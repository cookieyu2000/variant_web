        "Title": "    Haplotypic characterization of BRCA1 c.5266dupC, the prevailing mutation in Brazilian hereditary breast/ovarian cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Specific pathogenic mutations associated with breast cancer development can vary between ethnical groups. One example is BRCA1 c.5266dupC that was first described as a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but was later also found in other populations. In Brazil, this mutation corresponds to 20% of pathogenic BRCA1 variants reported. Our objective was to investigate the haplotype component of a group of Brazilian families who inherited c.5266dupC in the BRCA1 gene and to verify the ancestry contribution from European, African, and Amerindian origins. Fourteen probands carrying c.5266dupC and 16 relatives (carriers and non-carriers) were investigated. The same haplotype was observed segregating within all the families analyzed, revealing no recombinants in a region of 0.68 Mb. Ancestry analysis demonstrated that the European component was predominant among probands. The BRCA1 c.5266dupC analysis indicates that there was a founder effect in the Brazilian population.",
        "Introduction": "    The spectrum of pathogenic mutations found in genes related to cancer development can vary depending on the ethnic groups that are being studied. Specific pathogenic mutations associated to particular ethnic groups show a high frequency due to founder effects, or population bottleneck and consequent inbreeding. As a result, rare pathogenic mutations become more common within the population over time. Inbreeding contributes to linkage disequilibrium in genomic regions that are segregated together for many generations with specific alleles in loci placed closest to the mutation site in that specific population.\n\n    A well-known example of founder effects is that of BRCA pathogenic mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. At least 2.6% (1/40) of this population carry one of the three founder pathogenic mutations described for BRCA1 (OMIM #113705) and BRCA2 (OMIM #600185): BRCA1c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23fs), BRCA1 c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756fs, former named 5382insC), and BRCA2c.5946delT (p.Ser1982fs). Although these pathogenic mutations were first identified in Ashkenazi Jews, BRCA1 c.5266dupC, was later described in other populations. It has already been identified in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe and also recurrently described in the Brazilian population, representing 20% of the BRCA1 pathogenic variants reported in a recent survey.\n\n    The comparison of haplotypes between families sharing the same mutation allows to distinguish whether high-frequency alleles derive from a single mutational event (a founder mutation), or if they have arisen independently more than once in a population . In a previous report, showed that seven unrelated carriers of this mutation share the same haplotype of genetic marker alleles flanking BRCA1. However, data available in Brazil regarding the frequency of different pathogenic variants in individuals at risk of hereditary breast/ovary cancer and the availability of samples from the c.5266dupC mutation carriers limited the conclusions at that time with respect to a possible founder effect. In addition, did not evaluate the ancestry of the carriers.\n\n    In this work, we present a haplotype analysis in an expanded set of Brazilian carriers of BRCA1 c.5266dupC. In addition, considering that the Brazilian population is highly admixed, with genetic backgrounds derived from Europeans, Africans and Amerindians, ancestry analysis was carried out to assess the contribution of these different backgrounds to the genetic diversity present in the carriers\n\n    Fourteen unrelated heterozygous probands harboring BRCA1 c.5266dupC and 26 relatives (carriers or non-carriers of eight families) were recruited for this study from collaborating research centers located in the cities of Rio de Janeiro (5 probands), Barretos (5 probands), and Porto Alegre (4 probands) between 2004 to 2016. All research procedures followed ethical guidelines and were approved by the local Ethics Committee (009/07). The five probands/families from Rio de Janeiro were also previously analyzed in.\n\n    Haplotypes were characterized based on three SNPs and four Short Tandem Repeat (STR) markers along ~581 kb of chromosome 13 encompassing the BRCA1 locus (Figure S1). SNPs were analyzed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, as described by.\n\n    Four microsatellite loci were used for genotyping: D17S855 (intragenic marker in intron 20), D17S1325 and D17S1326 (3' markers) and D171321 (5' marker); primers are listed in Table S1. For all microsatellite loci, PCR amplifications were performed in final volumes of 25 muL, with 2.0 mmol/L of MgCl2, 125 mumol/L of each dNTP, 20 pmol of each primer, 1x PCR buffer, 1 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 50 ng of genomic DNA. Reactions were submitted to 30 cycles of 94  C for 15 s, 60  C for 15 s, and 72  C for 20 s. Forward primers were labeled with carboxyfluorescein, and PCR products were analyzed in an ABI-PRISM 3730 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Scoring of allele size was achieved using the internal size standard GeneScan -500 LIZ  (Applied Biosystems). Allele size was estimated using Peak ScannerTM software v1.0 (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    To estimate genetic ancestry, 46 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) were selected. These markers were used to investigate the contribution of African, European, East Asian, and Native American populations to the genetic background of the probands. AIMs were genotyped in one multiplex PCR assay followed by capillary electrophoresis, as previously described. Structure software was used to estimate the ancestral components of the samples, and the results were validated by Admixture software. Genetic ancestry analysis was carried out for the 14 index cases.\n\n    Of all BRCA1 c.5266dupC carriers, 21 (63.6%) had been diagnosed with breast and/or ovarian cancer at ages ranging from 22 and 63 years old (median = 43 years) (Table 1). The age of cancer-unaffected mutation carriers (n=12) ranged from 22 to 66 years old (median = 47). For five of the 14 probands only the personal cancer history was available, for the remainder at least one relative developed breast or ovarian cancer (Table 1).\n\n    Fourteen probands carrying BRCA1 c.5266dupC and 26 relatives (carriers and non-carriers) were haplotyped. The same haplotype associated with c.5266dupC was segregating within all the families analyzed, revealing no recombinants in a region of 0,68 Mb (Figure S2). On the other hand, this haplotype was not found in non-carrier relatives analyzed (n=7). Ancestry analyses showed that the European component was predominant among the probands, with an average of 81.15% (Figure 1).\n\n    The high frequency of breast cancer observed in our sample, especially bilateral cancer (n=13/21), was also reported in other studies and recently associated to its location (within the breast cancer cluster region of the gene). The segregation of the same haplotype within BRCA1 c.5266dupC in all carrier relatives analyzed, reinforced the founder effect of this mutation in the Brazilian population.\n\n    Our data is in accordance with previous results showing a European component that exceeds 70% in the South and Southeast of Brazil, and support the European origin of BRCA1 c.5266dupC in Brazil. The predominant European ancestry observed in the carriers studied here is in line with the proposition of for the Scandinavian origin of this mutation, followed by its dispersion through Central Europe 400-500 years ago. As was stated before, a better explanation for the presence of this mutation in the Brazilian population is the immigration from Central Europe diring the 19th century encouraged by Brazilian officials, particularly to the Southeast and South regions of Brazil, where the mutation is nowadays more frequently found.\n\n    There are some limitations to the present study. Unfortunately, the sample size was small, considering that c.5266dupC corresponds to 20.2% of all Brazilian BRCA1 pathogenic variants, although, our samples account for patients of three Brazilian states. Nonetheless, it is the largest published study revealing a single haplotype between carriers in Brazil. This unique haplotype validates the founder effect for the c.5266dupC insertion in Brazil, and the ancestry data reveal the contribution of Central Europe for the Brazilian genetic background. The frequency of this mutation is shown to be relevant especially among patients of the southern and utheastern Brazilian regions, where the European ancestry contribution is large. Our study also shows that c.5266dupC is associated with the appearance of bilateral breast tumors, which confirms what was previously observed by other authors. Considering a scenario of limited resources, low cost screening focused on this recurrent pathogenic variant could be offered for patients and their families of European ancestry. However, this strategy is not adequate in view of the diversity of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants found in Brazil and the admixed ethnic origin of its individuals.",

        "Abstract": "    While the role of BRCA1/2 genes in familial breast and ovarian cancer is well established, their implication in the sporadic form of both cancers is still controversial. With the development of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, the exact relationship between BRCA1/2 genes and sporadic triple negative breast cancer/high grade serous carcinoma (TNBC/HGSC) needs to be further investigated. Therefore, we conducted a study in which we analyze BRCA1/2 point mutations and copy number alterations in Moroccan patients suffering from TNBC/HGSC.\n\n    To achieve our goal, we analyzed BRCA1/2 genes in the FFPE tissue blocks and blood samples of 65 TNBC/HGSC selected patients, using next generation sequencing technology.\n\n    From the 65 successfully sequenced patients in our cohort, we detected five-point variants in six different patients, four variants were classified as pathogenic and one of unknown significance. Regarding copy number alterations we detected one copy number loss in BRCA1 gene and one copy number gain in BRCA2 gene. The genetic screening of BRCA1/2 genes using these patients' genomic DNA indicated that five harbored a germline genetic alteration. While three harbored a somatic genetic alteration. To the best of our knowledge, three-point variants detected in our study have never been reported before.\n\n    According to the results found in the present study, in a population without a family history of cancer, the possibility of a BRCA1/2 somatic pathogenic variant in high grade serous carcinoma is 7%. While for Triple negative breast cancer somatic point variants and copy number alterations seems to be a very rare genetic event.",
        "Introduction": "    BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes encode for tumor suppressor proteins that are implicated in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Both proteins work in a common pathway known as the DNA homologous recombination repair pathway (HRR). A pathogenic genetic alteration in one of these genes induces homologue recombination deficiency (HRD), which increases the possibility of genetic alterations and genome instability, resulting in the formation of an undetectable cancer cell.\n\n    In this regard, numerous molecular oncology studies have been conducted over the last decade to investigate the impact of BRCA1/2 genetic alterations and their role in cancer. Both genes have proven to play a significant role in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Carriers of a genetic alteration in one of these genes face a 40-70% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and 10-45% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer.\n\n    While the implication of BRCA1/2 genes in familial breast and ovarian cancer is widely understood, their role in the sporadic form of both cancers is still controversial. Many studies around the world have indicated the presence of an association between BRCA1/2 genetic alterations and the sporadic form of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC). Since one-third of BRCA1/2 mutated BC patients suffer from TNBC subtype, and nearly half of OC patients with BRCA1/2 mutations develop a HGSC subtype. These findings have prompted scientific researchers to speculate about the presence of BRCA1/2 somatic genetic alterations in both cancer subtypes.\n\n    Currently, with the introduction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, for BRCA1/2 mutated breast and ovarian cancer patients, the exact relationship between BRCA1/2 genes and sporadic TNBC/HGSC needs to be further investigated.\n\n    As such, we conducted a study in which we analyze BRCA1/2 point variants and copy number alterations (CNA) in TNBC and HGSC tumors. The major purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1/2 somatic point mutations and CNA in both malignancies and whether they could represent a significant molecular marker.",
        "Methods": "    In this study, we enrolled 65 female patients. Thirty-seven suffered from TNBC and twenty-eight suffered from HGSC. The recruited patients were selected according to the following criteria:\n\n    TNBC or HGSC.\n\n    Age ranging from 45 to 70 years old.\n\n    Inclusion criteria:\n\n    Family history of cancer.\n\n    Age of diagnosis less than 45 years of age.\n\n    Bilateral tumors.\n\n    Exclusion criteria:\n\n    Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks and blood samples were collected from all the recruited patients after signing informed consent. Clinical and histopathological data were gathered by reviewing patients' medical records. This study was approved by the local research ethics committee.\n\n    The DNA extraction from paraffin tissue blocks and blood samples was performed automatically on the Maxwell 16 instrument, using the Maxwell 16 FFPE Tissue LEV DNA Purification Kit for FFPE samples and the Maxwell 16 Blood DNA Purification Kit for blood samples. DNA extractions were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    The eluted DNA concentrations were determined using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n    Genetic analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (accession numbers NM_007294 and NM_000059, respectively) mutations and copy number alterations was processed using the Oncomine BRCA1/2 research assay panel customized by Thermo Fisher. This panel contains 275 primer pairs in two pools, allowing for a comprehensive sequencing of BRCA1/2 genes.\n\n    Briefly, library preparation was performed automatically on the Ion Chef platform using the Ion AmpliSeq Chef Solutions DL8 Kit. This was followed by clonal amplification, which was also performed automatically on the ION Chef Platform using the Ion AmpliSeq IC 200 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, the prepared sequencing templates were sequenced on the Ion Personal Genome Machine System PGM (Ion Torrent; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) using Ion 318  Chips and the Ion PGM  Sequencing Hi-Q Kit v2, according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\n\n    After sequencing, the generated DATA were initially processed on the Ion Torrent Suite software v5.4 (Ion Torrent; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), to generate filtered sequence reads and remove poor signal-profile reads. The resulting reads were then aligned to the H19 (GRCh37) genome, using the reference genome sequence that targets BRCA1/2 genes. Finally, depth analysis and single nucleotide variants calling were performed using the Ion Torrent coverage and Variant Caller plug-in (version 5; Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n    The resulting BAM files were then analyzed on the Ion Reporter Analysis software (v. 5.10), using the Oncomine BRCA (5.10) pipeline (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which covers single nucleotide variants and copy number variations.\n\n    All the detected variants in our study were classified following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.\n\n    The datasets analyzed during the current study and a list of material requirement will be available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n    The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research of the University Hassan II. All participants gave a written informed consent to participate in the study.\n\n    Not applicable.",
        "Results": "    All the clinical and histopathological data of our patients are summarized in Table 1. Among the 65 recruited females in our cohort, thirty-seven suffered from TNBC, whereas twenty-eight suffered from HGSC.\n\n    The median age of the thirty-seven TNBC patients was 53 years old, ranging from 45 to 67 years old. Twenty-two (59.4%) had left-sided breast cancer and fifteen (40.5%) had right-sided breast cancer. The majority of these patients were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (27 patients,73%), while only Ten (27%) had lobular carcinoma. Regarding tumor stage, thirty patients (81%) presented with T3-T4 stage and seven (19%) were diagnosed with T2 stage. Finally, eighteen (48.6%) of our patients exhibited tumors with positive lymph nodes status and nineteen (51.3%) were lymph node negative.\n\n    As for our twenty-eight HGSC patients their median age was 56 years old, ranging from 45 to 69 years old. Fifteen (53.5%) had right ovary tumor localization, whereas thirteen (46.4%) had left ovary tumor localization. In terms of tumor stage, more than half of our patients (15 patients, 53.5%) presented with stage III, followed by stage IV (11 patients 39.2%) and lastly stage I-II (2 patients 7.1%). Finally,18 (64.2%) of our HGSC patients had a positive lymph node status while 10 (35.7%) had a negative lymph node status.\n\n    After BRCA1/2 molecular analysis, we detected five variants in sex different patients and two copy number alterations in two different patients, all summarized in Table 2.\n\n    c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23fs),variant was detected in the FFPE and blood samples of two different patients. The first patient was a 47 year old female suffering from TNBC, the variant was detected in both the FFPE and blood samples of the patient in a heterozygote state, with a depth score of 842 and 1150 respectively. While the second patient was 52 year old female suffering from HGSC the variant was detected in a homozygote state in the FFPE sample with a depth score of 524 and in the genomic DNA in a heterozygote state with a depth score of 1280.\n\n    c.2494_2495delCCinsTT (p.Pro832Leu), variant was detected in a heterozygote state in both the FFPE and blood samples of a 52 year old TNBC patient. In the FFPE sample this variant was detected with a depth score of 253 and in the genomic DNA it was detected with a depth score of 856.\n\n    c.4412delG (p.Gly1471fs), variant was detected only in the FFPE sample of a 56 year old HGSC patient. The patient's FFPE sample sequencing revealed the presence of this variant in a heterozygote state with a depth score of 318.\n\n    c.643delG (p.Glu215Lysfs), variant was detected in a heterozygote state in both the FFPE and blood samples of a 49 year old TNBC patient. The patient's sequencing results revealed the presence of this variant in the FFPE sample with a depth score of 289 and in the genomic DNA sample with a depth score of 993.\n\n    c.7632_7633delCG (p.Val2545Phefs), variant was detected in the FFPE sample of a 58 year old HGSC patient. The patient FFPE sample sequencing revealed the presence of this variant in a homozygote state with a depth score of 1984. This variant was not detected in the patient's genomic DNA.\n\n    The first copy number variation detected in our study is a copy number loss 17q21.31(41249158-41,251,946)x 1 in BRCA1 gene. This CNV was detected in the FFPE and blood samples of a 52 year old TNBC patient, with a confident score of 45 and 38 respectively.\n\n    The second copy number alteration detected in our study is a copy number gain, 13q13.1(32930545-32,930,833)x 3 in BRCA2 gene. This CNA was detected in the FFPE sample of a 55 year old HGSC patient, with a CNV confidence score of 36, and it was confirmed by another sequencing run, in which it was also detected with a CNV confidence of 32. This copy number gain was not detected in the patient's genomic DNA.",
        "Conclusion": "    According to the results found in the present study, the possibility of a BRCA1/2 somatic pathogenic mutation in HGSC is 7%. While in the case of TNBC, point mutations and CNA seems to be a very rare genetic event. Nevertheless, many studies worldwide have indicated the presence of somatic BRCA1/2 genetic alterations in TNBC. Moreover, in our cohort 6% of our TNBC/HGSC cases harbored a germline genetic alteration in BRCA1/2 genes which indicate that a respectable percentage of non-familial breast and ovarian cancer may harbor a BRCA pathogenetic germline alteration. With the emergence of Anti-PARP treatment, defining the extant of BRCA1/2 genes implications in non-familial BC and OC has become inevitable. Therefore, more studies should be conducted to define the intensity of both genes' implication in these subtypes of cancer.",
        "Discussion": "    We conducted a study in which we analyzed BRCA1/2 point variants and copy number alterations in 37 TNBC and 28 HGSC patients. The main goal of our study was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1/2 somatic variants and copy number alterations in both malignancies and whether they could represent a significant molecular marker.\n\n    Of the 65 successfully sequenced patients in our cohort, we were able to identify five-point variants in six different patients, three in BRCA1 gene and two in BRCA2 gene. Regarding copy number alterations we detected one copy number loss in BRCA1 gene and one copy number gain in BRCA2 gene. The genetic screening of BRCA1/2 genes using these patients genomic DNA indicated that five harbored a germline BRCA1/2 genetic alteration. While three harbored a somatic BRCA1/2 genetic alteration (Table 3).\n\n    The first variant reported in our study is c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23fs). It was detected in two different patients one was diagnosed with TNBC and the second with HGSC. According to Clinvar database, c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23fs) is a pathogenic variant of BRCA1 gene, caused by the deletion of two nucleotides, Adenine and Guanine at exon 2 of the gene. At the protein level, this deletion provokes the substitution of Glutamic acid by Valine at codon 23, which leads to a premature stop codon at position 16 of the new reading frame. This pathogenic variant was reported by Struewing et al. as a founder mutation of the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Also, it has been reported in many other populations worldwide and in the Moroccan population as well.\n\n    The second variant reported in our study is c.2494_2495delCCinsTT (p.Pro832Leu). It was detected in both the genomic and the FFPE DNA of a TNBC patient. This variant is due to the deletion of two cytosine nucleotides and the insertion of two thymine nucleotides at exon 10 of BRCA1 gene. At the protein level, this variant is expressed by the substitution of proline amino acid by leucine. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has never been reported before in any database or research study.\n\n    The third variant reported in our study is c.4412delG (p.Gly1471fs). It was detected only in the FFPE DNA of a HGSC patient. According to Clinvar database, this variant is a pathogenic mutation of BRCA1 gene that results from the deletion of a guanine nucleotide at exon 14 of BRCA1 gene. At the protein level, it causes the substitution of a Glycine amino acid by Alanine at codon 1471 which introduces a premature stop codon at position 34 of the new reading frame. This variant was reported before by Winter et al. as a somatic mutation in a breast cancer case.\n\n    The fourth variant reported in our study is c.643delG (p.Glu215Lys). It was detected in both the genomic and the FFPE DNA of a TNBC patient. This variant is due to the deletion of guanine nucleotide at exon 8 of BRCA2 gene. At the protein level, it causes the substitution of glutamic acid by lysine, which creates a premature stop codon at position 658 of the new reading frame. To the best of our knowledge, this variant is not reported in any database or research study.\n\n    The last variant reported in our study is c.7632_7633delCG. It was detected only in the FFPE DNA of a HGSC patient. This variant is due to the deletion of two nucleotides; guanine and cytosine at exon 16 of BRCA2 gene. At the protein level, it causes the substitution of valine amino acid by phenylalanine at position 2545, which provokes a premature stop codon at position 2547 of the new reading frame. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has never been reported before.\n\n    Regarding copy number alterations, we detected one copy number loss in BRCA1 gene 17q21.31(41249158-41,251,946)x 1, The latter was detected in both the genomic and the FFPE DNA of the patient. BRCA1 gene exon deletions have been reported before in HBOC cases. Moreover, Pan et al., have reported BRCA1 gene exon 7-8 deletion, in hereditary ovarian cancer cases.\n\n    We also detected one copy number gain 13q13.1(32930545-32,930,833)x 3 in BRCA2 gene. This copy number alteration was not detected in the patient's genomic DNA. BRCA2 exon 1-2 copy number duplications have been reported before in HBOC cases. However, exon 15 somatic duplication in breast or ovarian cancer has not been reported before in any database or research study.\n\n    In our study, from the 37 successfully sequenced TNBC patients, we didn't detect any somatic point variants or copy number alterations in both genes. Our study results line up with those reported by several research studies worldwide Nevertheless, other research studies reported somatic point variants in non-familial TNBC cases with a prevalence between 3 to 5%. On the other hand, from the 28 successfully sequenced HGSC patients, we detected two somatic pathogenic variants in BRCA2 gene (7%) and one somatic copy number gain also in BRCA2 gene (3.5%). Our findings are consistent with most studies worldwide, which reported BRCA1/2 somatic pathogenic variants in non-familial HGSC, with a prevalence of 5 to 8%. However, concerning copy number alterations as far as we know most studies worldwide perform a comprehensive CNA analysis in non-familial TNBC and HGSC cases. Unfortunately, we couldn't find a study that reported BRCA2 somatic copy number gain in HGSC.\n\n    In our cohort four of our patients out of 65 (6%) harbored a BRCA1/2 pathogenic germline alteration, we concluded that these cases suffer from hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Even though our selection criteria aimed to avoid HBOC patients. Several studies worldwide reported variable frequencies of BRCA1/2 germline variants in unselected TNBC and HGSC cases. All four patients that harbored BRCA1/2 germline alterations in our cohort confirmed the absence of cancer history in their families. Unfortunately, we could not analyze the genetic profile of their descendent parents. As a result, we could not confirm the hereditary origin of these genetic alterations. As far as we are concerned, they could be de novo alterations, which has been reported before by Kim De Leeneer et al.. Moreover, we cannot neglect the fact that a respectable percentage of breast and ovarian cancer patients, with inherited BRCA1/2 genetic alterations, do not have a clear family history, due to a small family structure, the predominance of males in the family, and paternal inheritance. This can only indicate that BRCA1/2 genetic testing should be considered for TNBC and HGSC patients even with the absence of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer selection criteria.\n\n    In the present study, we detected three point variants and one copy number gain that has never been reported before; c.2494_2495delCCinsTT (p.Pro832Leu), c.643delG (p.Glu215Lys), c.7632_7633delCG and 13q13.1(32930545-32,930,833)x 3. The Oncomine variant class pipeline has classified both variants c.643delG (p.Glu215Lys) and c.7632_7633delCG as truncating variants that causes a loss of normal protein function. While c.2494_2495delCCinsTT (p.Pro832Leu) variant was not classified by the Oncomine variant class pipeline therefore, to determine the pathogenicity of this variant we used the in silico analysis results given by SIFT (TI = 0.36), PolyPhen (PISC = 0.07) and GRANTHAM (R = 98). These results demonstrate that this variant is still of unknow significance. Apropos the copy number gain 13q13.1(32930545-32,930,833)x 3 the latter was also not classified by the Oncomine pipeline. However, since BRCA2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene. Copy number gains are not regarded as a cancer driver genetic alterations. Nonetheless, they are considered as up-regulating genetic alterations that, depending on their position in the gene, may cause a protein overexpression. BRCA2 overexpression has been reported before in research studies that analyzed the expression profile in breast cancer tumors. More studies should be conducted regarding BRCA1/2 copy number variation and their phenotypical effects.\n\n    Both variants c.643delG (p.Glu215Lys) and c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23fs). Were detected in a homozygote state in the patient's FFPE DNA. The second variant was detected in the patient genomic DNA as well in a heterozygote state. The fact that the latter is a germline pathogenic variant that was present in the patient's FFPE DNA in a homozygote state, encourages us to support the two genetic hit theory proposed by Knudson et al.. Nevertheless, three other patients in our cohort presented a germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant and they didn't present a loss of heterozygosis or compound mutations in BRCA1/2 genes in their FFPE DNA. The genetic cancerogenesis process of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is still not well established but many scientific studies have indicated that these tumors need an additional somatic mutation in other tumor suppress genes or oncogenes.\n\n    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze BRCA1/2 point variants and copy number alterations in the FFPE DNA of Moroccan TNBC and HGSC patients. Effectively, we were able to report two somatic point variants and one somatic copy number gain in HGSC patients. Moreover, we were able to identify three germline point variants that to the best of our knowledge were never reported before. This study offers information of clinical importance regarding BRCA1/2 genetic screening in non-familial cases of TNBC and HGSC. Nonetheless, the small number of cases in our cohort and the absence of information concerning the methylation profile of both genes are two limitations of our study, that should be surpassed in other future Moroccan studies dedicated to the implication of BRCA1/2 genes in breast and ovarian cancer.",

        "Abstract": "    There are twenty recurrent mutations in six breast-cancer-predisposing genes in Poland (BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL). The frequencies of the twenty alleles have not been measured in a large series of early-onset breast cancer patients from Poland unselected for family history. We genotyped 2464 women with breast cancer diagnosed below age 41 years for twenty recurrent germline mutations in six genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2 CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL. A mutation in one of the six genes was identified in 419 of the 2464 early-onset breast cancer cases (17%), including 22.4% of those cases diagnosed below age 31. The mutation frequency was 18.8% for familial breast cancer cases and 6% for non-familial cases. Among women with breast cancer below age 31, the mutation frequency was 23.6% for familial cases and 17.4% in non-familial cases. The majority of mutations (76.2%) were seen in BRCA1 and BRCA2. In Poland, a panel of twenty recurrent mutations in six genes can identify a genetic basis for a high percentage of early-onset cases and testing is recommended for all women with breast cancer at age 40 or below.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer is diagnosed in 2.1 million women each year and results in 600,000 deaths. In Poland, the incidence of breast cancer is 93.42 per 100,000 per year and is relatively low by European standards. Breast cancer accounts for about one-fourth of all cancer cases diagnosed in Polish women, and approximately one thousand women under the age of 39 were diagnosed with breast cancer in Poland in 2016. The incidence of breast cancer among premenopausal women has increased by approximately 1.5-fold over the past three decades; however, the incidence of breast cancer in young women diagnosed at age less than 40 years is relatively stable around the world.\n\n    There are two very important breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Other genes which were reported to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility include CHEK2, PALB2, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, NBN, ATM RAD50, BARD1, and RECQL.\n\n    Poland is homogeneous from a genetic perspective and the range of mutant alleles is limited, and a high percentage of all mutations are founder mutations. In ethnically-homogeneous populations, it is valuable to identify such common founder mutations in cancer-predisposing genes which may facilitate genetic testing. In our previous study, twenty recurrent mutations were found in six breast-cancer-predisposing genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL) in Polish breast cancer patients. The twenty founder mutations were detected in 421 of 1018 (41%) Polish women with a strong family history of breast cancer (the mean number of breast cancers per family was 3.6 and the mean age of diagnosis of the probands was 44 years), including BRCA1/2 alleles seen in 354 cases and non-BRCA1/2 mutations seen in 67 cases. The thirteen BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the panel represented 84% of all BRCA1/2 mutations and the three CHEK2 truncating mutations constituted 95% of all CHEK2 mutations. The two recurrent PALB2 mutations represented 83% of all PALB2 mutations. In total, the panel covered about 80% of all BRCA1/2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL mutation detection in Polish high-risk families with breast cancer.\n\n    However, the frequencies of these twenty mutant alleles of BRCA1/2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL have not been measured in a large series of early-onset breast cancer patients from Poland.\n\n    The goal of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of these twenty alleles in six genes in Polish early-onset breast cancer patients.",
        "Methods": "    The women with breast cancer were selected from a registry of 25,000 breast cancer cases housed at the Hereditary Cancer Center in Szczecin. Patients were diagnosed in 16 different centers in Poland between 2000 and 2017. All cases were confirmed to have invasive breast cancer through review of the pathology reports.\n\n    Patients were invited to participate and provide blood samples within 12 months from diagnosis. During the patient interview, the goals of the study were explained, informed consent was obtained, genetic counseling was given, and a blood sample taken for DNA analysis. All patients and control subjects were of European ancestry and ethnic Poles. Family histories were collected during an interview. A positive family history was defined as the occurrence of one or more breast cancers among first or second degree relatives. For this study we included 2464 consecutive patients diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer at age 40 or below (mean age 37, range 18-40).\n\n    The study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants signed an informed consent document prior to participation. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Pomeranian Medical University (KB-0012/97/17, approval date 19 June 2017).\n\n    DNA was isolated from blood taken from the participants using standard methods. Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated and subsequent DNA extraction undertaken in the Department of Genetics and Pathology in Szczecin.\n\n    Genetic tests for three common Polish BRCA1 mutations were performed using multiplex-polymerase chain reaction assay. The 5382insC variant in exon 20 and the 4153delA variant in exon 11 were detected using an allele-specific amplification PCR (ASA-PCR). The last recurrent mutation c.181T>G in exon 5 of BRCA1 was detected using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR (RFLP-PCR) and Ava II enzyme. All other recurrent mutations in the BRCA1 gene (c.66_67delAG, c.3700_3704delGTAAA, c.5251C>T, c.676delT, c.1687C>T, c.3756_3759delGTCT) and BRCA2 gene (c.3847_3848delGT, c.7910_7914delCCTTT, c.658_659delGT, c.5946delT) were genotyped using TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) the LightCycler Real-Time PCR 480 system (Roche Life Science, Penzberg, Germany). The primer and probe sequences are available upon request. Laboratory technicians were blinded to case-control status.\n\n    Other founder genes, CHEK2 (c.1100delC, c.444+1G>A, del5395), PALB2 (c.509_510delGA, c.172_175delTTGT), NBN 657del5 (c.657_661delACAAA), and RECQL (c.1667_1667+3delAGTA), were genotyped using TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies) and the LightCycler Real-Time PCR 480 system (Roche Life Science). The primer and probe sequences are available upon request. Laboratory technicians were blinded to case-control status. A large deletion of exon 9-10 of CHEK2 gene was genotyped using multiplex-PCR reaction. This multiplex-PCR method was based on our report in 2000 and validated later.\n\n    In order to confirm germline recurrent small mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL genes, Sanger sequencing was performed from a second independent blood sample. The sequencing reaction was performed using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies). Sequencing products were analyzed using a genetic analyzer ABI Prism 3500XL (Life Technologies). All BRCA1/2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL sequences were compared to the NCBI reference sequence (RefSeq) reported in GenBank : NM_007294.3, NM_000059.3, NM_001005735.1, NM_024675.3, NM_002485.4, NM_002907.3.\n\n    We estimated the odds ratios for selected recurrent mutations to investigate their association with early-onset breast cancer risk. To do so, we compared mutation frequencies in patients with breast cancer (cases) to those seen in Polish cancer-free individuals (controls). For BRCA1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, BLM, and RECQL, as a reference we used mutation frequencies in a large series of controls from our previous studies. Odds ratios (OR) were generated from two-by-two tables, and statistical significance was assessed with the Fisher exact test or the Chi-squared test where appropriate. The odds ratios were generated for women with breast cancer below age 41 and for women with breast cancer below age 31.",
        "Results": "    A positive family history of cancer was observed in 1661 of 2354 (70.6%) patients diagnosed at age 40 or below, including 271 out of 340 (79.7%) patients diagnosed at age 30 or below (Table 1 and Table 2). Family history was missing for 110 cases.\n\n    We found a pathogenic mutation in 419 of the 2464 early-onset breast cancer cases (17%) (Table 3). The mutation frequency was 22.4% for those diagnosed at age 30 or below (Table 4). Among 2464 cases diagnosed at age 40 or below, 18.8% of familial cases and 6% of non-familial cases carried a mutation (Table 1). Among 340 breast cancer cases diagnosed at age 30 or below, 23.6% of familial cases and 17.4% of non-familial cases carried a mutation (Table 2).\n\n    As expected, the majority of mutations (72.3%) were in BRCA1 and BRCA2. We identified a BRCA1 mutation in 301 out of 2464 (12.2%) cases and a BRCA2 mutation in two of the cases (0.08%).\n\n    Seven recurrent mutations of CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL represented the other 27.7% of all mutation-positive cases. Three different truncating mutations in CHEK2 were seen in 77 cases (3.1%). A PALB2 mutation was identified in 19 women (0.8%), and a RECQL recurrent variant was detected in two women (0.08%) (Table 3).\n\n    We calculated the odds ratios for early breast cancer for selected founder mutations by comparing mutation frequencies observed in this study in patients diagnosed at age 40 or below to those reported in a large series of population controls in our previous studies. The odds ratios for breast cancer diagnosed at age 40 or below were 28.8 for BRCA1 (95% CI 18.6-44.5); 3.8 for CHEK2 (95% CI 2.5-5.5); and 3.6 for PALB2 (95% CI 1.6-7.5), and all were statistically significant. The odds ratio for NBN was 1.3 (95% CI 0.7-2.5), and it was not significant (p = 0.5). The odds ratio for RECQL was 1.9 (95% CI 0.3-13.6), and it was also not significant (p = 0.9) (Table 3).",
        "Conclusion": "    The goal of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of twenty alleles in six genes, BRCA1/2, CHEK2, PALB2, NBN, and RECQL, in Polish early-onset breast cancer patients. In the current study we found that this panel of twenty recurrent mutations can identify a genetic basis for approximately one-fifth of early-onset cases, and testing is recommended for all women with breast cancer under age 40. The identification of a mutation at the time of diagnosis can have an impact on selecting patients for preventive surgery or targeted therapy.",
        "Discussion": "    We found that one of the twenty mutations was present in 17% of breast cancer cases diagnosed at age 40 or below and in 22.4% of all breast cancer cases diagnosed at age 30 or below. BRCA1 mutations were more common (12.2% among breast cancer cases diagnosed at age 40 or below), while mutations in the BRCA2 gene were rare (0.08% in breast cancer patients diagnosed at age 40 or below). We confirmed a high risk of breast cancer among young BRCA1 female carriers (almost 30-fold increase for breast cancer at age 40 or below). This means that among women with a BRCA1 mutation in Poland, the risk of cancer at age 40 is much higher than that in the general population, but the odds ratio cannot be generalized to older women.\n\n    Truncating mutations of the CHEK2 gene (c.444+1G>A, c.1100delC, del5395(exon10-11del)), cause a two- to three-fold risk of breast cancer. Among Polish women who carry a truncating CHEK2 mutation without a family history of breast cancer, the risk increase is about three-fold, and the risk is higher (increased about five-fold) in carriers of a truncating mutation of CHEK2 in the presence of positive family history of breast cancer. In our study we found that the risk increase, given a CHEK2 truncating mutation, begins below age 40 (OR = 3.8; 95% CI 2.5-5.6).\n\n    Mutations in the NBN gene (also called NBS1) are responsible for the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), which is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal instability, immunodeficiency, and a predisposition to cancer. Approximately 90.0% of NBS patients carry the homozygous mutation 657del5 (c.657_661delACAAA) in exon 6, which has been predominantly identified in Slavic populations and confers a two-fold risk for breast cancer development. In a meta-analysis of seven studies, strong evidence was presented for a moderately increased breast cancer risk associated with a truncating variant, c.657del5, with a relative risk of 2.7. Another study from Poland provided evidence for an association between the variant and early-onset breast cancer. In our study we found that the risk of breast cancer <41 years was not increased (OR = 1.3; 95% CI 0.7-2.5).\n\n    Approximately one percent of cases had one of two recurrent mutations in the PALB2 gene. In Finland, Canada, and Poland, these two mutations are present in 0.5-1.0% of all breast cancers. PALB2 mutations have been associated with a relative risk up to five-fold, although studies in different populations have produced divergent estimates. In Poland, two founder PALB2 mutations were detected (c.509_510delGA, c.172_175delTTGT) and were associated with a 4.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer in unselected Polish women similar to the odds ratio we found for young breast cancer patients (OR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.7-7.9).\n\n    In this study we found that the risk increase of breast cancer development in carriers of the RECQL mutation is 1.9 (95% CI 0.27-13.6), but the mutation was rare (two cases) and the odds ratio was not statistically significant. The RECQL gene mutation was previously reported to increase the risk of breast cancer by five-fold among unselected cases from Poland.\n\n    It seems reasonable to use the panel of twenty Polish founder mutations as a test for all young breast cancer patients. Our panel has a high sensitivity. We propose to use this panel as an inexpensive prescreening tool. Full sequencing (in particular, using gene panels including BRCA1/2) is warranted in women with early-onset breast cancer, in particular for those with a positive family history and those with breast cancers with clinical features characteristic of BRCA1-related tumors. The decision of management with mutation carriers will depend on the type of the detected mutation and on the clinical and pedigree data, i.e., in case of a BRCA1/2 mutation, appropriate surveillance and preventive surgery are advised. The identification of a BRCA1/2 mutation at the time of diagnosis can also have an impact on selecting patients for targeted therapy. Cisplatin has been reported to be effective and generally well tolerated among Polish BRCA1 patients with breast cancer. Mutations in CHEK2 have been associated with resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, but further studies are needed.\n\n    Of note, we observed that the frequencies of the twenty predisposing mutations were higher (43%) in families with strong breast cancer clustering than in women with early-onset breast cancer (17%) (Table 5). Therefore, strong family history seems to be a stronger indicator of heredity than early age of diagnosis.",

        "Title": "    Evidence for an ancient BRCA1 pathogenic variant in inherited breast cancer patients from Senegal",
        "Abstract": "    BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most incriminated genes in inherited breast/ovarian cancers. Several pathogenic variants of these genes conferring genetic predisposition have been described in different populations but rarely in sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this study were to identify pathogenic variants of the BRCA genes involved in hereditary breast cancer in Senegal and to search for a founder effect. We recruited after free informed consent, 27 unrelated index cases diagnosed with breast cancer and each having a family history. Mutation screening of the genes identified a duplication of ten nucleotides c.815_824dupAGCCATGTGG, (p.Thr276Alafs) (NM_007294.3) located in exon 11 of BRCA1 gene, in 15 index cases (allelic frequency 27.7%). The pathogenic variant has been previously reported in African Americans as a founder mutation of West African origin. Haplotypes analysis of seven microsatellites surrounding the BRCA1 gene highlights a shared haplotype encompassing ~400 kb between D17S855 and D17S1325. This haplotype was not detected in none of 15 healthy controls. Estimation of the age of the pathogenic variant suggested that it occurred ~1400 years ago. Our study identified a founder pathogenic variant of BRCA1 predisposing to breast cancer and enabled the establishment of an affordable genetic test as a mean of prevention for Senegalese women at risk.",
        "Introduction": "    With a rapidly evolving incidence, breast cancer is currently the first female cancer in sub-Saharan Africa followed by cervical cancer. Recent reviews have reported that most breast cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa are triple negative, prognostic stage III tumours, with average age at diagnosis at late 40 s, resulting in a high-mortality rate. Overall, 5-10% of breast cancers are inherited and could be associated with ovarian cancers. The risk is linked to two high-penetrance susceptibility genes: BRCA1 (17q21) and BRCA2 (13q12). Both are tumour suppressor genes involved in double strand break DNA repair. Women who have inherited mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are at higher risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancers. Risk increased with the number of affected women within the family, early age at diagnosis and the degree of relationship with other affected women. The cumulative risk of breast cancer by age 80 years was estimated to 72% for BRCA1 carriers and 69% for BRCA2 carriers. For ovarian cancer, cumulative risk at age 80 years was estimated to 44% for BRCA1 carriers and 17% for BRCA2 carriers.\n\n    Many studies in different populations have identified pathogenic variants that have been stored in BRCA Consortia databases (CIMBA http://cimba.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/, UMD http://www.umd.be/BRCA1/, BIC http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/, ENIGMA https://enigmaconsortium.org/, BRIDGE https://bridges-research.eu/). Some variants are at very high frequencies in specific ethnic groups suggesting their founder effect. In Ashkenazi Jewish women, BRCA1 c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23Valfs) and c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756Profs) founder mutations conferred a life time risk to breast/ovarian cancer, ten times higher compared with general population. In Africa few studies have reported specific founder mutations of BRCA1: c.5335delC (p.Gln1779Asnfs) identified in Egypt; c.5309G>T (p.Gly1770Val) identified in five unrelated families from Morocco; c.303T>G (p.Tyr101Ter) reported in Yoruban population from Nigeria and c.2641G>T (p.Glu881Ter) in Afrikaner population from South Africa. In addition to these founder mutations, other mutations with African origin have been described in African Americans in the US, in African diaspora and in Hispanics from Peru, Mexico and the Bahamas: c.815_824dupAGCCATGTGG (p.Thr276Alafs); c.1713_1717delAGAAT (p.Glu572Thrfs), and c.5173_5176delGAAA (p.Arg1726Lysfs). Among these mutations c.815_824dup10 is of particular interest. It has been reported as originated from West Africa during the slavery period. In the CIMBA database this mutation has been identified in 65 people from France, Spain and the US. They are mostly labelled as being of African or Hispanic descent. Haplotypes analyses have shown that the shared BRCA1 region flanking c.815_824dup10 is shorter than those flanking European founder mutations. Therefore c.815_824dup10 African mutation may probably be older than European mutations. In West Africa very few studies have screened for BRCA1 founder mutations. Here we report the highest occurrence of c.815_824dup10 of BRCA1 gene in Senegalese patients with inherited breast cancer and confirm its West African origin.",
        "Methods": "    Female index cases with biopsy-proven breast cancer and family history of breast or ovarian cancer, followed up at the Joliot Curie Institute and the Senology department of Aristide le Dantec Hospital in Dakar were recruited. After free written informed consent all participants were interviewed to collect demographic data and medical history. Twenty-seven unrelated female index cases were included in this study. Pedigrees were drawn with Progeny software and 5 ml blood sample was collected from each participant. Characteristics of each index cases and pedigrees are available upon request. From the 27 index cases recruited a first group of 15 was screened for mutations in all exons of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. After identification of a recurrent mutation in this first group, the twelve (12) consecutives index patients were screened for this recurrent mutation by PCR genotyping. For index cases with the BRCA1 pathogenic variant, healthy relatives were further recruited for genetic testing after written informed consent.\n\n    We have also recruited a control population including 90 healthy women without known cancer who came for routine check-up at the Laboratory of Biology of Le Dantec Hospital and 80 women with sporadic breast cancer and without family history from the Joliot Curie Institute. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Cheikh Anta DIOP University under Protocol 014/2014/CER/UCAD. All participants gave their informed written consent before participation in the study.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood with a QiAmp  DNA blood purification kit (Qiagen). BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons were amplified by PCR with specific primers located in intron/exon boundaries. Twenty-eight fragments covering the 22 coding exons of BRCA1 and 32 fragments covering the 26 coding exons of BRCA2 gene were amplified. The large exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2 were amplified as two and nine fragments, respectively, while exon 11 of BRCA1 was amplified as seven fragments (Supplementary Table 1). PCRs were carried out with initial denaturation at 95  C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95  C for 30 s, 55  C for 30 s, and 72  C for 30 s with a GeneAmp  PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) as described previously.\n\n    The PCR products were purified with a MinElute 96UF kit and sequenced using a Big Dye terminator V3.1 sequencing kit on a 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Both forward and reverse strands were sequenced. Obtained sequences were compared with BRCA1 GenBank reference sequence (NM_007294.3) with Alamut Software. This method was used for the first 15 index cases recruited.\n\n    For the following 12 patients and healthy relatives recruited, the recurrent pathogenic variant identified in the first group was genotyped by PCR with primers 5'-TGCTTGTGAATTTTCTGAGACGG-3' and 5'-TGAGCATGGCAGTTTCTGCT-3' using standard PCR conditions, followed by a 4% agarose gel migration during 4 h at 100 V. Individuals with the pathogenic variant showed two fragments at 422 and 412 bp (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\n    We selected ten index cases with the pathogenic variant and 15 unrelated healthy controls for haplotype analysis. Seven microsatellite markers flanking the BRCA1 gene located in 2.30 Mb were genotyped by PCR (locus order: cen-D17S1793-D17S1320-D17S855-D17S1323-D17S1325-D17S951-D17S1183-tel) with fluorescent labelled primers (Supplementary Table 2). The PCR products were analysed in automated sequencer ABI Prim 310 using Genscan 3.1.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Allele sizes are given as size of the PCR amplicons containing the microsatellites. Genotyping was performed by Inqaba BiotecTM.\n\n    The age of c.815_824dup10 pathogenic variant in generations (G) was calculated using the following equation: G = logdelta/log (1 - theta). Linkage disequilibrium (delta; delta) between the mutation and each of the closest recombinant microsatellite markers D17S855 and D17S1325 was calculated as delta = (Pd - Pn)/(1 - Pn), with Pd being the frequency of the ancestral microsatellite marker allele among the chromosomes carrying the mutated BRCA1 and Pn being the frequency of that microsatellite allele on chromosomes not carrying the mutation. The symbol theta (Teta) represents the recombination fraction between a marker and the gene. The genetic distances were inferred from Ensembl database (https://www.ensembl.org/index.html).\n\n    Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.",
        "Results": "    Mean age at breast cancer diagnosis was 39.5 years (range from 21 to 67 years). Overall, 88.8% of recruited patients were diagnosed before age 50. Of patients with information on tumor stage (94.1%), most were diagnosed at advance stage (stage II = 58.9% or stage III = 35.2%). Tumour hormone receptors and HER2 status showed that 42.8% had triple negative breast cancer followed by HER2 enriched tumors, 28.5 % (Table 1).\n\n    Mutation screening identified a recurrent pathogenic variant at heterozygous state of the BRCA1 gene in 15 probands out of 27 recruited. This is a duplication of ten nucleotides (c.815_824dupAGCCATGTGG, p.Thr276Afs) located in exon 11 of BRCA1 according to the HGVS nomenclature (Fig. 1). This pathogenic variant leads to a frameshift and a spurious stop codon 14 amino acids further down. It was detected in six index cases of a first group of 15 index cases by mutation screening of all coding exons of BRCA1 gene, and later in nine additional index cases from a second group of 12 patients by PCR genotyping (Supplementary Fig. 1). The allelic frequency was then estimated at 27.7% in hereditary breast cancer cases. The pathogenic variant was also detected by genotyping in a control population of sporadic breast cancer cases and healthy controls free from any cancer (allelic frequency estimated at 5% and 0.55%, respectively), and in ten healthy relatives from selected studied families (Table 2, Fig. 2). The PCR genotyping method is now available for first routine screening of the recurrent pathogenic variant in women at risk in our laboratory (Fig. 3).\n\n    Any other pathogenic variant of the BRCA1 gene was identified in the remaining nine index cases of the first group while one of them had a novel BRCA2 pathogenic variant.\n\n    As the pathogenic variant is recurrent in our study population, we searched for its founding effect by haplotype analysis. We genotyped seven microsatellite markers flanking the BRCA1 gene and distributed in 2.15 Mb in ten index cases with the pathogenic variant, and 15 unrelated healthy controls. Haplotype analysis showed that specific alleles sizes 144, 156, and 173 bp of three microsatellite markers D17S855, D17S1323, and D17S1325, respectively segregated together in the index cases, and constituted a common haplotype of ~400 kb. This haplotype is not found in any of the healthy controls studied. This common haplotype suggested a founder effect of the pathogenic variant in the study population (Table 3).\n\n    We then estimated the age of the pathogenic variant in number of generations, using the following formula G = logdelta/log (1 - theta) as described in the methodology. The pathogenic variant is supposed to appear in Senegal 55.5 generations ago, ~1400 years.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa has a clinical epidemiology characterized by an early age at diagnosis (<50 years), aggressive tumors with poor prognosis. This particular epidemiology has been observed in our study population. The average age of diagnosis was 39.5 years and is the lowest reported in sub-Saharan Africa: 45 years in Senegal and Nigeria, 46 years in Mali, and 49 years in Ghana. In Canada, the US, and Australia there has been an average age at diagnosis of about 45 years for sporadic breast cancer and 39.9 years for inherited breast cancer. A study conducted in Senegal in 2017 has reported a mean age at diagnosis of 47.5 years in women with sporadic breast cancer. The average age observed in this study is then concordant with that reported in inherited breast cancer over the world.\n\n    Tumors characteristics showed a late stage diagnosis with aggressive tumors of bad prognosis mainly grade SBR II and III. This has also been reported in sporadic breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. This late stage diagnosis could be linked to the lack of awareness programs for breast cancer symptomatology and diagnosis, and the high cost of breast cancer therapy, most patients first resorted to traditional medicine.\n\n    Despite the need expressed by gynecologists and oncologists, molecular phenotyping of tumors is not available in most sub-Saharan African countries. Available data came from abroad at expensive costs inaccessible to most patients. For the few laboratories that have local facilities, the poor quality of biopsies, the inadequacy of fixation time, the lack of equipment and specialists, are pitfalls for achieving these analyzes. Our results showed that the majority of tumors were triple negative (42.8%) or Her2 enriched (28.5%), all considered as poor prognostic tumors. Added to this, is the young age at diagnosis with 40.7% of our population under 35 years of age. It has been reported that breast cancer diagnosed in women under 40 years with triple negative or Her2-enriched tumors, is of poor prognosis and high metastasis incidence. It therefore appears that breast cancer in young women could constitute a biologically different entity. Germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and a familial aggregation are frequently observed in this case. Therefore, a BRCA gene mutation will be suspected, when an index case has a young age at diagnosis, and/or a family history of breast or ovarian cancer and a poor prognosis tumor. Patients in our study were relatively young (mean age 39.5 years) and all had at least one affected relative, while 14.8% had associated ovarian cancer. These characteristics are in favor of BRCA genes inherited mutations and thus a genetic predisposition.\n\n    Hereditary breast cancer accounts for 5-10% of breast cancers in women. Molecular genetics have led to a better understanding of the genetic basis of predisposition to breast/ovarian cancer. Several genes have been involved with two major genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 and minor genes PALB2, P53, PTEN, PALB2, P53, PTEN, CDH1, RAD51, MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and EPCAM. Pathogenic variants of these genes play an important role in the genetic predisposition to breast or ovarian cancer. The cumulative risk of breast cancer at age 80 is estimated at 72% for BRCA1 carriers and 69% for BRCA2 carriers, while for ovarian cancer it is estimated at 44% for BRCA1 carriers and 17% for BRCA2 carriers.\n\n    Predisposition to inherited breast cancer has been conducted in European or American populations while in Africa particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, very few studies have been conducted. We report here for the first time in Senegal, a recurrent pathogenic variant of the BRCA1 gene, c.815_824dup10 involved in the predisposition to hereditary breast cancer. Allelic frequency of the mutation was estimated to 27.7%. This is the highest allelic frequency of this mutation reported in a population. Review from the literature has shown that the variant has been described for the first time in a breast cancer patient from Ivory Coast living in the US. Later it was also reported in patients from Mexico and the Bahamas, among African-Americans and Hispanics living in the US, in Peru, but also in some European populations. Among African Americans with hereditary breast cancer, it is the most common mutation with a frequency of 16%. According to CIMBA database, 65 people carrying the variant have been identified worldwide, mostly of African or Hispanic origin. Studies in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria and Burkina Faso have not report it in these populations.\n\n    When a mutation is identified at a high frequency within a population, exploring for its founding effect becomes important for cancer prevention. Several founder mutations have been reported in different populations. Variants c.66_67delAG and c.5266dupC of BRCA1 have been used for breast cancer prevention among Jewish women. In Africa, founder mutations have been reported in Yoruba population from Nigeria (c.303T>G;(p.Tyr101Ter)) in a series of four families, in Afrikaners from South Africa (c.2641G>T (p.Glu881Ter)) in five families, and in Morocco (c.5309G>T; (p.Gly1770Val)) in five families. The founding effect of the variant c.815_824dup10 was reported first in five nonrelated families from US and the mutation was supposed to be of West African origin.\n\n    When we screened for its founder effect in Senegal, we identified a haplotype of about 400 kb containing the variant in hereditary breast cancer patients and not in any of the healthy controls. This Senegalese haplotype is shorter compared with the one identified in the US, which spanned 700 kb, as well as the one associated with the Jewish mutation c.66_67delAG. This suggested that the Senegalese haplotype would be older than the African-American haplotype which was estimated to be 200 years old. Age estimation of the Senegalese haplotype suggested that the variant c.815_824dup10 arose around 1400 years ago. Then we supposed that the variant appeared first in Senegal and was spread throughout the world by population migration, especially by slave trade. Senegal by its geographical position in West Africa was one of the major ports during the trans-Atlantic slave trade toward the European and the US continents. But it would be of interest to screen for this mutation in other West African countries. Studies conducted in Nigeria and Burkina Faso have not reported it.\n\n    While the allelic frequency of c.815_824dup10 in our study is high (27.7%), it is necessary to recruit more index cases and more controls in order to estimate the exact allelic frequency of this variant in Senegalese population.\n\n    In this study we identified a founder pathogenic variant involved in predisposition to inherited breast cancer in Senegalese women. Screening of the variant in women at risk in Senegal and other West African countries (Mali, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Benin) will be of interest for breast cancer prevention strategies. It will also lead the ground for oncogenetic counselling in Senegal.",

        "Title": "    Screening of BRCA1/2 genes mutations and copy number variations in patients with high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC)",
        "Abstract": "    Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer susceptibility disorder. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are considered as high penetrance genes of this syndrome. The identification of BRCA1/2 genetic alterations before cancer development, grant patients the chance to benefit from various medical cancer prevention approaches. Therefore, the appearance of recent advanced technologies in molecular analysis such as next generation sequencing has simplified full BRCA1/2 analysis.\n\n    Many attempts took place in hope of understanding the molecular germline spectrum of these two genes in Moroccan HBOC patients. However, most of the past projects focused only on young breast cancer cases, lacked ovarian cancer cases in their cohort and only a limited number of these studies were able to analyze the entire exons or copy number variations for both genes.\n\n    In attempt of gaining more information regarding the molecular profile of BRCA1/2 in HBOC, we conducted a study in which we analyze their molecular profile on selected Moroccan patients suspected of having HBOC syndrome.\n\n    In this study we obtained blood samples from 64 selected Moroccan patients, who suffered from Breast and/or ovarian cancer and had a strong family history for cancer. To analyze BRCA1/2 punctual variants and copy number variations, we used the Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and Oncomine BRCA1/2 research assay panel. Afterward, we correlated the molecular results with the clinic-pathologic data using IBM SPSS Statistics ver 2.\n\n    From the 64 selected cases, Forty-six had breast cancer, fifteen had ovarian cancer and three had both breast and ovarian cancer. The molecular analysis revealed that 18 patients from the 64 harbored a pathogenic variant (28%). Twelve had six different BRCA1 pathogenic variants and six had six different BRCA2 pathogenic variants. In this study, we report four pathogenic variants that to the best of our knowledge has never been reported in the Moroccan population before. Regarding copy number variation analysis, No CNV was detected in both genes for all the 64 successfully sequenced and analyzed patients in our cohort.\n\n    Work like the present has an important implication on public health and science. It is critical that molecular profiling studies are performed on underserved and understudied population like Morocco.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer susceptibility disorder, account for 5-7% of all breast cancer cases, and 10-15% of all ovarian cancer cases. The diagnosis of this syndrome has been entrenched in 1970, since then the scientific world has been conducting many studies in hope of defining the clinical characteristics of this syndrome, and understanding its genetic origins.\n\n    Until date, the national comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) has established clinical guidelines that help in distinguishing HBOC patients from other sporadic cases. Moreover, genetic studies have demonstrated that HBOC is a highly heterogeneous disease, associated with germline genetic alterations in a number of genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, ATM, NBS1, RAD50, BRIP1 and PALB2. With BRCA1 and BRCA2 as main predisposing genes of HBOC. Hence, BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers present a risk of 65-80% and 45-85% for developing breast cancer while, for ovarian cancer they present a risk of 37-62% and 11-23% respectively.\n\n    The identification of BRCA1/2 genes pathogenic alterations in patients suspected to have HBOC, before cancer development or in the first stages of breast and ovarian cancer, grants them the chance to benefit from various medical cancer prevention approaches, such as risk-reducing surgery (mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy), chemo-prevention and enhanced surveillance approaches. Therefore, BRCA1/2 genetic analysis has become a fundamental concern of doctors and families with a high risk of HBOC syndrome.\n\n    Since the beginning of molecular analysis till date, BRCA1/2 genetic screening has been massively facilitated by the appearance of recent advanced technologies. This advancement has aid enormously in the characterization and the identification of both genes genetic alterations. So far globally, a total of 1826 pathogenic BRCA variant has been reported. Other genetic alterations such as large exon, gene deletions/duplication have also been reported in HBOC families with a significant proportion.\n\n    Although there are similarities among BRCA1/2 testing criteria worldwide, several reports had shown that different populations have variable BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation spectrum and prevalence. Therefore, it is only reasonable to hypothesize that the spectrum and the prevalence of pathogenic variants will differ in Morocco as well. Accordingly, different molecular studies of BRCA1/2 have been conducted in hope of understanding their molecular germline alterations in Moroccan HBOC patients. Most of these studies have focused only on breast cancer cases and on young patients due to the fact that breast cancer is described as young women disease in the Arab world and other developing nations like some African and Asian countries. Moreover, studies that analyzed the molecular profile of BRCA1/2 in HBOC Moroccan patients rarely had ovarian cancer cases in their cohort. Finally, a limited number of Moroccan studies were able to analyze the entire exons or copy number variations for both genes.\n\n    In attempt of filling some gaps and gaining more information regarding the molecular germline profile of BRCA1/2 in Moroccan HBOC and around the globe. We initiated a study in which we analyze the punctual variants and copy number variations of both genes on selected HBOC Moroccan patients. To achieve our goal, we used next generation sequencing technology and the commercially available Oncomine BRCA1/2 research assay panel. This panel analyze both punctual variants and large exons deletions and duplications. Afterward, we correlated the molecular results with the clinico-pathological data of the patients, in hope of understanding more the implication of these molecular alterations in HBOC syndrome.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 64 female at-risk for HBOC were enrolled in this study between 2016 and 2020. The study material has been collected from individuals referred to ANOUAL laboratory for BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Even though all cases were recruited from the same city, they had different ethnicity. However, only 23 from the 64 gave their origins the others gave their living location Therefore; this parameter was not included in this study.\n\n    Breast cancer diagnosed at or before the age of 45 years,\n\n    Ovarian cancer diagnosed at or before the age of 45 years,\n\n    Multiple primary breast cancers either in one or both breasts,\n\n    triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 60 years,\n\n    Two or more relatives with breast or ovarian cancer, with at least one under the age of 50 years;\n\n    Three or more relatives with breast or ovarian cancer at any age.\n\n    All the cases recruited had to fulfill the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) selection criteria. HBOC was suspected in cases with breast and/or ovarian cancer, and a personal or a family history of any of the followings:\n\n    Prior to the collection of blood samples and clinical data from all participants. Written informed consents were signed from them and their relatives that were recruited in this study. All included Siblings in this study were considered as one case. A pre-analysis genetic counseling was accomplished with patients to collect their family and tumor information. This project was approved by the local Ethics in Research Committee.\n\n    Peripheral blood samples from the patients were collected in EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted automatically from blood samples using Maxwell  16 Blood DNA Purification Kit and stored at - 20  C. DNA purity and concentration was measured by Nano Drop 2000 Spectrophotometer and Qubit 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA).\n\n    BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were screened using the Ion PGM sequencing platform and Oncomine BRCA1/2 Research Assay panel, this panel contains 265 primer pairs in two pools, covering all coding sequences of both genes, including all splice sites with an average of 64 bp extensions from the intron junctions. The sequencing was carried out in three steps: library preparation, template preparation and finally templates sequencing.\n\n    Libraries were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions guidelines. Briefly, we used 10 ng of DNA isolated from whole blood to generate the sequencing libraries by amplification reaction for each pool. After target amplification, pool 1 and pool 2 amplification reactions were combined into one PCR tube. Followed by partial digestion of primers using FuPa enzyme, and barcode adapter's ligation. Finally, generated amplicons were purified using AMPure  XP Reagent. Barcoded purified libraries were quantified and diluted to 100pM before template preparation.\n\n    Sequencing templates were produced by clonal amplification of the libraries using the Ion OneTouch 2 System and Ion Torrent PGM Hi-Q VIEW OT2 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The Template-positive Ion SphereTM Particles were isolated with MyOne Streptavidin C1 Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and washed with Ion OneTouch Wash Solution, Using the Ion OneTouch ES system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Finally, the barcoded and enriched templates were loaded on the Ion Torrent 316 V2 sequencing chip for deep sequencing on the personal genome machine (PGM) using Ion PGM Hi-Q view Sequencing Solutions kit, all according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n    Generated raw data sequences quality assessment and alignment to the hg19 human reference genome, was carried out by Ion Torrent Suite software (version 5.0.5; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Coverage analysis and Single nucleotide variant calling were performed using Torrent coverage and Variant Caller plug-in (version 5; Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n    Generated BAM files were used for the annotation of single nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions and copy number variants in the Ion Reporter Server System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the original algorithm pipeline developed by Thermo Fisher Scientific for BRCA1/2 Research Assay Panel. Only single nucleotide variants with a coverage superior to 250X were considered authentic.\n\n    Genetic variants were classified according to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) using a five-tier system: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of unknown significance (VUS), likely benign, or benign.\n\n    Variants including nonsense, missense, frameshift, large genomic rearrangements, and splice site, were considered as pathogenic when resulting in a prematurely truncated protein and/or reported in BIC or Clinvar as pathogenic. If not their pathogenicity is predicted by in silico analysis via: Sift, Polyphen, Mutation taster and identified through a literature search.\n\n    Statistical analysis to assess the association between clinic-pathologic data and BRCA1/2 punctual variants status was carried out with IBM Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Chi-square (chi2) test and Fisher's exact test both were applied to obtain the P-value. Correlations was defined as P < 0.05.\n\n    The datasets analyzed during the current study and a list of material requirement will be available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n    The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research of the University Hassan II. All participants gave a written informed consent to participate in the study.\n\n    Not applicable.",
        "Results": "    From the 64 collected cases, Forty six females had breast cancer fifteen females had ovarian cancer and three had both breast and ovarian cancer. Therefore, in our cohort we have 49 breast tumors and 18 ovarian tumor.\n\n    The median age of all the recruited patients in our cohort was 42, ranging from 23 to 55 years old. The majority of our BC tumors had Ductal carcinoma (91%), T2 tumor size (44.8%), SBR grade II (46.9%), and luminal subtype of cancer (59%). All the clinico-pathological data of breast cancer cases are summarized in Table 1. Regarding ovarian cancer cases, the majority had serous carcinoma (66.67%), T3 tumor size (61.11%) and SBR grade III (55.56%). All the clinico-pathological data of ovarian cancer cases are listed in Table 2.\n\n    After performing BRCA1/2 molecular analysis, we detected 12 pathogenic variants in 18 patients from 64 (28.%). 12 patients harbored BRCA1 variant, and 6 harbored BRCA2 variant.\n\n    In BRCA1 gene we detected 6 different pathogenic variants and in BRCA2 gene we detected 6 different pathogenic variants as well. All the pathogenic variants found in our study are reported in Table 3. All these variants were stated in both BIC and Clinvar.\n\n    From the 18 patients with pathogenic variants in BRAC1/2 genes in our study; twelve had breast cancer, five had ovarian cancer and one had both breast and ovarian cancer. The breast data of the last mentioned patient were included in Table 1 and her ovarian data were included in Table 2.\n\n    From all the 64 successfully sequenced patients we found one uncertain significance variant in one ovarian cancer patient and her sister that suffered from breast cancer. This variant was not found in their healthy third sister. The variant c.91 T > G (p.Trp31Gly) is a substitution of the nucleotide thymine with guanine in exon 3 of BRCA2 gene, causing the substitution of Tryptophan to glycine in the binding region of BRCA2 gene. This variant was included in the statistical analysis between BRCA carriers and no carriers in Table 2. No likely pathogenic variant was detected in our population.\n\n    No CNV was detected in both genes for all the 64 successfully sequenced and analyzed patients in our cohort.",
        "Conclusion": "    Works like the present have an important implications in both public health and science. First, proper risk assessment including genetic testing of high risk individuals can lead to increased awareness of cancer risk and effective use of interventions to reduce BRCA-related cancer incidence and mortality. Second, understanding the spectrum of ethnic-specific mutation landscape can lead to genetic tests tailored to ethnic groups, which can increase sensitivity and specificity of analytic techniques as well as lowering the cost. Lastly, genetic testing can indicate presence or absence of BRCA mutation as well as variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). As catalogue of genetic variants are collected, further refinement is possible to decipher the mechanistic meaning of the VUSs. To achieve a comprehensive collection of all variants worldwide, it is critical that molecular profiling studies are performed on underserved and understudied population such as Morocco. Thus, despite the lack of novelty in our study, we believe that the clinical, economic, and scientific implication of our results is broad and profound.",
        "Discussion": "    To date, there have been several attempts to describe the spectrum of BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic variants in Moroccan patients with HBOC syndrome. However, past works have failed to depict a comprehensive picture; they either focused only on young patients with breast cancer, lacked ovarian cancer cases in their cohort, or only sequenced selected regions of both genes. Moreover, no Moroccan study has analyzed copy number variations for both genes in patients suspected for HBOC before. Thus, to overcome past limitations, the goal of our study is to describe the punctual variants and copy number variations profile of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on Moroccan patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer suspected to have HBOC syndrome.\n\n    Respecting the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for HBOC syndrome, we were able to recruit 64 patients suspected of HBOC syndrome; Forty-six (71.9%) had breast cancer, fifteen (23.4%) had ovarian cancer and three (4.7%) had both breast and ovarian cancer. The predominance of breast cancer cases in HBOC cohort is reported in all HBOC studies worldwide. Epidemiological studies in Morocco have shown that the frequency of breast cancer is higher than ovarian cancer, which increases the probability for the predominance of breast cancer patients in our cohort.\n\n    In agreement with other studies, the median age of all the 64 analyzed patients in our cohort is 42 years old. For breast cancer cases, alone the median age is 42 years old, and for ovarian cancer cases alone the median age is 43 years old. To the best of our knowledge, no Moroccan study has worked on HBOC cohort with ovarian cancer cases before. Therefore, we are only able to compare our breast cancer cases median age with the one reported by Tazzite et al. and Laraqui et al.. Our findings correlate with both studies that reported a median age inferior to 45 years old for familial breast cancer cases. On the other hand, our entire HBOC cohort median age line up with that reported by Ciernikova et al. and Alemar et al.. However, our cohort median age is still younger than the one reported by Tingyan Shi et al.. Many studies have indicated that the median age of onset in north African countries including Morocco is more than 10 years younger than the age of onset in European/North American countries.\n\n    Clinico-pathological data of all patients included in this study, were collected through a review of the patients medical records. The majority of our BC cases had Ductal carcinoma (91%), T2 tumor size (44.8%), SBR grade II (46.9%), and luminal subtype of cancer (59%). These results correlate with other local and international studies. Besides, according to Tazzite et al. and Musolino et al., these characteristics are also the most encountered in sporadic breast cancer cases. Apropos ovarian cancer cases, the majority had Serous carcinoma (66.67%), T3 tumor size (61.11%), and III SBR grade (55.56%). We didn't find any Moroccan study concerning ovarian cancer clinico-pathological data. However, Our findings line up with other studies on other populations.\n\n    In this study, the molecular analysis was performed using the Oncomine BRCA1/2 Research Assay Panel that could detect both punctual variants and copy number variations. It is considered as an alternative assay to investigate both types of BRCA1/2 genetic alterations in one workflow. This panel efficiency has been investigated by Hirotsu et al. (2017), and according to his study results, the Oncomine BRCA1/2 research assay panel is a highly accurate tool for analyzing variants with wide-ranging allelic fractions and for detecting copy number alterations.\n\n    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Moroccan study to analyze BRCA1/2 copy number variations in Morocco. Globally, only a limited number of studies analyzed BRCA1/2 CNV profile in HBOC patients. From a population to another the results are still contradicted, which emphasize the importance of more studies to build solid conclusions regarding the implication of BRCA1/2 CNV in HBOC.\n\n    After molecular analyses of BRCA1/2 genes, eighteen patients (28.1%) in our cohort from the 64 harbored BRCA1/2 pathogenic alteration. In BRCA1 gene we found 6 different pathogenic variants in 12 patients (66%). while for BRCA2 gene we found 6 different pathogenic variants in 6 patients (33%) and one variant of uncertain significance. No copy number variation was detected in both genes for all the successfully sequenced 64 patients. All the pathogenic variants detected in our study and their molecular effect are summarized in Table 3 and are mentioned in both data bases BIC and Clinvar. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants that we found in this study line up with that reported by Laraqui et al., Jouali et al. and Alemar et al.. However, this prevalence is still higher than that reported by Tazzite et al.. This variability in pathogenic punctual variants percentage could be explained by the fallowed selection criteria and the technology used in these studies. In our cohort, we found a dominance of BRCA1 gene pathogenic variants compared to BRCA2 pathogenic variants these results correlate with other studies.\n\n    Regarding BRCA1 gene we found 6 different pathogenic variants. The first is c.798_799delTT (p.Ser267fs), it was detected in three unrelated patients. All three had breast cancer from which two had triple negative subtype and one had luminal subtype. This variant has been reported in different Moroccan studies and also was reported in some Tunisian and Algerian studies, to be the first non-Jewish founder BRCA1 pathogenic variant in north Africa.\n\n    Another four patients harbored the variant c.3279delC (P.Tyr1094fs), two were discovered to be second degree relatives from the mother side after investigation. Both cousins had luminal breast cancer. As for the third patient, she suffered from aggressive triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Finally, the last patient suffered from triple negative breast cancer. This variant was first reported in 2005 by van der Hout et al. in Netherlands, then it was reported for the first time in morocco at 2012 by Tazzite et al., afterward it was reported by El khachibi et al. and in 2015 it was reported by Strom et al. in the USA. The high prevalence of this variant in our cohort and the fact that it has been reported several times in morocco state the probability of it being a founder mutation of our population or maybe for a specific ethnicity in morocco. However, none of the four patients provided their origins and we were unable to contact them.\n\n    The third variant C.4823C > G (p.Ser1608Ter) was detected in one patient and her sister. Both came for BRCA1/2 testing after one was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer and the other had ovarian cancer. As far as we know, this variant has been reported in USA and UK by Strom CM et al. and Robertson L et al., and this is the first study to report this pathogenic variant in Morocco.\n\n    The fourth BRCA1 pathogenic variant c.1016dupA (p.Val340fs) was detected in a patient suffering from luminal breast cancer. This pathogenic variant is reported as the 12th most common frameshift variant occurring in BRCA1 gene. It was detected in different populations and once in Morocco by Laraqui et al..\n\n    The fifth BRCA1 pathogenic variant is c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23fs), it was detected in two patients one with triple negative breast cancer and the second with ovarian cancer. It is also known as 187delAG, this variant is one of three main pathogenic founder variants in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In Morocco, this variant has been reported by Zoure et al. and Jouali et al. and globally, it has been found in different populations.\n\n    The last BRCA1 pathogenic variant we found in this study is c.5158C > T (p.Arg1720Trp), it was detected in a patient with ovarian cancer. This variant has been reported in Morocco by Laraqui et al., in Finland by Kuusisto et al. .and in Italy by Antonucci et al..\n\n    Apropos BRCA2 gene, we identified 6 different pathogenic variants in 6 unrelated patients and one variant of uncertain significance in one patient and her sister. The first patient had ovarian cancer and harbored c.1302_1305delAAGA (p.Lys437fs) pathogenic variant. This variant was identified in morocco by Laarabi et al. and it was reported in several populations around the world.\n\n    The second patient had triple negative breast cancer and harbored c.7110delA (p.Lys2370fs) pathogenic variant. This variant was reported for the first time by Tazzite et al. and our study is the second in the world to report this variant.\n\n    The third patient also had triple negative breast cancer and harbored the pathogenic variant C.3847delG (P.Val1283fs). as far as we know, this is the first Moroccan study to report this variant. Nevertheless, it was reported in different populations worldwide.\n\n    The fourth pathogenic variant C.5576-5579delTTAA (P.I1859fs) was detected in a patient with luminal breast cancer. According to our literature search, this is the first study to report this variant in Morocco, but it has been reported in other studies.\n\n    Our fifth BRCA2 pathogenic variant is c.7235_7236insG (p.Lys2413fs) it was detected in a patient with ovarian cancer. This variant has been reported for the first time by Tazzite et al. and our study is the second to report it.\n\n    Our last BRCA2 pathogenic variant is c.3860delA (p.Asn1287fs). It was detected in a patient suffering from ovarian cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Moroccan study to report this variant however, it was reported in different populations worldwide.\n\n    Finally, in our study we reported one variant of uncertain significance c.91 T > G (p.Trp31Gly) in BRCA2 gene. This variant was found in our patient and in one of her two sisters as well. Both sisters carrying the variant suffered from cancer while their third sister who didn't harbor the variant was healthy. This variant was reported by Laura Caleca et al.. In her study, Caleca proved that this variant affects the binding of BRCA2 protein with the PALB2 protein.\n\n    Comparing our BRCA1/2 identified pathogenic variants with all the pathogenic variants found by other Moroccan studies (Table 4). We detected In BRCA2 gene, two variants that have been reported only in this study and by Tazzite et al.. The variant c.7235_7236insG (p.Lys2413Terfs) and the variant c.7110del (p.Lys2370fs). The fact that these variants were never reported in other studies worldwide, rise the probability of them being specific pathogenic variants for the Moroccan population. Furthermore, we found four pathogenic variants that have never been reported in other Moroccan studies. The first C.4760C > G (p.S1587Ter) was found in a patient that confirmed her Moroccan Arab origins. The second C.3847delG (P.Val1283fs) was found in a patient that confirmed her Moroccan Amazigh origins. While the third C.5576-5579delTTAA (P.I1859fs9) and the fourth c.3860delA (p.Asn1287fs) were found in patients with European ancestors. However, all four mutations were reported in European studies. We believe that the history of the migration flow between the two populations can explain the origins of these pathogenic variants.\n\n    In our study, we didn't report any copy number variation in both genes. All our patients were successfully sequenced and according to the Ion reporter pipeline, the CNV analysis was successful for all the patients in our cohort. Copy number variation in both genes was reported by Wen-Ming Cao et al. with a percentage of 16.1% (5/31). While, other studies state that BRCA1/2 CNVs for HBOC patients is rarely found. More global studies are required to define the implication of BRCA1/2 CNVs in HBOC.\n\n    After molecular analysis, we compared the histopathological characteristics between BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations carriers and no carriers for breast and ovarian cancer cases separately. For both cancers, no significant difference was found concerning Histological type, Tumor size, and SBR grade. While, for the molecular subtype of breast cancer we found a correlation between BRCA1/2 carriers and triple negative breast cancer with a P-Value < 0.05. Our results correlate with those of Alemar et al., Cao et al.. Moreover, according to different epidemic molecular studies, BRCA1 mutation carriers have more chances of developing triple negative breast cancer subtype.\n\n    In our cohort 46 patients (34 BC, 10 OC and 2 BC + OV) didn't harbor any BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant or copy number variation, despite having a strong family history for cancer. These results drive us to suspect that these patients may harbor genetic alterations in other genes implicated in HBOC syndrome such as TP53, PTEN, ATM, NBS1, RAD50, BRIP1 and PALB2, which emphasize the need for analyzing all the genes implicated in HBOC in one workflow instead of only BRCA1/2.",

BRCA analyses were performed on prospectively enrolled Latin American Clinical Cancer Genomics Community Research Network participants via a combination of methods: a Hispanic Mutation Panel (HISPANEL) on MassARRAY; semiconductor sequencing; and copy number variant (CNV) detection. BRCA PV probability was calculated using BRCAPRO. Among 1,627 participants (95.2% with cancer), we detected 236 (14.5%) BRCA PVs; 160 BRCA1 (31% CNVs); 76 BRCA2 PV frequency varied by country: 26% Brazil, 9% Colombia, 13% Peru, and 17% Mexico. Recurrent PVs (seen >=3 times), some region-specific, represented 42.8% (101/236) of PVs. There was no ClinVar entry for 14% (17/125) of unique PVs, and 57% (111/196) of unique VUS. The area under the ROC curve for BRCAPRO was 0.76. In summary, we implemented a low-cost BRCA testing strategy and documented a significant burden of non-ClinVar reported BRCA PVs among Latin Americans. There are recurrent, population-specific PVs and CNVs, and we note that the BRCAPRO mutation probability model performs adequately. This study helps address the gap in our understanding of BRCA-associated cancer in Latin America.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Latin American women. High mortality rates in the region are driven in part by advanced stage at diagnosis and limited access to cancer care. Also, the mean age at diagnosis is younger than US non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations and there is a high prevalence of hormone receptor and Her2 negative breast cancer (TNBC), features common in hereditary disease. Thus, strategies aimed at preventing, or detecting breast cancer at an earlier stage, are crucial within the region.\n\n    Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome accounts for approximately 10% of all breast cancer and 15-20% of ovarian cancer cases, and the most commonly associated genes with HBOC are BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA). Women with likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants (PVs) in either of these genes, have up to 80% lifetime risk of breast cancer and 20-50% risk of ovarian cancer. The identification of PVs in at-risk individuals has significant clinical utility, as there are effective interventions aimed at both cancer prevention and early diagnosis. We previously reported a high rate of BRCA PVs among 110 United States (U.S.) Hispanics with early-onset breast cancer. However, Hispanics are not well represented in most studies. For example, just 3.4% of participants were Hispanic in a recent study of female PV carriers from 69 centers in 49 countries on 6 continents.\n\n    BRCA PVs are present in around 1/800 people in the general population. However, a higher rate of PVs has been reported in some founder populations such as the Ashkenazi Jewish, with a PV prevalence of 1/40. From published high risk clinic series, approximately 10% of women meeting National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) genetic testing criteria will carry a BRCA PV. Some studies suggest that individuals with Latin American or African ancestry have a higher prevalence of PVs while others demonstrated a lower yield among Hispanic immigrants in the United States (U.S.). Our group reported a high prevalence of BRCA PVs (25%) in a large study of Hispanics living in the Southwestern U.S..\n\n    The frequency of BRCA PVs has been reported to be between 1.2 and 15.6% among Latin American cancer patients, and 15-28% among young breast or ovarian cancer patients in Mexico, unselected for family history of breast cancer. However, the prevalence and contribution of BRCA PVs to the overall cancer burden in the region are not yet well understood.\n\n    Women with HBOC are usually younger at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and more frequently present with TNBC. Each of these characteristics is an indication for genetic testing according to international guidelines. In Latin America, the proportion of young women with breast cancer is almost twice that seen in more developed regions of the world, and there also is a greater proportion of TNBC, meaning that a significant number of Latin American patients would meet criteria for gene testing. Unfortunately, despite this great need, access to genetic cancer risk assessment and testing is limited across the region and is not covered by public insurance.\n\n    Because genetic testing is expensive, pretest probability models are useful for selecting women at a higher risk of carrying a BRCA PV. However, because probability models are based mainly on data from NHW populations, their performance among Hispanics is limited. Some studies have found that BRCAPRO accuracy might be inferior in US minorities because the prevalence of carriers may differ by ethnicity and race. BRCAPRO performance was reported as greater than 80% in NHW, 75% in African Americans and 58-75% in small samples of US Hispanics.\n\n    BRCA PVs are detected by complex genetic technologies including multiple mutation scanning methods and Sanger DNA sequencing. Assays for the detection of large genomic rearrangements, herein referred to as copy number variants (CNVs), are also expensive. CNVs represented 11% of BRCA PVs among US Hispanics, of which 62% were the BRCA1 exon 9-12del (c.548-?_4185 + ?del), a Mexican founder PV, seen most frequently among patients from central Mexico, and estimated to have originated ~1,440 years ago.\n\n    Commercial costs for these tests range between $249 and $5,000 U.S. dollars (USD), which is not affordable as an out-of-pocket expense for most of the Latin American population. Disparities in access to testing have a significant impact on affected populations, due in part to underrepresentation in surveys of regional cancer etiology and in genomic variant databases. To address disparities in genetic testing, we have developed and implemented a low-cost testing strategy for at-risk individuals, as part of a larger dissemination and implementation intervention.\n\n    Here we report our results employing a sequential genetic testing strategy to detect BRCA PVs in a large sample of Latin Americans meeting referral criteria, using a combination of Sequenom MassARRAY technology, Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing, and PCR-based methodologies for CNVs. We also report on the performance of the BRCAPRO mutation prediction model among our Latin American cohort.",
        "Methods": "    Patients seen for GCRA through Clinical Cancer Genomics Community Research Network (CCGCRN) sites in Latin America between December 2012 and August 2017 were prospectively enrolled after informed consent on an IRB-approved protocol and offered genetic testing. The overall protocol was approved by the City of Hope IRB (#96144; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04185935) data coordinating center, and approved separately, as a Federated consortium at each participating center: (1) Instituto Nacional de Cancerlogia (INCan) in Mexico City, Mexico; (2) Instituto Jalisciense de Cancerologia, in Guadalajara, Mexico; (3) Instituto des Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN) in Lima, Peru; (4) Clinica del Country, Oncology Center, in Bogota, Colombia; (5) The University of Puerto Rico and MD Anderson Cancer Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico; and (6) Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Patients met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for genetic/familial high-risk assessment: breast and ovarian. Demographic characteristics, clinical variables and four-generation pedigrees focused on family cancer history were obtained. When more than one person was enrolled and tested in a family, the first person tested was selected for inclusion in study.\n\n    Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood drawn into ACD-A collection tubes using the Qiagen (Germantown, MD) FlexiGene DNA Kit.\n\n    For all individuals, 25 ng of genomic DNA was screened for the presence of the copy number variant (CNV), BRCA1 exon 9-12del (c.548-?_4185 + ?del), by a three-primer PCR assay (3-PA).\n\n    As described previously, a panel of 114 known pathogenic recurrent BRCA point and insertion/deletion PVs among Hispanics was used to genotype all individuals on the Sequenom (San Diego, CA) MassARRAY platform, and together with the BRCA1 exon 9-12del 3-PA, comprises our Hispanic mutation panel (HISPANEL).\n\n    Using Ion Torrent PGM semiconductor sequencing (see below) a CNV baseline was established within the Ion Reporter workflow to enable detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 CNV. Cases with uninformative HISPANEL and BRCA sequencing were further analyzed for CNVs in BRCA1 by MLPA (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). For each MLPA reaction, 125 ng of DNA was PCR amplified with probemix P002 according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR fragments were size separated on an ABI (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) 3130xl capillary sequencer. Dosage calculations and determination of CNV were performed with Coffalyser.Net software v.140701 (MRC-Holland) and/or GeneMarker software (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). CNVs detected by NGS or MLPA, were confirmed with MLPA probe mixes P087 and P045, respectively. BRCA2 was only evaluated for CNV by NGS, in part due to the known 5-fold greater rate of occurrence in BRCA1 relative to BRCA2 of CNVs.\n\n    HISPANEL negative cases that met NCCN criteria received full sequencing of all BRCA coding exons and exon-intron junctions on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. 10 ng of Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) quantified DNA was PCR amplified using the commercially available Ion AmpliSeq BRCA1 and BRCA2 Community Panel (https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-workflow/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-select-targets/ampliseq-target-selection/community-panels.html) - pilot tested by our laboratory for the AmpliSeq BRCA Global Consortium - to generate targeted, barcoded, amplicon libraries. Following template preparation and enrichment, 36 individual sample libraries were loaded on an Ion 318 Chip v2 and run for 500 cycles (250 bp single end reads).\n\n    Base calling, call qualification, sequence alignment (genome reference hg19), and coverage analysis were performed in Ion Torrent Suite 5.0.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The average coverage was >= 500x across the 171 primers in the panel. After signal processing with Torrent Variant Caller, sequence aligned files were uploaded to Ion Reporter v5.0 Cloud (https://ionreporter.thermofisher.com/ir/) for additional variant calling, annotation and reporting. Using a custom designed workflow, with a CNV baseline established by sequencing 10 BRCA CNV negative control cases, individual cases were examined for all variants.\n\n    All variants annotated in Ion Reporter were visualized in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) for classification (last time accessed May 2019). Only entries from established commercial vendors (Ambry Genetics, Color Genomics, Counsyl, GeneDx, Invitae, and/or Myriad Genetics (through the Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP), http://clinicalgenome.org/data-sharing/sharing-clinical-reports-project-scrp/), were considered. If a BRCA variant had been evaluated by the Evidence-based Network for Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium (https://enigmaconsortium.org/), recognized as an expert reviewer in ClinVar, that classification was used. Variant call format files for variants without ClinVar entrees were also uploaded into Ingenuity Variant Analysis (IVA) (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) which applies American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to variant classification.\n\n    Small sequence variants (point, in/del PVs) were confirmed with Sanger sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and run on an ABI (Applied Biosystems) 3130xl capillary sequencer. CNV variants detected by Ion Torrent sequencing were confirmed with MLPA (see above).\n\n    The cost for each test was calculated in USD and based on laboratory reagents and materials as follows: BRCA1 exon 9-12del 3-PA ($0.25/case), Sequenom MassARRAY BRCA Panel ($10/case), Ion Torrent PGM AmpliSeq BRCA Panel ($82/case) and BRCA1 MLPA ($25/case).\n\n    The probabilities of carrying a BRCA PV were estimated using BRCAPRO (version 2.1.4) in 1,535 cases. BRCAPRO risk estimates are derived through a Bayesian probability model, and accounts for the patient's first- and second-degree relatives, age of diagnosis of breast and/or ovarian cancer, and ages of unaffected family members. Pedigrees were created electronically using Progeny (Progeny Software, Delray Beach, FL). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were calculated for the BRCAPRO model at a 10% threshold. Calibration of the model was conducted by comparing observed versus predicted numbers of PV carriers. The AUROC was calculated to evaluate model discrimination.\n\n    Variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, including mean, range and frequency. Frequencies of BRCA variants (pathogenic/VUS) were described for the whole cohort, and individually for each country. We also describe the type of mutation (CNV, recurrent and unique variants). Differences between countries of origin were compared and expressed as percentages. The sensitivity of HISPANEL testing was calculated using observed versus detectable, with full BRCA sequencing as the country-specific reference for testing. SAS version 9.4 analytic software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to carry out the statistical analysis.\n\n    Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
        "Results": "    From December 2012 to August 2017, a total of 1627 participants were prospectively enrolled. Median age at enrollment was 44.6 years (range 14-96 years); and 1,607 (98.8%) were women. Of the 1627, 1375 (84.5%) had a primary breast cancer, 125 (7.7%) ovary cancer, and 49 (3.0%) other cancer types. Family history of breast cancer at <= 50 years in at least one first- or second-degree relative was reported in 412 (25.3%) participants, and of ovarian cancer at any age in 133 (8.2%) participants. Demographic characteristics are described in Table 1. The mean age at diagnosis of a first breast cancer in participants was 40.3 years (range 19-79); 15.0% had clinical stage 0-I and 85.0% had stage II-IV; 31.4% had TNBC (Table 2). A stepwise low-cost screening strategy (Fig. 1) was developed and implemented in our laboratory for the genotyping of a large Latin American cohort for mutations in the BRCA genes. Incremental genotyping costs by strategy was analyzed (Supplementary Table 1), and all strategies totaled approximately $100/case.\n\n    The overall frequency of BRCA PVs for the cohort was 14.5% (236/1627). The population with the highest frequency was Brazil (25.7%), followed by Mexico (17.4%), and Peru (12.6%), while the lowest frequencies were found in Colombia and Puerto Rico (9.3%).\n\n    There were 196 unique variants of unknown significance (VUS). The VUS rate by country varied significantly: 12.2% for Brazil, 9.8% for Colombia, 12.2% for Mexico, 17.8% for Peru and 9.3% for Puerto Rico (p = 0.006).\n\n    Of the 125 unique PVs (Supplementary Data 1), 17 (13.6%) were not represented in ClinVar, a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human genetic variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). Two of those 17 were recurrent. Of the 196 unique variants of unknown significance (VUS), 111 (56.6%) were not in ClinVar (Supplementary Data 1).\n\n    Primary screening with our custom designed recurrent Hispanic Mutation Panel (HISPANEL) comprised of 114 known PVs on the Sequenom MassARRAY platform, combined with a three-primer PCR assay (3-PA) for the Mexican founder PV (BRCA1 exon 9-12del), yielded 47.4% (112/236) of all positives (Table 3). The HISPANEL sensitivity was 47% overall; 57% (63/110) in Mexico; 57% (12/21) in Colombia; 53% (10/19) in Brazil; 50% (2/4) in Puerto Rico; and 30% (25/82) in Peru. BRCA sequencing yielded 41.9% (99/236) of all positives and other CNV methods yielded 11% (23/236).\n\n    We found a total of 48 CNVs, all of them in BRCA1. No BRCA2 CNVs were detected. BRCA1 CNVs represented 20.3% (48/236) of all positives and 30% of BRCA1 PVs, with the Mexican founder PV, BRCA1 exon 9-12del (detected by investigator developed PCR assay), accounting for 47.9% (23/48) of all CNVs. The remaining 52.1% of BRCA1 CNVs were detected by NGS and confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). In Mexico, 34.5% (38/110) of all PVs were CNVs, followed by 9.5% in Colombia, 8.5% in Peru, and 5.3% in Brazil. In Puerto Rico 1 of 4 PVs was a CNV. Within Mexico, CNVs represented 41.2% (7/17) of PVs in Guadalajara (including one BRCA1 exon 9-12del variant) and 33.3% (31/93) of PVs in Mexico City (including 22 BRCA1 exon 9-12del CNVs).\n\n    Of the 236 PVs detected in this cohort, 101 (42.8%) were recurrent (observed 3 or more times) in the cohort (Table 4). The most frequent PV was the BRCA1 exon 9-12del (c.548-?_4185 + ?del) PV, observed 23 times in Mexico. The Ashkenazi Jewish founder PV, BRCA1 c.66_67delAG, was next (n = 13; 8 Peru, 5 Mexico), followed by BRCA1 c.5123 C > A (n = 11), c.815_824dup (n = 8; 5 Peru, 3 Mexico), and another Ashkenazi Jewish founder PV, c.5266dupC (n = 8; 6 Brazil, 2 Mexico). PVs found to be frequent in Colombia include: BRCA1 c.3331_3334del (n = 3; 2 Colombia, 1 Brazil) and c.5123 C > A (n = 11; 4 Colombia, 4 Mexico, 3 Peru). Regarding BRCA2, only a Colombian founder variant was recurrent: c.2808_2811del (n = 6: 3 in Brazil, 2 in Mexico and 1 in Colombia). In Brazil 3 recurrent PVs accounted for 52.6% (10/19) of the total; in Mexico 11 recurrent PVs accounted for 52.7% (58/110); in Peru 6 recurrent PVs accounted for 31.7% (26/82); in Colombia 3 recurrent PVs accounted for 33.3% (7/21).\n\n    Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for the BRCAPRO model at a 10% threshold. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was 0.76 for BRCAPRO to predict the probability that a participant in this cohort carried a BRCA PV (Fig. 2). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were 37.6%, 92.1%, 44.1%, 89.9% and 84.3%, respectively.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This is the largest study of BRCA PVs among Latin Americans to date, and represents a cross-section including Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Among 1,627 prospectively accrued participants, most affected with cancer, we detected 236 (14.5%) BRCA PVs using a low-cost BRCA genotyping workflow. Most previous studies were population specific and/or had a small sample size (Supplementary Data).\n\n    The prevalence of PVs was 9.3-25.7% across the countries included in this study, similar to the range (3.0-47.8%) reported in previous studies (Supplementary Data 2). There were wide variations in reported prevalence within each country. For example, a study of 327 patients in Mexico only reported 7.3% PVs and did not test for CNVs other than the Mexican founder PV. Another study of 101 patients in Mexico at high-risk and/or with breast cancer at or under the age of 40 years, which included CNV analysis, reported 13.9% PVs, which more closely approximated our observation of 17% of the 632 patients in Mexico.\n\n    This study highlights the extent to which BRCA CNVs play an important role in the etiology of cancer in Latin America, and particularly in Mexico where CNVs represented 34.5% of PVs, nearly half of which were the Mexican founder, BRCA1 exon 9-12del. The burden of this PV has previously been documented by us and others in independent Mexican cohorts, and among Mexican Americans. CNVs represented < 10% of PVs in Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. The sample size was too small to estimate for Puerto Rico.\n\n    The absence of BRCA2 CNVs was notable. The Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) reported a ratio of 3.5:1 excess of BRCA1 CNVs compared to BRCA2, among 18,435 breast cancer cases with BRCA1 PVs and 11,351 with BRCA2, ascertained from 69 centers in 49 countries on 6 continents. However, Hispanics only represented 3.4% of the total which was primarily NHW. We confirmed all CNVs by MLPA or long-range PCR, and the CNV detection algorithm incorporated into the Ion Reporter workflow for NGS performs well. Two of the three studies in Mexico that included CNV analyses (Supplementary Data 2) did not detect any BRCA2 CNVs, though 14 BRCA1 CNVs were detected (11 of which were the Mexican founder PV). The remaining study reported 3 BRCA1 CNVs and 11 BRCA2 CNVs. However, 9 of 11 were single exon deletions and were not confirmed by a secondary MLPA kit or long-range PCR, and confirmation is recommended due to a high false-positive rate for single exon CNVs on MLPA. Consequently, we believe the weight of evidence suggests a paucity of BRCA2 CNVs among the populations studied here.\n\n    Although limited by high-risk clinic ascertainment, the observed frequency of BRCA PVs highlights the burden of hereditary cancer in every country we examined. We found the highest frequency of PVs in Brazil, where the inclusion criteria required a greater clinical burden of breast/ovarian cancer, followed by Mexico and Peru, while the lowest frequency was found in Colombia and Puerto Rico. Another limitation is known heterogeneity in genetic ancestral composition of among Hispanics from the Americas. We found that the founder Jewish PVs (BRCA1 c.66_67del and c.5266dupC) were recurrent in our cohort. We were among the first to document a shared genotype between Ashkenazi Jewish individuals and Mexican Americans with no known Jewish ancestry who carried BRCA1 c.66_67del. Subsequent publications have reinforced the observation, and suggest they are likely descendants of conversos or crypto-Jews who emigrated to the Americas in the late 15th century and over generations assimilated into the larger Hispanic society, representing an underappreciated diaspora to the new world.\n\n    In addition, we evaluated the BRCAPRO model performance for the first time in a Latin American cohort and found that it performed well (AUROC 0.76) and was comparable to that reported for genetic risk clinics in England (0.76). BRCAPRO can be used in clinical practice to select patients at risk for carrying BRCA PVs, though it was developed using rates derived from primarily European populations. Similar to our findings, a small study of U.S. Hispanics reported an AUROC of 0.70. The BRCAPRO results from our study of native Latin American populations, reinforces our observations of prevalence and relationship to clinical phenotype, and also serve as a surrogate indication that our genetic testing methods were sensitive. Further, our study indicates that BRCAPRO can be used as a tool to select individuals at the highest risk of carrying BRCA PVs, which could enable prioritized allocation of limited resources in Latin America.\n\n    Worldwide, BRCA testing in the past was commonly performed by capillary DNA (Sanger) sequencing, which was considered the gold standard, albeit expensive. Our study spans 2012-2017, during which time we developed and applied inexpensive approaches, including the HISPANEL on a Sequenom MassARRAY spectroscopy platform, and subsequently, multiplex amplicon library NGS on the Ion Torrent PGM platform that could be deployed in countries with limited resources. The HISPANEL served well in early studies, with an analytic sensitivity compared to full sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 of up to 70% in Mexico, largely because recurrent PVs constituted a large proportion of the overall burden. HISPANEL also performed well in Colombia, due to the prevalence of founder PVs in this country. For example, the three prevalent PVs seen in Colombia, BRCA1 c.5123 C > A, BRCA1 c.3331_3334del, and BRCA2 c.4889 C > G, accounted for a third of all PVs found in this region. In Mexico, the BRCA1 exon 9-12del PV accounted for a fifth of all mutations detected and was not seen outside of Mexico. In Peru, the observed sensitivity of HISPANEL was 30%, approximately half of what was observed in Colombia and Mexico. This is consistent with the isolation of the Indigenous American Peruvian population, while other populations show more migration between regions. Despite limitations, this report shows that using a low-cost strategy for broad access to BRCA genotyping in Latin America is feasible. The most recent iteration in our laboratory is a multiplex amplicon multigene panel, validated in the CARRIERS project.\n\n    There are 125 unique PVs among the 236 BRCA PVs reported here; 17/125 (13.6%) were not represented in ClinVar, highlighting the underrepresentation of Latin American ancestry. This lack of representation may influence the effectiveness of variant curation by clinicians. Data from this ongoing study also are valuable to construct population-specific variant frequencies, and to increase representation in public databases. We also found that 111/196 (56.6%) unique VUS were not reported previously in ClinVar. We recently demonstrated that sequence data well controlled for racial/ethnic composition can yield important observations about pathogenicity of uncertain variants. The proportion of VUS reported varied by study and gene. The proportion of VUS that we report here (14%) is higher than that in NHW women and comparable to other studies including Hispanics. In a meta-analysis of largely European populations, BRCA1 VUS were reported in 1.23% of cases (95% CI 0.75-2.04) and for BRCA2 in 3.29% of cases (CI 95% 0.75-2.42). Similarly, the frequency of VUS is elevated in other underrepresented populations, such as in African American and Asiatic, and we demonstrated varying rates of variant reclassification by ancestry over time. Again, increased representation in public databases is important for clinical translation in diverse populations. Over half of the VUS were not seen in ClinVar, suggesting there may be a registration bias towards deposit of PVs in ClinVar.\n\n    In conclusion, strategies to develop affordable BRCA testing in low- and middle-income countries with limited resources are important to extend the reach of lifesaving genetic cancer risk assessment (GCRA). The burden of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in the respective countries is evident from this and other studies. More than 80% of the breast cancers in this series were diagnosed at Stage II or greater, and 268 cases had multiple primary tumors, including 27 ovarian cancers that might have been prevented if genetic testing was available at breast cancer diagnosis. Dissemination and implementation of GCRA, supported by clinical training and accessible genetic testing, could result in measurable prevention of breast cancer and its related mortality in Latin America and other low- and middle-income countries globally.",

        "Title": "    Antioxidant Properties of Zinc and Copper:Blood Zinc-to Copper-Ratio as a Marker of Cancer Risk BRCA1 Mutation Carriers",
        "Abstract": "    Pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene 1) confer high risks of both breast (up to 70%) and ovarian (up to 40%) cancers. Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are essential for various physiological functions, including antioxidant reactions. Their balance, reflected in the Zn/Cu ratio, plays a crucial role in maintaining redox homeostasis, which is vital for cancer prevention. This study examines the antioxidant properties of Zn and Cu, specifically focusing on the blood Zn/Cu ratio as a potential marker for cancer risk among BRCA1 mutation carriers. The study cohort consisted of 989 initially unaffected women, followed up for 7.5 years. Blood samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Although individual Zn and Cu levels did not significantly correlate with overall cancer risk, those women with a Zn/Cu ratio above 6.38 experienced a significantly lower cancer risk than women with a ratio below this cut-off point. This suggests that the Zn/Cu ratio may be a valuable biomarker for cancer prevention in this high-risk group. Given the increased cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers, optimizing Zn and Cu levels through dietary and active interventions could provide a preventive strategy.",
        "Introduction": "    The BRCA1 gene plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including the cell cycle and gene transcription regulation, apoptosis, repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), maintaining genomic stability, and protecting, repairing, and restarting stalled and damaged replication forks (independently of DSB repair). Additionally, BRCA1 protects stressed replication forks from degradation by stabilizing RAD51 nucleofilaments.\n\n    Tumors in patients with BRCA1 mutations typically exhibit a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or other inactivating somatic alterations of the wild-type copy. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene often affect one of the two essential domains, RING or BRCT, necessary for homologous recombination (HR), causing HR deficiency. This disrupts the repair of DSBs, leading to genomic instability, which drives oncogenesis and cancer proliferation. BRCA1-mutated tumors rely on alternative repair mechanisms due to impaired HR.\n\n    Women with BRCA1 mutations have an increased lifetime risk of various cancers, including breast cancer (up to 70%) and ovarian cancer (up to 40%). Additionally, there is an increased risk of developing a second primary breast cancer within 10 and 20 years by 20-30% and 40-50%, respectively. The risk for esophageal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers is also approximately three times higher compared to the general population (RR = 2.9, RR = 3.34, and RR = 3.69, respectively). An increased risk of colorectal cancer before age 50 has also been observed.\n\n    Further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer development among BRCA1 carriers may provide valuable insights into modifiable determinants and prevention strategies.\n\n    Besides the influence of inherited mutations on the incidence of cancer, women with a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation have various non-genetic modifiable factors. These factors include age, family history, breastfeeding, prophylactic procedures (salpingo-oophorectomy, mastectomy, and tubal ligation), hormone (such as contraceptives) or replacement therapy, tamoxifen, late age at menarche and menopause, fertility treatment, exposure to radiation, chronic infections and inflammations, and lifestyle habits (like alcohol, coffee consumption, smoking, physical activity, dietary energy intake, BMI, and dietary components (variety of vegetables and fruits, including elements)).\n\n    Among the elements, we can distinguish zinc and copper. Zinc's anticancer properties are generally attributed to its antioxidant capabilities and its role in shielding cells from oxidative stress. It plays a crucial role in regulating essential processes involved in cancer progression, such as DNA repair, gene expression, and programmed cell death. Copper remains vital for cellular metabolism, participating in various physiological functions, including antioxidant reactions and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. In the discussion of this paper, we further describe the antioxidant properties of zinc and copper and the potentially harmful effects of deficiency and excess, which may be involved in tumorigenesis. The zinc-to-copper ratio is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormones. In addition, the ratio of zinc to copper correlates with the modulation of immune defense, growth stimuli, and a response to stress. The Zn/Cu ratio is also presumed to be associated with the body's repair attempts in old age. The levels of Zn and Cu are tightly controlled by compensatory mechanisms designed to maintain their stability within specific ranges of nutritional intake. Studies published to date indicate that a form of redox balance exists between zinc and copper, which is reflected in the ratio of these elements.\n\n    The study of zinc and copper ratios in the blood has been ongoing for over 50 years. Previous research has evaluated blood/serum levels of zinc and copper in a prospective manner concerning cancer risk and survival. Prospective studies on cancer risk using zinc and copper status and their ratio in the blood are sparse in current literature. In the literature, we identified three prospective studies that measured blood levels of zinc and copper and their ratio to evaluate cancer risk. All of these studies were case-control studies conducted within a large prospective multicenter cohort (EPIC), with one specifically investigating breast cancer risk. To the best of our knowledge, there are no prospective studies examining the BRCA1 Zn/Cu ratio and its association with cancer risk. This gap in research has encouraged us to conduct a prospective study on BRCA1 mutation carriers to determine if the Zn/Cu ratio can be a useful preventive biomarker in this population.",
        "Methods": "    The study subjects were 989 initially unaffected adult women who received genetic counseling and testing between 2011 and 2017 at the Clinical Hospitals of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Poland, or at associated hospitals or outpatient clinics. Patients were seen at these facilities for the period specified and were enrolled in the study. At the first study visit, a fasting blood sample was collected from each study participant to be used for genetic testing for BRCA1 mutations. For analysis, 10 mL of peripheral blood was collected into a vacutainer tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) from all study participants. All blood samples were collected between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. and stored at -80 C until analysis.\n\n    Participants were included in this study if a deleterious BRCA1 variant was detected. Medical charts were reviewed for date of diagnosis, age at enrollment (<50/>=50), ovary removal (yes/no), smoking status (ever/never), contraceptive use (ever/never), diabetes (yes/no), dietary supplements (ever/never), hormonal therapy (ever/never), and BMI (<18.5/18.5-24.9/25.0-29.9/>=30.0).\n\n    This study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and with the consent of the Ethics Committee of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin under the number KB-0012/73/10 on 21 June 2010. All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n    The blood samples were obtained from fasting individuals through venipuncture using the Vacutainer  System (BD #368381, Plymouth, UK). Blood was carefully divided into new cryovials and then frozen at -80  C until analysis.\n\n    The elemental composition of the samples was determined using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique with the NexION 350D instrument (PerkinElmer, Norfolk, VA, USA). The KED (Kinetic Energy Discrimination) mode was employed for element determination, and rhodium was used as an internal standard to compensate for instrument drift and matrix effects. Detailed information regarding the specific parameters of the NexION 350D instrument used in the measurements can be provided upon request. During analysis, the blood samples were diluted 40-fold with a blank reagent (70 microL of blood: 2730 microL of buffer).\n\n    The blank reagent used consisted of high-purity water (>18 MOmega), TMAH (AlfaAesar, Kandel, Germany), Triton X-100 (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT, USA), EDTA (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and ethyl alcohol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).\n\n    Calibration curve standards were prepared by diluting the stock solution of 1000 microg/mL zinc and copper Standard (PerkinElmer Pure Plus, Shelton, CT, USA) with the blank reagent. The calibration method used was matrix-matched, and the correlation coefficients for the calibration curve were always greater than 0.999.\n\n    The accuracy and precision of the measurements were evaluated using certified reference materials (CRM): ClinChek  Plasmonorm Whole Blood Level 1 (Recipe, Munich, Germany) and Seronorm Whole Blood Level 2 (Sero, Norway). Technical details, plasma operating settings, and mass spectrometer acquisition parameters can be provided upon request. The testing laboratory participates in an independent external quality assessment scheme, QMEQAS (Quebec Multielement External Quality Assessment Scheme), organized by the Institut National de Sante Publique du Quebec.\n\n    All study participants were assigned to one of three categories (tertiles) depending on their zinc and copper levels. Patients were followed from the date of blood draw until the development of cancer or the date of the last follow-up. To estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer risk according to the zinc and copper tertile, univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed. The reference levels for zinc and copper were taken as the lowest tertile. In the multivariable models, the following variables were taken into account: zinc and copper level (tertile), age at blood draw (<50 vs. >=50), oral contraceptive use (yes/no), hormone replacement therapy use (yes/no), smoking history (yes/no), oophorectomy (yes/no), and BMI (<18.5/18.5-24.9/25.0-29.9/>=30.0). Due to missing data, 84 patients were excluded from the statistical analysis.\n\n    All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical environment (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria 2023).",
        "Results": "    The study group consisted of 989 women with a BRCA1 mutation. Among our cohort, there were 559 women with c.5266dupC, n = 250 with c.181T/G, n = 50 with c.4035delA, n = 18 with c.3700_3704delGTAAA, n = 14 with c.1687C > T, n = 12 with c.5251C > T, n = 9 with c.66_67delAG (c.68_69delAG), and n = 9 with c.676delT; 68 women had other rarer mutations. The women were unaffected at the time of inclusion in the study. The mean age of enrollment (blood draw) was 44.0 years. The patients were followed up for an average of 7.52 years, during which time 173 new cancers occurred in various organs (121 cases of breast cancers, 29 cases of ovarian cancers, and 23 cancers at other sites). The characteristics of the study group are shown in Table 1.\n\n    A total of 573 of the women had a risk-reducing oophorectomy at a mean age of 45.2 years. A total of 204 of the women had the oophorectomy prior to the blood draw and 369 women had the oophorectomy during the follow-up period.\n\n    In the study group, we compared the results of zinc, copper, and the zinc-to-copper ratio using the calculated cut-off point (Figure S1 Supplementary Materials).\n\n    The associations between blood zinc levels and cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers, which we described in an earlier publication, did not show a statistically significant reduction in the risk of any of the cancers; we observed tendencies, although not statistically significant, for ovarian and breast cancers.\n\n    Similarly, outcomes of the analysis of copper levels in the blood showed a tendency to reduce the risk of cancer with decreasing copper values (<863.33). However, the obtained results were not statistically significant (Tables S1-S3 in Supplementary Materials).\n\n    We observed that the value of their ratio after crossing a certain value became harmful (Figure 1). Our observation showed that in the studied cohort of women, this established cut-off point was 6.38. Values below this cut-off point were unfavorable and were associated with an increased risk of cancer.\n\n    When we divided the group by using a cut-off point = 6.38, we achieved an almost 1.5-fold statistically significant reduction in the risk of any cancer (HR = 1.48; CI = 1.07-2.04; p = 0.018) (Table 2).\n\n    The tendency, although not statistically significant, was also present for breast cancer and was associated with a more than 1.3-fold increased risk of breast cancer in the group of women who had a Zn/Cu ratio value of less than 6.38 (HR = 1.31; CI = 0.90-1.93; p = 0.2) (Table S4 in Supplementary Material).\n\n    The most pronounced, more than 1.75-fold, reduction of cancer risk was observed in ovarian cancer, but this result was not statistically significant (HR = 1.78; CI = 0.77-4.11; p = 0.2) (Table S5 in Supplementary Material).",
        "Conclusion": "    There is a need to consider optimization of the levels of both elements, Zn and Cu. It seems to be important in women at genetic risk (BRCA1 carriers) for cancers. The Zn/Cu ratio may be a significant biomarker of cancer risk in this cohort.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    Essential elements play a crucial role in maintaining the body's normal functions, including anti-cancer protective mechanisms. Zinc and copper have been recognized as influential in the occurrence of cancer. Understanding these influences is particularly important for individuals with a heightened risk of cancer, such as BRCA1 mutation carriers, who face a significantly increased lifetime risk of breast (up to 70%) and ovarian (up to 40%) cancer. Thus, gaining insights into the factors influencing the remaining 30% and 60% risks, respectively, for these malignancies is crucial.\n\n    Our earlier research, despite not demonstrating statistically significant reductions in cancer risk associated with blood zinc levels in BRCA1 mutation carriers, indicated trends. Given zinc's recognized antioxidant effects and these observed trends, we conducted further analyses, incorporating additional factors.\n\n    Zinc is crucial for maintaining DNA integrity and immune system function, as well as possessing antioxidant properties that help reduce oxidative stress. Its role in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells makes it a valuable component of cancer prevention strategies. Zinc is an essential cofactor for many proteins involved in DNA repair, and its optimal level reduces the risk of further DNA damage accumulation. Zinc affects the activity of enzymes and transcription factors regulating the cell cycle and the function of proteins such as p53, which helps regulate the cell cycle and prevent uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. It also stabilizes chromatin elements and DNA repair proteins, which is key to maintaining genomic stability. Zinc protects cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing oxidative stress and decreasing the risk of cancer development. Additionally, it is essential for the function of pro-apoptotic proteins, which helps eliminate damaged cells that could lead to cancer formation. Studies show that zinc supplementation has chemopreventive effects in the case of cancers. This might be due to reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in patients who supplement zinc.\n\n    The results obtained in our study showed that there is a tendency (not statistically significant) of a potential benefit of maintaining low (<863.33) copper levels in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Copper is an essential element, but like a double-edged sword, both elevated and decreased copper levels can pose risks, potentially exacerbating cancer development. Copper showcases both advantageous (antioxidant) and harmful (pro-oxidant) effects on cellular processes.\n\n    Copper exhibits several antioxidant properties critical for maintaining cellular health. Firstly, copper serves as an essential cofactor for superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, thereby reducing oxidative stress in cells. Additionally, copper is necessary for the synthesis of ceruloplasmin, a protein that not only scavenges free radicals but also facilitates the transport of copper in the bloodstream.\n\n    Furthermore, copper participates in antioxidant pathways that protect lipids from peroxidation, a harmful process where free radicals attack lipid molecules in cell membranes. Another crucial function of copper is its role in maintaining the balance between oxidized and reduced forms of molecules within cells, which is essential for proper cellular function and protection against oxidative damage. Copper is a component of ubiquitous and multifunctional metalloenzymes that facilitate the reduction of molecular oxygen, a process vital for various physiological functions, as indicated in references. These antioxidant properties underscore copper's significance in protecting cells from oxidative damage. The accumulation of copper in cancer cells manifests in two distinct biological traits. On one hand, it can stimulate tumor development by promoting cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, it can also induce programmed cell death in tumor cells, thereby impeding tumor progression. In recent years, the terms \"cuproplasia\" and \"cuproptosis\" have emerged, explaining to some extent the complex mechanisms of copper involvement in tumorigenesis. Cuproptosis involves mitochondrial copper directly attaching to proteins, leading to post-translational modifications such as lipoylation. This process, through a complex interaction associated with proteotoxic stress, leads to cell death. There is no research evidence to suggest that these processes do not occur in BRCA1 mutation carriers.\n\n    Copper plays a crucial role in the anticancer and preventive mechanisms by inhibiting angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels that tumors rely on for growth. This inhibition is achieved by reducing angiogenic factors like VEGF and FGF. Additionally, copper promotes apoptosis in cancer cells by disrupting copper-dependent enzymes, leading to cell death. By targeting metalloproteins and inhibiting copper-dependent enzymes like LOX and SOD1, copper hinders processes like extracellular matrix remodeling. It also modulates the immune system, enhancing its ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells. In addition, copper can impact epigenetic modifications, potentially restoring the expression of tumor suppressor genes and silencing oncogenes. It interferes with the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in extracellular matrix degradation. Copper inhibits oncogenic pathways like PI3K/Akt and MAPK, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation.\n\n    An imbalance in copper and zinc levels (elevated zinc and/or reduced copper) hinders the antioxidant function of various enzymes. Prolonged oxidative stress could heighten the likelihood of developing breast cancer and impact the initial phases of cancer development and advancement.\n\n    The copper-to-zinc ratio (Cu/Zn ratio) is believed to serve as a more precise predictive indicator compared to individual copper or zinc levels. An imbalance between copper and zinc levels can lead to the overproduction of ROS, which in turn promotes tumorigenesis. Given the sensitivity of mitochondrial DNA to ROS, there may exist a theoretical link between copper and zinc levels and mutations in mitochondrial DNA in cancer cells. A recent comprehensive analysis determined that an elevated Cu/Zn ratio correlates with a heightened risk of breast cancer.\n\n    The interactions between zinc and copper within the human body are intricate, beginning in the small intestine, where the intake and status of each element can influence the absorption of the other. They are crucial components of copper-zinc SOD (CuZnSOD), pivotal for maintaining DNA stability and integrity to mitigate cancer development.\n\n    The literature often highlights the beneficial potential of maintaining an optimal Zn/Cu ratio. However, prospective studies focusing on this ratio in cancer risk are limited. Studies by Stepien et al., based on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, revealed significant associations between the Zn/Cu ratio and colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma risk.\n\n    The literature's rationale prompted us to investigate the Zn/Cu ratio in our cohort. We observed interdependence between zinc and copper levels, with low Zn often coinciding with Cu deficiency and vice versa. By establishing a cut-off point of 6.38 for the Zn/Cu ratio, we found that ratios below this significantly increased cancer risk, while values equal to or greater than 6.38 represented an optimal range with relatively lower risks.\n\n    There is a lack of information in the literature on how catalysts (including SOD1) differ in BRCA1 mutation carriers compared to the general population. However, since the observed correlations between cancer risk and Zn/Cu ratio are similar between the general population and our cohort, we can assume that these mechanisms described above can also be valuable in BRCA1 carriers.\n\n    The tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and its encoded proteins are vital for preserving the integrity of the genome, playing a crucial role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. The primary model for cancer development linked to BRCA1 mutations is based on the \"two-hit\" hypothesis, where one allele is lost, and the other undergoes a loss-of-function mutation. This mechanism forms the basis of the molecular pathogenesis of BRCA1-related cancers, with key factors including genomic instability and oxidative stress. Genomic instability arises from deficiencies in DNA repair caused by BRCA1 mutations, particularly affecting homologous recombination, leading to the accumulation of DNA damage and an increased risk of oncogenic mutations. Additionally, the loss of BRCA1 function is associated with chromosomal aberrations like breaks, fusions, and translocations, further destabilizing the genome. Cells with BRCA1 mutations often exhibit LOH, where the normal BRCA1 allele is lost, resulting in the complete loss of BRCA1 function in these cells. Oxidative stress poses a threat to genomic stability, with BRCA1 playing a crucial role in regulating oxidative stress as a defense mechanism in individuals without pathogenic variants. Mutation carriers are more vulnerable to the effects of ROS and the resulting oxidative DNA damage, contributing to the development of cancer. BRCA1 indirectly influences oxidative stress regulation through the p53 protein, which responds to ROS-induced oxidative stress. BRCA1 activates and stabilizes p53, facilitating the p53-dependent transcription of genes involved in DNA repair. Mutations in BRCA1 disrupt these interactions, reducing the cell's ability to effectively manage oxidative stress. Furthermore, BRCA1 is essential for cell cycle checkpoints, particularly in response to DNA damage. Acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, BRCA1 polyubiquitinates G2/M cell cycle proteins, marking them for degradation and preventing their accumulation. Mutations in BRCA1 allow cells with DNA damage to continue dividing, thereby increasing the risk of cancer development.\n\n    Considering these findings, addressing zinc deficiency through dietary changes or supplementation may be advantageous. It is advisable to avoid factors known to elevate copper levels, such as hormone replacement therapy and contraception.\n\n    Given our patients in the BRCA1 cohort, studies on the efficiency of active interventions aimed at improving the Zn/Cu ratio are strongly justified. While there are promising trials in the literature actively targeting copper reduction, such interventions specifically tailored to women with BRCA1 mutations are currently lacking.\n\n    Our study has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the number of BRCA1 mutation carriers included in the study was relatively small, which could limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the patients were selected from cancer genetics outpatient clinics, introducing a potential selection bias as most women were referred due to a positive family history of cancer. This selection criterion may not represent the broader population of BRCA1 mutation carriers. Furthermore, the observation period could have been longer to capture more extended outcomes and trends. Another limitation is the homogeneity of the studied population, which was primarily of a Polish genetic background. This genetic uniformity may not reflect the diversity seen in broader, more varied populations. Therefore, validation studies on additional groups and in various populations are necessary to confirm the findings and ensure their applicability across different genetic backgrounds and demographic settings.\n\n    Hence, there is considerable promise in expanded efforts targeting BRCA1, necessitating broader cohort inclusion, active intervention implementation, and clinical trials focusing on prevention by optimizing the Zn/Cu ratio. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that this relationship can serve both as a marker and a potential target for intervention.",

        "Title": "    Differences in Ovarian and Other Cancers Risks by Population and BRCA Mutation Location",
        "Abstract": "    Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer is caused by a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The frequency of germline BRCA1/2 gene mutation carriers and the ratio of germline BRCA1 to BRCA2 mutations in BRCA-related cancer patients vary depending on the population. Genotype and phenotype correlations have been reported in BRCA mutant families, however, the correlations are rarely used for individual risk assessment and management. BRCA genetic testing has become a companion diagnostic for PARP inhibitors, and the number of families with germline BRCA mutation identified is growing rapidly. Therefore, it is expected that analysis of the risk of developing cancer will be possible in a large number of BRCA mutant carriers, and there is a possibility that personal and precision medicine for the carriers with specific common founder mutations will be realized. In this review, we investigated the association of ovarian cancer risk and BRCA mutation location, and differences of other BRCA-related cancer risks by BRCA1/2 mutation, and furthermore, we discussed the difference in the prevalence of germline BRCA mutation in ovarian cancer patients. As a result, although there are various discussions, there appear to be differences in ovarian cancer risk by population and BRCA mutation location. If it becomes possible to estimate the risk of developing BRCA-related cancer for each BRCA mutation type, the age at risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy can be determined individually. The decision would bring great benefits to young women with germline BRCA mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    The BRCA1 gene, located on chromosome 17, and the BRCA2 gene, located on chromosome 13, are involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks and cell-cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage. The functions of two genes preserve genomic stability as tumor suppressor genes. The overall prevalence of germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in unaffected women has been estimated at 0.11% and 0.24%, respectively. So far, many mutations have been identified in BRCA1/2 genes. Among them, the same mutation has been found in multiple, unrelated families and can be traced back to a common ancestor. Such mutations are so-called common founder mutations observed in specific populations, e.g., 187delAG and 5385insC of BRCA1 and the 6174delT of BRCA2 in the Ashkenazi Jewish and L63X and Q934X of BRCA1 in a Japanese population. Certain common founder mutations have also been identified in other populations. The carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations have a high risk of specific cancer, such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. However, the probability of cancer development in the carriers is variable, even within families with the same variant. It is still unknown whether the risk of developing cancer in the carriers is related only to the specific mutation or whether additional genetic and environmental factors exist.\n\n    In this review article, we used three databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science) and references or related articles to conduct a review of the cancer risk by BRCA mutation types. We identified articles in the databases using the following search string: (\"ovarian cancer\" OR \"breast cancer\" OR \"common mutation\" OR \"founder mutation\" OR \"cancer risk\" OR \"ethnicity\" OR \"race\" OR \"population\") AND \"BRCA\". Given the search results, we added the words \"Prostate cancer,\" \"Pancreatic cancer,\" \"Melanoma,\" \"risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy,\" and \"risk-reducing mastectomy\" to cover all relevant articles.\n\n    The risk of developing ovarian cancer is thought to increase with early menarche, delayed menopause, nulliparity, infertility, and obesity, however, the strongest risk factor for ovarian cancer is a positive family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is 2 to 6 times higher in those who have breast cancer or ovarian cancer as first-degree relatives. Hereditary ovarian cancer occurs as part of a hereditary tumor represented by Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome. Of these, HBOC is the most involved and is estimated to account for about 65-85% of hereditary ovarian cancers. In large-scale epidemiologic studies, the penetrance of the BRCA1/2 gene for female breast cancer was about 70%, and there was almost no difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, the penetrance of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene for ovarian cancer has been reported to be about 40% and 20%, respectively. On the other hand, the risk of developing male breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma in BRCA2 mutation carriers has been reported to be higher than in BRCA1. Given the genetic risk of developing ovarian cancer in a population, the frequency of BRCA gene carriers in the general population leads to the direct estimation of risk factors. In addition, the frequency of germline BRCA1/2 gene mutation carriers and the ratio of germline BRCA1 to BRCA2 mutations in ovarian cancer patients may vary depending on the population.\n\n    Table 1 shows the differences in germline BRCA1/2 mutation prevalence between population and country in ovarian cancer patients. The frequency of germline BRCA mutation ranged from 5% to 30%. Among these reports, the high frequency of germline BRCA mutation in Ashkenazi Jews stands out as already reported. The frequency of germline BRCA mutation in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan showed average values of about 15%. On the other hand, the frequency of germline BRCA mutation varies in European countries, but that of Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland appear to be relatively low. The ratio of BRCA1 to BRCA2 mutations varies from population to population, but it is consistent with previous reports that germline BRCA1 mutation was more common than germline BRCA2 mutation in ovarian cancer cases. However, reports from Iceland and Poland show that germline BRCA2 mutation was more frequent than germline BRCA1 mutation. The exact reason for this event is unknown, but the presence and spread of common founder mutations among ethnically different populations may have affected the proportion of germline BRCA1/2 mutation.\n\n    In many mutational analyses of BRCA1/2 genes for epithelial ovarian cancer, we picked up large-scale epidemiological studies of more than 500 ovarian cancer patients. Table 2 shows that the rate of germline BRCA mutation of each histological type varies by the country where the study was conducted. Regarding high-grade serous carcinoma, the mutation rate showed a range of 16% to 28%, and the rate tended to be higher in Asian countries than in Western countries. Almost 20% of Low-grade serous carcinoma in Japan or Korea were BRCA mutated, while this was only 6% in the USA or German population. Although it is not clear due to the small number of cases, the frequency of BRCA mutation in Low-grade serous carcinoma may be lower in Asia than that in European countries. Regarding mucinous carcinoma, no case with germline BRCA mutation was found in Western countries and Japan, however, germline BRCA1/2 mutation was found in 4 of 57 cases (7.0%) in China and 1 of 18 cases (5.6%) in South Korea. There is no doubt that patients with mucinous carcinoma rarely have germline BRCA mutation, but it is unclear whether the involvement of BRCA gene mutations in the pathogenic mechanism of mucinous carcinoma differs between Western and Asian countries. In the histological diagnosis of ovarian cancer, the existence of a mixed type is also known, and it may be related to the diversity of pathological diagnosis rather than the molecular biological reason. Regarding endometrioid carcinoma, the mutation rate was the lowest in Japan at 6.7% and the highest in Germany and South Korea at 13.0%, but there seems to be no clear difference between the countries. There are few reports on the new classification, Seromucinous tumor of the ovary, but in the analysis of four cases in Japan and seven cases in South Korea, no case with germline BRCA1/2 mutation was found in the tumor.\n\n    Regarding clear cell carcinoma, Germany had the lowest rate at 0%, followed by Japan at 2.1%, and other countries at about 7%. There are significant differences between Western and East Asian countries regarding the frequency of clear cell carcinoma in all types of epithelial ovarian cancer. For example, the frequency of clear cell carcinoma in the United States is about 6%, but the frequency of clear cell carcinoma in Japan is about 25%, which is a four-fold difference. It is known that the incidence of endometriosis is high in East Asia, and it is presumed that this is a factor in the higher frequency of clear cell carcinoma that develops from endometriosis than in Western countries. Especially in Japan, there is a tendency that drug therapy with GnRH agonists and Dienogest is preferred over surgical therapy as a treatment for endometriosis, so there is a relatively high possibility that clear cell carcinoma will develop from an endometriotic cyst.\n\n    Regarding the difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the frequency of histological types in each country, the frequency of serous carcinoma in cases with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation was about 80%, and there was almost no difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2. Among ovarian cancer patients in China and South Korea, five cases of mucinous carcinoma with BRCA1/2 mutation were found, of which three cases had a BRCA1 mutation and two cases had a BRCA2 mutation.\n\n    Genotype and phenotype correlations have been reported in BRCA mutant families. At present, such correlations are rarely used for individual risk assessment and management. However, the data of the mutant carriers have accumulated dramatically, so the genotype and phenotype correlations may be utilized for individual risk assessment.\n\n    The ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) was identified in or near exon 11 in both the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Mutations within the lesion increase the ratio of ovarian cancer to breast cancer, unlike variants elsewhere in both genes. The Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) revealed that the incidence of ovarian cancer is high in patients with germline BRCA mutation in the OCCR in about 30,000 BRCA mutant carriers in 33 countries around the world. These results are consistent with prior reports of OCCR in BRCA1/2 genes. On the other hand, regarding the breast cancer cluster region (BCCR), multiple regions other than exon 11 have been reported for both genes. Rebbeck et al. speculated why OCCR is present in the BRCA1 gene as follows. Mutations in exon 11 could produce a partial BRCA1 protein encoded by the known exon 11 splice variant, while the full-length protein is lost by the process of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Thus, it is biologically plausible that individuals carrying mutations within exon 11 (and the OCCR) may have a different phenotype than other mutations for BRCA1.\n\n    The Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database contains DNA sequence variations reported from around the world. The total number of database entries was 15,311 and 14,914 in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. Table 3 shows the top 10 pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Regarding the judgment of clinical pathogenic importance, according to the opinion of the BIC steering committee, the sequence change of this type interferes with gene function and results in an increased risk of cancer based on available data. For the BRCA1 gene, the most frequently reported mutation is 185delAG, followed by 5382insC, C61G, 4184del4, R1443X, 3875del4, and exon13ins6kb. The above seven variants showed the number of entries of 100 times or more. Among these common founder mutations, the mutations located within OCCR are Q563X, 2800delAA, E1250X, and 3875del4 in BRCA1 and 4075delGT in BRCA2 (Figure 1). In a recent report, Yoshihara et al. reported that more than 50% of Japanese ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were within the OCCR after excluding 16 cases with L63X founder mutation. On the other hand, Cardoso et al. reported that 33% (20/60) of Argentine ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 mutations were beyond the OCCR, in stark contrast with 61% (22/36) of the patients with BRCA2 mutations being inside the OCCR. Moreover, Teixeira et al. reported that among Dutch BRCA1 families, ovarian cancer risks were higher in women with OCCR mutations than non-OCCR mutations, but not in BRCA2 families.\n\n    Rebbeck et al. reported that exon 11 mutations were associated with earlier ages in breast and ovarian cancer diagnosis and mutations conferring NMD or premature termination codon were associated with a later age at breast cancer diagnosis in BRCA1. In BRCA2, the mean age was greater for mutations in OCCR vs. mutations not in OCCR (45.0 vs. 43.9 years, p < 0.001), lower for mutations in BCCR1 vs. mutations not in BCCR1 (42.6 vs. 44.3 years; p = 0.004), and lower for mutations in BCCR2 vs. mutations not in BCCR2 (43.5 vs. 44.3 years, p = 0.04).\n\n    Various common founder mutations of the BRCA gene have been reported by different populations in the world. It has been reported that some of these mutation carriers have a different risk of developing cancer than the overall mutation carriers. For example, Satagopan et al. reported that the estimated lifetime ovarian cancer risks were 66% (95% CI, 37-100%) due to 185delAG mutation and 29% (95% CI, 16-69%) due to 5382insC mutation. There is also a report that the presence of 5382insC decreased and C61G in BRCA1 increased the risk of peritoneal cancer (p = 0.049 vs. p = 0.013) in the Polish population who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Ashkenazi Jewish families with the 6174delT founder mutation were more likely to have a family member with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.58; p = 0.002). Breast cancer risks for carriers of 6174delT were lower than those of all BRCA1 carriers (43% by age 70, 95% CI, 14% to 62%; p = 0.007 compared with all BRCA1 mutation carriers), on the other hand, the ovarian cancer risks in the carriers were somewhat higher than the average BRCA2 risks (20% vs. 11%). The corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 14% (95% CI, 2% to 24%), 33% (8% to 50%), and 20% (2% to 35%) in carriers of the 185delAG, 5382insC in BRCA1 and 6174delT mutations in BRCA2, respectively. The K3326X mutation was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.17 to 1.40) independent of additional BRCA2 mutations and demonstrated strong association with serous ovarian cancer (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.70), but not with prostate cancer.\n\n    We found L63X and Q934X as Japanese common founder mutations previously. The clinical characteristics (e.g., subtype and nuclear grade of resultant cancer) of breast cancer patients with L63X might differ from those in patients with other BRCA mutations, however, the elevation of ovarian or breast cancer risk was not detected. After excluding L63X founder mutation, the proportion of patients with a family history of ovarian cancer and germline BRCA1 mutations outside the OCCR was lower and the proportion of patients with a family history of breast cancer and germline BRCA1 mutations within the OCCR was relatively lower. There are, relatively, many reports that BRCA carriers with common founder mutations have different risks of developing breast and ovarian cancer compared with the overall BRCA1/2 mutation, however, the results of only a few common founder mutations have been validated by multiple studies. Since the frequency of specific common founder mutations in each population varies, so does the number of breast and ovarian cancer patients who carry the mutation. In other words, 185delAG in the Ashkenazi Jewish population can be analyzed in many breast and ovarian cancer cases, so it is possible to analyze the risk of developing cancer relatively easily. However, sufficient statistical power is often not obtained in the analysis of other common founder mutations. BRCA genetic testing has become a companion diagnostic for PARP inhibitors, and the number of families with germline BRCA mutation identified is growing rapidly. Therefore, it is expected that analysis of the risk of developing cancer will be possible in a large number of mutant carriers, and there is a possibility that personal and precision medicine for carriers with specific common founder mutations will be realized.\n\n    Ten-year cumulative contralateral Breast Cancer (CBC) risks were 21.1% for BRCA1, 10.8% for BRCA2 mutation carriers and 5.1% for non-carriers. On the other hand, the 15-year actuarial risk of CBC was 36.1% for BRCA1 carriers and was 28.5% for BRCA2 carriers. The average cumulative risks by age 70 years for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers were estimated to be 83% and 62% for CBC.\n\n    Tai et al. reported that the cumulative risks of male breast cancer were higher in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers than in non-carriers at all ages. The relative risks of developing breast cancer were highest for men in their 30s and 40s. Both the relative and cumulative risks were higher for BRCA2 carriers than for BRCA1 carriers. The estimated cumulative risk of breast carcinoma for male BRCA1 mutation carriers at age 70 years was 1.2% and for BRCA2 mutation carriers, 6.8%. In addition, both retrospective and prospective analyses confirmed that breast cancer risk in men was 7.1% by age 70 years and 8.4% by age 80 years in BRCA2 carriers. Struewing et al. reported that four (3.6%) and fifteen (13.6%) of 110 Israeli Jewish male breast cancer patients carried the BRCA1 185delAG and BRCA2 6174delT founder mutation, respectively, but not BRCA1 5382insC. Lubinski et al. reported that a high risk of male breast cancer was observed with the BRCA2 6503delTT mutation (OR = 15.7; p = 0.023).\n\n    Based on previously estimated population frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, it was estimated that BRCA1 mutations confer a relative risk of prostate cancer of approximately 3.7-fold and 8.6-fold, which translates to an 8.6% and 15% cumulative risk by age 65 years. A recent meta-analysis revealed that the relative risk of prostate cancer is 1.35-fold and 2.64-fold in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, respectively. Overall survival was significantly worse among germline BRCA2 carriers compared to non-carriers. BRCA2-related prostate cancer has been associated with a higher histologic grade and results in a poorer overall survival. It was reported that BRCA2, in particular, confers a more aggressive phenotype with a higher probability of locally advanced and metastatic disease, and should be considered a prognostic marker associated with poorer survival. Agalliu et al. reported that BRCA2 mutation confers a 3-fold elevated risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Although BRCA1 mutations were not associated with prostate cancer, the BRCA1 185delAG was associated with high Gleason score tumors.\n\n    Several studies reported that BRCA2 carriers had higher relative and cumulative risks of pancreatic cancer compared to BRCA1 carriers. Recently, Mocci et al. reported that BRCA1 carriers were at increased risk of pancreatic cancer [standardized incidence ratios (SIR) = 4.11] as were BRCA2 carriers (SIR = 5.79) in a retrospective cohort analysis. A prospective study of 5,149 females with BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers showed a significant 2.4-fold increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer and the increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer was similar for BRCA1 (SIR = 2.55) and BRCA2 (SIR = 2.13). Among unselected pancreatic cancer patient cohorts, multiple studies have shown to estimate the incidence of germline BRCA mutations ranged from 0.7-5.7% for BRCA2 and 0.3-2.3% for BRCA1. Of the 145 Jewish pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients, 8 patients (5.5%) were found to have BRCA mutations, 6 patients (4.1%) carried a BRCA2 mutation (6174delT) and 2 patients (1.3%) carried a BRCA1 mutation (185delAG and 5382insC).\n\n    A few studies suggest that melanoma risk, both cutaneous and ocular, may be elevated in some families with BRCA2 carriers. Moran et al. reported that an increased risk for ocular melanoma in BRCA2 carriers in 490 BRCA-mutated families.\n\n    Previous studies suggested that endometrial serous adenocarcinoma is not BRCA-related cancer and is more associated with tamoxifen exposure than with the effects of germline BRCA mutations. Recently, in a prospective cohort study of BRCA carriers who received only RRSO, not hysterectomy, endometrial cancer developed in eight patients in a median follow-up of 5.1 years, with no apparent increased risk after RRSO, on the other hand, BRCA1 carriers had an increased risk of endometrial serous adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, a large Dutch nationwide cohort study revealed that BRCA1/2 carriers have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for endometrial cancer, with the highest risk observed for the rare subgroups of serous-like and p53-abnormal endometrial cancer in BRCA1 carriers.",

        "Conclusion": "    Although there are various discussions, there appear to be differences in ovarian cancer risk by ethnicity and BRCA mutation types. These mutation-specific risks coincide with known or hypothesized functional domains and provide a basis around which accurate risk estimates can be generated for women who have inherited a particular BRCA1/2 mutation. While RRSO is certain to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, there are some concerns about reducing the risk of breast cancer. In a prospective cohort study, Kauff et al. reported that RRSO did not significantly reduce the breast cancer risk in BRCA1 carriers. However, the latest meta-analysis has shown a significant reduction in breast cancer risk and overall mortality rate, regardless of the past history of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer does not appear to be different between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.\n\n    The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines state that the age at RRSO should be based on the earlier age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer patients in the family. If it becomes possible to estimate the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer and the age of onset disease for each BRCA mutation type, the age at RRSO can be determined individually. Solsky et al. reported that for BRCA1/2 carriers who delayed RRSO or who were identified with a mutation later in life, the OCCR mutation tended to be associated with lower life expectancy estimates than the BCCR and non-BCCR/OCCR mutations, so BRCA1/2 cluster regions may provide more precise estimates of life expectancy in counseling and shared decision-making. The decision would bring great benefits to young women with BRCA mutations, so we hope that a lot of verifiable research will be undertaken.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

        "Title": "    Spectrum of BRCA1/2 Mutations in Romanian Breast and Ovarian Cancer Patients",
        "Abstract": "    Background: About 10,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and about 2000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in Romania. There is an insufficient number of genetic studies in the Romanian population to identify patients at high risk of inherited breast and ovarian cancer. Methods: We evaluated 250 women of Romanian ethnicity with BC and 240 women of Romanian ethnicity with ovarian cancer for the presence of damaging germline mutations in breast cancer genes 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively) using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Results: Of the 250 breast cancer patients, 47 carried a disease-predisposing BRCA mutation (30 patients (63.83%) with a BRCA1 mutation and 17 patients (36.17%) with a BRCA2 mutation). Of the 240 ovarian cancer patients, 60 carried a BRCA mutation (43 patients (72%) with a BRCA1 mutation and 17 patients (28%) with a BRCA2 mutation). In the BRCA1 gene, we identified 18 variants (4 in both patient groups (ovarian and breast cancer patients), 1 mutation variant in the BC patient group, and 13 mutation variants in the ovarian cancer patient group). In the BRCA2 gene, we identified 17 variants (1 variant in both ovarian and breast cancer patients, 6 distinct variants in BC patients, and 10 distinct variants in ovarian cancer patients). The prevailing mutation variants identified were c.3607C>T (BRCA1) (18 cases) followed by c.5266dupC (BRCA1) (17 cases) and c.9371A>T (BRCA2) (12 cases). The most prevalent mutation, BRCA1 c.3607C>T, which is less common in the Romanian population, was mainly associated with triple-negative BC and ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: The results of our analysis may help to establish specific variants of BRCA mutations in the Romanian population and identify individuals at high risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome by genetic testing.",
        "Introduction": "    According to Globocan, breast cancer (BC) in women is the most common cancer in the world, both in terms of incidence and mortality, and the incidence of BC is estimated to increase to approximately 33.8% of newly diagnosed cases by 2040. The same trend can be observed in ovarian cancer (OC), with an estimated increase in new cases of 36.6% by 2040, despite the advances in diagnostic techniques and the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. The multifactorial etiology of breast and ovarian cancer is responsible for this dire situation. Both environmental and genetic factors are included. The lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer is 45-80% in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations are associated with an aggressive BC course (the triple-negative breast cancer subtype especially) and advanced OC. According to a recent study, pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes confer a high risk of BC, contralateral BC, and OC. The average cumulative risk for BRCA1 carriers was estimated to be 60% for BC, 59% for OC, and 83% for contralateral BC. For BRCA2 carriers, the cumulative risk was estimated to be 55% for BC, 16.5% for OC, and 62% for contralateral BC.\n\n    The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations varies between ethnic groups and geographical areas. At present, the up-to-date BRCA Exchange database contains descriptions of more than 2100 pathogenic mutation variants in the BRCA1 gene and more than 2600 pathogenic mutation variants in the BRCA2 gene.\n\n    The spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene alterations includes frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations altering protein functions, splice mutations leading to truncation, and large rearrangements. Founder mutations have been described in certain geographical areas by ethnic communities, such as Ashkenazi Jews and Icelandic, Dutch, Turkish, and Polish populations. In Romania, BC is the most common female malignancy with an annual incidence of about 10,000 new cases and 3300 deaths. In addition, about 2000 women are diagnosed with OC each year and about 1100 women with OC die of this disease each year. To date, only a few surveys on BRCA1/2 mutations in Romanian patients with breast and ovarian cancer have been published. The lack of a sufficient number of genetic studies in the Romanian population prevents us from developing an effective mutation screening tool that could identify patients at high risk of inherited breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n    Our goal in the present study was to identify the BRCA1/2 germline mutations in a cohort of 250 Romanian patients with BC and the BRCA1/2 germline/somatic mutations in 240 women with OC that satisfy the recognized international criteria for testing. This is one of the first comprehensive studies to determine the contribution of BRCA1/2 germline mutations to BC and OC development in the Romanian population.",
        "Methods": "    Our study is a retrospective analysis of 250 patients with BC and 240 patients with OC diagnosed and treated at The Oncology Institute \"Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta\" Cluj-Napoca, Romania (OICN) from 2014 to 2019. All patients were of Romanian ethnicity. The clinical information (age, tumor grade and stage, luminal status, and surgical treatment), pathology reports, and family history were obtained from the patient/hospital registry. All patients were tested following the recognized Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium (BCLC) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria (breast cancer before 40 years of age, triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 50, or having a conventional family history of breast cancer).\n\n    The screening of BRCA genes for mutations was performed using genomic DNA from blood samples using the Purelink Genomic DNA kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\n    The DNA was then evaluated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and concentrations between 10 and 158 ng/microL with 260/280 ratios of 1.5-2 were obtained. The quantified DNA was further used for sequencing library preparation using the Ion Ampliseq Community BRCA1_BRCA2 primer kit consisting of 167 amplicons to analyze the coding regions of both BRCA1/2 genes. For each sample, 10 ng/microL of DNA was used. To obtain the library's amplicons, the following protocol was used. In the first PCR, we added 1 microL of AmpliSeq HiFi Master Mix, 3.5 microL of the primers of one of the three pools from the Ion Ampliseq Community BRCA1_BRCA2 kit, 1 microL of 10 ng/microL DNA, and 1.5 microL of nuclease-free water. The same amounts were used for each of the three pools of primers, so each sample had three PCR reactions. The program used for the PCR was: 1 cycle for 2 min at 99  C, 20 cycles for 1 s at 99  C and 4 min at 60  C, and 1 cycle at 10  C with an indefinite hold. After this PCR, the three reactions for each sample were put together in a new tube, 2 microL of FuPa reagent was added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 50  C, 10 min at 55  C, 20 min at 60 , and a maximum of 60 min at 10  C. In the next step, we added 4 microL of Swich solution, 2 microL of 1:4 diluted Ion Express Barcodes, and 2 microL of Ligase. The mixture was further incubated for 30 min at 22  C, 5 min at 65  C, 5 min at 72  C, and a maximum of 60 min at 10  C. After this step, the libraries were purified using Agencourt AmPure Beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted in 40 microL of Platinum Polymerase and 1.6 microL of primers. Then, the mixture was incubated in a PCR with the following program: 2 min at 98  C, 5 cycles at 98  C for 15 sec and 64  C for 1 min, and 1 cycle at 10  C with an indefinite hold. After this PCR step, a two-step purification of the PCR products was performed using Agencourt AmPure Beads.\n\n    The libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 and the Qubit HS DNA Kit. All libraries were diluted to a concentration of 100 pM. Template preparation was performed using the Ion One Touch 200 OT2 Template kit (Applied Biosystems) with the Ion One Touch 2 System (Life Technologies). After the emulsion PCR, the libraries were enriched using the same kit as for the template preparation, together with the Ion One Touch ES apparatus. The enriched libraries were sequenced on 316 chips (8 libraries/chip) using the Ion PGM 200 sequencing kit and the Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies). After sequencing, the data were analyzed using the Torrent Suite and the Ion Reporter 5.0 software. The obtained mutations were verified in the ENIGMA, BIG, and ClinVar databases in order to identify the pathogenicity class for each mutation.\n\n    For the validation of the first 40 samples, the DNA from the first 40 samples was sent to Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, where it was analyzed using the MiSeq platform (Illumina) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.\n\n    For the evaluation of the Copy Number Variation and other large chromosomal variations for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, we used the SALSA MLPA probe mix P-002-D1 BRCA1 and SALSA MLPA probe mix P045-B3 BRCA2/CHEK2 reagents from MRC Holland. For the MLPA reactions, we used the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer and 150 ng of DNA for each sample. The fragment analysis was performed on an ABI-Prism 310 Capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems), and the fragment analysis was performed using the free Coffalyser software provided by MRC Holland.\n\n    All the Class 3 and 5 mutations identified in the studied samples were validated by Sanger Sequencing using specific primers/assays from Thermo Scientific for each identified mutation. The PCR for the amplification of specific target regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was performed using PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) and 30-60 ng of DNA. After the initial PCR, the mixture was purified with CleanSweep PCR Purification reagent (Applied Biosystems) and the amplicons were quantified using Qubit 2.0. In the BigDye Termination reaction, we used 20 ng of amplicons and the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) with its specific protocol. After this reaction, the mixture was purified using the BigDye XTerminator Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After the purification reaction, 20 microL of the mixture was analyzed on the ABI-Prism 310 Capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The data obtained were transformed into FASTA files using the Chromas software and the FASTA files were analyzed using the MEGA 7 and Genome Browser software.\n\n    For the ovarian cancer cohort, we used two types of biological samples (blood and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue). The genomic DNA from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was extracted using the Code 405 MagCore  Genomic DNA FFPE One-Step Kit (RBC Bioscience) kit and the MagCore HF16 automate platform, and the genomic DNA from blood samples was extracted using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey&Nagel). Next-Generation Sequencing library preparation was performed using the Accel-Amplicon  BRCA1, BRCA2 panel (Swift Biosciences), which covers all the coding regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, including exon-intron junctions. Sequencing was performed on the MiSeq Next-Generation Sequencing benchtop (Illumina). After sequencing, the data were analyzed using the BWM-MEM algorithm for alignment and the GATK algorithm for variance characterization using the ClinVar, OMIM, 1000GENOMES, GnomeAD, Varsome, LOVD, BIC, and INVITAE databases using the NSClinical software. For missense mutations, the mutations were also analyzed in silico using the \"dbNSFP\" program.\n\n    The MLPA Analysis Was Performed Using the SALSA MLPA Probe mix P002 BRCA1 kit (MRC Holland) and the ABI3130xl Genetic Analyzer\n\n    The obtained data were analyzed using the Coffalyser.Net (MRC Holland) software.\n\n    The mutations identified were classified (into 5 classes) by consulting the ClinVar, BIC, and ENIGMA consortium databases. All patients included in this study previously signed a general institutional informed consent form for genetic testing. The study design was evaluated and approved by the Ethics Committee of OICN and the \"Iuliu Hatieganu\" (the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca Ethics Committee). Descriptive statistics were obtained in order to group subjects by categories such as age, histopathology subtype, tumor grade, stage of the disease, and surgical intervention. In addition, BC patients were categorized by hormone receptor status, HER2 status, unilateral BC, and bilateral BC.",
        "Results": "    In this study, 250 Romanian BC patients and 240 Romanian patients with relapsed, high-grade, platinum-sensitive OC selected according to the established criteria were screened for mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes by direct sequencing.\n\n    In the BC group, the median age at diagnosis was 42 years (28-62 years old). A total of 57% of the patients (20 patients) were less than 40 years of age, 40% (14 patients) were between 41 and 60 years of age, and 3% (1 patient) were between 61 and 70 years of age.\n\n    In the OC group, the median age at diagnosis was 50 years (32-83 years old). A total of 7% of the patients were less than 40 years of age, 81% were between 41 and 60 years of age, and 12% were between 61 and 83 years of age.\n\n    The clinical and pathological characteristics of the BC and OC patients are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n    In the BC patient group, following NGS, we identified 47 (18.8%) BRCA mutation bearers. A total of 63.83% of these patients (30 patients) had BRCA1 mutations and 36.17% (17 patients) had BRCA2 mutations.\n\n    All the VUS and pathogenic mutations in the BC patient cohort were validated using Sanger sequencing.\n\n    The MLPA analysis of BC patients revealed that all the included patients had normal copy number variations, except for one patient that exhibited a CHEK2-9(10) deletion but no pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This deletion is considered to be a founder mutation in the Polish population.\n\n    Among the OC mutation carriers, we identified 43 patients (72%) that had BRCA1 mutations and 17 patients (28%) that had the BRCA2 mutation. The clinical characteristics of all selected cases are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n    Regarding BRCA mutations in BC patients, we identified 8 mutations in the BRCA1 gene and 11 mutations in the BRCA2 gene. The mutation types identified were as follows: four frameshift deletions (21.05%) (two BRCA1 mutations and two BRCA2 mutations), one frameshift insertion (5.27%) (a BRCA1 mutation), six nonsense mutations (in a nonfunctional protein) (31.59%) (two BRCA1 mutations and four BRCA2 mutations), four missense mutations (nucleotide insertions) (21.05%) (one BRCA1 mutation and three BRCA2 mutations), and four splice site mutations (21.05%) (two BRCA1 mutations and two BRCA2 mutations) (Table 3).\n\n    The BRCA1 mutational variants identified in the BC population that can be found in the HGVS database or the ClinVar database are the following.\n\n    In the BRCA1 gene, we identified two frameshift deletions, one frameshift insertion, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two splice site mutations.\n\n    The frameshift deletions c.4218delG (chr17:41234559) and c.68_69delAG (chr17:41276044), the frameshift insertion c.5266dupC (chr17:41209079), the two nonsense mutations c.3067C>T (chr17:41243941) and c.1687C>T (chr17:41245861), and the missense mutation c.181T>G (chr17:41258504) are BC/OC-causing mutations that have been previously reported in the literature (Table 4).\n\n    The two splice site mutations c.4485-1G>T (chr17:41226539) and c.212+1G>T (chr17:41258472) are classified as pathogenic by the ClinVar database.\n\n    The most prevalent mutation in the BC cohort was c.5266dupC (11 patients) (36.66%), followed by c.3067C>T (9 patients) (30%) and c.181T>G (4 patients) (13.33%).\n\n    The BRCA1 mutational variants identified in the OC population that can be found in the HGVS database are the following. DNA sequencing revealed a new mutation, c.(80+1_81-1)_(441+1_442-1)del, which we could not find in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) and Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) databases (it is listed as VUS in the BIC database), with an unknown pathogenic effect and 16 deleterious mutations, of which 7 were frameshift mutations (c.135-2A>G, c.2411_2412delAG, c.3700_3704delGTAAA, c.4065_4068delTCAA, c.4675+1G>C, c5266dupC (5382insC), and c.843_846delCTCA), 4 were nonsense mutations (c.1066C>T, c.1687C>T, c.1789G>T, and c.3607C>T), 1 was a single nucleotide variant (c.4986+3G>C), and 4 were missense mutations (c.181T>G, c.5497G>A, c.558A>G, and c.556T>G) (Table 5).\n\n    The most prevalent BRCA1 mutation was c.3607C>T 11 patients (26%), followed by c.5266dupC (5382insC) 8 patients (19%) and c.1687C>T and c.181T>G, each with an equal share of 9% (4 patients) (Table 5).\n\n    The BRCA2 mutational variants identified in the BC population that can be found in the HGVS database or the ClinVar database are the following. DNA sequencing revealed four nonsense mutations (c.4022C>G (chr13:32912514), c.1528G>T (chr13:32907143), c.8680C>T (chr13:32950854), and c.8695C>T (chr13:32950869)), three missense mutations (c.7007G>A (chr13:32921033), c.9371A>T (chr13:32968940), and c.8167G>C (chr13:32937506)), two frameshift deletions (c.9253delA (chr13:32954279) and c.5795_5796delAT (chr13:32914286)), and two splice site mutations (c.516+1G>A (chr13:32900420) and c.8755-1G>A (chr13:32953453)) (Table 6).\n\n    The most prevalent mutation in the BC population was c.9371A>T (seven patients) (41.17%). All the other identified pathogenic mutations were observed in only one patient.\n\n    Regarding BRCA mutations in OC patients, we identified 17 BRCA1 mutations and 11 BRCA2 mutations. In the BRCA gene, we identified the following mutations: 25 frameshift mutations (44%) (17 BRCA1 mutations and 8 BRCA2 mutations), 18 nonsense mutations (31%) (17 BRCA1 mutations and 1 BRCA2 mutation), 13 missense mutations (23%) (6 BRCA1 mutations and 7 BRCA2 mutations), and 1 single nucleotide variant mutation (2%) (1 BRCA1 mutation) (Table 7).\n\n    The BRCA2 mutational variants identified in the OC population that can be found in the HGVS database are the following. DNA sequencing revealed a new mutation, c.9658_9660delCCT, which has not been previously cited in the BIC and HGVS databases, with an unknown pathogenic effect (listed as VUS in the BIC database) and 10 deleterious mutations, of which 7 are frameshift mutations (c.1593delA, c.2435delA, c.3975_3978dupTGCT, c.5946delT, c.6267_6269delinsC, c.6839_6840insA, and c.8655dupA), 2 are missense mutations (c.9371A>T and c.3032C>G), and 1 is a nonsense mutation (c.3545_3546delTT) (Table 8).\n\n    The most prevalent BRCA2 mutation in ovarian cancer patients was c.9371A>T (six patients) (35%), followed by c.6839_6840insA (two patients) (Table 9).",
        "Conclusion": "    The results of this study are useful because they identify specific variants of the BRCA mutations in Romanian patients with BC and OC. This study should be continued by investigating the practical implications of these results, namely by establishing correlations between the identified mutational subtypes, the clinical and pathological characteristics, and the evolutionary course of the neoplastic diseases BC and OC.\n\n    The second practical application of these results is in the identification of individuals at high risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) by genetic testing.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    This is one of the first comprehensive studies to evaluate the contribution of BRCA1/2 germline mutations to BC and OC development in the Romanian population.\n\n    Eight distinct BRCA1 mutational variations were identified in our BC patient group. Of these, four known variations have previously been reported to be pathogenic and one new mutation was identified that does not belong to the BIC and HGVS databases (it is listed as VUS in the BIC database). All the BRCA1 mutations identified in the BC cohort were identified as being pathogenic in the ClinVar database.\n\n    The most frequently encountered BRCA1 mutation in our BC group was chr17:41209079 (c.5266dupC). A total of 11 patients (36.37%) harbored this mutation, of which 6 had TNBC. Nine patients (30%) were found to have a c.3067C>T mutation, of which six had TNBC.\n\n    In the OC group, the situation was almost the same for the two most prevalent mutations, except that the prevailing BRCA1 mutation was c.3607C>T (11 patients) (26%) followed by c.5266dupC (5382insC) (8 patients) (19%).\n\n    Some BRCA mutational variations were found with a similar incidence in patient populations in some Central-Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Turkey, Poland, the Czech Republic, Greece, and Belarus).\n\n    The third most prevalent BRCA1 mutation encountered in our BC patients, the missense variant c.181T>G, has been recognized as the second most frequent mutation in Poland and other European countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, and Belarus). In a recent study conducted by Dodova et al., the c.181T>G mutation was identified in Bulgarian breast cancer patients at a very low rate (two patients), and it was associated with early onset of the disease.\n\n    In our OC patients, the BRCA1 mutations c.181T>G and c.1687C>T were ranked fourth regarding prevalence. In our analysis, the c.181T>G mutation was found as a disease-causing mutation in four patients with TNBC and c.1687C>T was carried by two patients with TNBC and four patients with OC. These latter two mutations (c.181T>G and c.1687C>T) represent the main BRCA1 mutations in the Slovenian population with a frequency of 56% and 30%, respectively, and they are also found in South-Eastern Europe (Greece in particular). c.1687C>T also represents a common mutation prevalent in other European countries such as Austria and Sweden with a common founder ancestor.\n\n    Regarding the BRCA2 gene, we identified 11 different mutational variants in the BC patient cohort, all previously reported as being deleterious in the ClinVar database.\n\n    The most often encountered BRCA2 mutation in our BC group was the missense mutation chr13:32968940 (c.9371A>T) (seven patients (41.18%), of which only one had TNBC). This mutation has previously been identified in the Romanian population, but it is not very frequent in the populations around Romania. It was also the most prevalent BRCA2 mutation among the OC patients that we analyzed.\n\n    The BRCA2 mutation c.8680C>T (chr13:32950854) has also been previously described in the Romanian population and, in our analysis, it was associated with early onset of BC (36 years).\n\n    Another mutation that we found to be associated with the BRCA2 gene and is considered to be deleterious, c.7007G>A, is associated with abnormal splicing leading to premature translation and truncated proteins and was previously described in a Czech population.\n\n    We identified one new mutational variation, chr13:32912514 (c.4022C>G), that does not belong to the BIC and HGVS databases. c.4022C>G is implicated in FLNB-Related Spectrum Disorders, Joubert syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, \"Cutis laxa\" with severe pulmonary involvement, gastrointestinal and urinary abnormalities, and CC2D2A, PTCH1, LTBP4, and DMD-related disorders, but its significance is uncertain and its pathogenicity has conflicting interpretations. The BRCA2 mutational variant c.4022C>G has not been stated to be BC or OC pathogenic.\n\n    The identified BRCA mutational variants have no known association with an increased incidence of relapsed breast or ovarian cancer.\n\n    The mutation with the largest distribution across Eastern Europe is c.5263_5264insC. In our analyzed groups of patients with breast and ovarian cancer and BRCA mutations, this mutation was not observed.\n\n    Mutations that have been frequently observed in neighboring populations (e.g., the Bulgarian and Polish populations) and mutational variants reported as being specific to a particular population include the BRCA1 mutations 185delAG (c.66_67delAG) and 5382insC (c.5263_5264insC) and the BRCA2 mutation 6174delT (c.5946delT) in Ashkenazi Jews, the BRCA1 mutations c.4035delA, C61G (c.-58C>G), and 5382insC (c.5263_5264insC) in a Polish population with familial breast cancer, the BRCA1 mutations c.303T>G, c.5324T>G, c.1623dupG, and c.4122_4123delTG in patients of African descent with familial breast cancer, the BRCA1 mutation Ex9-12del in Latin American, particularly Mexican, patients with familial breast and ovarian cancer, the BRCA2 mutation c.7480C>T in Korean patients with familial breast cancer, the BRCA1 mutation 5382insC (c.5263_5264insC) in Bulgarian patients with breast and ovarian cancer, and 5266dupC in the Trakya region of Turkey.\n\n    In conclusion, in our study, we identified 19 BRCA gene mutational variants, namely 8 BRCA1 variations and 11 BRCA2 variations, 4 of which were found in both groups of patients (ovarian and breast cancer patients). One particular mutation variant was found in the BC patient group and thirteen particular mutation variants were found in the OC patient group. We identified 17 BRCA2 variants (1 variant was discovered in both ovarian and breast cancer patients, 6 distinct variants were discovered in BC patients, and 10 distinct variants were discovered in OC patients).\n\n    The small number of BRCA1/2-positive BC and OC patients could be considered a limitation regarding the association between the BRCA1/2 mutational variations and the clinical features. This will be addressed in a further study, in which we will expand the patient cohort in order to obtain more significant clinical correlations and an increase in the statistical impact.\n\n    The prevailing mutation variants were identified to be c.3607C>T (BRCA1) (20 cases), c.5266dupC (BRCA1) (19 cases), and c.9371A>T (BRCA2) (13 cases) (Table 9).",

        "Title": "    Overview on population screening for carriers with germline BRCA mutation in China",
        "Abstract": "    Carriers with BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic variants are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancers (also pancreatic and prostate cancers). While the spectrum on germline BRCA mutations among the Chinese population shows ethnic specificity, the identification of carriers with germline BRCA mutation before cancer onset is the most effective approach to protect them. This review focused on the current status of BRCA1/2 screening, the surveillance and prevention measures, and discussed the issues and potential impact of BRCA1/2 population screening in China. We conducted literature research on databases PubMed and Google Scholar, as well as Chinese databases CNKI and Wangfang Med Online database (up to 31 March 2022). Latest publications on germline BRCA1/2 prevalence, spectrum, genetic screening as well as carrier counseling, surveillance and prevention were captured where available. While overall 15,256 records were retrieved, 72 publications using germline BRCA1/2 testing were finally retained for further analyses. Germline BRCA1/2 mutations are common in Chinese patients with hereditary breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Within previous studies, a unique BRCA mutation spectrum in China was revealed. Next-generation sequencing panel was considered as the most common method for BRCA1/2 screening. Regular surveillance and preventive surgeries were tailored to carriers with mutated-BRCA1/2. We recommend that all Chinese diagnosed with breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancers and also healthy family members, shall undergo BRCA1/2 gene test to provide risk assessment. Subsequently, timely preventive measures for mutation carriers are recommended after authentic genetic counseling.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes that function in DNA double-strand break repair in the homologous recombination pathway. Mutated BRCA1/2 genes can cause BRCA1/2 protein deficiency and genome instability. Since the identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the 1990s as the landmarks of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, human beings enter the era of cancer genetic testing. Female BRCA mutation carriers have 60-80% of lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and 20-40% of risk of ovarian cancer. Mutation in BRCA is also associated with an increased risk of prostate and pancreatic cancers. In addition, BRCA pathogenic mutation carriers are significantly associated with increased disease risk for three additional cancers, including biliary tract cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer. Notably, BRCA1 pathogenic variants carriers have a 4.30, 2.36 and 2.17-fold elevated lifetime risk of the male breast, pancreatic and stomach cancers compared to non-carriers. BRCA2 pathogenic variants carriers have 44.0, 3.69, 3.34 and 2.22-fold elevated lifetime risk of the male breast, stomach, pancreatic and prostate cancers compared to non-carriers, respectively.\n\n    Early detection and prevention have been proven to reduce cancer incidence and mortality (while increasing cancer survival) in mutation carriers. Therefore, identifying BRCA mutation carriers is important to reduce cancer risk. In this review, we conducted literature research on PubMed, Google Scholar and Chinese databases about germline BRCA1/2 mutation in the Chinese populations included literature published up to 31 March 2022. A total of 15,256 publications were obtained: PubMed (n=856), Google Scholar (n=6,153), CNKI (n=4,935) and Wangfang Med Online database (n=3,312). After removing duplicates, selecting the title and the abstract and carefully reading the whole paper, 72 publications related to germline BRCA1/2 testing were finally included. Based on the comprehensive literature review, we discuss population screening approaches for comprehensive identification of the BRCA mutation carriers in the Chinese population and propose the ideal procedure for achieving the goals in China ( Figure 1 ).\n\n    In the general Chinese population, the prevalence of pathogenic BRCA1/2 variation has been reported to range from 0.29 to 1.10% (0.02 to 0.34% for BRCA1 and 0.11 to 0.27% for BRCA2).\n\n    The prevalence of BRCA1/2 in the general population varies by country and ethnicity. It was 0.18% in a Malaysian group of 2,809 individuals, 0.26% among 22,731 Japanese, 0.38% in a Mexican population of 3,985 individuals, 0.53% in 50,726 US people and 2.17% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, which is the highest. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutation in the general Chinese population is intermediate.\n\n    The spectrum of BRCA variation in Chinese is rather different from those in non-Chinese populations. It was reported that approximately 38-41.4% of BRCA variants were only present in the Chinese population. Even when compared to neighboring India, only 4.1% and 0.4% of shared BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants were found in both populations.\n\n    In a large-scale cohort with 1,245 pathogenic variants identified, 48 most common pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants (39.86% of total) were not reported as common variants in Caucasians. The pathogenic variant BRCA1 c.5470_5477del was determined as a founder mutation in the Chinese Han population. Interestingly, another systematic review with 2,128 BRCA1/2 variants derived from 35,178 Chinese individuals from 23 provinces also reported that c.5470_5477del ranked as the highest frequency of all BRCA1 variants identified while the c.3109C>T ranks highest in BRCA2. Further, BRCA1 c.3770_3771delAG was the most common variant in Chinese ovarian cancer patients. The proportions of frameshift, nonsense, splice and missense mutations in Chinese ovarian cancer patients were determined as 51.2%, 39.3%, 7.1% and 2.4%, respectively. But the founder mutations in other ethnic populations, such as BRCA1 c.66_67delAG, BRCA2 c.5946delT in Ashkenazi Jewish, BRCA 1 c.303T>G, c.1623dupG in African, BRCA1 c.390C>A in Japanese and Korean and many other founder mutations in different non-Chinese populations, were absent or at low prevalence in Chinese population.\n\n    We summarized the prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutation in different populations from large-scale cohort studies published within five years ( Table 1 ). A total of 41 studies were included for further analysis.\n\n    In the Chinese cancer patients, a study showed that the prevalence rate was 5.53% for BRCA1/2 (43.7% in BRCA1 and 56.3% in BRCA2) in unselected breast cancer patients. In comparison, a higher prevalence of 9.06-19.54% for BRCA1/2 mutation was observed in familial breast cancer patients. 60% of breast cancer patients carrying BRCA1 deleterious mutation were classified as triple-negative breast cancer, while only 10 to 20% were triple-negative breast cancer in unselected cancer patients. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutated breast cancer generally show an earlier age of onset, on average 5 to 8 years earlier than patients with sporadic breast cancer. BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants are also enriched in bilateral breast cancer and patients with family history of breast or other cancers. In unselected ovarian cancer patients, BRCA1 pathogenic variants were more common compared to BRCA2 (20.07% vs. 6.19%). Pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 genes were more related to a younger diagnosis age, serous ovarian carcinoma and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). Among prostate cancer patients carrying germline mutations, BRCA2 is the most common mutated gene among DNA damage repair pathway genes. The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants was 0.38% and 4.30%, respectively, in prostate cancer patients. BRCA2 was also reported as the most frequent gene in the germline in pancreatic cancer patients, with a prevalence rate of 1.9%; the frequency of BRCA1 variants was 0.5%. However, there is a lack of multicenter studies on BRCA mutations in pancreatic cancer. It is worth noting that the actual prevalence may be higher than what is now predicted because the data for pathogenic variants interpretation are mainly from non-Chinese populations. In addition, most of the studies summarized in the  Table 1  examined only single nucleotide variants and indels and did not detect mutations of large genomic rearrangements (LGRs). It is possible that many unknown pathogenic variants have not been identified.\n\n    Despite increasing data from large-scale and multicenter BRCA studies having been reported, no BRCA data is reported for the Chinese living in many remote areas. Most BRCA1/2 prevalence studies were from cities with relatively developed economies and medical care, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. Possibly because genetic testing is not yet covered by basic medical insurance, patients in economically developed regions are more likely to afford expensive genetic testing. Meanwhile, economically and medically developed regions have more medical resources, such as genetic testing facilities and genetic counseling services. The bias is also because these regions have more investigators and research funds and are more likely to conduct clinical studies. However, considering the regional and ethnic specificity of BRCA gene variation, substantial efforts are needed to generate a comprehensive BRCA variation map for the Chinese population.",
        "Methods": "    In the mid-1990s, the identification of the relationship between BRCA1/2 mutation and cancer risk heralded the era of genetic testing for susceptibility to cancer. Subsequently, germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were extensively studied in the Caucasian populations, and associations with breast and ovarian cancers were established. Sanger sequencing has been widely used in BRCA variant identification since the 1990s, but the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) revolutionized the detection strategy due to its affordability and efficiency.\n\n    NGS, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES) and panel sequencing, have facilitated BRCA mutation research. Also because of the policy support in 2015, large-scale BRCA studies in China have increased rapidly since then. Due to the lack of hotspot variation, NGS is currently the optimal option for BRCA1/2 genetic testing in the Chinese population. NGS panel test is widely implemented for clinical BRCA test in China in recent years. The two-gene panel is a more preferred option for the general population, breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients, while pancreatic, prostate and other cancer patients tend to be suggested with the multi-gene panel in China ( Tables 1 ,  2 ).\n\n    Because of its accuracy, Sanger sequencing remains to be a gold standard for detecting BRCA variants and validating NGS-detected BRCA variants and can be used in confirming the findings. Practical test- and laboratory-specific criteria have been proposed for confirmation strategy to facilitate timely delivery of clinical accuracy.\n\n    Many studies involving different populations have shown that LGRs in BRCA1/2 can be identified in HBOC. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a cheap, sensitive and reliable method for detecting gene rearrangements. In the eastern Chinese population, 2.9% of HBOC patients without detectable BRCA1/2 small pathogenic variants were identified harboring LGRs in BRCA. The data are similar to those from the Myriad data set with high-risk patients, most of whom were diagnosed with early-onset ovary cancer or male breast cancer. The study reported an overall BRCA1/2 mutation rate of 23.8%, of which 9.9% were LGRs. Thus, large genomic rearrangement testing is recommended if the NGS result is negative for high-risk populations to avoid the missed diagnosis of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.\n\n    NGS panel, the recommended method for BRCA1/2 testing in clinical practice, still has some problems. First, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) increase with testing a larger panel or increasing genome sequencing length, making BRCA1 and BRCA2 interpretation more complex. For example, 24.7% of variants reported in the general population and 43.8% reported in breast cancer were identified as VUS, respectively. Classification of VUS as pathogenic or benign variants has important clinical implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment. The methods to identify VUS as pathogenic or benign need to become more efficient and accurate, considering the huge abundance of VUS. BRCA1/2 variants interpretation mainly follows the Chinese expert consensus on BRCA1/2 variant interpretation (2021 version) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guideline in China.\n\n    Nevertheless, the population, disease-specific and sequence databases commonly used for interpretation contain few Chinese or Asian data. Lacking Chinese ethnic-specific data makes variant interpretation highly reliant on the peer-reviewed literature, which is also limited. This challenging context prevents many pathogenic variants from being identified and the VUS increases even more. Suggesting a new classification system for Chinese is needed, including but not limited to the databases based on Chinese populations and biological function identification of Chinese specific variants. Chinese Familial & Hereditary Cancer Susceptibility Gene Mutation Database (CFCSG-database) is one of the biggest cancer susceptibility gene mutation databases based on Chinese population. But the amount of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants is still limited in it. More large-scale population studies and function studies of BRCA1/2 mutation in Chinese are needed to obtain more evidence to optimize the mutation interpretation.\n\n    As new shreds of evidence accumulate, the variant classification could be change over time. A study of 21,216 Breast cancer patients and 6,434 healthy controls performed VUS reclassification in the cohort. After the reclassification, 7 VUS were re-grouped into benign, which reduced the VUS ratio in both patient and healthy control (from 9.8 to 7.9% and from 6.9 to 5.3%), indicating that the evidence should frequently be updated for VUS reclassification, and emphasizing the VUS carriers should be followed up.\n\n    Another notable issue concerns the price of BRCA mutation testing. Currently the price of BRCA mutation testing for a single sample in China is roughly 300 dollars ($), which is only paid by the patient side and not covered by the government side through basic medical insurance. Actually, the price of a single BRCA mutation testing is too high for the majority of ordinary Chinese. Therefore, financial investment from the Chinese government side is necessary to promote the widespread of BRCA mutation testing across China, e. g., Chinese government could offer reimbursement through Chinese basic medical insurance system for the high-risk population who took BRCA mutation testing. Additionally, evidence shows population-based BRCA mutation screening is also cost-effective for Chinese data with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $18,066 from a societal perspective and $23,485 from a payer perspective per quality-adjusted life year.\n\n    In fact, while these issues are prominent in China, they also exist in many other countries and need to be addressed through collective efforts.\n\n    Currently, the principles of BRCA mutation detection in China mainly refers to the guideline on next-generation sequencing-based BRCA1/2 testing (2019), the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, as well as other Chinese expert consensus on specific cancers or genetic testing (summarized in  Table 2 ). We summarized the criteria proposed in 10 different guidelines and consensuses for Chinese population BRCA screening in recent 5 years.\n\n    Genetic counseling is essential in pre- and post-sequencing stage for the test individuals. The purpose is to accurately estimate the probability of cancer susceptibility gene mutations and offer early prevention advice and medical management such as regular surveillance, chemoprevention or surgical prevention for BRCA mutation carriers. In a study with 839 breast cancer patients and 510 relatives, who are considered high-risk populations, 86.4% and 63.8% cases showed a strong willingness to accept genetic counseling and genetic testing, respectively. For those high-risk populations who are willing to do the genetic testing of BRCA1/2, the mutation rate was 19.9%. Despite the high willingness, most of the high-risk individuals lacked knowledge of cancer inheritance. We are glad to find out that another study exhibited that 79% of germline mutation carriers were aware of the risk and the importance of surveillance, while 56% accepted preventive interferences after genetic counseling on gynecologic tumors.\n\n    However, the development of cancer genetic counseling in China is in its beginning. Unlike some developed countries where specialized and certified genetics health professionals are available, cancer genetic counseling relies heavily on clinicians. Setting up standardized workflows and training eligible counselors is pivotal for promoting genetic counseling in China. Although the \"oncologist-led BRCA consultation\" mode has improved access to cancer genetic testing in developing countries, specialized cancer genetic counselors are urgently needed. Organizations like the Chinese Board of Genetic Counseling and others are now dedicated to training genetic counselors in more than 15 provinces across China. Meanwhile, the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association is urging hospitals nationwide to set up cancer genetic counseling clinics to accommodate the increased demand for counseling. Still, the training projects and qualified counselors are minimal and lack statistics.\n\n    After genetic testing, the frequency of regular surveillance for female mutation carriers was significantly higher compared to non-carriers, according to the report on high-risk southern Chinese females.\n\n    Early-stage breast cancer lacks apparent signs and symptoms. Possible symptoms of breast cancer can be skin dimpling, red or thickening, nipple retraction and lymph nodes swelling. But a painless hard lump with irregular edges discovered accidentally by patients themselves is the most common early sign. Ninety-one percent of Chinese breast cancer patients had dense gland, which significantly affected the quality and effectiveness of palpation examination. For the surveillance of high-risk female carriers, in addition to regular breast self-examination and clinical breast examination, X-ray combined with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually selected as the methods recommended for women aged >40 years to detect early signs of breast cancer in China. Given that Chinese women have dense breasts and many younger patients with BRCA1/2 mutated breast cancer, mammography screening has a lower sensitivity. A prospective study comparing different screening methods for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations found the sensitivity of 77% with MRI compared with 36% with mammography and 33% with ultrasound.\n\n    Regular pelvic examination, tumor marker CA125 detection and transvaginal ultrasound are the methods recommended for detecting early signs of ovarian cancer. Annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination are recommended for prostate cancer screening and surveillance, especially for BRCA1 carriers. A study showed that multiparameter MRI has high diagnostic efficacy for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated prostate cancer patients. As soon as PSA elevation is detected, multiparameter MRI is recommended for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers aged >55 years for further diagnosis. Besides, annual imaging examinations can be considered to prevent pancreatic cancer for BRCA2 carriers, although the efficacy of this approach remains to be validated. The recommended starting age for monitoring breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer is 25, 30, 40 and 50 years, respectively, or ten years earlier than the earliest confirmed case in the family.\n\n    Many studies confirmed that for BRCA mutation carriers, chemoprevention or surgical prevention play an important role in reducing the occurrence of HBOC. In high-risk women, prophylactic mastectomy can reduce the incidence of breast cancer by 90% and the mortality rate by 81%. A study showed that 23.8% and 32% of patients chose prophylactic mastectomy and prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy; more than 17% of healthy carriers also had prophylactic surgery in Hongkong, China. In mainland China, however, healthy carriers and surgeons are more cautious about choosing prophylactic surgery. Only one study reported that three healthy carriers with deleterious BRCA1/2 variant underwent prophylactic nipple-sparing mastectomy. Breast cancer patients carrying BRCA1/2 deleterious variants had a 4.52-fold and 5.54-fold increased risk of contra-lateral breast cancer, respectively, compared to non-carriers. Preventive contra-lateral prophylactic mastectomy can be an optimal selection for BRCA1/2 mutated breast cancer patients in China. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, which can significantly reduce the risk of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers, is recommended for high-risk women after childbirth to prevent ovarian cancer.\n\n    Studies found that BRCA1/2-mutated patients are more likely to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy. Since DNA damage caused by platinum-based drugs requires DNA homologous recombination for repair, the functional defects caused by mutations in the BRCA1/2 gene make tumor cells more sensitive to platinum-based drugs. The TNT phase III trial compared the efficacy between carboplatin and docetaxel in unselected advanced TNBC. In the germline BRCA1/2-mutated subgroup, the objective response rate with carboplatin was 2-fold higher than it with docetaxel (68% vs. 33%). Recently, cancer patients with BRCA mutation could be benefited from poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) targeted therapy due to the increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitor specifically causes the death of cancer cells with BRCA1/2 mutations through the \"synthetic lethal effect\". The OlympiA trial has confirmed the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer, while the OlympiAD trial, as well as many other phase III clinical trials, have proved the role of PARP inhibitors in advanced BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer. PARP inhibitors are widely used for BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer patients as maintenance therapy in China based on the results of several phase III trials, including SOLO-1, SOLO-2, PAOLA-1, PRIMA and NOVA. PARP inhibitor olaparib is recommended for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients based on the PROfound trial. The phase III PROfound study showed a more prolonged imaging-based progression-free survival in the olaparib group compared with the control group (median, 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months). PARP inhibitors are increasingly used to treat BRCA-mutated patients, but whether they can be used for prevention needs further investigation.\n\n    Chemoprevention for cancer-free BRCA1/2 carriers remains controversial. Only a small retrospective study has shown that tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, reduces the risk of breast cancer in healthy carriers of BRCA2 mutations by 62%. But it is unclear whether it has a preventive effect in BRCA1-mutated healthy carriers. The evidence is not enough to support tamoxifen as a prevention strategy for healthy BRCA1/2 mutated carriers. Oral contraceptives have proven preventive efficacy for ovarian cancer with a family history. However, it is controversial whether oral contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.",

        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Taken together, germline BRCA1/2 mutations are common in Chinese patients with hereditary breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Because of its ethnic specificity, the unique features in the spectrum of BRCA mutations have already been revealed but the extension of the sequencing efforts to the whole Chinese population remains yet to be achieved. Many Chinese consensuses today recommend BRCA1/2 genetic testing for cancer patients only. Regarding the prevalence in healthy populations, approximately one in every 300 healthy Chinese is a BRCA1/2 mutation carrier. BRCA mutation-related cancer is one of the most preventable cancers. Whether or not to perform population screening should not solely be based on cost-effectiveness but should also consider more non-cost factors such as social, political, public interest and patients' benefits. Under the current political and economic conditions in China, to achieve early prevention of BRCA mutation carriers, we recommend that the criteria be relaxed and all Chinese diagnosed with breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer, as well as healthy individuals with a clear family history, should undergo BRCA1/2 genetic testing to provide a risk assessment. Subsequently, preventive measures such as regular surveillance, chemoprevention or surgical prevention for mutation carriers are recommended after authentic genetic counseling.\n\n    Evidence had shown that relying on personal and family history may not be sufficient to determine the risk for BRCA1/2 variants. Population BRCA screening is considered the trend in the near future. Thus, a growing number of healthy individuals harboring pathogenic mutations can be identified for cancer prevention. Population screening for carriers with BRCA germline mutations in the Chinese population is highly warranted to promote prevention, early detection, early diagnosis, and timely treatment of BRCA mutation-related cancers, which may increase 5-year survival for BRCA mutation-related cancer patients. Also, the ethical, psychological and legal issues cannot be ignored.",

        "Title": "    Functional Homologous Recombination (HR) Screening Shows the Majority of BRCA1/2-Mutant Breast and Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines Are HR-Proficient",
        "Abstract": "    Cancer cells from patients who carry a disease-causing BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are incapable of repairing double-strand DNA breaks via the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway. As a consequence, these patients respond to platinum-based chemotherapy and Poly-[ADP-Ribose]-Polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). However, using a functional read-out for HR, we show that not all HR-deficient cell lines carry a BRCA1/2 mutation. Moreover, the majority of BRCA1/2-mutant cell lines are HR proficient, highlighting the importance of measuring the functional HR status. For almost all of the BRCA1/2-mutant HR proficient cell lines, we could explain the discrepant HR status. The observed reversion mechanisms predominantly acted on restoring the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation directly. Taken together, our results indicate that only determining BRCA1/2 mutation status may not suffice for selecting patients for platinum-based chemotherapy or PARPi. Moreover, for experimental approaches cell line functionality of HR should be assessed beforehand.\n\n    Tumors with a pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation are homologous recombination (HR)-deficient (HRD) and consequently sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy and Poly-[ADP-Ribose]-Polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). We hypothesized that functional HR status better reflects real-time HR status than BRCA1/2 mutation status. Therefore, we determined the functional HR status of 53 breast cancer (BC) and 38 ovarian cancer (OC) cell lines by measuring the formation of RAD51 foci after irradiation. Discrepancies between functional HR and BRCA1/2 mutation status were investigated using exome sequencing, methylation and gene expression data from 50 HR-related genes. A pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation was found in 10/53 (18.9%) of BC and 7/38 (18.4%) of OC cell lines. Among BRCA1/2-mutant cell lines, 14/17 (82.4%) were HR-proficient (HRP), while 1/74 (1.4%) wild-type cell lines was HRD. For most (80%) cell lines, we explained the discrepancy between functional HR and BRCA1/2 mutation status. Importantly, 12/14 (85.7%) BRCA1/2-mutant HRP cell lines were explained by mechanisms directly acting on BRCA1/2. Finally, functional HR status was strongly associated with COSMIC single base substitution signature 3, but not BRCA1/2 mutation status. Thus, the majority of BRCA1/2-mutant cell lines do not represent a suitable model for HRD. Moreover, exclusively determining BRCA1/2 mutation status may not suffice for platinum-based chemotherapy or PARPi patient selection.",
        "Introduction": "    Germline BRCA1/2 mutations underlie tumorigenesis in approximately 5-15% of all ovarian cancer (OC), 3% of all breast cancer (BC) and in 10-20% of all triple negative BC cases. The BRCA1/2 proteins play a pivotal role in the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) via the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Therefore, tumors with a pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation, in general, are HR deficient (HRD) and thus highly sensitive to Poly-[ADP-Ribose]-Polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and DSB-inducing chemotherapies, such as platinum-based compounds. However, HRD has also been observed in tumors without a germline BRCA1/2 mutation. According to a variety of HRD tests, approximately 20% of primary BC and up to 50% of OC are HRD and could thus also benefit from PARPi.\n\n    Unfortunately, resistance to PARPi has emerged as a new challenge in the clinic. Various resistance mechanisms exist and they can be classified into four categories: increased drug efflux, decreased PARP trapping, restoration of HR and stabilization of stalled replication forks. Resistance to PARPi is also associated with resistance to platinum-containing compounds, indicating overlapping mechanisms. A number of resistance mechanisms have been identified in pre-clinical genetic screens or in studies with patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). However, clinical evidence exists only for reversion mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes, causing restoration of the BRCA1/2 gene function.\n\n    In light of all this, accurately identifying patients who respond to PARPi treatment is imperative. Since not all patients with an HRD phenotype carry a mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, only screening these two genes will be insufficient for accurate stratification. In this respect, HRD causes specific mutational scars in the genome that can be detected via massive parallel sequencing, such as single base substitution (SBS) signatures 3 and 8 (SBS3 and SBS8), small insertion/deletion (ID) signature (ID6) and structural variant (SV) signatures 3 and 5 (SV3 for BRCA1-type cancers and SV5 for BRCA2-type cancers). However, these mutational scars will remain part of the genome despite evolving drug resistance due to HR restoration. Therefore, measuring HRD status via a functional assay is necessary for real-time HR status assessment and consequently monitoring drug resistance before and during treatment.\n\n    For pre-clinical studies, human cancer cell lines are the most commonly used model system. Although the caveats of cell line studies are well-known, such as cross-contamination and genetic drift, a well-described collection of cell lines is a valuable source of biological material for studying molecular mechanisms and to perform drug screening. With this in mind, we decided to determine the functional HR status in our large panel of BC (n = 53) and OC cell lines (n = 38) using our in-house developed RECAP assay.\n\n    We hypothesized that the functional HR status of cell lines would better reflect the real-time HR status of the cells at the time of testing than the original germline BRCA1/2 mutation status. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive characterization of our large collection of BC and OC cell lines to study the discrepancies between functional HR and BRCA1/2 mutation status as well as SBS signature 3. To study discrepancies in functional HRD and BRCA1/2 mutation status, we investigated exome sequencing, gene expression and methylation data for a panel of 50 known HRD genes.",
        "Methods": "    Fifty-three BC and thirty-eight OC cell lines (listed in Figure 1 and Figure 2 and Tables S1, S2 and S4) with confirmed identity and known origin were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% FBS (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) and penicillin/steptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37  C and 5% CO2.\n\n    A2780 and A2780 (ECACC) as well as SKOV3 and SKOV3 (ECACC) are the same cell line, except they have a different origin (academic versus commercial, respectively). A2780 ADR and A2780 CIS are derived from the commercial line and were challenged once a month with 100 nM doxorubicin and 1 mM cisplatin, respectively. COV362.4 is a subclone of COV362 established by agar cloning. OCUB-F is a subclone of OCUB-M and was established by passaging non-adherent cells only. UWB1.289 is a BRCA1-null cell line, while UWB1.289+BRCA1 is an isogenic line stably transfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid containing a wild-type BRCA1 cDNA. The culture medium of UWB1.289+BRCA1 was supplemented with 200 microg/mL geneticin (G418 Sulfate; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to maintain selection pressure for transfected cells.\n\n    COV413A and COV413B, PEA1 and PEA2, PEO1 and PEO4, as well as PEO14 and PEO23 were cell line pairs derived from the same patient at different time points. COV413A and COV413B were derived from a colon and bladder dome metastasis, respectively. PEA1 was established from the treatment-naive primary tumor, whereas PEA2 was established from the same tumor after developing platinum resistance 6 months after treatment. PEO1 was derived from the patient's first platinum-sensitive relapse and PEO4 from a platinum-resistant relapse. PEO4 has a secondary BRCA2 reversion mutation that restores the original BRCA2 mutation that was present in PEO1. PEO14 was derived from the original treatment-naive tumor, whereas PEO23 was derived from the platinum-resistant relapse.\n\n    Genomic DNA from cell lines was isolated using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The quality and quantity of the DNA was verified using NanoDrop 2000 measurement (A260/A280 = 1.8-2.0), gel electrophoresis (DNA length >= 10 kb) and Qubit measurement (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each cell line, 250 ng of genomic DNA was used for library preparation using the Lotus  DNA Library Prep Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, IA, USA). Enzymatic fragmentation and adapter ligation were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, while the final library amplification step was performed using KAPA HiFi polymerase instead of the polymerase supplied with the kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). DNA libraries were verified on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the DNA1000 chip and pooled per 6 samples (500 ng per cell line totaling to a pooled library of 3 microg). Subsequent exome capture was performed using the xGEN Exome Research Panel v1.0 (IDT) using the manufacturer's recommendations. Post-capture libraries were verified using the BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent) on a high-sensitivity DNA chip. Libraries were quantified using the NEBNext Library Quant kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), normalized to 2 nM and pooled.\n\n    Pooled libraries were 100 bp paired-end sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) generating ~115M reads per cell line (obtaining an average of 30x per cell line). Reads were trimmed using Cutadapt v2.10 (, accessed on 4 June 2021) and aligned against hg19 using Burrows Wheeler Aligner v0.7.17 with default settings. Samtools v1.12 was used to sort and mark duplicate reads and Picard tools v2.17.10 (, accessed on 4 June 2021) for collecting quality metrics. Variants were called using Strelka v2.9.10 in germline mode and the resulting VCFs were annotated using Annovar v10.2019 and annotate_bam_statistics (, accessed on 4 June 2021). Non-frequent (in <3 of 91 cell lines) recurring variants affecting 50 HR-related genes (listed in Table S3) identified in the 53 breast and 38 ovarian cancer cell lines are summarized in Tables S1 and S2, respectively.\n\n    Cells were seeded on coverslips one day prior to irradiation with 5 Gy using an X-ray machine (RS320, XStrahl Medical & Life sciences, Surrey, UK). For suspension cell lines, cells were irradiated in suspension before preparation of cytospins. One hour after irradiation, 3 mug/mL 5-Ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to label cells in S phase. Two hours after irradiation, cells were subjected to pre-extraction, fixation and RAD51 immunofluorescence as described previously. Additionally, the presence of 53BP1/gammaH2AX foci was used as a positive control for the presence of DNA DSBs. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-RAD51 (1:10,000,), rabbit anti-53BP1 (1:1000, NB100-904, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA) and mouse anti-gammaH2AX (1:500, JBW301, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor  594 goat anti-mouse (1:1000) and Alexa Fluor  488 goat anti-rabbit (1:1000) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Image acquisition was performed on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope, using the 63x oil immersion objective. RAD51 foci in EdU positive cells were quantified manually. Per quantification, at least 30 EdU positive nuclei were counted and three independent RAD51 quantifications were performed per cell line. Cell lines were regarded as HRP if >=50% and HRD if <=20% of EdU positive cells contained >=5 RAD51 foci. Cell lines were HR intermediate (HRI) if the percentage of EdU positive cells showing >=5 RAD51 foci was between 20 and 50%. This classification was based on previous experiments in tissue slices.\n\n    Cells were scraped and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% Glycerol and 60mM Tris pH 6.8), heated to 95  C for 5 min and protein concentration was measured using the Lowry protein assay. Size separation of proteins was achieved on a 3-8% Tris-Acetate gel (Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane by wet blotting at 300 mA for two hours at 4  C in transfer buffer (0.4 M Glycine, 5 mM Tris, 20% Methanol). Next, the membrane was blocked in 3% dry skimmed milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 for at least one hour. Primary antibodies against BRCA2 (1:1000, OP95, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), BRCA1 (1:500, OP92, Merck Millipore), PARP1 (1:5,000, C2-10, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) and alpha-tubulin (1:10,000, T5168, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4  C. The secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, UK), was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then, ECL substrate was added and the signal was detected on the Alliance 4.7 (Uvitec Cambridge Cleaver Scientific, Warwickshire, UK). The bands were quantified using the 'Analyze Gels' function in Image J (version 1.50i) and equal protein loading was verified by the alpha-tubulin loading control.\n\n    Genome-wide methylation profiles were generated previously for BC cell lines (n = 53) using the recently developed MeD-seq assay. Data from individual LpnPI sites were summarized per CpG island, for which annotations were downloaded from Ensembl (, accessed on 11 November 2019). Data were normalized to the total read count per library and square root transformed. All individual CpG islands that were (partly) located within a window ranging from 1000 bp upstream to 1000 bp downstream of the transcription start site of selected genes were selected for further analysis.\n\n    Gene expression data for part of the BC and OC cell lines (n = 69) were generated previously (GSE9385 and GSE53418) and measured using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. Affymetrix' Expression Console was used to process and normalize raw .cel files using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) parameters to generate per-gene expression levels. Since the BC and OC cell line experiments were conducted at different time points, data from these cohorts were separately processed and then tested for batch effects. Principle component analysis (PCA) using prcomp in R v3.6.0 revealed the presence of a batch effect between data sets which was corrected using ComBat. After correction, PCA did not reveal any batch effect anymore between the BC and OC cell lines.\n\n    Mutational signatures were generated by Jarvis et al. for part of the cell lines (n = 53) used in this project. DNA methylation and gene expression data for 50 HR-related genes (listed in Table S3) as well as mutational signature data for base substitution signature 3 for the breast and ovarian cell lines are summarized in Table S4.\n\n    cDNA was synthesized previously from total RNA for all BC and OC cell lines as described before. qPCR for the Delta11q splice variant and full-length BRCA1 was performed in a Mx3000PTM Real-Time PCR System (Agilent, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using 1X SensiFast SYBR Lo-Rox master mix (Bioline, Memphis, TN, USA) and 333 microM of specific primers (Delta11q-forward 5'-AGAGGCATCCAGAAAAGTATC-3', FL-forward 5'-GAGCAAAGCATGGATTCAAAC-3' and reverse 5'-GATAGCCCTGAGCAGTCTTC-3') as recommended by the manufacturer. In addition to a negative control (i.e., genomic DNA), we also included a standard curve of a serially diluted cDNA sample consisting of pooled BC cell lines in each PCR plate. The latter was performed to ensure that the PCR efficiency between plates was comparable. Presence of the Delta11q splice variant was determined by subtracting the Cq value for the Delta11q splice variant from the Cq value of the full-length BRCA1 transcript.\n\n    HCC1937 cells were grown to 70-80% confluency in a 6-well plate and transfected with 1 microg of the pCW57_1-eGFP-SHLD2 plasmid using transfection reagent Fugene-HD (Thermo Fisher Scientific; DNA:Fugene-HD ratio = 1:4). Twenty-four hours after transfection, 0.5 mug/mL doxycycline was added to the cells to induce GFP-SHLD2 gene expression. After another 24 h, cells were irradiated and further processed for RAD51 immunofluorescence staining (as described above). pCW57_1-eGFP-SHLD2 was a gift from Sylvie Noordermeer.\n\n    HCC1937 and HCC2218 cells were grown to 50-70% confluency in a 6-well plate and transfected with 0.5 and 1 microg, and 1 and 2 microg each of the pReceiver-Lv105-GFP (Genecopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA; EX-EGFP-Lv105), eSpCas9(1.1)_No_FLAG_LMNA_G2 (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA, #178090) and LMNA_mScarlet-I_Donor (Addgene #178092) plasmids using transfection reagent Fugene-HD (DNA:Fugene-HD ratio = 1:4 and 1:3), respectively. After 72 h, cells were collected and the mean intensity and percentage of GFP- and mScarlet-positive cells were quantified on a FACSAriaIII (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The transfection efficiency was determined by the percentage of GFP-positive cells, whereas the capability of cells to perform HR was determined by comparing the percentage of mScarlet-positive cells with those from a control transfection. This control transfection only lacked the eSpCas9(1.1)_No_FLAG_LMNA_G2, thereby correcting for non-HR-related mScarlet-positivity originating from transfection of the LMNA_mScarlet-I_Donor itself. HRP cell line Hs578T and HRD cell line MDA-MB-436 were used as a positive and negative control to set appropriate gating for the analysis. eSpCas9(1.1)_No_FLAG_LMNA_G2 and LMNA_mScarlet-I_Donor were a gift from Yannick Doyon.\n\n    Statistical analyses were all two-sided and performed using R v4.2.2 or GraphPad Prism v6.0 (San Diego, CA, USA) for calculating standard errors of the mean in graphs. The Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparing two or three groups of continuous data, respectively. p-values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant.",
        "Results": "    Since the HR status can change over time, for example, as a result of selective pressure from chemotherapy, the prevailing HR phenotype of the 91 BC and OC cell lines was tested using a functional method. This method is based on the formation of RAD51 foci after irradiation, thus reflecting the real-time HR status of the cell line regardless of reported BRCA1/2 mutation status (Figure S1). Two of the fifty-three (3.8%) BC cell lines were HRD and one BC cell line was HRI (1.9%; Figure 1). However, ten (18.9%) BC cell lines harbored an inactivating pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation. Only two of these (i.e., MDA-MB-436 and HCC1395) were found to be HRD/HRI, while eight BRCA1/2-mutant BC cell lines (i.e., HCC1954, SUM149PT, HCC1599, SUM1315MO2, HCC202, HCC1937, HCC1569 and BT474) were functionally HRP. Moreover, HCC2218 was HRD, but wild-type for BRCA1 and BRCA2. None of the thirty-eight OC cell lines were HRD and one (2.6%) was HRI (Figure 2). However, seven (18.4%) OC cell lines harbored an inactivating pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation. Only one of these (i.e., PEO1) was also found HRD/HRI, while six BRCA1/2-mutated OC cell lines (i.e., UWB1.289+BRCA1, COV362.4, PEO16, COV362, IGROV1 and UWB1.289) were functionally HRP. We thus found a discrepancy between functional HR and BRCA1/2 mutation status in 15 of the 91 (16.5%) BC and OC cell lines (Table 1).\n\n    Among all OC and BC cell lines, regardless of BRCA1/2 mutation status, the incidence of functional HRD was strikingly low. Only two (3.8%) BC cell lines and none of the OC cell lines were HRD. One HRD BC cell line (i.e., HCC2218) was not BRCA1/2 mutated (Figure 1, Table 1), suggesting alternative means of BRCA1/2 silencing could be the cause of HRD. Therefore, we performed Western blotting of BRCA1, BRCA2 and PARP1 proteins for all HRD/HRI cell lines and BRCA1/2-mutated cell lines regardless of HR status. Cell line HCC2218 showed very low levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins (Table 1, Figure S2). However, methylation of the BRCA1 promoter at CpG19767 or CpG19770 or the BRCA2 promoter at CpG11721 was not evident in this cell line (Figure 3A-C). Therefore, the HRD phenotype of HCC2218 is likely not caused by promoter methylation of either BRCA1 or BRCA2.\n\n    Next, we evaluated the exome sequencing data from the 91 BC and OC cell lines for other causes than BRCA1/2 deficiency to explain the HRD phenotype in HCC2218 (Tables S1 and S2). Several other (putative) DNA damage response genes were mutated in HCC2218, such as ARID1B, ATM, FANCD2, FANCM and MRE11. However, mutations were all missense and heterozygous. Moreover, such mutations were also identified among other BC and OC cell lines not having an HRD phenotype making it unlikely that any of these are causal for the HRD phenotype of HCC2218.\n\n    To evaluate the BRCA1/2 wildtype HRD phenotype of HCC2218 further, we investigated the promoter methylation status of 60 CpG islands from 50 genes involved in HR (Tables S3 and S4, Figure S3). Interestingly, HCC2218 had the highest promoter methylation levels for ATM at CpG8407 and the second highest promoter methylation levels for RAD51B at CpG13662 (Figure 3D,E). Unfortunately, we had no gene expression data available for this particular cell line to verify whether promoter methylation of these genes also led to reduced gene expression. However, ATM promoter methylation is unlikely to be causal for the HRD phenotype of HCC2218, since pathogenic germline mutations of ATM also do not cause HRD. Moreover, SUM190PT, the BC cell line with the highest levels of RAD51B promoter methylation, did not show reduced but average gene expression levels of RAD51B, indicating that RAD51B promoter methylation may not always lead to reduced gene expression levels. Thus, promoter methylation of RAD51B may also not be causal for the HRD phenotype in HCC2218 (Figure 4A). It thus remains unclear what the underlying mechanism is causing HRD in HCC2218.\n\n    Eight BC cell lines (i.e., BT474, HCC202, HCC1569, HCC1599, HCC1937, HCC1954, SUM149PT and SUM1313MO2) and six OC cell lines (i.e., COV362, COV362.4, IGROV1, PEO16, UWB1.289 and UWB1.289+BRCA1) were HRP yet harbored a BRCA1/2 mutation (Figure 1 and Figure 2). For 6 of these 14 cell lines, the observed HRP phenotype could be explained by a low variant allele frequency (VAF) of the pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation (Table 1, Tables S1 and S2). BT474 and HCC1569 harbored a heterozygous BRCA2 mutation, while BRCA1/2 mutations in HCC202, HCC1954 and IGROV1 had even lower VAFs (4.3-25%). For HCC1599, the VAF of the BRCA2 mutation was relatively high (81%), but still resulted in incomplete BRCA2 protein loss. Interestingly, although HCC1569 harbored a heterozygous BRCA2 mutation and BRCA2 protein levels were low but detectable, BRCA1 protein expression was absent (Table 1, Figure S2). Although we could not find any clear cause for the loss of BRCA1 protein expression among the exome sequencing or methylation data, an HRD instead of the observed HRP phenotype had been expected. Reasons for the HRP phenotype in PEO16 and UWB1.289+BRCA1 are the presence of an in-frame BRCA2 mutation with corresponding BRCA2 protein expression and reconstitution of BRCA1 function with a wild-type BRCA1 cDNA, respectively (Table 1 and Table S2). Thus, with the exception of HCC1569, these cell lines with low VAF, an in-frame BRCA2 mutation and reconstitution of wild-type BRCA1 were all correctly classified as HRP.\n\n    PEO1 and PEO4 OC cell lines were also correctly classified. PEO1 and PEO4 were derived from the same patient, but PEO1 was the first platinum-sensitive relapse and PEO4 was a subsequent platinum-resistant relapse. PEO1 harbored a BRCA2 nonsense mutation that was restored to wild-type in PEO4, rendering PEO4 HRP (Table S2). Moreover, PEO1 was not HRD, but HRI because of a different BRCA2 restoration mutation than in PEO4. However, this BRCA2 restoration mutation in PEO1 had a VAF of only 30%, resulting in an intermediate HR status (Table 1).\n\n    For cell lines HCC1569, HCC1937, SUM149PT, SUM1315MO2 COV362, COV362.4 and UWB1.289, we did not find a BRCA1/2 gene reversion mutation as the explanation for the HRP phenotype and therefore these seven cell lines are likely to harbor another resistance mechanism that caused restoration of their HR pathway. Indeed, both SUM149PT and UWB1.289 have been shown to express an alternative Delta11q splicing isoform of BRCA1, whereas SUM1315MO2, on the other hand, expresses a RING domain-deficient BRCA1 protein. Both mechanisms lead to partial restoration of BRCA1 proteins and reversion to a HRP phenotype. We confirmed the presence of the alternative Delta11q splicing isoform in our SUM149PT and UWB1.289 cells and additionally identified COV362 and COV362.4 cells expressing this splice variant.\n\n    To reveal the underlying cause of the BRCA1/2-mutant HRP phenotype of HCC1569 and HCC1937, we evaluated the exome sequencing data for mutations in 13 genes previously shown to be involved in HR restoration, such as PARG, TP53BP1, REV7, RIF1, DYNLL2, SHLD complex genes and CST complex genes. For HCC1937, we did not identify mutations in any of these genes, while HCC1569 harbored a missense mutation in CTC1 as well as two missense mutations in SHLD3 (Table S1). Missense mutations in these genes were, however, also identified in five BC and OC and two BC cell lines, respectively, and an association with HR reversion was not evident.\n\n    Therefore, we also investigated the gene expression data of 48 genes involved in HR. As expected, BRCA1/2-deficient or HRD cell lines did not cluster together upon hierarchical clustering of the expression levels of these genes (Figure S4), since the expression of these genes is linked to cell cycle progression. Next, we searched for outlier behavior (low or high) with regard to the gene expression of the 13 genes previously shown to be involved in HR restoration in BRCA1/2-mutant HRP cell line HCC1937. Unfortunately, we had no gene expression data available for HCC1569. Interestingly, HCC1937 had the lowest levels of PARG gene expression from the 69 cell lines. However, the low levels of SHLD2 gene expression were even more pronounced, indicating that reduced SHLD2 expression could probably be causal for the HRP phenotype in this BRCA1-deficient cell line (Figure 4B,C).\n\n    Consequently, we attempted to reconstitute HCC1937 cells with wild-type GFP-SHLD2 cDNA in order to reverse the HRP phenotype. Unfortunately, after transfection of HCC1937 cells with GFP-SHLD2 cDNA and subsequent induction of gene expression with doxycycline, hardly any of the GFP+ cells were in the S-phase of the cell cycle. In total, we observed no more than ten GFP+ cells that were in S-phase and all had low GFP levels, which prohibited us to reliably count RAD51 foci. Since the majority of the ten GFP+ cells, however, seemed to produce RAD51 foci after irradiation (Figure S5), this could suggest that low SHLD2 expression in HCC1937 cells may not be the cause of the HRP phenotype. However, considering the severely reduced amount of GFP+ cells in S-phase and their low GFP expression, we are reluctant to draw any definitive conclusion.\n\n    Finally, to demonstrate that HCC1937 and HCC2218 cell lines were correctly classified as HRP and HRD by the ReCAP assay, we used an HR-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 assay that integrates mScarlet cDNA into the LMNA locus. For HCC1937 cells, flowcytometry analysis showed an average 2.8-fold increase in mScarlet-positive cells as compared to the control transfection lacking the LMNA gRNAs and Cas9 (6.6% vs. 2.3%; Figure S6). In addition, the mean mScarlet intensity was also increased 2.1-fold on average (4867 vs. 2282). For HCC2218 cells, however, the percentage of mScarlet-positive cells and their intensity were comparable to the control transfection (1.55% vs. 1.15% and 1530 vs. 1944; Figure S6). These results confirm that HCC1937 cells are indeed HRP, while HCC2218 cells are HRD.\n\n    HRD-associated mutational scars that can be extracted from massive parallel sequencing data also allow for the classification of HR status. Previously, SBS signatures were extracted from 1020 cancer cell lines by Jarvis et al., also including 37 of the 53 BC and 16 of the 38 OC cell lines studied here. A higher percentage relative contribution (%rc) of SBS signatures 3 and 8 have been associated with BRCA1/2 deficiency and an HRD phenotype. Since only SBS signature 3 could be extracted for these 53 cell lines, we compared classification by SBS signature 3 with BRCA1/2 mutation status of the cell lines as well as HR status (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 5, Table S4). Interestingly, although BRCA1/2-mutant cell lines had a higher median %rc of SBS signature 3 compared with wild-type cell lines, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). In contrast, HRD and HRI cell lines combined did show a significantly higher %rc of SBS signature 3 compared with HRP cell lines (p = 0.0080). This was, however, not the case for BRCA1/2-mutant HRP compared directly with wild-type HRP cell lines (p = 0.67). Importantly, although SBS signature 3 correlated better with functional HR status than BRCA1/2 mutation status, misclassification of HR status by SBS signature 3 occurred for 6 out the 10 cell lines with a high (i.e., >30%) %rc. Except for the four HRD and HRI cell lines, six HRP cell lines also had a %rc>30%. In fact, the five cell lines with the highest %rc for SBS signature 3 were all HRP. These results highlight the importance of measuring functional HR status instead of BRCA1/2 mutation status or HRD-associated mutational scars.",
        "Conclusion": "    We identified discrepancies between BRCA1/2 mutation status and functional HR status in 16.5% (15/91) of BC and OC cell lines. Most strikingly, 82.4% (14/17) of BRCA1/2-mutant cell lines were HRP, highlighting the importance of determining the functional HR status. Unraveling the mechanisms driving the discrepant HR status in these cell lines demonstrated that reversion mechanisms predominantly acted on restoring the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation directly. Although we identified one BRCA1/2-mutant HRP cell line with a strikingly low SHLD2 expression, reconstitution experiments were not conclusive in determining causality. Taken together, our results indicate that the majority of BRCA1/2-mutant cell lines are not a suitable model to study HRD and thus careful selection of cell lines for in vitro experiments involving HR is warranted. Moreover, only determining BRCA1/2 mutation status may not suffice for the proper selection of patients for platinum-based chemotherapy or PARPi.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    In a large cohort of BC (n = 53) and OC (n = 38) cell lines, we measured the functional HR status by quantifying RAD51 foci formation after irradiation and determined BRCA1/2 mutation status. Since the HR status can change over time due to evolutionary tumor and treatment selection and cell lines are exposed to genetic drift, we hypothesized that functional HR status better reflects real-time HR status than BRCA1/2 mutation status. Consistent with this, discrepancies between BRCA1/2 mutation status and functional HR status were identified in 16.5% (15/91) of BC and OC cell lines. Importantly, while only one of the four (i.e., 25%) HRD and HRI cell lines was not explained by a BRCA1/2 gene mutation or methylation, the vast majority (i.e., 14/17; 82.4%) of BRCA1/2-mutant BC and OC cell lines were found to be HRP. This highlights the importance of determining the functional HR status and additionally could imply a selection advantage for cells to become HRP.\n\n    To explain the discrepancies between HR and BRCA1/2 mutation status for these 15 cell lines, we evaluated exome sequencing, gene expression and promoter methylation data for 50 HR-related genes. Moreover, BRCA1/2 protein expression levels were determined through Western blotting. Despite the amount of relevant data, we were unable to identify a putative causal factor for the HRD phenotype of BRCA1/2 wild-type BC cell line HCC2218 indicating that novel HRD-causing factors remain to be identified. Alternatively, other mechanisms could be involved such as overexpression of a negative regulator of HR or post-translational inactivation of an HR-related protein. Of the fourteen BRCA1/2-mutant HRP cell lines, six displayed a low VAF for their BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation, one had an in-frame mutation, four had restored BRCA1 function through expression of an alternative BRCA1 Delta11q splicing isoform, one expressed a RING-less BRCA1 protein and one had reconstituted wild-type BRCA1 cDNA through transfection.\n\n    Interestingly, the HRP phenotype of BRCA2-mutant BC cell line HCC1569 was explained by its heterozygous BRCA2 mutation resulting in incomplete BRCA2 inactivation. However, this cell line additionally displayed an absence of BRCA1 protein expression and consequently should have been HRD. We did not find any explanation for the absence of BRCA1 protein or the HRP phenotype of these cells amongst the mutation, methylation or gene expression data. Alternatively, other mechanisms could be involved including alternative splicing, regulation through a microRNA or circular RNA or overexpression of HR proteins that lead to reversion of the HRD phenotype.\n\n    Both SUM149PT and UWB1.289 cells had been shown to express a BRCA1-Delta11q splice variant lacking the majority of exon 11, thereby partially circumventing both PARPi as well as cisplatin sensitivity arisen from their pathogenic exon 11 BRCA1 mutations. Similarly, SUM1315MO2 cells had been shown to partially restore BRCA1 function by expressing a RING domain-deficient BRCA1 protein through using an alternative translation start at codon 297. This way, PARPi and platinum-compound sensitivity induced by its RING-domain mutation was reverted, also explaining the HRP phenotype. Both BRCA1-specific reversal mechanisms are elegant ways of circumventing RING-domain and exon 11 mutation-induced drug sensitivity. We reconfirmed the Delta11q alternative splice isoform in our SUM149PT and UWB1.289 cells and additionally identified this splice variant in COV362 and COV362.4 cells. We did not, however, observe this variant in IGROV1, which is the only other cell line with a BRCA1 exon 11 mutation. This is in line with the HRP phenotype of IGROV1 already being explained by a low VAF of its BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.\n\n    Interestingly, COV362 and COV362.4 cell lines both harbored a second BRCA1 mutation (i.e., c.4096+1G>T) in the splice donor of exon 11. This splicing mutation was unable to revert the upstream c.2612_2613insT mutation, since this insertion's predicted frame shift (i.e., p.F872Vfs*31) resulted in a premature stop codon far upstream of the c.4096+1G>T mutation. However, it did result in a second transcript being expressed besides Delta11q in which the complete intron 12 was retained and predicted to produce a protein with an in-frame insertion of 134 amino acids.\n\n    The BRCA1-mutant BC cell line HCC1937 was described as RAD51 foci negative by others, but in our hands, this cell line was able to form RAD51 foci, consequently classifying as HRP. Since cell lines may genetically diverge in time, this is an excellent example of the importance of reconfirming published findings in one's own cell lines. Importantly, we found a strikingly low SHLD2 gene expression in HCC1937. SHLD2 is a member of the Shieldin complex, also containing SHLD1, SHLD3 and REV7. The Shieldin complex was shown to promote non-homologous end-joining and the disruption of Shieldin factors restores HR and PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. However, to our knowledge mutation or loss of SHLD2 has not been associated with the restoration of PARPi resistance in clinical samples. Therefore, we attempted to establish causality of SHLD2 downregulation for the HRP phenotype in HCC1937. Perhaps unexpectedly, after reconstitution of SHLD2 cDNA in HCC1937, the vast majority of SHLD2-expressing cells were not in the S-phase, which is required to assess RAD51 foci formation. In addition, the few cells that were in the S-phase had relatively low SHLD2 expression and were in poor condition. This may suggest that overexpression of SHLD2 is toxic to these cells.\n\n    Irrespective of whether SHLD2 downregulation is causal for the HRP phenotype in HCC1937 cells, 12 of the 14 BRCA1/2-mutant HRP cell lines were explained by mechanisms directly acting on BRCA1/2 and not by indirect mechanisms involving PARG, TP53BP1, RIF1, Shieldin or CST complex factors. This is consistent with reports on clinical samples.\n\n    We hypothesized that the functional HR status of cell lines would better reflect the real-time HR status of the cells at the time of testing than BRCA1/2 mutation status. Interestingly, although the %rc of SBS3 was not determined on our own cell lines, but extracted from previously published data, it was significantly higher in HRD and HRI cell lines as compared with HRP cell lines. In contrast, the %rc of SBS3 was not significantly different between BRCA1/2-mutant and wild-type cells. There was also no difference in %rc between BRCA1/2-mutant HRP and wild-type HRP cell lines. This is an unexpected finding since SBS3-associated mutations induced by BRCA1/2-deficiency would be accumulating in a cell line or tumor during the tumorigenesis process and remain in the genome even after reversal of the HRD phenotype. Therefore, one would expect the %rc of SBS3 to correlate better with BRCA1/2 mutation status than functional HR status. However, cell lines have been growing ex vivo for a significant amount of time with selection being an ongoing process. Moreover, HRD and HRI cell lines had a significantly higher %rc of SBS3 than BRCA1/2-mutant HRP cell lines which could have been accumulated ex vivo, after the tumor was removed from the patient. Of course, it is also important to realize that we evaluated only one of five mutational signatures associated with BRCA1/2-deficiency which could have led to some misclassification. In addition, extracting somatic mutational signatures from cell lines without the availability of a matched normal control is much more challenging and signatures were based on whole-exome sequencing data which yields sparser data compared to whole-genome sequence data.\n\n    This study provides evidence that BRCA1/2-deficient and/or HRD cell lines comprise a heterogeneous group in which most (i.e., 82.4%) BRCA1/2-deficient cell lines have an HRP phenotype and therefore do not represent HRD tumor specimens. Since cell lines are so broadly applied as a model system, it is of utmost importance to realize that the specific cell line used influences the conclusions that are drawn from these experiments tremendously. Therefore, we recommend not to randomly select a BRCA1/2-deficient cell line, but properly choose the appropriate cell line depending on the purpose of the in vitro experiments. Furthermore, since cell lines including their functional HR status may change over time, the specifics of the cell line should always be verified before commencing a study. Therefore, this comprehensive overview of functional HR status of our collection of cell lines, in addition to previous characterizations, further aids in selecting the proper in vitro model for studies regarding HR, BRCA1/2 function and beyond (e.g., studies utilizing HR-dependent CRISPR/Cas9 gene modification).",

        "Title": "    Prevalence of specific and recurrent/founder pathogenic variants in BRCA genes in breast and ovarian cancer in North Africa",
        "Abstract": "    Elucidation of specific and recurrent/founder pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA (BRCA1 and BRCA2) genes can make the genetic testing, for breast cancer (BC) and/or ovarian cancer (OC), affordable for developing nations.\n\n    To establish the knowledge about BRCA PVs and to determine the prevalence of the specific and recurrent/founder variants in BRCA genes in BC and/or OC women in North Africa, a systematic review was conducted in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.\n\n    Search of the databases yielded 25 relevant references, including eleven studies in Morocco, five in Algeria, and nine in Tunisia. Overall, 15 studies investigated both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, four studies examined the entire coding region of the BRCA1 gene, and six studies in which the analysis was limited to a few BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 exons. Overall, 76 PVs (44 in BRCA1 and32 in BRCA2) were identified in 196 BC and/or OC patients (129 BRCA1 and 67 BRCA2 carriers). Eighteen of the 76 (23.7%) PVs [10/44 (22.7%) in BRCA1 and 8/32 (25%) in BRCA2] were reported for the first time and considered to be novel PVs. Among those identified as unlikely to be of North African origin, the BRCA1 c.68_69del and BRCA1 c.5266dupC Jewish founder alleles and PVs that have been reported as recurrent/founder variants in European populations (ex: BRCA1 c.181T>G, BRCA1 c1016dupA). The most well characterized PVs are four in BRCA1 gene [c.211dupA (14.7%), c.798_799detTT (14%), c.5266dup (8.5%), c.5309G>T (7.8%), c.3279delC (4.7%)] and one in BRCA2 [c.1310_1313detAAGA (38.9%)]. The c.211dupA and c.5309G>T PVs were identified as specific founder variants in Tunisia and Morocco, accounting for 35.2% (19/54) and 20.4% (10/49) of total established BRCA1 PVs, respectively. c.798_799delTT variant was identified in 14% (18/129) of all BRCA1 North African carriers, suggesting a founder allele. A broad spectrum of recurrent variants including BRCA1 3279delC, BRCA1 c.5266dup and BRCA2 c.1310_1313detAAGA was detected in 42 patients. BRCA1 founder variants explain around 36.4% (47/129) of BC and outnumber BRCA2 founder variants by a ratio of  3:1.\n\n    Testing BC and/or OC patients for the panel of specific and recurrent/founder PVs might be the most cost-effective molecular diagnosis strategy.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer (BC) became the most common cancer globally as of 2021, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases, representing 11.7% of all cancer cases. According to the GLOBOCAN Cancer Tomorrow prediction tool, incident cases are expected to increase by more than 46% by 2040. The increasing global BC burden is mainly observed in low- and middle-income countries, particularly women under the age of fifty. The rapid changes in diets and lifestyles, and social-cultural environments brought about by growing economies have had an impact on the prevalence of factors associated with increased BC risk. Therefore, the increase in the proportion of women in the industrial work force gave rise to a postponed pregnancy, having fewer children and, excessive total and abdominal body fat and physical inactivity which resulted in a convergence toward the risk factor profile of countries in Western Europe and narrowing international gaps in BC morbidity.\n\n    BC incidence rates increased uniformly and rapidly in transitioning countries. Some of the most rapid increases are occurring in North Africa, including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania. The incidence of BC among North African women aged 15 to 49 is lower than that in Western countries. However, the young age pyramid of North Africa makes the relative proportion of BC in young patients substantially higher than that in Western countries (e.g.50 to 60% versus 20% in France). The size and grade of breast tumors in North Africa is higher and the median age of onset (48) is more than ten years younger than the European/North American median of 61, and is often diagnosed in premenopausal women. The relative frequency of triple-negative and inflammatory BC is also higher. The combination of lower incidence and lower age of onset of BC in North Africa suggests that genetic factors such as germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA (BRCA1 and BRCA2) genes may contribute to a larger proportion of BC overall.\n\n    Prevalence and PVs distribution of BRCA genes can vary in different regions and among different ethnic groups due to specific and recurrent/founder variants. Founder variants originated from an ancestor population and maintained over time, were observed in specific geographic areas. Significant evidence from founder mutation has been described in Ashkenazi Jewish, Icelandic, French-Canadian, Brazilian and Italian populations. Traditionally, well-documented founder BRCA PVs have been instrumental to informed prioritization strategies for time- and cost-effective genetic testing and prompt identification of carrier individuals. Given the high rates of consanguinity and endogamy marriage culture among the North African populations, it seems plausible that specific and recurrent/founder BRCA PVs may be detected in the region. Rebbeck et al. investigated 1650 and 1731 unique PVs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively, from 29,700 families worldwide and observed distinct variation in PV type or prevalence by geographical region and race/ethnicity. Racial and ethnic differences can play an important role in hereditary breast carcinomas through its associations with specific and recurrent/founder variants. The purpose of this review is to establish the knowledge about BRCA PVs and to determine the prevalence of the specific and recurrent/founder variants in BRCA genes in BC and/or OC women in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. It seems that no surveys on BRCA PVs have yet been conducted in Libya and Mauritania, therefore no data are available.",
        "Methods": "    We conducted a systematic review of all the literature published on the BRCA PVs spectrum and the frequencies in BC women in North Africa. Pub Med, Science Direct and Google Scholar were searched up to June 2021 for eligible studies using the following keywords: \"breast cancer\", or \"breast tumor\", or \"adenocarcinoma of the breast\", or \"BRCA genes\", or \"BRCA1 gene\", or \"BRCA2 gene\", or \"BRCA pathogenic variant\", or \"BRCA mutation\", or \"BRCA prevalence\" or \"BRCA frequency\", or \"BRCA rate\" or \"BRCA incidence\". An additional literature search was also conducted using North Africa and specific country names belonging to the considered region and any other variant names for any of North Africa countries (ex: Mediterranean countries, Maghreb, Arab population). We manually checked reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews to identify additional studies. We also searched relevant abstracts reported in the most important multi-disciplinary societies of medical oncology such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meetings to identify unpublished studies.\n\n    Original research articles were identified from Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. The included studies had to meet the following criteria: the study must relate to the role of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes in BC and/or OC, it should also analyze all the coding regions, test for known mutations, or select exons of BRCA genes. Besides, the study must provide sufficient information on the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 PV frequencies. Likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown/uncertain significance (VUS) were excluded from this study. The prevalence of any variant was included regardless of whether the variant was specific or recurrent/founder. Also, where study authors did not clearly state that variant was germline or somatic and/or pathogenic, or clinically relevant, the variant was classified as not reported/unclear in order to avoid any misinterpretation. Details of the study methods, population characteristics, and prevalence of BRCA PVs were extracted and summarized in Table 1.\n\n    A reinterpretation of sequence variants was conducted by following the classification system recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) Standards and Guideline for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants. The 2015 ACMG-AMP guidelines were a major step toward establishing a common framework for variant classification. The ACMG-AMP suggests that the clinical pathogenicity of a variant can be evaluated using multiple lines of evidence from available literature, structural/functional data, population frequencies, and statistical analyses of clinical data. The process can result in 1 of 5 classifications: benign (class 1), likely benign (2), VUS (class 3), likely pathogenic (class 4), and pathogenic (class 5).\n\n    Variants were considered to be \"founder\" if they were described as such in the primary literature, based on confirmatory haplotype analysis or population frequency.\n\n    The datasets generated and analysed during the current study are available in the [Breast and ovarian cancer in North Africa (tables)] repository.\n\n    Pub med (Open access): https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\n\n    Science Direct (Open access): https://www.sciencedirect.com/\n\n    Google Scholar (Open access): https://scholar.google.com/\n\n    Not applicable\n\n    Not applicable",
        "Results": "    The search of the databases yielded 25 relevant references which are closely related to defining the inclusion criteria and was included in this review. The retrieved articles describe studies conducted in Morocco (n=11), Algeria (n=5), and Tunisia (n=9). Overall, 15 studies investigated both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, four studies examined the entire coding regions of the BRCA1 gene, and six studies in which the analysis was restricted to a few BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 exons.\n\n    Overall, we observed 76 distinct BRCA PVs (44 in BRCA1 and 32 in BRCA2). The identified variants are found in 196 BC and/or OC patients (129 BRCA1 carriers and 67 BRCA2 carriers). A total of 18 of the 76 (23.7%) PVs [10/44 (22.7%) in BRCA1, 8/32 (25%) in BRCA2] were reported for the first time and were considered to be novel PVs in the North African populations. Among them, four PVs were reported in Morocco (c.3453delT in BRCA1, and c.3381delT, c.7110delA, c.7234_7235insG in BRCA2, three in Algeria (deletion of exon2 in BRCA1, c.2805delAand c.6450del in BRCA2, and eleven in Tunisia (c.211dupA, c.296_297delTG, c.2418dupA, c.3254delG, c.3364_3370dupACAGATT, c.3751dup, c.4067_4071delAAGAA in BRCA1 and c.1313dupT, c.1976_1800delCTTAT, c.2095 C>T, c.7654dupT in BRCA2). The reported PVs in BRCA genes from North African studies are presented in Table 2.\n\n    Among those identified PVs, some are unlikely to be of North African origin which includes the BRCA1 c.68_69del and BRCA1 c.5266dupC Jewish founder variants, as well as PVs that have been reported as founder variants in European populations (ex: BRCA1 c.181T>G in Poland). Furthermore, other PVs have been described worldwide and represented as common PVs in several populations (ex: BRCA1 c.1016dupA in Italy, Germany, Scandinavian countries and French-Canadians, BRCA1 c.2125_2126insA in French-Canadians, BRCA1 c.2338 C>T and BRCA2 c.1813dupA in Germany, BRCA1 c.5030_5033delCTAA in France, BRCA2 c.3860delA in Austrian population, and BRCA2 c.3847_3848delGT in Denmark).\n\n    The most well characterized five PVs are four in BRCA1 gene including c.211dupA (14.7%, 19/129), c.798_799detTT (14%, 18/129), c.5266dup (8.5%, 11/129), c.5309G>T (7.8%, 10/129), c.3279delC (4.7%, 6/129) and one in BRCA2 including c.1310_1313detAAGA (38.9%, 26/67). The BRCA1 c.798_799delTT was identified in 18 North African patients, accounting for 14% (18/129) of the total identified BRCA1 PVs. Microsatellite markers in and flanking the BRCA1 locus showed a common haplotype in Algerian and Tunisian c.798_799delTT carriers, suggesting the first non-Jewish founder variant to be described in Northern Africa. The c.798_799delTT variant, located in exon 11, is a frame-shift variant including two small deletions, two bases (TT) deletion, that cause truncated protein signal at codon 285.\n\n    The other frequently recurrent PVs c.211dupA and c.5266dupC were found in 55.6% (30/54) of BRCA1-related hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in Tunisian families but neither in Algerian nor in Moroccan families with BC and/or OC. The c.211dupA variant seems to be the most frequent BRCA PVs in Tunisia, accounting for 35.2% (19/54) of all identified BRCA1 PVs. It seems to be specific to Tunisia since it has never been previously described in any other population. The haplotype analysis supported the founder effect of c.211dupA in Tunisia and showed its recent origin. The frameshift variant c.211dupA results in a premature protein termination at codon 79 at the level of the splicing donor site of exon 5.\n\n    The c.5266dupC variant in BRCA1 exon 20 was detected in most Tunisian series, accounting for 20.4% (11/54) of all BRCA1 PVs. This alteration is one of three well-characterized Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations, with an overall carrier frequency of nearly 0.5% in this population. The c.5266dupC variant is the most globally frequent, pathogenic BRCA1 variant and has been reported in varied populations in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. The haplotype analysis indicates the likelihood of a single founder origin both in Europe and in North America for the c.5266dupC variant. Haplotype analysis may be useful in establishing whether or not it has a common founder origin for all BRCA1 c.5266dup variant in Tunisia. The BRCA1 c.5266dupC PV, located in coding exon 18, results from a duplication of C at nucleotide position 5266, causing a translational frameshift with a predicted alternate stop codon.\n\n    The BRCA1 c.5309G>T variant was identified in ten patients of which nine of which were BC and one was OC. Two of the BC patients were sporadic cases. A haplotype linked to c.5309G>T, constructed from five microsatellite markers and spanning 1.54 Mb, was defined in one family. The alleles found in the other families are consistent with this haplotype, supporting the founder effect of c.5309G>T in Morocco. This mutation was first reported in Spain in two families of Moroccan origin and was classified as probably pathogenic on the basis of a combination of functional and structural analyses. The c.5309G>T variant in BRCA1 gene is located in the functionally important BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal domain, a domain known to harbor missense substitutions associated with increased risk of BC and/or OC. The c.5309G>T variant should be treated as a disease-causing variant despite a lack of evolutionary conservation of the glycine at position 1770.\n\n    The BRCA1 c.3279delC variant mutation is a recurring PV in the Moroccan population. It accounts for 12.2% (6/49) of the BRCA1 mutations, suggesting a possible founder effect. This mutation has been identified in one HBOC kindred of Dutch descent as well as in one HBOC kindred of Moroccan descent in which the proband and her mother were diagnosed with BC at younger ages. The c.3279delC variant, located in coding exon 9 of the BRCA1 gene, is a frameshift variant of one base (C) deletion that changes a tyrosine to isoleucine at codon 1094 and creates a premature stop codon at position 15 of the new reading frame.\n\n    The BRCA2 c.1310_1313delAAGA frameshift PV is considered as a North African recurrent mutation since it has been identified in Moroccan, Algerian, and Tunisian BC patients. Interestingly, geographical clustering in the North-Eastern area of Morocco is evident for the c.1310_1313delAAGA mutation, suggesting a founder effect. c.1310_1313delAAGA incidence rate is high and accounts for 50% (17/34) of all BRCA2 PVs in North-East of Morocco. This sequence change harbors the deletion of four nucleotides from exon 10 of the BRCA2 mRNA, causing a frameshift after codon 437 and the creation of a premature translational stop signal 22 amino acid residues.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    BRCA genes remain the primary inherited causes of BC and OC, accounting for 30-70% of hereditary BC families and approximately 90% of hereditary OC families. BRCA PV carriers are linked with an increased lifetime risk of developing BC and/or OC. Current investigations have reported several differences and significant heterogeneity in the incidence and geographic distribution of PVs in BRCA genes. In North Africa, BRCA PVs frequency varies widely from  1% (Morocco) in sporadic BC to 37.5% (Tunisia) in HBOC. The spectrum and prevalence of BRCA PVs vary mainly due to population-specific recurrent/founder variants. Some of which have documented a founder effect of such recurrent or unique variants through haplotype analysis. Prevalence studies of BRCA gene variants suggest that these genetic alterations can explain a high-frequency BC in some populations than others and may contribute to differences in cancer risk between populations and racial/ethnic minorities. Accurate identification of the population-specific variant spectrum is therefore the first step towards incorporating appropriate BRCA genetic testing into clinical practice in certain populations and racial/ethnic groups.\n\n    In North Africa, BRCA1 founder variants explain around 36.4% (47/129) of BC and outnumber BRCA2 founder variants by a ratio of  3:1. Clear founder effects have been reported in Morocco (BRCA1 c.5309G>T) and Tunisia (BRCA1 c.211dupA). Furthermore, the BRCA1 c.798_799detTT was identified in 14% (18/129) of BRCA1 carriers in North African populations. It was initially thought to be specific to Algeria (19.23%, 5/26), but later found to be prevalent in Tunisia (7.4%, 4/54) and Morocco (18.4%, 9/49). Haplotype analysis of some families carrying these PV revealed the presence of a common allele. The BRCA1 c.798_799detTT frameshift variant is cited twice in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database, without any ethnic origin indicated. Interestingly, the c.798_799delTT and c.5309G>T variants in BRCA1 have been identified in sporadic BC patients in North Africa, and hence their presence in patients without a history of BC and/or OC cannot be attributed to the de novo mutational event. To our knowledge, the BRCA1 c.798_799delTT variant has been identified in Spain, in southern Italy, and in France. This restricted geographical distribution to close Mediterranean countries could be explained by geographical proximity and migration flow history. The c.1310_1313delAAGA variant in BRCA2 represents another common PV in North African populations whose founder effect through haplotype analysis is required for confirmation in this region. According to the BIC database, the BRCA2 c.1310_1313delAAGA PV was found in different European patients and was recorded several times in the French Universal Mutation database-BRCA2 (UMD-BRCA2) and classified as founder variant. The c.1310_1313delAAGA PV, located in coding exon 9 of the BRCA2 gene, results from a deletion of four nucleotides at nucleotide positions 1310 to 1313. The deletion causes a frameshift, which changes a Lysine to an Isoleucine at codon 437, and creates a premature stop codon at position 22 of the new reading frame. In addition, it is important to highlight that one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish founder variants (i.e. BRCA1 c.5266dup) is frequently observed in Tunisian BRCA1 carriers (20.4%, 11/54). The BRCA1 c.5266dup has been mainly observed in Italy in some families from the North-eastern coast of Sicily. BRCA1 c.5266dup was reported as a founder variant also in several European populations with a low proportion of individuals who self-identify as Jewish. Previous studies indicate that the mutation was introduced into the Ashkenazi Jewish genetic pool approximately 400-500 years ago in Poland, but the mutation originated from a single common European ancestor long before it became an Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation. The BRCA1 c.5266dupC variant is the second most frequently reported PV in the BIC database.\n\n    Besides recurrent/founder variants, two BRCA1 PVs (c.211dupA and c.5309G>T) identified in North Africa were not reported previously. The c.211dupA and c.5309G>T variants in the BRCA1 gene were found as unique to the Tunisian and Moroccan populations, respectively. Several founder variants as they have common ancestral haplotypes have been identified in various areas and races. For example, the well-known founder variants are c.68_69delAG, c.5266dupC in BRCA1, and c.5946_5946delT in BRCA2 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The c.824_825ins10, c.1713_1717delAGAAT, c.5177_5180del4, c.4357+1G>A variants in BRCA1 and c.4471_4474delCTGA variant in BRCA2 have been identified as a potential Afro-American founder variant. A high frequency of founder c.771_775del5 BRCA2 PV was identified in Iceland. The founder BRCA2 c.771_775del5 variant was reported to cause the familial clustering of both female and male BC cases. The c.2685_2686del variant in BRCA1 and c.9672dup variant in BRCA2 have been reported as founder mutations for the Dutch population. A French-Canadian founder status is evident for c.4327 C>T in BRCA1 and c.8537_8538delAG in BRCA2. The founder effect of c.68_69delAG, c.181T>G, c.676delT, c.1687 C>T, c.3700_3704delGTAAA, c.3756_3759delGTCT, c.4035delA, c.5251 C>T, c.5266dupC in BRCA1 and c.658_659delGT, c.3847_3848delGT, c.5946delT, c.7913_7917delTTCCT in BRCA2 is characteristic of Central European population. In BRCA1 gene, three large genomic deletions (deletion of exon 20, exon 24, and exons 23, and 24) and the c.5212G>A PV have been characterized as population-specific founder variants by haplotype analysis in the Greek population. The c.1140dupG and c.4136_4137delCT variants in BRCA1 were identified as novel putative founder variants in Middle Eastern patients. In Addition to c.2641G>T, c.68_69delAG, c.5266dupC, and c.1374delC recurrent variants in BRCA1, haplotype analysis confirmed the founder status of c.5771_5774del and c.7934del variants in BRCA2 and revealed an additional founder variant in BRCA2, c.582G>A, in South African families. In Latin America, clear founder effects have been reported in Mexico (BRCA1 del exons 9-12), Brazil (BRCA1 c.5266dupC and BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu), and Colombia (BRCA1 c.3331_3334delCAAG, BRCA1 c.5123 C>A, and BRCA2 c.2808_2811delACAA). In the Middle Eastern population, nine PVs were recurrent in epithelial OC and founder mutation analysis revealed only two mutations (BRCA1 c.4136_4137delCT and BRCA1 c.1140dupG) sharing the same haplotypes thus representing founder mutations. Studying the founder effect of these variants can provide a comprehensive analysis of a population's evolution and its migration pathways.\n\n    The identification of recurrent/founder variants is an extremely important step towards the improvement of genetic counseling since molecular testing can be targeted to the recurrent/founder variant allowing for a more rapid and less expensive test. The high frequency of recurrent/founder variants, allowing for analyzing a large number of cases, might provide accurate information regarding their penetrance and distinguish factors that affect them. Once a risk factor is identified in one subgroup of PV carriers it would need to be tested through other PV carriers. Subsequently, it would need to be tested in a large population-based case-control study of patients with BC and/or OC, in order to determine how important the risk factor is in the general population. Furthermore, the evidence of differences in susceptibility and in age onset of cancer and in the type of cancers that develop among carriers of a founder variant could make it possible to define the role and importance of risk-modifying factors with the resulting improved disease management.\n\n    Furthermore, a specific variant in BRCA genes has been found with high prevalence in restricted populations as a consequence of a founder effect. The specific founder variant of c.303T>G and c.2641G>T in BRCA1 gene were reported in the Yoruba population from Nigeria and in the Afrikaner population from South Africa, respectively. Geographical clustering of c.3481_3491del11 and c.5128G>T variants in BRCA1 in the Alsace-Lorraine region at the North-East and in the north-east of France, respectively, suggests a founder effect. In the southwest of the Netherland, the founder effect of c.4186-1643_4357+2020del3835 variant in BRCA1 gene and c.5351dupA variant in BRCA2 gene were prevalent in Catholic (West Brabant clustering) and Protestant (South Beveland clustering) families, respectively, reflecting religious endogamy. The c.4964_4982del19 variant in BRCA1 gene has been identified as a founder variant in a geographically and historically homogeneous population from Calabria, a south Italian region. Significant regional founder effect has been demonstrated for c.3228_3229delAG, c.3285delA, c.1380dupA, and c.5062_5064del3 variants in BRCA1 gene in Tuscany in central Italy. The c.5062_5064delGTT variant in BRCA1 gene and c.8537_8538delAG variant in BRCA2 gene have been described as founder variants in Middle Sardinia and in South and Middle Sardinia, respectively. Figlioli et al. showed that the BRCA1 c.190T>C is a founder variant in BC families from Bergamo province in the Northern Italian region. The c.3048_3052dupTGAGA variant is the western Swedish BRCA1 founder variant. The BRCA1 c.131G PV was considered a specific founder variant in the Lebanese population. In Saudi Arabia, six PVs were reported to be unique and founder PVs in Saudis with OC; four in BRCA1 gene (c.711_712insTGAA, c.1140dupG, c.5054 C>T, c.5530delC) and two in BRCA2 gene (c.2667delT and c.5760_5770del11) genes.\n\n    The identification of specific BRCA variants could allow us to identify new founder effects for some of these and to quantify the degree of homogeneity within a population. Moreover, it was essential for promoting and potentially advancing rapid founder-based BRCA point-of-care technology as a time- and cost-effective alternative. This discovery can surely help oncologists and cancer genetics professionals to simplify their choices in the genetic screening on high-risk families, on the basis of their ethnic origin, through more accurate estimation of carrier probabilities of BRCA variants. Understanding the contribution of specific variants to BC risk in such a population will help to examine the possibility of conducting population-wide genetic testing for candidate variants that are over-represented in this population. The most well-known and significant examples of recurrent/founder mutations in BRCA genes found worldwide are presented in Table 3.\n\n    The high rates of specific and recurrent/founder PVs have led to a scientifically valid initiative to offer limited genotyping platforms. Establishing a founder effect lies mainly in the reduction of costs. Cost remains a frequently mentioned barrier to genetic testing in some populations such as North Africa. If we manage to decrease costs, screening could be offered more widely and cover a larger number of women, and could offer the benefits of early or pre-symptomatic diagnosis. To date, the eligibility criteria for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing have been expanded and updated. Currently, both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes to women also with personal history of cancer (e.g. multiple primary BCs, if first diagnosis was <=50 years old, early age of BC, co-occurrence of BC and OC, etc.. The three Ashkenazi-Jewish founder PVs (c.66_67del, c.5266dup in BRCA1, and c.5946del in BRCA2) are offered as a variant testing panel for self-reported Ashkenazim. This approach is much less expensive than comprehensive gene sequencing. With advances in sequencing technologies, testing women for the panel of population-specific recurrent/founder variants may be a valuable advance for therapy decisions in BC and OC patients.\n\n    A panel of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, including close to 100 recurrent variants (HISPANEL), has been constructed with diverse variants from Hispanic women with BC from the USA, based on the information in manuscripts describing variants in BRCA genes from Latin American countries and data bases. In Poland, Lukomska et al., recommend that all women with OC and first-degree female relatives should be tested for the panel of 18 founder variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51C. In addition to the known founder deleterious variants in the Chinese population, Jiang et al., highlight that the recurrent PVs in BC patients could be taken as candidate genetic screening loci for a more efficient genetic screening of this population. Studies from Egypt suggest wider screening of the founder PVs (c.68_69del and c.5266dupC in BRCA1) among high-risk families using the Pyrosequencing technique that could be an excellent platform for BRCA founder PVs analysis.\n\n    Identification of specific and recurrent/founder variants that could be included in a low-cost PV panel, used as a first line screening approach, would be useful in the North African region. Advance of a screening panel for specific/recurrent and founder PVs offers a simple, rapid, and affordable routine molecular diagnostic method for the clinical management of BC and/or OC patients and their unaffected family members. The PVs panel can also include other recurrent worldwide PVs such as BRCA1c.1016dupA which has also been reported in other countries (Italy, Germany, and French-Canada), however allelotyping results indicated an independent origin of this PV. That would justify the inclusion of the BRCA1c.1016dupA into targeted variant screening panels in any population, irrespective of ethnic origin.\n\n    In addition, offering a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based Multigene Panel Testing (MGPT) to BC and/or OC patients may significantly increase the detection rates of specific/recurrent and founder PVs in BC and/or OC predisposition genes beyond BRCA. PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, MUTYH, MSH2, and RAD51C have been shown to be the most frequently altered gene in BC and/or OC patients with negative test result for BRCA PVs. Several recurrent or founder PVs have been described among some of these genes. For example, the c.444+1G>A PV was detected in 29% of Slovenian patients with CHEK2 variant. Two splicing PVs in CHEK2 gene, an Eastern European founder variant c.444+1G>A and a novel c.319+2T>A, were recently discovered in Finnish BC patients. The PALB2 c.3113G>A PV was the most recurrent familial variant in Australian BC patients. Two recurrent PALB2 PVs (c.172_175delGA and c.509_510delGA) were observed in Polish BC and/or OC. The c.159delT variant in PALB2 gene was identified as a founder PV in the Finnish population. These genetic alterations can be identified in the European.\n\n    and non-European population and could be tested with the specific/recurrent and founder variants which occur in the BRCA genes for a targeted genetic screening of the first level using NGS-based MGPT. The identification of additional specific/recurrent and founder variants will be important for promoting and potentially advancing to rapid founder-based BRCA and beyond BRCA point-of-care technology as a time- and cost-effective alternative.",

        "Title": "    New recurrent BRCA1/2 mutations in Polish patients with familial breast/ovarian cancer detected by next generation sequencing",
        "Abstract": "    Targeted PCR-based genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 can be performed at a lower cost than full gene testing; however, it may overlook mutations responsible for familial breast and/or ovarian cancers. In the present study, we report the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify new pathogenic variants of BRCA1/2.\n\n    BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons were amplified using the Ion AmpliSeq BRCA1/2 Panel and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer in 512 women with familial and/or only early onset breast and/or ovarian cancers who were negative for selected BRCA1/2 mutations.\n\n    146 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 32 indels were identified. Of them, 14 SNVs and 17 indels were considered as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. One and 18 pathogenic mutations had been detected previously in the Polish and other populations, respectively, and 12 deleterious mutations were previously unknown. Eight mutations were recurrent; Q563X (BRCA1), N3124I (BRCA2) and c.4516delG (BRCA1) were found in eight, six and four patients, respectively, and two other mutations (c.9118-2A > G and c.7249delCA in BRCA2) were detected in three patients each. Altogether, BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations were identified in 52 out of 512 (10%) patients.\n\n    NGS substantially improved the detection rates of a wide spectrum of mutations in Polish patients with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer. Although targeted screening for specific BRCA1 mutations can be offered to all Polish breast or ovarian cancer patients, NGS-based testing is justified in patients with breast or ovarian cancer likely related to BRCA1/2 who test negative for the selected BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations.\n\n    The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12920-015-0092-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Introduction": "    Approximately 5-10% of breast cancers and 10% of ovarian cancers have a hereditary component, which in most cases is associated with clinically significant mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. According to the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), more than 1800 and 2000 distinct variants of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been described, respectively. The incidence and spectrum of mutations vary among populations, and the carrier frequency in general populations ranges between 1/40 and 1/800. Some populations demonstrate a wide spectrum of mutations, while others are characterized by high prevalence of a small number of founder mutations. In Ashkenazi Jews, three founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 comprise 80% to 95% of mutations, respectively. In Poland, the frequency of BRCA1 mutations is estimated to be between 1/240 and 1/360, and two founder mutations, namely, 5382insC and T300G (C61G), account for 70-90% of BRCA1 mutations. None of them is unique to Poland.\n\n    Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Polish women, and is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. The only factor that significantly decreases cancer-related mortality is early diagnosis, and in special cases, prophylactic surgery. Since cancers detected at an early stage of development are asymptomatic or low-symptomatic disorders, early diagnosis of cancer is usually accidental or the result of screening programs. Current cancer screening guidelines for the general population are based on the age of the individual, and patients at risk of developing cancer are identified on the basis of a positive family history of cancer. Families with two first- or second-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancers, with at least one of the cases diagnosed before the age of 50 years, are considered to be at moderate risk, while those with at least three relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancers are considered to be at high risk.\n\n    The mutation status may determine the medical management of patients, including annual screening and prophylactic surgery, and genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is routinely performed in women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk. More than 100,000 individuals in the United States undergo BRCA testing annually. However, since BRCA testing is a costly procedure (the current charge for full gene sequencing is several hundred to thousands of dollars), most genetic counseling programs recommend less expensive targeted screening for specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations rather than full gene testing.\n\n    Next generation sequencing (NGS) offers a powerful, faster, and cheaper alternative for targeted sequencing aimed at identifying non-synonymous, splicing, and stop codon variants exhibiting deleterious consequences in the coding genes. As a consequence, several NGS-based workflows for clinical BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing were recently proposed.\n\n    In a previous study from our group, we used multiplexed PCR-based genotyping technology and showed that the frequency of selected BRCA1 mutations was moderate in familial and high in nonfamilial breast cancers. In addition, a strong founder effect was confirmed for BRCA1 mutations but not for BRCA2 mutations in the Polish population. In the present study, we show that the use of the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer to sequence the coding exons of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes substantially improves the detection rates of a wide spectrum of mutations in Polish patients with familial and/or only early onset of breast and/or ovarian cancers.",
        "Methods": "    Patients whose blood samples were collected between 2003 and 2010 were selected from the registry of the Genetic Counseling Unit, Warsaw Cancer Center-Institute of Oncology. The personal and familial cancer histories were acquired by in-depth interviews. Healthy individuals with no known personal or familial history of malignancy, normal results of screening colonoscopy, and normal mammography or PSA levels were recruited primarily from the National Colorectal Cancer Screening Program. All patients and control subjects were Polish Caucasians recruited from the Masovian voivodeship population. Informed consent for hereditary cancer genetic testing was obtained from all of the patients. The permission for genetic testing was granted by the Ethical Committee at Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology on 9 May 2002 (No. 28/2002) and further extended to include testing with NGS on 11 June 2013 (No. 28/2002/1/2013). The study did not require ethical approval.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood as described previously. DNA concentration was determined on a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer using the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies). For library preparation, a set of reagents from the Ion AmpliSeq  Library Kit 2.0 (Life Technologies) and Ion AmpliSeq BRCA1 and BRCA2 Panel, which comprises 167 primer pairs spanning 16.25 kb, were used to amplify the coding regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Amplification for each patient was performed using three separate primer pools containing 1.4 mul of 5x Ion AmpliSeq  HiFi Master Mix, 3.5 mul of 2x Ion AmpliSeq Primer Pool, and 3 ng of DNA in a total reaction volume of 7 mul. Cycling conditions were as follows: 99 C for 2 min, followed by 19 cycles of 99 C for 15 sec and 60 C for 4 min, ending with a hold at 10 C. At this point, three separate reactions for a given patient were combined, and amplicons were partially digested at primer sequences with 2 mul of FuPa reagent under conditions provided by the manufacturer in The Ion AmpliSeq DNA and RNA Library Preparation protocol (Revision B.0). Subsequent steps of library preparation were performed according to the above protocol. Briefly, following digestion, samples were subjected to sequencing adapter ligation with either 16 or 32 indexing barcodes, and purified with the AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter). The DNA library was eluted from AMPure XP beads with 52 mul of PCR reagent solution consisting of 50 mul of Platinum PCR Super Mix HiFi and 2 mul of Library Amplification Primer Mix, and amplified under the following conditions: 98 C for 2 min, followed by five cycles of 98 C for 15 sec and 64 C for 1 min, ending with a hold at 10 C. Next, the amplified DNA library was subjected to a two-round purification process using AMPure XP beads with 0.5x and 1.2x bead-to-sample volume ratios, respectively. Library concentrations were determined with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies), and the respective size distributions were determined with the High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit on Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).\n\n    Library molarity was determined, and either 16 or 32 libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations and used for automatic template preparation on Ion Chef using reagents from the Ion PGM IC 200 Kit and Ion 316 Chip Kit v2 BC. Sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer using 500-flow runs. Data from the PGM runs were processed on the Ion Torrent server using a platform-specific pipeline incorporated in Torrent Suite v4.2.1 (Life Technologies) to obtain sequence reads, trim adapter sequences, filter and remove poor signal reads, and assign the reads to a given barcode. The reads were mapped to the hg19 (Homo sapiens) reference genome and adjusted to the specific amplicon target regions deposited in the \"BRCA1_2.20131001.designed\" BED file available in Torrent Suite. The coverageAnalysis (v4.2.1.4) and variantCaller (v4.2.1.0) plug-ins with a set of default parameters optimized for the BRCA1/BRCA2 panel were obtained from www.Ampliseq.com, and were ran for each sequencing dataset.\n\n    Variants were classified either as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or insertion/deletion (indels) variants using a python script. Variants were annotated using data from BIC for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The identified variants were matched to existing variants in BIC according to four parameters as follows: chromosome number (chromosome 13 and chromosome 17 for BRCA2 and BRCA1, respectively); position of the variant in the human genome assembly hg19 (GRCh37), which was retrieved from the BIC database field HGVS; genomic and type of reference; and alternate base. The possibility of different alternate and reference base was taken into account as well as the possibility of variant on the reverse strand.\n\n    All the SNVs were analyzed using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for the human genome assembly hg19 (GRCh37). The occurrence of variants was determined using an R script. Variants with unknown clinical significance in BIC and new changes were subjected to in silico analysis of their deleteriousness, and screened for evidence of pathogenicity in the literature.\n\n    SNVs and indels were analyzed using Condel and SIFT Indel, respectively. Missense variants were classified as pathogenic when reported in BIC as pathogenic, and/or predicted as pathogenic by a Condel score, and identified through a literature search. Frameshift mutations were classified as pathogenic when reported as pathogenic by BIC and/or predicted as pathogenic by SIFT Indel.\n\n    Pathogenic mutations detected by NGS were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In addition, five selected variants, namely, Q356R, N3124I, Q563X, c.7249delCA, and c.9118-2G > A, were genotyped using Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Life Technologies, USA) and a 7900HT Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies) as described previously.",
        "Results": "    The incidence of SNVs and indels within 167 amplicons covering the BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons was tested using the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer in 31 (a training set) and 512 women with breast cancer or ovarian cancer newly diagnosed before the age of 50 years who were positive and negative for BRCA1/2 mutations, respectively, as determined by targeted genotyping. The genotyping comprised 11 mutations in BRCA1, namely c.66_67delAG, C61R, c.3700_3704del5, c.3756delGTCT, c.3777delT, c.4035delA, c.4041delAG, c.4065delTCAA, c.5263delC, R1738E and R1751X, and nine mutations in BRCA2, namely E394X, c.5239insT, c.5946delT, c.5964delAT, c.6447delTA, c.7910del5, c.8924delT, R3128X and c.9402delT. Of the 512 women, 317 had familial breast and/or ovarian cancer, and 195 had only early onset cancer and/or contralateral breast and ovarian cancers; the median age of women with breast cancer at diagnosis was 43 years.\n\n    The average number of bases with >= Q17/>=Q20 across all 21 PGM sequencing runs was 343/324 Mbp, constituting 96/90% of total output. The average coverage across all samples was 507, whereas the mean mapping rate reached 94%.\n\n    The NGS-based procedure confirmed the pathogenic mutations in all 31 DNA samples of a training set (not shown). Among 512 DNA samples analyzed, we identified 146 SNVs (64 in BRCA1 and 82 in BRCA2) and 32 indels (20 in BRCA1 and 12 in BRCA2). Sixteen indels were found in coding regions (nine in BRCA1 and seven in BRCA2). The results of the detailed analysis of SNVs and indels are summarized in Additional file 1.\n\n    The types and number of SNVs are summarized in Table 1. Of these, eight SNVs (five in BRCA1 and three in BRCA2) were already reported in BIC as pathogenic. Three additional SNVs were reported as variants of uncertain significance (VUS); variants co-localized with these SNVs were reported as pathogenic in ClinVar. In addition, we identified three novel nonsense variants (Table 2). Of 41 missense variants that were either reported as VUS in BIC or had not been reported previously, 24 had at least one transcript in which the Condel score was reported as deleterious (Table 3).\n\n    Of the indels identified in the present study, five in BRCA1 and two in BRCA2 had already been reported in BIC as pathogenic. One additional indel was reported as unknown in BIC, although its co-located variants in dbSNP were reported in ClinVar as pathogenic (Table 4). We also found nine novel indels in coding regions (Table 4).\n\n    Altogether, among 512 patients in whom the previous targeted genotyping did not reveal a pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation massive amplicon sequencing identified 52 patients with 31 deleterious mutations, of which sixteen were frameshift, eight were nonsense, three were missense, and four affected splicing. Of note, one patient carried two pathogenic mutations, namely Q563X and N3124I. All pathogenic variants were confirmed by Sanger direct sequencing. Five other variants were likely pathogenic, and 17 variants were VUS. All of them were missense mutations (Table 3).\n\n    Using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, the incidence of five selected variants, one common polymorphism (Q356R) and four mutations (N3124I, Q563X, c.7249delCA, and c.9118-2G > A) were tested in additional group of 445 cancer patients diagnosed under the age of 50 and 1300 healthy individuals (856 women and 444 men with a median age of 59 years).\n\n    Although Q356R was described as pathogenic in ClinVar, its prevalence was similar among patients (15.1%) and healthy controls (16.9%). Therefore, the clinical significance of this polymorphic variant was not confirmed. By contrast, Q563X was detected in 5 (1.1%) out of 445 cancer patients, respectively, but only in one healthy individual. The three other mutations (N3124I, c.7249delCA, and c.9118-2G > A) were detected by TaqMan genotyping only in DNA samples in which they were identified by NGS.",
        "Conclusion": "    NGS testing might be routine for many genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, the cost of complete genetic testing is significantly higher than that of conventional PCR-based genetic testing; the internal costs in our institution, excluding personnel and overhead, are $120 vs. $20. Therefore, introducing the NGS to routine genotyping of BRCA (and other genes) in clinical practice would need additional financial support from public healthcare systems. Instead, targeted screening for specific BRCA1 mutations performed at the reasonable costs can be offered to all breast or ovarian cancer patients in the Polish population, regardless of the family history or the age of disease onset. Since PCR-based cost-efficient testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 can detect mainly pre-selected mutations, the more recurrent mutations included in the screening, the greater efficiency of the testing.\n\n    In the present study, we identified two mutations, namely, Q563X (BRCA1) and N3124I (BRCA2), showing a strong founder effect in the Polish patients with a hereditary risk of ovarian/breast cancer. These mutations should be included in the set of mutations analyzed in PCR-based targeted screening programs in Poland. Sanger direct sequencing should be used to confirm the presence of a pathogenic mutation detected by PCR- or NGS-based genotyping, and it is the method of choice for cascade screening of relatives of the index patient. Finally, NGS-based testing of all coding exons in both genes may be reserved for patients with breast or ovarian cancer that is more likely related to BRCA. These considerations for the comprehensive assessment of pathogenic mutations in breast and ovarian cancers are exemplified for BRCA1 C1501X mutation found in multiple family members during conducting this study (Table 5 and Additional file 2). However, further studies are required to determine which clinical features may better define a feasible link between breast/ovarian cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations.",
        "Discussion": "    The rare germline pathogenic BRCA1 mutations increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer to approximately 80% and 60%, respectively, whereas BRCA2 mutations increase breast cancer risk to more than 80% by the age of 80. Because the risk of cancer can be predicted by a family history and/or by an early disease onset, the Genetic Counseling Unit at the Warsaw Cancer Center-Institute of Oncology offers risk counseling based on the occurrence of cancer in the pedigree. However, according to Polish guidelines and recommendations, the government sponsored surveillance program, which includes annual mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging, pelvic ultrasonography, and cancer antigen 125 levels, is provided only to women with known pathogenic mutations. Therefore, in families with an increased cancer risk, genetic testing is critical for preventive healthcare, including specialized surveillance programs and prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy, which reduce the risk of breast/ovarian cancer by over 90%. The detection of BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations facilitates the selection of patients and the delivery of healthcare and related services in women harboring their respective germline mutations.\n\n    Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are present in more than 60% and 30% of families, respectively, our targeted mutation screening detected 20.8% and 1.3% of patients carrying pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, respectively. This suggests that a proportion of mutations responsible for familial breast and/or ovarian cancers were not identified. In the present study, we report the utility of NGS for the detection of new pathogenic variants of BRCA1/2.\n\n    Among 512 DNA samples analyzed, we identified 146 SNVs and 32 indels, of which 14 SNVs and 17 indels were considered as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. One and 18 pathogenic mutations had been detected previously in the Polish and other populations, respectively, and 12 deleterious mutations had not been detected earlier. Eight mutations were recurrent; Q563X, N3124I and c.4516delG were found in eight, six and four patients, respectively, and two other mutations (c.9118-2A > G and c.7249delCA) were detected in three patients each (Figure 1). Overall, sequencing of BRCA1/2 coding exons identified additional predicted cancer risk mutations in 52 out of 512 (10%) patients with familial and/or an early onset breast/ovarian cancer that were missed using our standard genotyping procedure. The incidence of new pathogenic mutations was higher in women with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer [26 mutations (17.9%) in 145 patients] than those representing only familial breast cancer [26 (7.1%) in 367 patients]. These mutations could be used for estimation of cancer risk in index patients and for cascade screening.\n\n    The pathogenicity of nonsense and frameshift mutations was relatively easily established; however, the functional consequences of several missense, intronic, and small in-frame insertion/deletions were not as evident, and reaching an adequate conclusion and providing advice regarding their significance were challenging tasks. These unclassified VUSs are not communicated to the patient or to non-genetic professionals to avoid increasing healthcare utilization and costs associated with unnecessary physician visits and imaging tests. Therefore, it is urgent to develop functional studies to evaluate the pathogenicity of a suspected variant and determine its involvement in breast and/or ovarian cancer development. New genome editing techniques enable the assessment of genetic variants, including those of uncertain significance, in a native chromosomal context. For example, in a proof of concept study, known mutations and artificial variants in exon18 BRCA1 were introduced using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, resulting in traceable changes in BRCA1 mRNA splicing and abundance. Such an approach, when scaled up, allows the evaluation of the combination effects of variants on splicing and transcript levels in any gene.\n\n    The overall mutation prevalence in the combined results of previous targeted genotyping studies and the present amplicon sequencing was >30% in a group of patients with early onset breast/ovarian cancer. However, the negative results of genetic testing may not be universally informative for assessing cancer risk and do not rule out hereditary predisposition. The lack of detection of pathogenic mutations in families affected by an increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer may result not only from misinterpretation of determined variants, but also from incorrect selection of index women and/or the genetic analytical range. Additionally, for some populations the large rearrangements in BRCA1/2 genes have been described in a significant proportion of families with strong breast/ovarian cancer history. However, in Poland such testing is not routinely performed since no founder mutations were described. In addition, amplicon sequencing with PGM platform does not seem to be a method ready for searching of BRCA1/2 large rearrangements in genetic counseling.\n\n    The presence of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes other than BRCA1/2 may also lead to the development of hereditary breast/ovarian cancers. An NGS 25-gene panel revealed that the frequency of mutations in genes other than BRCA1/2 is 4.3%, of which 3.9% are in genes associated with breast/ovarian cancer. The 4.3% frequency of germline mutations in additional cancer susceptibility genes was also detected through analyses of breast cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. However, with the exception of PALB2, most of these predisposition genes do not reach the same degree of significance as BRCA1 predisposition, and in contrast to BRCA1/2 mutations, neither age at breast cancer diagnosis nor family history of ovarian or young breast cancer are predictive factors for other mutations.",

        "Title": "    BRCA1 And BRCA2 analysis of Argentinean breast/ovarian cancer patients selected for age and family history highlights a role for novel mutations of putative south-American origin",
        "Abstract": "    The spectrum of BRCA1/2 genetic variation in breast-ovarian cancer patients has been scarcely investigated outside Europe and North America, with few reports for South America, where Amerindian founder effects and recent multiracial immigration are predicted to result in high genetic diversity. We describe here the results of BRCA1/BRCA2 germline analysis in an Argentinean series of breast/ovarian cancer patients selected for young age at diagnosis or breast/ovarian cancer family history.\n\n    The study series (134 patients) included 37 cases diagnosed within 40 years of age and no family history (any ethnicity, fully-sequenced), and 97 cases with at least 2 affected relatives (any age), of which 57 were non-Ashkenazi (fully-sequenced) and 40 Ashkenazi (tested only for the founder mutations c.66_67delAG and c.5263insC in BRCA1 and c.5946delT in BRCA2).\n\n    We found 24 deleterious mutations (BRCA1:16; BRCA2: 8) in 38/134 (28.3%) patients, of which 6/37 (16.2%) within the young age group, 15/57 (26.3%) within the non-Ahkenazi positive for family history; and 17/40 (42.5%) within the Ashkenazi. Seven pathogenetic mutations were novel, five in BRCA1: c.1502_1505delAATT, c.2626_2627delAA c.2686delA, c.2728 C > T, c.3758_3759delCT, two in BRCA2: c.7105insA, c.793 + 1delG. We also detected 72 variants of which 54 previously reported and 17 novel, 33 detected in an individual patient. Four missense variants of unknown clinical significance, identified in 5 patients, are predicted to affect protein function. While global and European variants contributed near 45% of the detected BRCA1/2 variation, the significant fraction of new variants (25/96, 26%) suggests the presence of a South American genetic component.\n\n    This study, the first conducted in Argentinean patients, highlights a significant impact of novel BRCA1/2 mutations and genetic variants, which may be regarded as putatively South American, and confirms the important role of founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Argentinean Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n    The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/2193-1801-1-20) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary breast cancer accounts for 5-10% of all BC cases and is characterized by dominant inheritance, premenopausal diagnosis, more severe course, bilaterality and frequent association with ovarian cancer (OC). The identification of the two major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer genes, BRCA1 (17q21, MIM* 113705) in 1994 and BRCA2 (13q14, MIM* 600185) in 1995, led to a new era in the diagnosis of inherited high predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. Breast-ovarian cancer (BOC)-causing mutations and other genetic variants are distributed along the entire coding and non-coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2, and more than 3400 gene variants have been described in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC). New variants continue to be detected worldwide, mostly in BRCA1.\n\n    The prevalences of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in BOC patients with early onset (EO) and/or BOC family history (FH) appear to be similar across race/ethnicity, but there is evidence of important racial and/or geographic differences in the spectrum of BRCA1/2 genetic variation, including pathogenic mutations and variants of uncertain significance. These differences may reflect population history and genetic drifts, and could have a significant impact on genetic counselling, genetic testing, and follow-up care. A typical example is provided by the case of Ashkenazi Jews, where three founder mutations: BRCA1 c.66_67delAG BRCA1 c.5263insC, and BRCA2 c.5946delT account for most of familial breast-ovarian cancer. Founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jews in Israel: frequency and differential penetrance in ovarian cancer and in breast-ovarian cancer families.\n\n    BRCA1/2 mutation status in subsets of BOC patients selected for age, BOC family history and ethnicity has been scarcely investigated outside Europe and North America, with few reports for South America, where Native American founder effects and the complex multiracial demography of recent immigration are predicted to result in high genetic variation. Indeed, recent studies point to a role of Native American ancestry in BRCA1/2 disease patterns in Central and Northern America. Epidemiological data indicate that in Argentina BC incidence and mortality rates are among the highest in the world. The historical records and epidemiological and molecular studies point to variable degrees of admixture among European, mainly Spanish and Italian, and Native American components in more than 50% of the Argentinean population. Regarding autosomal evidence of admixture, the relative European, Native American, and West African genetic contributions to the Argentinean gene pool were estimated to be 67.55%, 25.9%, and 6.5%, respectively.\n\n    Our study is the first report describing BRCA1/BRCA2 gene variants in Argentinean BOC patients, and highlights a significant impact of novel mutations and genetic variants which may be regarded as putatively South American. On the other hand, we confirm the key role of founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Argentinean Ashkenazi Jews.",
        "Methods": "    The study includes 134 BOC probands selected either for age at cancer diagnosis or for family history (FH), according to the criteria listed in Table 1. The patients selected for diagnosis within 40 years of age and no BOC FH (EO patients, any ethnicity) included 37 cases (21 with BC, 13 with OC, 3 with BOC; age range 12-40 years, mean age 31.0 +- 7.5 years). The FH patients (any age, 97 cases overall), selected based on the presence of at least two BOC-affected 1st or 2nd degree relatives, included 57 non-Ashkenazi patients (32 with BC, 18 with OC, 7 with BOC, age range 26-71 years, mean 44.6 +- 10.9 years), and 40 Ashkenazi patients (32 with BC, 6 with OC and 2 with BOC, age range: 32-64 years, mean age 47.1 +- 9.9 years) (Tables 1 and 2). The Ashkenazi subset was tested only for the panel of the three founder Ashkenazi mutations (c.66_67delAG (reported in BIC as 185delAG), and c.5263insC (in BIC as 5382insC) in BRCA1 and c.5946delT (in BIC as 6174delT) in BRCA2); all the other cases were fully sequenced.\n\n    Blood samples were sent from the participating centers to the Laboratory HRDC of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires, and were also recruited at the Centro de Estudios Medicos e Investigaciones Clinicas (CEMIC). Study eligibility required signing an informed consent as a result of the routine procedures for genetic analysis. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sociedad Argentina de Investigacion Clinica.\n\n    Genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA blood purification kit (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com). The coding sequences and exon-intron boundaries of the BRCA1-2 genes were analyzed by amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with alternative primers to avoid false results due to polymorphisms, followed by direct sequencing of at least 55 amplicons, to ensure overlapping of the segments. Sequencing was performed using either an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer or an Applied Biosystems ABI PRISM   310 Genetic Analyzer. Homozygosis (HO) was confirmed by alternative sequencing in exonic and/or intronic regions. The three Ashkenazi mutations were tested as described. Variants nomenclature follows the guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Tables provide lists including also the nomenclature of the Cancer Information Core Internet Website (BIC), April 2012.\n\n    Effects of the missense mutations that resulted not reported or recorded as clinically unknown (CU) in the BIC were predicted by virtual analyses of functional compatibility for aminoacid changes using two programs: Align-GVGD (http://agvgd.iarc.fr/) and SIFT (http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/).",
        "Results": "    We describe for the first time in Argentina the results of BRCA1/BRCA2 germline analysis in 134 BOC probands selected either for diagnosis within 40 years of age (37 cases) or for FH (97 cases) (Tables 1 and 2). The latter included 40 Ashkenazi patients, tested only for the three founder Ashkenazi mutations. All the other cases were fully sequenced.\n\n    Overall 96 mutations and sequence variants, of which 53 in BRCA1 and 43 in BRCA2, were identified in 94/134 patients analyzed. Mutation types, effects, carrier frequencies, worldwide occurrences and relevant references are listed in online Additional file 1: Tables S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2. The sequence variants were classified as pathogenic based on literature data and/or when predicted to truncate/inactivate the protein product.\n\n    Among the 53 sequence variants identified in BRCA1 15 are novel and 17 clinically unknown, 14 introduce a stop codon; 22 are missense substitutions (Additional file 1: Table S1). With regard to the 43 BRCA2 mutations, 9 are novel, 17 clinically unknown, 6 introduce a stop codon; 15 are missense substitutions and one is predicted to result in an aberrant splice (Additional file 2: Table S2). The truncating mutations and the novel non-truncating variants predicted to affect the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products are described in Table 3. Synonyms, intronic and polymorphic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants ranged from 4 to 33 per individual patients and were detected in all the 94 fully-sequenced cases (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). Notably, 34 variants are listed in BIC as of clinically unknown importance, and of these 14 were identified in unique patients (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2).\n\n    Overall, a total of 24 bona fide pathogenetic mutations, 16 in BRCA1 and 8 in BRCA2, were detected in 38/134 cases (28.4%), including: a) 6/37 (16.2%) fully-sequenced patients in the group within 40 years of age; b) 15/57 (26.3%) fully-sequenced non-Ashkenazi FH patients; c) 17/40 (42.5%) Ashkenazi FH patients, analyzed for the three Ashkenazi mutations only (Table 2). The pathogenetic mutations were more frequent in BRCA1 (23/38, 60.5%) than in BRCA2 (15/38, 39.5%), which is in agreement with literature data.\n\n    The Ashkenazi-FH patients with age <=40 years showed the highest frequency of pathogenetic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, i.e., 58.3% (for BRCA1 16.7% in c.66_67delAG and 8.3% in c.5263insC and 33.3% for BRCA2 c.5946delT), in agreement with literature frequencies. The detection rate of bona fide pathogenetic mutations in FH-negative probands selected for age within 40 years at diagnosis was 6/37 (16.2%). This falls within the 15-31% range reported in the literature for EO BOC with FH, but is in contrast with the lack of mutations reported in EO Chilean patients without FH. The published data on the South American population show lower rates of mutation detection, while in agreement with results from a study in the USA and a large study in high risk Hispanic family from USA and also with an study of Hispanic BOC from Colombia. Differences in mutation detection rates might reflect divergences in the criteria of proband selection and in the methods of analysis. In fact, the other South American reports were based on indirect mutation detection methods and not on full sequencing; in contrast, we used direct sequencing of all the amplicons along the BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences and exon-intron boundaries.\n\n    It may be of interest to compare the deleterious mutation rates of the young patients with no FH (16.2%) and of the FH cases of similar age (within 40 years) in the non-Ashkenazi and Ashkenazi groups (Table 3). Notably, a pathogenetic mutation was found in 6/31 (19.4%) non-Ashkenazi FH patients within 40 years of age (mean age 35.6 +- 4.8 years) and in 7/12 (58.3%) FH Ashkenazi cases within the same age cutoff (mean 35.6 +- 2.8 years). The recurrent Ashkenazi mutations were never detected in non-Ashkenazi probands. BRCA1 c.66_67delAG, BRCA1 c.5263insC and BRCA2 c.5946delT were found in 7 (17.5%), 2 (5%) and 8 (20%) Ashkenazi probands, respectively. Interestingly, BRCA2 c.5946delT was also found in a non-Ashkenazi FH patient who could recall a great grand mother of Ashkenazi origin. Conversely, only a non-Ashkenazi pathogenetic mutation (Asp2723His in BRCA2) was detected in one of 4 patients of Ashkenazi origin included in the subset selected for early diagnosis and no FH. This supports the full sequencing of EO Ashkenazi patients with no BOC FH.\n\n    With regard to disease association, the pathogenetic mutations in BRCA1 occurred in 16/88 BC cases (18.2%), 5/24 OC cases (20.8%) and 2/22 BOC cases (9.1%), those in BRCA2 in 13/88 BC cases (14.8%), 1/24 OC cases (4.2%) and 1/22 BOC cases (4.5%). As expected, OC was more frequent in BRCA1 carriers (21.7% vs 6.7%), and BC in BRCA2 carriers (86.6% vs 65.2%).\n\n    Seven pathogenic mutations (18.4% of all the mutations detected) were putatively novel: 5 in BRCA1 (21.7% for this gene), all with frameshifts generating stop codons in exon 11, and 2 in BRCA2 (13.3% for this gene), one with a frameshift at nt 2369, exon 14 (c7333 insA), the other (c.793 + 1delG) affecting the donor splicing site nucleotide at IVS + 1 delG in intron 9 (Table 3).\n\n    The frequency of the common non-pathogenic variants and synonyms was in agreement with that reported in the BIC. The mutations reported in BIC as CU that we detected in multiple patients as homozygous (in parenthesis number of cases) and/or in association with deleterious mutations, such as p. Gln356Arg, IVS7 + 36 C > T, IVS7 + 41 C > T, IVS14-63 C > G, and IVS18 + 66 G > A in BRCA1 and p. Val2171Val (9), p. Ala2466Val (4), IVS8 + 56 C > T, IVS9 + 65delT, IVS10 + 12delT, and IVS11 + 80delTTAA (1) in BRCA2 most probably represent non-pathogenic variants. Furthermore, based on prediction programs, homozygous status, detection in multiple unrelated patients and/or association with pathogenic mutations, 10 variants found in the present study and not reported in the BIC can be considered non pathogenic. These include p. Val122Asp, p. Gln139Lys, IVS7 + 38 T > C, IVS7 + 49 del 15 bp, in BRCA1 and c*110 A > C at 3'UTR in BRCA2 (two other novel BRCA2 variants, i.e., IVS4 + 246 G > C and IVS4 + 364delT, located far from the end of the exon 4 are reported here only as heterozygosity markers).\n\n    Five of the 28 missense variants (Table 4) (i.e., p. Arg7Cys, p. Cys61Gly, p. Arg71Gly, p. Tyr179Cys, and p. Met1652Thr in BRCA1, p. Asp2723His in BRCA2) were predicted to have an impact on protein structure upon evaluation by SIFT and GVGD (Table 4). BRCA1 p. Arg7Cys, differently from the other non-conservative variants, has a rather low prediction score and was found in two cases. The high prediction values for BRCA1 p. Cys61Gly and BRCA1 p. Arg71gly agree with their previously reported pathogenicity (Table 4). Few reported data are available for BRCA2 p. Asp2723His. BRCA1 p. Met1652Thr, located in the BRCT tandem repeat region is predicted to result in a large volume change in rigid neighbourhood but structural and functional assays show normal peptide binding specificity and transcriptional activity. Tyr179Cys is also located in a highly conserved region and is listed as clinically importance unknown (CU) in BIC. Notably BRCA1 Tyr179Cys co-occurred with two other missense mutations, i.e., Phe486Leu and Asn550His, in an FH patient affected with pagetoid BC (AB80). These 3 mutations, already reported to occur together, may constitute a rare haplotype [brca.iarc.fr/LOVD].\n\n    In agreement with the complex population history of Argentina, the BRCA1/2 mutations detected in this BOC series were associated with diverse geographic/ethnic backgrounds (Figure 1 and online Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). Of the 96 detected variants, 25 (26%) are not reported in the BIC, in HapMap and in the current literature, and are thus putatively unique for Argentina, 17 (17.7%) were reported worldwide (at least 3 continents), 4 (4.2%) were reported only in Latin-America. The remaining variants comprise mutations previously detected in Europe, Asia and North America. (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). The putative Latin American variants include p. Ile2490Thr in BRCA2, a modestly penetrant variant that might contribute to sporadic breast cancer risk, listed as CU in the BIC, originally described in a Caribbean patient and reported almost 100 times in the BIC, frequently associated to Latin American probands. In this line, several novel variants were previously observed in Argentina in genes related to other hereditary syndromes and might be regarded as putatively regional or influenced by founding events,. In the present case series this mutation recurred in six cases (Table 4, Figure 1)\n\n    Two other mutations related to South American ethnicity deserve mention: 1) BRCA1 IVS7 + 37 del14bp(TTTTCTTTTTTTTT), not listed in BIC but found in 10/42 families from Uruguay (including one with a pathogenetic mutation in BRCA2), and in a patient from Chile; and 2) BRCA2 IVS16-14 T > C, reported in a patient from Uruguay and detected in 31 of our patients (including 4 with identified pathogenic mutations).",
        "Conclusion": "    The present study is the first reporting the spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in an Argentinean BOC series, based on the analysis of the coding sequences and exon-intron boundaries of both genes. Given that the rates of BC incidence and mortality in Argentina are among the highest in the world, a better understanding of the impact of BRCA1/BRCA2-related disease in Argentinean BOC patients is important for the implementation of prevention and/or early detection strategies. In our case series selected for early diagnosis with no FH or for FH independently of age at diagnosis, the overall detection rate of bona fide pathogenetic mutations was quite high (38/134, 28.3%). This could rise to 35.8% (48/134) including the missense mutations suspected to confer increasing risk of breast cancer.\n\n    Although global and European sequence variants contribute to near 45% of the detected BRCA1/2 variation, the significant fraction of new variants putatively unique for Argentina detected in the present study might suggest the presence of a Native American genetic component, not yet genetically characterized, that it in recent centuries has come to admixture with alleles mostly of European origin.",

        "Title": "    BRCA1 Haploinsufficiency Leads to Altered Expression of Genes Involved in Cellular Proliferation and Development",
        "Abstract": "    The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies. However, the current test is expensive, and cannot differentiate between pathogenic variants and those that may be benign. Focusing only on one of the two BRCA partners, we have developed a biological assay for haploinsufficiency of BRCA1. Using a series of EBV-transformed cell lines, we explored gene expression patterns in cells that were BRCA1 wildtype compared to those that carried (heterozygous) BRCA1 pathogenic mutations. We identified a subset of 43 genes whose combined expression pattern is a sensitive predictor of BRCA1 status. The gene set was disproportionately made up of genes involved in cellular differentiation, lending credence to the hypothesis that single copy loss of BRCA1 function may impact differentiation, rendering cells more susceptible to undergoing malignant processes.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths throughout the western world. While the majority of breast cancer cases are sporadic, 5-10% are classified as hereditary, and are due to the presence of a mutation in a breast cancer predisposition gene. Approximately half of all hereditary breast cancers are due to a mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, and approximately 80% of individuals with a mutation in either of these genes develop breast cancer by the age of 70 years. Because of the high risk of cancer in individuals with these mutations, their early and accurate identification targets them for increased surveillance and/or protective interventions such as surgery.\n\n    However, the task of identifying carriers of BRCA mutations is complicated by our continued lack of understanding of the specific biological mechanisms that are impacted by mutation of either gene. Additionally, the consistent evaluation of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 as a gene set implies that functional assays must necessarily be broad enough to capture activities of both proteins, an unreasonably difficult task. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on each of the genes as an independent problem to highlight the approach for development of a biological assay to explore loss of a complex protein. The work described here is focused on measurement of loss of BRCA1 function.\n\n    Since the identification of BRCA1 almost two decades ago, the molecular pathways in which BRCA1 functions and how disruptions of these functions promote breast and ovarian carcinogenesis remains a mystery. The human BRCA1 gene encodes an 1863 amino-acid protein, containing two highly conserved domains in the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. At the N-terminus lies a RING domain, a cysteine rich zinc-binding motif that functions as an E3 ligase enzyme involved ubiquitination. Two tandem repeat globular domains termed BRCT, a common feature of proteins involved in the DNA damage repair and cell cycle control, lie at the C-terminus. Functionally, BRCA1 has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular functions, including ubiquitination, regulation of the G1/S, intra-S and G2/M-phase cell cycle checkpoint control, regulation of spindle pole body duplication, transcription, sex chromosome inactivation and homologous recombination repair of double stranded DNA breaks. Taken together, these individual roles suggest a function for BRCA1 in the maintenance of genomic integrity. BRCA1 has also been suggested to a play a role in the differentiation of breast epithelial cells, with loss of BRCA1 function leading to impaired acini formation in 3D culture and an accumulation of less differentiated cells with altered proliferation properties.\n\n    Current methods for the identification of BRCA1 carriers are based on gene sequence variations. One of the inherent difficulties in this approach is in differentiating between clinically important changes and benign polymorphisms in these genes. While BRCA1 mutations that result in a truncated protein can usually unequivocally be called disease-causing, many other mutations, termed variants of unknown significance (VUS) are more difficult to interpret in a clinical context. Approximately 13% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic tests reveal mutations identified as VUSs.\n\n    Tracking how specific BRCA1 mutations segregate with disease within families as well as case-control studies provide the most reliable information for classifying VUS as pathogenic or neutral. Case control studies are made difficult, however, by the rarity of specific mutations in the population, while segregation studies suffer from uncertainties generated by the high likelihood of phenocopies among the affected, and the potential for late onset cancer in the unaffected. In cases where clinical data are not available to classify VUS, several functional assays have been developed to assess the effects of individual mutations on specific BRCA1 functions, including a transcriptional activation assay, phosphopeptide binding assay, ubiquitin ligase activity assay and an embryonic stem-cell based functional assay. However these functional assays can be technically complex and are limited to mutations in specific domains impacting particular functions. Regardless of whether the \"correct\" function is targeted in such assays, the requirement to assay multiple complex biochemical functions precludes the use of this approach in the clinical laboratory setting.\n\n    Given the pleiotropic roles of BRCA1, and the potential for individual mutations to lead to tumorigenesis via different mechanisms, the development of a functional assay for BRCA1 presents a significant challenge. However, because BRCA1 evidently plays a central role in many critical pathways that converge on the maintenance of genomic integrity, we hypothesized that there was a high likelihood that loss of even a single copy of BRCA1 would have a measurable impact on the expression of downstream genes involved in one or more of these pathways. Indeed, BRCA1 haploinsufficiency has been shown in several studies to alter the differentiation and proliferation pathways of breast epithelial/progenitor cells in patients carrying a BRCA1 mutation.\n\n    Evidence lending support to the idea of carrier-phenotype expression profiling comes from several studies, including small-scale studies on BRCA1 carrier fibroblasts following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Bellacosa et al. 2010, showed that BRCA1 carriers had altered gene expression profiles in cultured primary breast and ovarian epithelial cells compared to non-carriers. Another recent study showed that lymphocytes from BRCA1 mutation carriers demonstrated altered gene expression profiles following exposure to IR, which could be used as a prediction tool to identify BRCA1 mutation carriers. Here, we sought to determine whether EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines heterozygous for BRCA1 mutations could be distinguished from control cell lines using whole genome gene expression profiling.",
        "Methods": "    EBV-transformed lymphocytes (LCLs) were obtained through the NIH Breast Cancer Family Registries. The 69 cell lines used in this study included 38 control (BRCA1+/+) and 31 BRCA1 mutation carriers (BRCA1+/-). The carrier cell lines included frameshift, missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations; a list of the BRCA1 mutations is shown in Table 1. All LCLs used in this study were cultured in RPMI-1640 media (Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, ON) supplemented with non-heat inactivated 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma Aldrich). All cell culture was carried out in 25 cm2 flasks (Corning, Nepean, ON) at 37 C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were split in a 2:1 ratio until the desired cell number of 650,000 cells/ml was reached. Where noted, DNA damage was induced through exposure to 2 Gy ionizing radiation (IR), delivered by a 137Cs Victoreen Electrometer (Atomic Energy of Canada, Mississauga, ON) at a dose rate of 0.52 Gy/min. Following treatment, the cells were allowed to recover for a period of 6 hr at 37 C in 5% CO2 atmosphere prior to extraction of total RNA.\n\n    This work was approved by the Queen's University Research Ethics Board under approval #PATH-115-10. Collection and generation of the LCL lines has been reported previously.\n\n    To assess the characteristics of our samples prior to transcriptome analysis, we determined the kinetics of arrest and recovery (0-18 h) across a range of IR doses (0-4 Gy). In all cases, cells were exposed to Cell Proliferation Labeling Reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfe, Canada), according to the manufacturers instructions, for 1 hour prior to harvest. A dose of 2 Gy followed by 6 hours of recovery was the minimum dose and maximum recovery time at which we observed a uniform G1-S arrest, as assayed by loss of the early S phase cells from 2 dimensional flow cytometry profiles. This dose/recovery scheme was used throughout the study. For all microarray experiments, two parallel cultures were generated and one was treated with 2 Gy IR, 6 hours prior to harvest. Only cell lines showing proliferation in untreated cells, G1 checkpoint arrest following IR, and producing high quality RNA were used for microarray analysis.\n\n    RNA from each of the 69 cell lines was extracted using TRIZOL Reagent following the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). RNA was purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON). RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Version B.02.02). RNA with an integrity number of at least 7 was amplified and labeled using the Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amplification kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Labeling reactions were performed with 250 ng total RNA, along with the Agilent Spike-in RNA mix, using Cy3-CTP and Cy5-CTP for control (-IR) and experimental (+IR) RNA, respectively (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA). Amplified RNA was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, DE, USA) and the concentration of cRNA and the specific dye activity were calculated. Samples with a specific dye activity greater than 8 pmol/microl were selected for hybridization to arrays. Pairs of cRNA (unirradiated versus irradiated) were hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo 4x44K GE arrays as per the product protocol. Image acquisition and analysis were done using an Agilent Microarray Scanner, Model G2565BA and Agilent Feature Extraction software v9.1 set to default settings. Raw data has been submitted to the NCBI GEO database (Accession Number GSE19541.)\n\n    (NSC) analysis was done using the PAM method as a software add-on within Microsoft Excel. Heat maps of the final classifiers, normalized by chip, were constructed using the Genesis software package. Pathway analysis was performed using the Ingenuity software package (www.ingenuity.com). Identification of radiation responsive genes was done using SAM.\n\n    For NSC analysis, a total of 43,338 features were used in the analysis. 38 features that had gene label values that could not be interpreted by the analysis software were eliminated from the dataset prior to analysis. Normalization, where used, is described in the relevant sections of the Results.\n\n    Comparisons between microarray and qPCR data were calculated as follows: For microarray data, log (2) ratios between the values for each sample was compared to the average of all cell lines. For qPCR samples, DeltaCt values were calculated for each target gene relative to the GusB control, and DeltaDeltaCt values were calculated relative to the DeltaCt value of WT19998 as a control. Fold changes were calculated individually versus the average of all cell lines for which data were available. Average values were calculated independently for each of the BRCA1 haploinsufficient and WT cell lines.",
        "Results": "    Following the generation of whole transcriptome expression data from each of the logarithmically growing cell lines, we sought to determine whether gene expression values differed in BRCA1+/- versus BRCA1+/+ lines. We used a nearest shrunken centroids analysis approach to analyze the data. Data were analyzed either with no prior normalization, or following median normalization (per chip). These two approaches to analysis yielded similar and extensively overlapping results. However, the use of raw data tended to emphasize highly expressed genes, while the application of normalization algorithms permitted the identification of additional genes of interest that were expressed at lower levels. Therefore, we focused on the normalized datasets, although some genes unique to the non-normalized analysis were included in our final model.\n\n    We divided our samples into training (53 samples) and test (16 samples) randomly. Using the normalized data set, we observed the minimum training set error (6%, 3/53 samples) over a relatively wide range of shrinkage co-efficients (1.85-2.86), representing 288 to 23 genes, respectively. When this model was tested on the test set (8 wild type and 8 carriers), the accuracy was 95% (15/16), with a single misclassification of a control sample.\n\n    Modeling using the raw data was also effective, although it exhibited a slightly lower accuracy in the independent test set, and utilized a much larger number of genes in the predictor. The minimum training set error was 11% (6/53), and accuracy on the independent test set was 88% (14/16), with 2 control samples incorrectly classified, including the one that was previously misclassified using the model from the normalized data. The raw data model was accurate over a narrower range of shrinkage coefficients (1.35-1.65), representing 785 to 367 genes, respectively.\n\n    To generate a list of the most consistent predictive genes for biological analysis, we first selected genes that were identified by both approaches using the most stringent shrinkage coefficients (a total of 13 gene features). We then added genes that were ranked higher (by either model) than the lowest ranking of those identified by both approaches. In many cases, such genes were identified by both approaches if the shrinkage coefficients were relaxed to the lowest value that minimized training set error. A total of 17 genes were added by this approach. Finally, carrying out these approaches in both datasets (normalized or not) identified some genes were only identified in the raw (7 genes) or normalized (6 genes) data sets. The end result was a list of 43 genes, summarized in Table 2.\n\n    To graphically examine the contribution of these candidates to the classification scheme, we used the GENESIS software package to generate a heat map of expression level of these 43 genes across the cell lines tested (Fig. 1). Samples are arranged by BRCA status at the top, with relative expression values at the right. As expected, clustering revealed distinct expression patterns in the training set. More importantly, this clustering was clearly recapitulated in the independent test set, indicating the classification results are consistent across the 43 gene profile, rather than being driven by a small number of genes within this set.\n\n    To further understand the underlying biology leading to the classification scheme, we used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) application to explore the networks linking the genes in our predictor. IPA constructs optimal interaction networks that contain a maximum of 35 genes/proteins, and returns a graphical interaction network, as well as a calculated probability score. The probability score for any given network takes into account a number of factors, including the number of molecules on the input list that appear in the final pathway relative to random molecules in the database. The probability score for a network is calculated using a right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test; and see www.ingenuity.com.\n\n    We developed a network based on the 43 gene consensus list (Fig. 2). The network is designated as relating to \"Hematological System Development and Function,\" with a calculated p-value of 10-26. Of the 35 genes/complexes reported in this pathway by IPA, 20 are in our input list of 43, and an additional 9 components represent complexes containing these genes. The disease/disorder states identified as associated with the most genes in the 43 gene consensus list were cancer (26 genes, p = 5x10-3-7x10-6) and inflammatory response (22 genes, p = 5x10-3-7x10-6). The molecular and cellular functions associated with the most input genes were cellular growth and proliferation (26 genes, p = 5x10-3-2x10-6) and cellular development (23 genes, p = 5x10-3-2x 10-7). The physiological system development and functions associated with the largest numbers of input genes were hematological system development and function (21 genes, p = 5x10-3-1x10-7), and immune cell trafficking (15 genes, p = 5x10-3-1x10-7).\n\n    An alternative approach to determining the function of genes that are differentially regulated in cells derived from BRCA1 carriers is though Gene Ontology analysis. Outputs from those analyses were in general agreement with the Ingenuity-based analysis, with the top GO Process terms identified including regulation of proliferation (12 genes: CD24, CXCR3, FOXP1, FYN, IFIT3, IFNA4, IFNA5, IFNG, MMP7, PLA2G4A, SERPINF1, SOX4,) and differentiation (10 genes: CD24, CSRP2, ETV7, FOXP1, IFNA4, IFNA5, IFNG, SOX4, TBX21, UBD.) In addition, other common GO process terms found among this list were the regulation of apoptosis (11 genes, CD24, CXCR3, FYN, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFNG, MX1, PRLR, SOX4, TNS4, UBD), cytokine-mediated signaling (10 genes: IFNA5, IFNA4, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, USP18, MX1, MX2, HLA-DMB, IFNG), type 1 interferon-mediated signaling (8 genes: IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFNA4, IFNA5, MX1, MX2, USP18), response to virus (8 genes: TBX21, MX1, MX2, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFNA4, IFNA5, IFI44L), and immune response (6 genes: PXDN, ENPP2, FCGRT, IGHD, IFI44L, IGHG1).\n\n    To ensure technical reproducibility, we validated a subset of the most highly predictive genes using qPCR. RNA was prepared from the indicated control and carrier cell lines, and subjected to TaqMan assay for the indicated target genes. Data were graphed along with the gene expression microarray data obtained in the original experiment. As presented in Fig. 3, CSCR3, TBX21 and IFIT1 all reproducibly show consistency between microarray and qPCR based approaches in terms of overall average values across multiple samples, as well as a generally consistent trend between individual samples. Of the 5 genes tested in this way, 4 were shown to recapitulate the microarray data in the followup qPCR assays (Table 2).\n\n    Given the association of BRCA1 with the DNA damage response, we also attempted to determine whether we could generate a molecular classifier to distinguish BRCA1 mutant heterozygotes from wild type cells following exposure of cells to IR. Analysis was performed using nearest shrunken centroids, essentially as above, except that expression for each gene was calculated relative to its own expression level in a parallel unirradiated sample. Training set error was minimized (9%) at a single shrinkage coefficient, 1.44, representing 144 genes. However, in this case, the predictive value of the model on the independent test set was poor. Only 5 of 16 samples (31%) were correctly predicted with multiple errors in both control and carrier prediction.\n\n    To optimize the modeling, the data were filtered to remove low expressing genes, which can cause difficulty in analysis. Using the 19850 genes with highest average expression level in control samples, analysis was repeated. Again, a single shrinkage coefficient, 1.57, representing 76 genes, was found, which minimized the training set error (15%). Analysis of the independent test set yielded an accuracy of only 5 of 16 samples.\n\n    It was unclear whether the failure to generate a predictor with this dataset was because the IR treatment had not had the desired effect, or whether activation of the DNA damage response did not differentiate between BRCA1 wildtype and haploinsufficient cells. To determine whether the IR treatment had actually had the desired effect on DNA repair and checkpoint pathways, we identified the radiation-responsive genes in wild type cells, and compared these to other published datasets. Using SAM, with a defined false-discovery rate of 1.5%, we identified 2643 up-regulated genes (SAM score >1.26), and 3631 down-regulated genes (SAM score <-1.16), under the conditions described above. While a complete description of these results is beyond the scope of this manuscript, about half of previously reported radiation-responsive genes were recapitulated in our data set, suggesting appropriate activation of radiation response pathways following our treatment [Table 3].\n\n    Given this, we conclude that response to IR is unlikely to yield a functional discriminator for BRCA1 haploinsufficiency, and hypothesize that manifestation of the defect in radiation response may require loss of the second BRCA1 allele.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Our results identify a set of dysregulated genes in unperturbed EBV-transformed lymphocytes carrying heterozygous BRCA1 mutations. The identity of the genes in our model is consistent with the hypothesis that cells with a reduced amount of functional BRCA1 are less differentiated than non-mutant control cells. In addition, we have shown that subjecting the same cell lines to 2 Gy IR results minimal ability to discriminate cells carrying a BRCA1 mutation from those that do not. This suggests that BRCA1 haploinsufficiency does not cause global changes in the DNA damage response at low doses, but does not preclude such changes at higher doses. Alternatively, the DNA damage defects in BRCA1 mutant cell lines may only be seen after loss of the wild type BRCA1 allele. These findings together have significance for development of a functional assay for BRCA1 carriers, as well as for understanding the biology behind BRCA1-dependent breast cancers.\n\n    Apart from the potential clinical significance of a rapid functional tool to identify BRCA1 heterozygous mutation carriers, our model provides intriguing data about the biological effect of haploinsufficiency of this protein. TBX21 is one of the key genes we identified as down-regulated in BRCA1+/- LCLs compared to wildtype cells. It has been shown to act as a master regulator for T cell development, particularly via a mechanism involving interferon gamma. This finding is consistent with published work showing defective T cell lineage in BRCA1 null mice, and that BRCA1 is involved in the development of the breast in mouse and human systems. In addition, breast tumors arising in BRCA1 carriers have been shown to have increased expression of several stem cell markers. Consistent with this, we found that BRCA1+/- cells exhibited down-regulation of numerous interferon-regulated genes, including IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, HERC5, and USP18. While neither IFNbeta or IFNgamma were identified in our predictive models for BRCA1 status, IFNalpha is a component of the optimal SVM-based predictor, further supporting the idea that interferon signaling in general may be deregulated under conditions of BRCA1 haploinsufficiency.\n\n    Initial studies of LOH in the breast tumours of BRCA1 carriers reported a rate of 75% (75/101) of LOH of the wild type allele. More recently, quantitative allelotyping has demonstrated a significant degree of variability in the extent and direction of LOH in breast tumours. In some cases, normal tissue shows LOH of the wild type BRCA1 allele, and tumor tissue shows loss of the mutant allele.\n\n    In addition to the LOH studies, it is well established that complete loss of BRCA1 in sporadic cancer is a very rare event. While this may reflect a different mechanism for BRCA1 inactivation in sporadic cancers, such as gene silencing, it may also be that BRCA1-dependent oncogenesis is initially associated with haploinsufficiency during development. This may be exacerbated by the additional cancer-driving effects of homozygous BRCA1 loss in the late stages of carcinogesis contributing to the overall aggressiveness of BRCA1-dependent tumours. In such a model, BRCA1 would function as both a gatekeeper (early event due to haploinsufficiency leading to reduced differentiation) and a caretaker (later effect which requires complete loss of function, contributing to aggressiveness through effects on maintenance of genomic stability). Such a dualistic role might explain the bewildering lack of consistency of the LOH studies in BRCA1-related tumours to date.\n\n    This model of BRCA1 function may also explain our results that showed a relative lack of predictive power for discriminating BRCA1 carriers from wild type cells following irradiation. In contrast to previous finding using irradiated fibroblasts, our results from LCLs demonstrated that IR did not accentuate differences between wild type and BRCA1 mutation carrying cells. It is possible that these different results reflect fundamental differences in the radiation response between lymphocytes and fibroblasts.\n\n    The best model we generated was made using unirradiated cells. This is significant because it suggests that the best predictor may be achievable without the use of complicated irradiation protocols. Our model was 100% accurate in predicting the test set. There were a total of 8 samples in the training set that were not properly classified. Pooling of the test and training sets gave an overall sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 92%. The ability to predict in an independent test set suggests that the model is robust and will likely be reproducible in further validation studies.\n\n    The accurate identification of BRCA1 mutation carriers is an important challenge in disease management. Given the size of the gene, the heterozygous state of individuals at risk, and multiplicity of functions ascribed to the protein, it is also a significant challenge to develop a comprehensive functional assay for BRCA1. The results of this study indicate that BRCA1 mutation carriers may be identified using a functional assay based on altered gene-expression profiles in non-cancerous cells. Furthermore, the ability of this assay to predict BRCA1 status in unperturbed cells suggests that it can potentially be adapted to a simple peripheral blood-based assay. Future work will focus on determining whether the gene expression patterns seen here can be observed in fresh blood samples as well, as this would be a condition of using a variant of this assay in a clinical screening setting. In addition, future work will also focus on whether the functional data from this assay can be applied to classifying VUS alterations in BRCA1; regardless of its utility as a screening tool, such a finding would add significant clinical value by appraising the likelihood of any VUS contributing to disease risk.",

        "Title": "    Hereditary cancer syndromes in Latino populations: genetic characterization and surveillance guidelines",
        "Abstract": "    Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes comprise approximately 10% of diagnosed cancers; however, familial forms are believed to account for up to 30% of some cancers. In Hispanics, the most commonly diagnosed hereditary cancers include colorectal cancer syndromes such as, Lynch Syndrome, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes. Although the incidence of hereditary cancers is low, patients diagnosed with hereditary cancer syndromes are at high-risk for developing secondary cancers. Furthermore, the productivity loss that occurs after cancer diagnosis in these high-risk patients has a negative socio-economic impact. This review summarizes the genetic basis, phenotype characteristics, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's screening, testing, and surveillance guidelines for the leading hereditary cancer syndromes. The aim of this review is to promote a better understanding of cancer genetics and genetic testing in Hispanic patients.",
        "Introduction": "    According to the 2010 census, Hispanics comprise 16.3% of the population in the United States (US). By 2050, the Hispanic population is estimated to become 25% of the US population. Hispanics are a mixed group of individuals from across Latin America and the Caribbean and are defined as individuals that share a culture and language that is linked to the historic migrations that started from Spain that led to the discovery of the Americas. In the year 1492, Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean and reached the Americas. The arrival of Columbus to the Americas led to the start of the \"Colonization of Americas\", where language, culture and religion was instituted by the Spaniards, but also other European countries such as Portugal. Spaniards introduced new diseases to the Americas leading to the death of most of the Indigenous population of the Americas. Due to the high mortality of Indigenous population, Africans (mostly from West Africa) were introduced in the Americas. Through these historic migrations, the Hispanic population was created. These populations had great levels of genetic and cultural admixture from the three major racial ancestral populations: Europeans, Africans, and Indigenous. However, the variability observed in Hispanic admixture, is concordant with the local history of the country of origin. For instance, Hispanics from the Caribbean (including Puerto Ricans) have a higher proportions of West African compared to Hispanics from South America, which have higher European and Amerindian ancestry.\n\n    Cancer is a major public health problem and the leading cause of death among Hispanics worldwide. Malignancies, such as breast and colorectal cancers, when diagnosed in individuals younger than 50 years, are likely caused by inherited mutations and often are aggressive leading to a worse prognosis. With the availability of efficient screening methods for both breast and colorectal cancer, these cancers may be prevented or diagnosed at early, more treatable stages in Hispanics, minimizing the burden of these diseases in this population. By identifying individuals at high-risk and establishing tailored early detection and preventive strategies, the economic productivity loss, morbidity, and mortality may be significantly reduced.\n\n    In this article, we provide a summary of the genetic basis for three of the leading cancers in Hispanics (breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer), which have known hereditary contributions. We will discuss the clinical presentation of these cancers in Hispanics and how it differs from other populations. Furthermore, we will discuss the role of multigene testing in advancing genetic testing services in Latino populations.\n\n    Breast cancer (BC) represents approximately 29% of all cancer cases in US Hispanic women. Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 8th cancer with the highest incidence and the 5th leading cause of cancer death among US Hispanic women. Approximately, 5-10% of all BC are caused by mutations in highly penetrant susceptibility genes. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for approximately 25% of hereditary BC and 15% of all OC. Women with mutations in these genes have up to an 87% lifetime risk of developing BC by age 70 and up to a 44% risk of OC.\n\n    In Hispanics, deleterious BRCA mutations have been found in approximately 25% of women with BC. The majority of the studies reporting the prevalence of BRCA mutations in Hispanics have been performed on heterogeneous groups of Hispanic women from different countries, including: Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Bahamas, Cuba, and Puerto Rico (Table 1). Recently, BRCA mutations in Latin American countries was published, which detailed the mutations found and how the prevalence changed from country to country. All of these studies have shown that the BRCA mutation spectrum varies according to the country of origin. For example, women from Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil have a higher prevalence of BRCA1 mutations, whereas in women from the Caribbean (Cuba and Puerto Rico), BRCA2 is more frequently mutated. Studies of women with BC from Spain showed a larger number of rearrangements in both BRCA genes when compared to Hispanic women. Additionally, several mutations for both BRCA genes were found in Hispanic subpopulations, especially in Argentina where there is a higher proportion European admixture. Furthermore, a mutation (BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu) from Portugal was identified in the Northern/Central region and accounted for one-fourth of the BRCA1/2 mutations. This same mutation was identified in several families of Brazil.\n\n    Several populations have shown the presence of founder mutations, which include some Ashkenazi Jew mutations (BRCA1 185delGA; BRCA1 5382insC) observed in Mexico, Peru, and Brazil. These founder mutations have also been reported in Spain. Therefore, these Ashkenazi Jew mutations are thought to come from areas of Spain where Jews communities settled during the early Common Era. The BRCA1 ex9-12 deletion found in Mexican women is also a founder mutation. This mutation has not observed in Spain or South American populations, and was found to pre-date Spanish colonization since it is estimated to have arisen approximately 1,480 years ago (Table 1). Furthermore, two additional founder mutations of Galician and Spanish origin were found in Spain. Of these, the BRCA1 c.211A > G Galician founder mutation was found in the groups of a US Hispanic and the Argentinian cohort. Three additional founder mutations: 2 in BRCA1 (BRCA1 c.3331_3334delCAAG and BRCA1 c.5123C > A) and 1 in BRCA2 (BRCA2 c.2806_2809delACAA) where described in Hispanics from Colombia. These Colombian founder mutations were found in individuals that share the same haplotype, and therefore share a common ancestor. The BRCA2 c.3922G > T mutation has only been identified in the Puerto Rican cohort, and in US Hispanic studies that include Puerto Ricans and not in other Latin American countries. In Portugal, the BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu mutation seen in families of Portuguese descent was also identified as a founder mutation that occurred around 558 years ago. Moreover, the BRCA1 c.5266dup mutation was identified as a founder Brazilian mutation of Eastern European origin. The presence of these founder mutations in Latin America is tightly linked to migration patterns that shaped the genetic background of each Hispanic subpopulation up to present-day.\n\n    Several studies suggest that the prevalence of BRCA mutations in Hispanic women is higher than the prevalence of BRCA mutations among Ashkenazi Jews and non-Hispanic Whites. However, these observations are based on the predictability of BRCA genetic risk models that use non-Hispanic White women as reference to determine risk, thus the prevalence of BRCA mutations might differ from what has been reported. Differences observed in the BRCA mutation spectrum of Hispanic populations could be due to variations in the contribution of each ancestral population to the genetic background of the Hispanic subgroups. In addition, there is very limited information on the mutation spectrum in some countries, such as Costa Rica, Bahama, and Cuba, among others. Therefore, the mutation spectrum of BRCA among Hispanic women is still understudied, which may our knowledge on the true percentage of BC in Hispanic populations that may be attributable to hereditary changes.\n\n    The clinical presentation of HBOC among Hispanic subpopulations is very similar to non-Hispanic cohorts. Most studies reported that the majority of women that met inclusion criteria had BC diagnosed before age 50 (67.5%; range: 50.4-81.4%). Additionally, family history of BC was found on an average of 16.1% (range: 5.2-27%) of Hispanic women recruited in the studies described in this review. Comparisons of the age at BC diagnosis among the Hispanic subpopulations described above showed that Caribbean Hispanics (Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Cuba) were diagnosed at later ages (mean: 45.9 years; range: 40-51.8 years) than their South American (mean: 44 years), Central American (mean: 41.6 years) and US Hispanic (mean: 38.5 years) counterparts.\n\n    The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) established guidelines for physicians to evaluate potential candidates for genetic counseling and testing. The evaluation criteria for HBOC genetic testing include: personal history of BC before 50 years of age, one or more 1st degree relatives with BC, family history of a BRCA1/2 mutation, and personal history of OC, among others. The information obtained from the genetic tests is used by physicians to guide the patient's medical/surgical management. This management may include chemoprevention therapy, prophylactic surgery (double mastectomy, oophorectomy, and/or hysterectomy), and increased surveillance by mammography and breast MRI. Even though these guidelines have been established, underutilization of these guidelines for Hispanic patients that meet the criteria has been reported. The reason for the low adherence to these guidelines is yet to be addressed, but it is believed that a combination of factors such as, socioeconomic, belief systems, and access to care contribute to this health disparity. Furthermore, the benefits of utilizing these guidelines in other countries, where prevalence of BRCA mutations is high, is still to be determined. For example, the high prevalence of BRCA mutations in the Bahamas supports the implementation of universal testing. However, countries such as Puerto Rico, that have a small number of mutations, could benefit even more from implementing these guidelines. Additionally, it is important to note that these guidelines where developed using studies mainly performed in non-Hispanic White women. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether NCCN guidelines are useful in Hispanic women or if the differences observed in the prevalence of BRCA mutations and clinical presentation, warrants changes to accommodate these differences.\n\n    Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 11 and 8% of cancers in US Hispanic males and females, respectively. Hereditary CRC accounts for approximately 5-10% of all CRC cases. There are two major types of inherited CRC syndromes: 1) Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and 2) Lynch Syndrome (LS). In this section, we will discuss the clinical presentation, genetic basis, and guidelines for testing for these two forms of inherited CRC syndromes.\n\n    FAP is characterized by the presence of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. These polyps appear during adolescence and, if left untreated, can develop into CRC by age 40. Affected individuals without a colectomy have close to 100% lifetime risk of developing CRC. By age 20, most patients have at least 1 adenomatous polyp; by age 50, most have developed adenocarcinoma. Thus, the recommended treatment for FAP is prophylactic colectomy in young adulthood.\n\n    Classic FAP has an incidence ranging from 1 in 8300 people to 1 in 22,000 people, depending on the country of origin. FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene. Most cases have a family history of FAP, but close to 25% of cases are diagnosed as de novo mutations. Identifying the specific APC mutation in a family can be used for targeted sequencing testing for pre-symptomatic, at-risk family members.\n\n    The FAP mutation spectrum has been studied in a limited number of Hispanic countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Portugal, and Spain (Table 2). Most mutations identified in Hispanic patients from both Latin America, Portugal, and Spain have been in exon 15 of the APC gene (Table 2). This exon comprises more than 75% of the coding sequence and is the most commonly mutated region of the APC gene.\n\n    The data available on the clinical manifestation of FAP in Hispanic is limited. Of the studies discussed, only studies from Puerto Rico, US Hispanics (from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras) and Brazil had phenotype information for Hispanic FAP patients. Puerto Rican individuals with FAP had a mean age of diagnosis of 27.6 years (range: 9-71 years), the majority were male (51.6%), and had >= 100 polyps in their colon (67.7%). In addition, upper gastrointestinal polyps and desmoid tumors were observed in 41.9 and 9.7% of the study subjects, respectively. Ricker et al. described 9 Hispanic women from different regions with FAP with a mean age of diagnosis of 37.2 years. Among these women the most common extracolonic manifestation as upper gastric polyps. The study describing Brazilian FAP patients reported that subjects had a mean age of 32.6 years (7-67 years), 79% had upper gastrointestinal polyps, and 54% had desmoid tumors. The prevalence of extracolonic manifestations in the FAP patients of the Brazilian cohort was higher than in other Hispanic subpopulations. In summary, the clinical manifestations of FAP in Hispanics are similar to the one presented by non-Hispanic US Whites.\n\n    To guide genetic testing for FAP in individuals at high-risk, both the NCCN and the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) have developed guidelines for physicians. The NCCN guidelines recommend genetic counseling for individuals with a personal history of >=20 colorectal adenomas, known APC deleterious mutation in the family, and personal manifestation of a desmoid tumor, cribriformular variant of papillary thyroid cancer, or hepatoblastoma. Guidelines from the AGA for genetic counseling and testing include, personal history of >10 cumulative colorectal adenomas, family history of FAP, and family history of FAP-type extracolonic manifestations.\n\n    LS accounts for 2-4% of all CRC cases. This syndrome is characterized by CRC at an early age and a high risk for a number of additional primary cancers, including endometrial and gastric cancer. Approximately 1 in 35 individuals diagnosed with CRC has LS. During their lifetime, individuals with LS will have up to a 70% risk of developing CRC; women will have up to a 45% risk of developing endometrial cancer.\n\n    Germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM, causing the absence of MMR protein expression result in LS. The most common genes mutated in LS are MLH1 and MSH2; close to 50% of LS individuals have a mutation in MLH1. In a review published by Dominguez-Valentin et al., the LS mutation spectrum in South American countries was described. Pathogenic mutations in the MMR genes were identified in patients from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Colombia (Table 3). Furthermore, the InSIGHT database contains additional information on MMR mutations in additional Hispanic subpopulations, Portugal, and Spain. As seen in non Hispanic Whites, mutations in the MLH1 gene are more common in Hispanic, Portuguese and Spanish populations, with the exception of Uruguay and Caribbean Hispanics (Puerto Rico) (Table 3). Data from Caribbean Hispanic patients showed that the mutation spectrum consisted mostly of MSH2 mutations (66.7%), followed by MLH1 mutations (25.0%). Mutations in the MSH6 gene have only been identified in the Caribbean Hispanics, Brazilians, Chileans, and Cubans. There are no published mutations in the EPCAM gene among Hispanics cohorts. The mutation spectrum of MMR genes in Hispanic subgroups could be more varied, thus, additional studies in Hispanic subpopulations are needed.\n\n    For MLH1 mutation carriers, the CRC lifetime risk has been shown to be as high as 68%. The prevalence of MSH2 mutations in families with LS has been reported to range from 38 to 54%, with a CRC lifetime risk of up to 68%. The clinical presentation of LS in the Hispanic subgroups, is similar to what has been observed in NHW with a mean age of diagnosis of 30-44 years of age, endometrial cancer being the 2nd most common LS-associated cancer, and colorectal tumor predominantly in the right colon.\n\n    The identification of at-risk individuals for LS includes the clinical profile of the patient and molecular testing. The NCCN has published clinical guidelines to determine a patient's risk of having LS. The Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria were established to help identify individuals that may harbor germline mutations in the MMR genes based on personal and family history of CRC. The American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) also provides guidelines for the identifying at risk individuals and additionally guidelines for the screening of CRC among these LS individuals. The AGA guidelines for LS testing are: to test MMR deficiency in newly diagnosed CRC cases, and to test individuals with CRC diagnosed at age <=70 or individuals older than 70 years of age who have a family history of LS. Moreover, the AGA guidelines for screening for LS in these high-risk individuals or those affected by LS suggest colonoscopies every 1 to 2 years starting at age 20-25 or starting 2 years younger than the youngest age at CRC diagnosis in the family. Additional studies are needed to determine the utilization of established guidelines for Lynch Syndrome in Hispanics.\n\n    In addition, assessment of molecular markers in tumors, such as microsatellite instability (MSI) or loss of MMR protein expression, are used as molecular screening tools for identifying LS patients. Loss of MMR protein expression correlates with the presence of MSI and is indicative of a possible germline MMR gene mutation. Genetic testing for LS is considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis. However, lack of detection of MMR protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be a surrogate marker to diagnose LS when genetic testing is not available, due to limited accessibility to this type of test (lack of insurance coverage, economic hardships, limited infrastructure). Current NCCN and AGA guidelines recommend that genetic testing be offered to at-risk patients if the test influences the medical management of their condition or that of their at-risk relatives. However, an important concern is that these criteria may miss LS patients who do not meet criteria. LS screening of all CRC tumors has been shown to be cost-effective and is currently recommended by multiple professional societies. As many as 1/3 of women with LS may initially present with endometrial cancer without a history of CRC, thus universal screening for LS in endometrial cancer has also been proposed. Currently, there are no reports in the literature on universal testing of Lynch Syndrome in Hispanic subgroups using IHC detection of MMR proteins, in contrast with non-Hispanic whites for which data is abundant.\n\n    The Supreme Court of the US invalidated the patents made by Myriad Genetics  that gave them the right to exclusively offer BRCA genetic testing. This ruling permitted additional methods to sequence the BRCA gene, as well as other genes, thus significantly reducing costs for genetic testing. Furthermore, major breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis underlying hereditary cancers are shifting genetic testing for hereditary cancer from single gene testing to multiple gene panels. Several of the commercial companies offering cancer genetic screening are offering panels comprised of dozens of genes, including BRCA1/2 and the MMR genes, among others. Multi-gene testing would be especially beneficial to families who present a spectrum of different cancer types. Furthermore, the current reduced cost of NGS technology will allow laboratories across Latin America to perform studies on patients with the cancer syndromes discussed above to continue understanding the mutation spectrum and prevalence of mutations of Hispanic populations.\n\n    Although the future of hereditary cancer testing will undoubtedly reside in multi-gene panel testing, it presents some important challenges. Multi-gene panels include moderate penetrance genes with limited clinical utility. Furthermore, for many of the known hereditary cancer genes, is not clear whether the identification of a deleterious mutation warrants clinical measures beyond increased surveillance, particularly among understudied ethnic groups such as Hispanics. In addition, multi-gene panel testing is likely to result in the identification of a higher number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and mutations with an undetermined clinical value. Currently, a lack of standardization across genetic laboratories regarding the analysis of the data as well as the clinical interpretation of results may lead to erroneous medical advice. As research, education, and health policy development advances, these issues are likely to be resolved.",

        "Conclusion": "    Over the last 10 years, the scientific community has conducted research to determine the prevalence and mutation spectrum of the genes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes in Hispanic populations. Genetic testing is an integral part of the treatment for cancer patients. As the standard of care in hereditary cancer testing shifts from single gene testing to multi-gene panel testing, it will be essential that ongoing research efforts focus on determining mutation penetrance and associated genetic risks. This information will ensure that the standard-of-care genetic testing is provided to all patients in need and that patients will have access to the latest advances in prevention and treatment of hereditary cancers. Examination of barriers to genetic testing and implementation of culturally sensitive educational programs will be essential to increase adherence. Moreover, integration of clinical genetic guidelines to health policy will enable implementation and sustainability of genetic medicine across Hispanic populations.",

        "Title": "    Novel BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic mutations in Slovene hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families",
        "Abstract": "    The estimated proportion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers among all breast and ovarian cancer cases is 5-10%. According to the literature, inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumour-suppressor genes, account for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases. The aim of this report is to present novel mutations that have not yet been described in the literature and pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations which have been detected in HBOC families for the first time in the last three years. In the period between January 2009 and December 2011, 559 individuals from 379 families affected with breast and/or ovarian cancer were screened for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Three novel mutations were detected: one in BRCA1 - c.1193C>A (p.Ser398*) and two in BRCA2 - c.5101C>T (p.Gln1701*) and c.5433_5436delGGAA (p.Glu1811Aspfs*3). These novel mutations are located in the exons 11 of BRCA1 or BRCA2 and encode truncated proteins. Two of them are nonsense while one is a frameshift mutation. Also, 11 previously known pathogenic mutations were detected for the first time in the HBOC families studied here (three in BRCA1 and eight in BRCA2). All, except one cause premature formation of stop codons leading to truncation of the respective BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins.",
        "Introduction": "    Most breast and ovarian cancers are sporadic and only about 5-10% of breast and 10% of ovarian cancers are thought to be hereditary, causing the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Majority of HBOC cases have underlying cause in germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 susceptibility genes. Carriers of known deleterious mutations in the BRCA genes have a lifetime risk of approximately 60 to 80% for development of breast cancer (BC) and a 15 to 40% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer (OC) and are also at a heightened risk for some other cancer types. So far, genome-wide association studies have not identified other highly penetrant susceptibility genes linked with HBOC, as reviewed in Mavaddat et al. Genetic screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 therefore remains the only verified strategy for identification of individuals at high risk for hereditary BC and/or OC. To reduce cancer risk, healthy carriers of deleterious BRCA mutations are presented with various preventive options, such as regular intensive screenings, prophylactic mastectomy with breast reconstruction and/or oophorectomy or chemoprevention in the setting of a clinical trial. Additionally, genetic counseling and BRCA screening can be offered to first degree relatives of the carrier.\n\n    The present report continues the previous report of our group from 2011 where pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the Slovene population were described. We describe novel pathogenic mutations that have not yet been described in the literature or BRCA mutational databases, such as Breast Cancer Information Core Database (BIC), Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD-Professional), Universal Mutation Database (UMD) and Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). We also report pathogenic mutations for which records already exist but were detected for the first time in the Slovene HBOC families tested between January 2009 and December 2011. The possible effects of novel and pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations which have been detected in Slovene HBOC families for the first time are discussed.",
        "Methods": "    In the period from January 2009 to December 2011, 559 new individuals from 379 Slovene HBOC families were submitted through mutational screening of the BRCA1 and/or the BRCA2 genes at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, which is the only public institution performing BRCA screenings in Slovenia. Probands were chosen after genetic counseling according to the ASCO guidelines for genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. The family history data were verified in the Slovenian state cancer registry established in 1950. All tested individuals provided written informed consent and attended genetic counseling sessions before and after testing.\n\n    In 362 probands admitted for complete screening of all BRCA1/2 exons, methods for variations searching consisted of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis (MLPA; MRC Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands) for detection of large genomic deletions and insertions and screening for small mutations of all BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons with high-resolution melting (HRM), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing methods. Probands (197) from cancer-affected families with already confirmed pathogenic BRCA mutation were tested only for the familial pathogenic mutation. The nomenclature of this study follows the Nomenclature for Description of Genetic Variations approved by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS).",
        "Results": "    Since the screening for BRCA mutations began in Slovenia in the year 1999, altogether 45 distinct pathogenic BRCA mutations have been detected in the tested Slovene families - 22 in the BRCA1 and 23 in the BRCA2 (Table I). The overall mutation detection rates for the period between January 1999 to December 2008 and from January 2009 to December 2011 were 29.8 and 21.2%, respectively (Table II). The majority of detected pathogenic mutations were nonsense mutations creating premature stop codons or missense mutations and small deletions and/or insertions that cause frameshifting and also lead to premature termination of translation. Of all detected BRCA1 mutations four were large deletions, all of more than one exon. No large deletions or insertions were detected in the BRCA2 gene so far. In the period of the last three years (January 2009 to December 2011) 559 probands were tested either for the known familial mutation or were submitted through the complete screening of all BRCA exons (Table II). Of the tested probands 115 were positive for BRCA1 pathogenic mutation and 41 for BRCA2 pathogenic mutation. In the stated period, three novel mutations were found which have not yet been described, one in the BRCA1 and two in the BRCA2 gene (Table III). The novel BRCA1 pathogenic mutation was detected in a healthy female from a HBOC family (Table III, Fig. 1). All novel BRCA2 mutations were detected in female BC patients (Table III, Fig. 1).\n\n    Besides three novel mutations, eleven known pathogenic BRCA mutations were discovered for the first time in the Slovene HBOC families, three BRCA1 and eight BRCA2 (Tables IV and V). All these newly detected pathogenic mutations were detected in female BC and/or OC patients (Tables IV and V). All novel and newly detected pathogenic mutations in Slovenia were small mutations dictating premature stop codon formation and subsequent truncation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Several recent studies have associated specific BRCA mutations with specific cancer risks and phenotypes. Many HBOC studies therefore have focused on predicting effects of specific BRCA mutations and reveal possible underlying molecular mechanisms. In this context, we discuss here the predicted effects of the individual novel and newly detected Slovene BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic mutations.\n\n    All three novel mutations described here -c.1193C>A (p.Ser398*) in the BRCA1 and c.5101C>T (p.Gln1701*) and c.5433_5436delGGAA (p.Glu1811Aspfs*3) in the BRCA2 gene are located in exon 11 of BRCA1 or BRCA2, which is the largest exon in both genes and also carry the majority of pathogenic mutations described so far. As BRCA mutations causing truncation of the BRCA proteins are regarded as pathogenic, with some exceptions of truncating mutations in the last 27th exon of the BRCA2, we predict that all three novel mutations have deleterious effects. More detailed descriptions are given below.\n\n    Mutation c.1193C>A (p.Ser398*) in exon 11 causes stop codon formation at codon 398. In the BIC database a similar mutation discovered in Asian population, which leads to formation of stop codon 398 (c.1193C>G), is described as a clinically significant variant, but no references are given. Codon 398 lies in one of five conserved regions located at the 5' end of exon 11 (codons 282-554), which include putative interacting sites for several proteins thought to be involved in transcription. Codon 398 also forms a part of interacting site (codons 341-748) for DNA repair protein RAD50 which participates in DNA repair by homologous recombination and by non-homologous end joining. Accordingly, we predict c.1193C>A mutation to severely impair BRCA1-mediated DNA repair.\n\n    Mutation c.5101C>T (p.Gln1701*) is a nonsense mutation causing formation of a stop codon at position 1701 which is located in exon 11 in the ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) spanning nucleotides 3035 to 6629. Several studies have shown that truncating mutations in the OCCR region confer a higher ratio of ovarian cancer relative to breast cancer. Also, higher risk of prostate cancer was recently detected in males with mutations in the BRCA2 OCCR region. Consistently with these studies, one of the two Slovene BRCA2 c.5101C>T families exhibits a high incidence of OC, besides BC (Table III).\n\n    Frameshift mutation c.5433_5436delGGAA (p.Glu1811 Aspfs*3) results in translation termination at amino acid position 1813, which lies within the BRC repeat region in exon 11, between BRC5 (amino acids 1649-1735) and BRC6 (amino acids 1822-1914). Jara et al described a similar mutation, c.5439delT (p.Leu1813fs*1), that might be disease-causing. This mutation dictates formation of a stop codon at amino acid position 1814 in the BRC repeat region.\n\n    The BRC repeat region is a region of eight highly conserved internal BRC repeats separated by conserved nucleotide stretches. The eight BRC repeats bind the RAD51 recombinase and control its activity in homologous DNA recombination. Truncating mutation within the BRCA2 BRC repeat domain, such as the novel c.5433_5436delGGAA, are therefore predicted to seriously impair the cell's ability to repair DNA double-strand breaks.\n\n    From January 2009 to December 2011 three known pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 and eight in the BRCA2 gene were detected for the first time in the Slovene HBOC families. Except one, all cause premature formation of stop codons leading to truncation of the respective BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins.\n\n    The mutation c.66_67delAG (p.Glu23Valfs*17) is the most common BRCA1 mutation worldwide which occurs at a frequency of 1.1% in the Ashkenazi Jews. Despite being so widespread, this is the first recording of c.66_67delAG in Slovenia, which to note has only very small Jewish population (estimated 500-1,000 people). The c.66_67delAG dictates formation of stop codon in the BRCA1 exon 2 thus forming a truncated BRCA1 protein, BRAt, which lacks all known BRCA1 functional domains. Studies have shown that besides being non-functional the truncated BRCA proteins can also impair the function of wild-type BRCA proteins. It was further suggested that the BRAt mutant protein increases transcription of the protein maspin (mammary serine protease inhibitor), which has been implicated in inhibition of growth, invasion, and metastatic potential of cancer cells. Jiang et al also demonstrated that maspin sensitizes BRCA deficient breast carcinoma cells to staurosporine-induced apoptosis thus leading to an increased chemosensitivity.\n\n    The other two newly detected BRCA1 mutations are located in exon 11. Mutation c.3718C>T (p.Gln1240*) is reported few times in the BRCA mutational databases but is published only once by Kwong et al, who detected it in an endometrial cancer patient of European origin. We detected the c.3718C>T in two Slovene families who are, interestingly, both affected by various cancer types (Table IV). As this mutation was first detected in endometrial cancer, this could imply that the c.3718C>T predisposes to other cancer types besides BC/OC. Further studies are needed to corroborate this observation and uncover possible underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\n    Mutation c.3436_3439delTGTT (p.Cys1146Leufs*8) in the 11th exon of BRCA1 was before only found once in the Slovene neighboring country Austria. It is predicted to cause termination of protein translation at codon 1153. It can be compared to a similar mutation c.3481_3491del11 (p.Glu1161Phefs*3) that creates stop codon at 1163. The c.3481_3491del11 is a widespread French founder mutation that is frequently detected in hereditary OC. Comparably, the Slovene c.3436_3439delTGTT family is characterized by higher incidence of OC relative to BC. Future studies are needed to determine whether increased incidence of OC is associated with specific exon 11 truncating BRCA1 mutations.\n\n    The eight newly detected BRCA2 mutations are all rather rare with only few existing records or publications. Mutation c.262_263delCT (p.Leu88Alafs*12) is located in exon 3. It was first described in one Polish HBOC family (described as 488_489delCT) and was recently detected in a Spanish BC patient. Salgado et al suggested that abrogation of the amino-terminal exon 3 transcription activation domain in the BRCA2 protein affects BRCA2 role in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair processes through replication protein A (RPA). They further suggested that abrogation of most (3320 amino acids) of the 3418 BRCA2 amino acids has more severe biological consequences besides disrupted transcriptional regulation.\n\n    Mutation, c.658_659delGT (p.Val220Ilefs*4), is located in exon 8 and is predicted to truncate the protein before the eight BRC repeats. Interestingly, the c.658_659delGT is one of a few BRCA2 mutations found in BRCA2 biallelic cases. These biallelic BRCA2 mutations are known to cause the D1 subgroup of Fanconi anemia (FA-D1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized, among other defects, by predisposition to several childhood cancers. Studies have shown that FA-D1 patients are especially at a high risk of developing brain tumors, in particular medulloblastomas, compared to other subgroups which are caused by mutations in other DNA-repair genes. To note, BC and OC risk in biallelic BRCA2 patients is difficult to determine as FA patients usually die at a young age, before BC or OC would generally develop. Nevertheless, it could be useful to follow whether carriers of monoallelic c.658_659delGT are also burdened by an increased risk for medulloblastomas or other brain tumors. The Slovene family which has monoallelic BRCA2 c.658_659delGT does not, however, exhibit any brain tumors and is affected mostly by quite late onset of OC. No biallelic BRCA2 mutations were detected in Slovenia so far.\n\n    Mutation c.1773_1776delTTAT (p.Ile591Metfs*22) causes formation of a stop codon 612 in the exon 10 of BRCA2. It has been described for Western European and Chinese population. A similar truncating deletion c.1787_1799del13 forming stop codon near at 609 was recently discovered in a prostate cancer patient with family history of stomach cancer but no BC or OC. No functional characterizations have yet been published for c.1773_1776delTTAT, however, the Slovene family having c.1773_1776delTTAT is to date affected only by BC (Table V).\n\n    Three BRCA2 mutations were detected in the exon 11, c.5213_5216delCTTA, c.6641insC and c.6814delA. Mutation c.5213_5216delCTTA (p.Thr1738Ilefs*2) in exon 11 has been already found in several HBOC families, mainly in the USA, the Netherlands and in Belgium. It causes formation of termination signal at codon 1739 located between BRC5 and BRC6 in the BRC repeat region, similarly to the novel mutation c.5433_5436delGGAA discussed above. According to the literature no other cancers besides BC and OC are associated with this mutation. This also applies to the Slovene c.5213_5216delCTTA family.\n\n    Mutation c.6641insC (p.Thr2214Asnfs*10) in exon 11 is a frameshift mutation reported only once in BIC database. Mutation is predicted to form a stop codon at position 2223 located at the 3' end of exon 11. The mutation is causing the truncated BRCA2 protein for the subsequent exons 12 to 27. Mutation c.6641insC was identified in Slovene BC patient diagnosed at age 47, with a history of two BC cases in her family, diagnosed at ages 36 and 44. Interestingly, one was male BC (Table V). Similar mutation c.6641dupC (p.Lys2215Tyrfs*10) was detected in nearby Croatia in two unrelated families.\n\n    Mutation c.6814delA (p.Arg2272Glufs*8) in exon 11 was detected in Slovene BC patient diagnosed at 32 years of age, whose mother had bilateral BC. It is described only once in the UMD database, without references, and is predicted to form stop codon at position 2279 near the 3' end of exon 11, therefore abrogating exons 12 to 27.\n\n    Mutation c.8175G>A (p.Trp2725*) was first reported just recently by Levanat et al. Mutation c.8175G>A was identified in two unaffected siblings (with a family history of two BC cases) from Croatia. Mutation c.8175G>A lies in the frequently mutated exon 18 of BRCA2 leading to the truncation of the BRCA2 oligonucleotide binding domain (OB1) in the DNA-binding domain (DBD). The BRCA2 DBD region is needed for binding of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that results from DNA damage or replication errors. Through this binding of ssDNA the BRCA2 protein mediates delivery of RAD51 to the sites of exposed single-stranded DNA thus enabling the RAD51 to catalyze homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange. Through affecting this recruitment of RAD51 to the ssDNA, mutations in the BRCA2 DBD are predicted to affect the homologous recombination needed for maintaining the integrity of the genome. Besides binding ssDNA, OB1 also binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 which is needed for BRCA2 stability and is also crucial for the BRCA2 functioning in one of the homologous recombination pathways.\n\n    Mutation c.9117G>A (p.Pro3039Pro) is located in exon 23 of BRCA2. This splicing mutation was shown to be truncating. By this mutation the OB2 functional domain of BRCA2 protein is affected most probably causing impaired repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Mutation c.9117G>A was identified in three tested members from one Slovene family. Proband (mother) was diagnosed with BC at the age of 49. Her two daughters were both identified as carriers; one diagnosed with OC at the age 24 and one still unaffected. Mutation c.9117G>A has been already found in several HBOC families of Western/Central/East European origin.\n\n    The present report describes three novel BRCA pathogenic mutations that have been detected in Slovene HBOC families thereby contributing to the ever-expanding spectrum of the world-wide pathogenic BRCA mutations. Eleven previously known pathogenic mutations that have been discovered for the first time in Slovenia are also presented. For the probands bearing novel or pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations which have been detected in Slovene population for the first time, relevant clinical data and family history are given. Recent literature is reviewed to provide new data, which should help to create specific plans for preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for individual carriers according to their specific mutation.",

        "Abstract": "    Considering the importance of BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and TP53 in the development of hereditary early-onset breast and ovarian cancer and that the genetic susceptibility profile of the Northeast population from Brazil has never been analyzed, this study aimed to verify the frequency of mutations of clinical significance in these genes in high-risk hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome patients from that region. DNA samples from 106 high-risk unrelated patients mostly from Bahia, the biggest state in the Northeast region, were analyzed. These patients underwent full BRCA1 gene sequencing, screening for common founder mutations in the BRCA2, CHEK2 and TP53 genes and genetic ancestry analysis with nine ancestry informative markers. The positive results were confirmed by two sequencing reactions. Three mutations of clinical significance were found: BRCA1 p.R71G (4.71%), 3450del4 (3.77%) and TP53 p.R337H (0.94%). The genetic ancestry analysis showed a high European ancestry contribution (62.2%) as well as considerable African (31.2%) and Amerindian (6.6%) ancestry contributions (r2=0.991); this degree of heterogeneity was also significant in the population structure analysis (r=0.604). This population is highly admixed with a different spectrum of genetic susceptibility, with the Galician founder mutation BRCA1 p.R71G accounting for 50% of all identified mutations in high-risk HBOC patients. TP53 p.R337H was also significantly frequent; thus, the combined screening of BRCA1/2 and TP53 should be offered to high-risk HBOC patients from Northeast Brazil.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast and ovarian cancers are among the most common cancers in developed and developing countries. Approximately 5-10% of familial cases are due to germline mutations in susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and TP53. These susceptibility genes have key roles in cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair.\n\n    Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Patients who have HBOC syndrome have a personal and family history of cancer mainly in the following organs: breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreas. In contrast, mutations in the CHEK2 and TP53 genes are also associated with breast and ovarian cancers, as well as with other cancers related to the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome.\n\n    Many studies have demonstrated that mutations in these susceptibility genes could result in early-onset carcinoma as well as in a worse prognosis; therefore, it is important to use genetic testing to identify these deleterious mutations, so that risk-reducing and risk-prevention strategies can be applied.\n\n    In previously characterized populations, it is easy to verify the genetic susceptibility of high-risk individuals, because some germline mutations have founder effects, such as the BRCA1 c.66_67delAG and c.5266dupC mutations and BRCA2 c.5946_5946delT in the Ashkenazi population; BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu in Portugal; BRCA2 999del5 in Iceland; CHEK2 c.1100 in European populations; and TP53 p.R337H in Southern Brazil.\n\n    Thus, knowing that ethnic differences in cancer incidence and mortality are the results of genetic and epidemiological risk factor interactions, it is crucial to characterize a population which will allow for a more accurate risk assessment and proper genetic counseling for the individuals.\n\n    The Brazilian population is one of the most heterogeneous in the world. Many populations have contributed to it, mainly Portuguese, African and Amerindian. However, other European populations, such as the Spanish and Italian, have also contributed to its genetic diversity. As the pattern of admixture in Brazil varies according to the region and no study has been performed with the population from the Northeast region of Brazil, our aim was to verify the frequency of mutations of clinical significance in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and TP53 in 106 patients at high risk for HBOC from the Northeast region of Brazil.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 106 unrelated Brazilian patients at high risk for HBOC who were referred to the Genetics Clinic of the Hospital Universitario Edgar Santos from Universidade Federal da Bahia between 2008 and 2013 were included in the study. The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the institutions that were involved and all of the patients provided informed consent.\n\n    During genetic counseling, clinical and epidemiologic data were obtained, and genetic testing was offered to affected individuals who met at least one of the following criteria: (a) two or more family members affected by breast cancer; (b) one family member affected by breast cancer and another affected by ovarian cancer; (c) three or more family members affected by breast or ovarian cancer, with at least one affected with ovarian cancer; (d) breast cancer diagnosed before 45yr of age; (e) ovarian cancer diagnosed before 50yr of age; (f) bilateral breast cancer; (g) male breast cancer at any age; and (h) cancer in multiple organs including breast cancer. The patients' available relatives were also analyzed.\n\n    DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the Gentra Puregene Blood kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) or the AxyPrep Blood genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA). The screening for mutations in BRCA1 was performed in two steps: (a) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of each exon followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and electrophoresis of denatured DNA as previously described and (b) then all of the PCR fragments that presented a different migration pattern on the gel were analyzed by direct sequencing in an ABI PRISM 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA USA) using the BigDye  terminator sequencing kit (Applied BioSystems) as recommend by the manufacturer. The primers used as well as the PCR cycling conditions are shown in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n    The initial screening for the mutations BRCA2 (c.5946_5946delT and c.156_157insAlu), CHEK2 (c.1100delC, c.444+1G>A and p.I157T) and TP53 (p.R337H) was performed by AS-PCR followed by electrophoresis in agarose gels (2%) or PCR/RFLP, which consisted of the following steps: (a) PCR reaction, (b) verification of amplification by electrophoresis in agarose gels (1.5%), (c) digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme and (d) scoring other electrophoreses in agarose gels (2.5%).\n\n    The primers and PCR cycling were based on Struewing et al., Machado et al., Bayram et al. and Custodio et al. (Supplementary Table 2). All of the RFLP reactions used enzymes reagents of New England Biolabs (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) and were performed according to this manufacturer.\n\n    Each PCR reaction contained 0.25 muM each primer, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 or 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 25 ng genomic DNA and UltraPure DNase/RNase-Free Distilled Water (Invitrogen) up to 25 mul. Except in the PCR reaction for TP53's mutation, Go Taq Flexi DNA polymerase was used (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\n\n    The positive results were verified by two sequencing reactions. For the genotyping control, 10% of the negative samples were randomly selected and sequenced. The PCR reactions of the BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu were run with a positive control. The gene reference sequences were NG_005905.2, NG_012772.3, NG_008150.1 and NG_017013.2, which are available in GenBank (NCBI, NIH, USA). The sequences were analyzed using the CLC Bio sequence viewer version 6.8.1 (a QIAGEN Company) and BioEdit version 7.1.9 (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or FinchTV 1.4.0 (Geospiza, Seattle, WA, USA).\n\n    A micro-panel of nine ancestry informative markers was used to estimate the genetic ancestry: APO, AT3-I/D, CKMM, FY-NULL, GC*1S, GC*1F, LPL, PV92 and SB19.3. These ancestry informative markers were genotyped as described above by (a) PCR followed by electrophoresis, (b) PCR/RFLP, or (c) real-time PCR as described by Parra et al. and Shriver et al.\n\n    The contents of the PCR reaction were as described above, except for the real-time PCR reactions, which used TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Applied BioSystems) as recommended by the manufacturer and were monitored in ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection Systems (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    The restriction enzymes were also from New England Biolabs (New England Biolabs). The primers, enzymes, probes and PCR conditions are described in Supplementary Table 3.\n\n    The descriptive analyses were performed in Epi Info version 7. GENEPOP 1.2 and ADMIX 95 were used to verify the allelic frequencies and estimate the genetic ancestry. The population structure was analyzed in STRUCTURE v.2.3.4 with 10.000 for the burn-in period interactions, 10 000 additional interactions and admixture option with the LOCPRIOR model and a K value from 1 to 3. The genotypes of the African (Nigerian), Amerindian and European (German and Spanish) populations were kindly provided by Dr Mark Shriver from Penn State University.",
        "Results": "    All of the patients were female, and most of the patients had cancer before 50 years of age, with a mean age at diagnosis of 43.06 years (SD=+-10.67). The majority of the cases were breast cancer (91.4%), followed by ovarian cancer (4.7%) (Table 1). Among the breast cancer cases, the most common histological type was the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) at 69.30% (70/101), and among the ovarian cancer cases, the most common was serous adenocarcinoma, at 77.77% (7/9).\n\n    In addition to the personal cancer history, most of these women also had a family history (83.02%, Table 1), and the frequency of the cancers associated with HBOC (breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer) was significant among the first (81.82%)-, second (87.83%)- and third (78.71%)-degree relatives.\n\n    Regarding other risk factors, such as the use of oral contraceptives, parity and age at menarche, a significant percentage of the study population had used oral contraceptives for more than 5 years (64.15%) or also had children (76.42%), and the mean age at menarche was 12.89 years (SD=+-1.63). Another risk factor that was analyzed was the smoking status, but a considerable portion of the subjects were nonsmokers (64.15%) (Table 1).\n\n    Knowing that the Brazilian population is composed of at least three ancestral population groups, a trihybrid admixture model was estimated in ADMIX 95, which showed a high European ancestry contribution 62.20% (s.e.=0.034) and considerable African and Amerindian ancestry contributions, 31.20% (s.e=0.011) and 6.60% (s.e.=0.036), respectively. This analysis was statistically significant (r2=0.991), and the study population fit the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P<0.005).\n\n    In addition, the population stratification analysis in STRUCTURE was also significant for K=3 (r=0.604); the bar plot in Figure 1 (left) shows the genetic admixture proportions of the Brazilian study population compared with the African, Amerindian and European populations based on the ancestry informative markers panel. The triangle plot in Figure 1 (right) demonstrates the distribution of the subjects according their genetic admixture and population of origin, in which is observed the heterogeneity degree of the study population clustered between the European and African populations. The average distances (expected heterozygosity) between individuals in the same cluster was greater in cluster 3 (0.319), in which the study population was more closely clustered than was that in cluster 1 (0.262) and cluster 2 (0.256), in which the African and Amerindian populations clustered (see triangle plot, Figure 1).The subjects also exhibited a distinct pattern in the assessment of self-reported race/color; most of the subjects self-reported as mulatto (40.57%), followed by white (34.91%) and black (20.75%). Almost all of the subjects were from the State of Bahia (83.02%), but there were also subjects from other regions of Brazil (15.09%) (Table 1).\n\n    Ten unrelated patients were identified with mutations of clinical significance; the most frequent mutation was BRCA1 c.211A>Grs80357382 (4.71%; 5/10), followed by BRCA1 c.3331_3334delCAAGrs80357777 (3.77%; 4/10) and TP53 p.R337Hrs121912664 (0.94%; 1/10). Six of these patients were from the countryside regions of the State of Bahia and four were from Salvador, the capital of Bahia. The clinic and pathological characteristics of the mutation carriers are described in Table 2, and Figure 2 shows the sequencing fragments of the identified mutations.\n\n    All of the mutation carriers had a family history of breast and ovarian cancer involving first-, second- and/or third-degree relatives (80.00%), except for two carriers who had no suggestive family history of any cancer (patients #21.1 and #106.1, Table 2). The pedigrees of three subjects who are carriers for each mutation are shown in the Figure 3, which presents the segregation of these mutations among first- and second-degree relatives, except for the TP53 p.R337H mutation carrier (Patient #97.1) for whom no family members were available for testing.\n\n    No patient with the Galician founder mutation (BRCA1 c.211A>G) reported a Spanish ancestry contribution in their families, whereas among the patients with the BRCA1 c.3331_3334delCAAG (3450del4), three reported a Portuguese and/or French ancestry contribution and the fourth patient reported an Italian ancestry contribution. The TP53 p.R337H mutation's carrier did not report her ancestry contribution. Table 2 presents the estimated genetic ancestry proportion for each mutation carrier, which was similarly estimated for the study population as a whole as described above.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Here, 106 unrelated high-risk subjects for HBOC from Northeast Brazil, a population that until now was uncharacterized, were analyzed. In this population, two mutations of clinical significance were found in BRCA1, 3450del4 and p.R71G (8.49%) and one in TP53, p.R337H (0.94%). These mutations were associated with aggressive clinic-pathological characteristics; most of the subjects had IDC and triple-negative tumors, and a family history of cancer involving first-, second- and/or third-degree relatives (Table 2 and Figure 3). Only two mutation carriers did not have a family history of any cancer, but both of these carriers had early-onset breast cancer (patients #21.1 and #106.1, Table 2).\n\n    The 3450del4 mutation has been described in many populations worldwide. In South America, this mutation has been described among patients with HBOC from other regions of Brazil and among patients with ovarian cancer from Colombia. In fact, in Colombia, 3450del4 was the only mutation of clinical significance, suggesting a founder effect. Here, this mutation also had a significant frequency among the patients from Northeast Brazil, with a frequency higher (3.77%) than that previously observed in the others regions of Brazil, at 0.16% and 2.12%.\n\n    The other mutation that was found in this study, BRCA1 p.R71G, which accounted for 50% of the mutations identified, is a Galician founder mutation that was first described by Vega et al. Based on the mtDNA analysis, the Galician population is very homogeneous, with traits of a Culdesac population with a striking similarity to the Basque population owing to its geographic location and cultural barriers (dialect). Others studies corroborate the restriction of this mutation in Galician or Hispanic descendants in Portugal, USA and Asturias (Northern Spain).\n\n    Although no Brazilian patient with the p.R71G reported a Spanish ancestry contribution, these patients presented considerable European ancestry contributions (Table 2), which was statistically significant (r=0.604), and historical data corroborate the hypothesis that the Northeast region of Brazil has a high Spanish ancestry contribution, especially Galician, because the State of Bahia received more Galician immigrants than others states. In Salvador, the capital of Bahia, from 1883 to 1950, approximately 3-6 generations ago (~20 years per generation), 94.3% of the Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, of which 90.8% were from Pontevedra Province. It is also important to emphasize that the likelihood of a de novo mutation occurring in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is very low.\n\n    The third mutation that was found, TP53 p.R337H (0.94%), is a low-penetrance mutation that has a founder effect in the Southern region of Brazil and is associated with breast cancer cases that are related to Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome syndrome. It seems that p.R337H originated in the Portuguese population because the haplotypes of the Portuguese (A3) and the Brazilian (A1) carriers differ by only one SNP, rs9894946:C>T.\n\n    The frequency of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in Southeast and South Brazil varies from 0.51 to 8.6%, and in the Northeast population, this mutation occurred at a significant frequency (0.94%). However, here the mutation carrier had a family history that was suggestive of HBOC and not Li-Fraumeni Syndrome or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (Figure 2) based on the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology v.1.2010 and criteria that were proposed by Li-Fraumeni, Birch, Eeeles and Chompret.\n\n    However, this association was also recently found by Cury et al.; therefore, this finding demonstrated that in Brazil, the TP53 p.R337H mutation is important for patients at high risk for HBOC as well as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome. Consequently, in agreement with it has been recently proposed, the combined screening of BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 should be offered to high-risk as well as early-onset breast cancer patients from Brazil.\n\n    Interestingly, in this study we did not observe the BRCA1 mutation that is the most frequent among the Brazilians: the BRCA1 c.5266dupC (5382insC), which accounted for 56% of all of the identified mutations in patients from Southeast Brazil. The highest frequency that was ever found in Brazil was 5% by Ewald et al. among high-risk patients for HBOC from Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro. Other studies in different regions of Brazil also found BRCA1 c.5266dupC with a significant frequency, except among Ashkenazi women from Porto Alegre.\n\n    BRCA1 c.5266dupC was first described as an Ashkenazi founder mutation, but an analysis of the origin of this mutation in the European population demonstrated that c.5266dupC originated from a common ancestor in Northern Europe long before becoming an Ashkenazi founder mutation. Because the Brazilian population has an ancestry contribution of many European populations, this mutation is likely to be found.\n\n    BRCA1 c.66_67delAG and BRCA2 6174delT, also considered Ashkenazi founder mutations, were found in other regions of Brazil as well as in Spanish and Latin America populations, and interestingly were not present in the population of Northeast Brazil; this result could also be because of the pattern of admixture of the Northeast population or even to the sampling size. However, the study population fit the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P<0.005).\n\n    The other mutation of BRCA2, c.156_157insAlu, a Portuguese founder mutation, was also not found in this population, although historical data demonstrated that most of the European immigrants who arrived in Brazil were Portuguese, and it was the Portuguese that settled the country (1500), with a great immigrant flux between 1850 and 1970 that was two times greater than that of the Spanish population. However, when considering the number of immigrants by state, in 1950, Bahia State registered 2509 Spanish immigrants and 1531 Portuguese immigrants. In 1970, the number of Spanish immigrants was also higher than that of the Portuguese, at 3225 and 1586, respectively.\n\n    From the data presented here and the available historical data, it can be inferred that even though Salvador (the capital of the State of Bahia) was the first capital of Brazil (from 1549 to 1763), the presence of the Portuguese population in Bahia was smaller than that of the Spanish population, most likely due to the transference of the Portuguese court to Rio de Janeiro, the second capital of Brazil.\n\n    In the estimated period of the first occurrence of BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu in Portugal, 120-130 generations ago (~20 years per generation), the Portuguese immigrants were well established in Brazil, but because of economic and political motives, their presence was greater in Southeast Brazil, mainly in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. In Rio de Janeiro, BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu was found in three unrelated patients with breast cancer.\n\n    Therefore, due to the bottleneck effect result of the Portuguese population movements, (a) immigration from Portugal to Brazil (settlement, 1500), (b) emigration from the Northeast to the Southeast regions of Brazil (the establishment of Rio de Janeiro as the capital of Brazil in 1973) and (c) others fluxes did not allow the fixation of BRCA2 c.156_157insAlu in the population of Bahia.\n\n    The most frequent CHEK2 germline mutations worldwide, c.1100delC, c.444+1G>A and p.I157T, were also not found in any of the analyzed patients. These data are interesting because mutations of low-penetrance genes are more likely to be found than are those of high-penetrance genes.\n\n    Nevertheless, it has to be considered that the presence of these mutations could also be related to the pattern of the admixture of the population. Other studies reported results similar to those presented here, and in Brazil, only one study found c.1100delC, but the affected individual had a family history matching the clinical criteria for hereditary breast and colorectal cancer.\n\n    In this study, the profile of a population that until now uncharacterized was analyzed; most of the subjects were from the largest state of the Northeast region (83.02%), but some were from other regions of Brazil (15.09%). In fact, it is important to consider that every population at some level is heterogeneous, some more than others, and that these variations can interfere with the level of genetic susceptibility.\n\n    Although the ancestry informative markers panel was relatively small, it could be observed that the study population was highly heterogeneous, presenting high levels of European ancestry contribution (62.20%), as well as significant African (31.20%) and Amerindian (6.60%) ancestry contributions. This high European ancestry contribution could be owing to fact that most of the subjects self-reported as white or mulatto (75.48%) and/or were from the countryside regions (52.83%), where there are more people with Caucasian traits than in Salvador, the capital of Bahia.\n\n    However, this degree of heterogeneity was confirmed in the population stratification analysis that was also statistically significant (r=0.604). In the bar plot, the degree of the genetic admixture of the study population was higher than that of the other population groups analyzed. In the triangle plot, the distribution of the study population was between the European and African populations. However, most Brazilian subjects clustered with the European populations, in which the degree of heterozygosity between individuals was higher (0.319) compared with the clusters of the African (0.262) and Amerindian (0.256) populations.\n\n    In Figure 1 (triangle plot), some individuals from the Amerindian population were not near its cluster (cluster 2) or seemed closer to the European cluster (cluster 3); this effect could be related to the size of the panel. Nonetheless, we must consider that there is genetic variation among and within populations; with this panel, a higher degree of heterogeneity of the study population was demonstrated.\n\n    In conclusion, in this highly admixed population, three founder mutations, BRCA1 3450del4 and p.R71G and TP53 p.R337H, were found and can be added to the mutation panels that are used for high-risk HBOC patients and for early-onset breast cancer patients from this region. However, more importantly, these findings indicate that the combined screening of BRCA1/2 and TP53 is important and should be offered to high-risk patients. In addition, it is notable that this population seems to have a high Spanish ancestry contribution, considering that BRCA1 p.R71G was found in a total of five unrelated patients. However, further genetic ancestry analysis could demonstrate whether the haplotype of these Brazilian patients is similar to that of the Galician patients.",

        "Title": "    A Multi-Center Study of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutations in Mexican-Mestizo Breast Cancer Families Reveals Mutations Unreported in Latin American Population",
        "Abstract": "    The presence of germline and somatic deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes has important clinical consequences for breast cancer (BC) patients. Analysis of the mutational status in BRCA genes is not yet common in public Latin American institutions; thus, our objective was to implement high-performance technology with highly reliable results with the possibility of analyzing several patients simultaneously, therefore reducing cost and work time. A prospective cohort of 252 unrelated sporadic breast cancer patients from the Mexican-mestizo population were analyzed using next generation sequencing (NGS) based on ion semiconductor sequencing. We found 28 pathogenic mutations (25 in BRCA1 and 13 in BRCA2), 11 of which had not been reported previously in Hispanic or Latin American populations. A total of 38 patients were positive for a pathogenic mutation representing 15% of our Mexican women cohort with breast cancer; 25 for BRCA1; and 13 for BRCA2. Our results revealed that there are mutations not analyzed by mutations panels, and our findings support the suitability of massive sequencing approaches in the public institutions of developing countries. Hence, BRCA screening should be offered to patients with breast cancer regardless of their family history of cancer in order to identify unaffected family carriers.",
        "Introduction": "    In spite of the time and resources devoted to its study, breast cancer (BC) remains the most diagnosed neoplasm and has the third highest number of reported deaths worldwide. Most breast cancer cases are sporadic; however, approximately 5% of breast cancers are attributable to germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Although different studies have shown that the penetrance of deleterious BRCA is variable, for BRCA1 mutation carriers, the average cumulative risk of developing BC by age 70 has been estimated at 65%, and for BRCA2 mutation carriers, at 45%. Currently, there are more than 3200 described mutations that confer breast or ovarian cancer susceptibility. Rather than being evenly distributed among the population, recent research has shown that BRCA mutations are distributed geographically and that these mutation subsets contain important numbers of exclusive mutations.\n\n    Therefore, it is important to search for BRCA mutations as deeply as possible in populations as diverse as possible. Achieving this is relatively easier in developed countries with efficient screening policies; yet, in countries where widespread public BRCA mutation screening programs for high-risk patients are yet to be fully implemented, more efficient methods need to be pursued. Recently, parallel next-generation sequencing has proven to be a feasible option for BRCA mutation detection in settings such as Tunisia, Brazil, and China, among others.\n\n    In Mexico, available evidence strongly suggests that deleterious BRCA mutations are directly related to a higher proportion of breast cancers in the Mexican-mestizo population, such as an earlier age at onset of breast cancer in Mexican women (<50 years), a high prevalence (23%) of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and a high proportion (20%) of TNBC patients that carry BRCA mutations. Hence, there is a need to continue the previous efforts toward a comprehensive BRCA mutation catalog of the Mexican-mestizo population that can bolster current BC diagnosis and treatment resources.\n\n    The purpose of this study was to analyze BRCA mutation frequency in a Mexican, multi-center cohort of breast and ovarian cancer patients through ion semiconductor sequencing.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 252 unrelated patients were recruited for screening between January 2015 and November 2017: 84 BC patients from the Oncologic Hospital of Guadalajara (Guadalajara City, Mexico) and 168 BC patients from the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (Mexico City, Mexico). Both centers concentrate patients from the neighboring states, i.e., the north and northwestern (Oncologic Hospital of Guadalajara) and center, south, and southeastern (Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia) regions of Mexico, widening the coverage of our study. All patients included in the present study signed an informed consent form.\n\n    DNA was extracted from peripheral blood with the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, cat. no. 51106, Hilden, Germany). DNA integrity was verified by agarose electrophoresis and the concentration was determined using RNase P Detection Reagent (FAM) (Applied Biosystems, cat. no. 4316831).\n\n    BRCA1 and BRCA2 were amplified using the Ion Ampliseq BRCA 1 and 2 panel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This panel includes 167 primers pairs in three pools. For library preparation, we used 25 ng of DNA, and amplifications of each patient were marked with a unique Ion Xpress Barcode Adapter (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. 4471250), purified with AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter cat. no. A63881), and quantified with an Ion Library Taqman Quantitation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. 4468802). Libraries were mixed in equimolar concentrations prior to emulsion PCR and Ion Sphere particle enrichment with a Hi-Q OT2 Reagent Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. A27743) in the Ion OneTouch 2 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For sequencing, we used the Ion PGM Hi-Q Sequencing kit (REFA25589) with chips 314, 316, or 318 in the Ion torrent PGM (Personal Genome Machine) instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n    The sequences data were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome (GRCh37). The .bam files were exported to the Ion Reporter mutation analysis.",
        "Results": "    The screened patients ranged from ages 28 to 63, with a mean age of 40 (n = 252); most samples belonged to stage III (38%, n = 95), and stages I-IV were all represented (Table 1). From a histological perspective, ductal carcinomas were far more frequent than lobular or mixed tumors (Table 2).\n\n    The raw sequencing files obtained from this study can be consulted at . We found a total of 95 variants in the exons and adjacent intronic regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; 40 of these were located in BRCA1 and 55 in BRCA2 (data not shown). From these variants, 28 were reported as pathogenic in the ClinVar database or as Class 5 in the BIC database, 16 in BRCA1, and 12 in BRCA2. From these, 17 had been previously reported in Latin American in Hispanic populations and 11 had not. The most common BRCA1 mutation was c.66_7delAG, present in four samples, while there were 11 mutations with only one report. As for BRCA2, the most common mutation was c.1813delA, which was present in two samples (Table 3). A total of 38 patients were positive for a pathogenic mutation, representing 15% of our Mexican women cohort with breast cancer: 25 for BRCA1 and 13 for BRCA2. Mutation distribution was uneven among molecular subtypes: 20% of the triple negative (TNBC) samples harbored pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 compared to 6.6% and 8% of the HR+ and Her2-, and Her2+ samples, respectively. Pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 were only present in HR+ and Her2-, and Her2+ tumors (Table 4).\n\n    The 28 pathogenic variants comprised mostly frameshift mutations, with a smaller number of amino acid substitutions and only two splicing mutations present (Table 5). Both frameshift and amino acid substitutions were plotted along the BRCA 1 and 2 domain structure to find out whether mutations were more frequent in a particular region of either protein. Figure 1 shows that the distribution is somewhat uniform along the length of both proteins, although there is a higher number of mutations in the coiled coil domain of BRCA 1 and the BRC repeats of BRCA 2.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our study allowed us to analyze mutations not represented in previous screenings of Mexican BC patients, identifying pathogenic mutations in a wide sample of patients from different states of the Mexican territory. Finding unrepresented mutations in Hispanic or Latino populations demonstrates that sequencing, rather than screening for a pre-defined set of mutations, is a more robust approach to the analysis and characterization of pathogenic variants in genes associated with cancer development.",
        "Discussion": "    At present, there are few studies characterizing germline mutations in Mexican-mestizo breast cancer patients. The main disadvantage of these studies is that the methods employed do not analyze the complete sequence of BRCA genes; rather, they search for a pre-defined set of mutations. An example is the panel known as HISPANEL, which analyzes 114 frequent mutations in data obtained in the US with Latin or Hispanic patients. HISPANEL has been used to characterize mutations in Mexican BC patients; however, by analyzing only 114 frequent mutations, it is not possible to identify pathogenic mutations that are under-represented in the population. In this study, we reported 11 mutations that had not been analyzed in Latino or Hispanic populations before, which further evinces the advantages of analyzing genes associated with cancer development through next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.\n\n    In Mexico, access to genetic tests to identify mutations in genes involved in cancer development is still limited. Scientific research projects are providing important data to awaken the interest of policy makers in government to mitigate this problem. In the present work, we screened for germline mutations from a wide area of Mexican territories by recruiting 252 patients from two centers that concentrate patients from most of the Mexican states. The design of the present study allowed us to obtain a cohort of BC patients that reflected the genetic diversity of the Mexican population. Thus, we were able to find 95 variants: 28 of them were classified as pathogenic and 11 had not been reported before in Latin American or Hispanic populations. A recent study by Fernandez-Lopez shows that the distribution of BRCA variants in the Mexican population may not differ significantly in different regions of the country. Although the BRCA variants obtained in this work came from a large number of healthy subjects, we still found pathogenic variants previously unidentified in the Mexican population.\n\n    Despite the fact that our patient cohort was not selected by familial history, the proportion of BC samples where we found BRCA mutations was close to the recently reported values in hereditary breast cancer patients from Colombia, Spain, Saudi Arabia, China, and Israel, among others. However, this was different from Brazil:a Latin American country often compared to Mexico in several aspects:where the BRCA mutation frequency among BC cancer patients is under 4%, and Iran, where studies point at a BRCA mutation frequency of 31% among BC patients.\n\n    The high proportion of TNBC samples matches the result from a previous single-center study that included samples largely from the central region of Mexico, where a 23% of TNBC was found as well. This proportion is similar to global estimates, except for some Asian countries where the proportion is around 15%. Likewise, BRCA mutations in TNBC samples were comparable to the previously observed 23% in patients from Mexico City. This proportion is higher than that found in unselected TNBC, which is around 19%, but can be lower in regions such as Australia, where a 9.3% is reported. Interestingly, we found only BRCA1 mutations in these samples, so we support the idea laid out by Baretta and colleagues that the prognostic value of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations should be accounted for separately, at least regarding TNBC.",

        "Title": "    Prevalence and spectrum of BRCA germline variants in mainland Chinese familial breast and ovarian cancer patients",
        "Abstract": "    Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most penetrating genetic predispositions for breast and ovarian cancer, and their presence is largely ethnic-specific. Comprehensive information about the prevalence and spectrum of BRCA mutations has been collected in European and North American populations. However, similar information is lacking in other populations, including the mainland Chinese population despite its large size of 1.4 billion accounting for one fifth of the world's population. Herein, we performed an extensive literature analysis to collect BRCA variants identified from mainland Chinese familial breast and ovarian cancer patients. We observed 137 distinct BRCA1 variants in 409 of 3,844 and 80 distinct BRCA2 variants in 157 of 3,024 mainland Chinese patients, with an estimated prevalence of 10.6% for BRCA1 and 5.2% for BRCA2. Of these variants, only 40.3% in BRCA1 and 42.5% in BRCA2 are listed in current Breast Cancer Information Core database. We observed higher frequent variation in BRCA1 exons 11A, 11C, 11D, and 24 and BRCA2 exon 10 in Chinese patients than in the patients of other populations. The most common pathogenic variant in BRCA1 wasc.981_982delAT in exon 11A, and in BRCA2 c.3195_3198delTAAT in exon 11B and c.5576_5579delTTAA in exon 11E; the most common novel variant in BRCA1 was c.919A>G in exon 10A, and in BRCA2 c.7142delC in exon 14. None of the variants overlap with the founder mutations in other populations. Our analysis indicates that the prevalence of BRCA variation in mainland Chinese familial breast and ovarian cancer patients is at a level similar to but the spectrum is substantially different from the ones of other populations.",
        "Introduction": "    BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) are rapidly evolving genes with high levels of variation across primate species. Germline mutations in BRCA predispose individuals for breast and ovarian cancer. Extensive efforts have been made to determine the prevalence and spectrum of germline mutations in both genes to aid clinical diagnosis of and prevent the disease.\n\n    Increasing evidence indicates that the presence of BRCA germline mutations in human familial breast and ovarian cancer is largely ethnic-specific. For example, 185delAG [c.66_67delAG according to human genome variation society (HGVS) nomenclature] and 5382insC (c.5263_5264insC) in BRCA1 and 6174delT (c.5946delT) in BRCA2 are highly prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews; c.4153delA (c.4035delA), C61G (c.-58C>G), and 5382insC (c.5263_5264insC) in BRCA1 are common in Polish familial breast cancer patients; c.303T>G, c.5324T>G, c.1623dupG, and c.4122_4123delTG in BRCA1 are frequently present in the familial breast cancer patients of African ancestry; ex9-12del in BRCA1 is often seen in Mexican familial breast and ovarian cancer patients, and c.7480C>T in BRCA2 is enriched in Korean familial breast cancer patients.\n\n    BRCA mutations have been extensively analyzed in European and North American populations, but much less are known about them in Asian, African, and Latin American populations, although these contribute most of the total human population. Using the data from Western populations to interpret BRCA mutations in non-Western patients can be inaccurate and lead to misdiagnoses. Therefore, knowledge of ethnic-specific BRCA mutations is urgently demanding and will be highly beneficial for the patients.\n\n    Mainland China has a population size of nearly 1.4 billion, accounting for one fifth of the human population worldwide. However, limited information about BRCA mutations in this large population is available in current BRCA variation databases. For example, only 13 of the 1,791 BRCA1 variants and three of the 2,000 BRCA2 variants in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database were derived exclusively from mainland Chinese patients. We hypothesized that 1) BRCA variation may be common in this population, and 2) many variants representing potential mutations may have already been identified but this information is unknown outside the Chinese scientific community, because many Chinese scientists publish in Chinese rather than in English and most Chinese medical and health science journals are not included in international journal databases. To test our hypothesis, we performed an extensive survey of Chinese and English scientific literature to collect BRCA variant data derived solely from mainland Chinese familial breast and ovarian cancer patients (Figure 1).",
        "Methods": "    We searched two major Chinese scientific databases, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang, which comprehensively collect information from Chinese academic journals, dissertations, conference proceedings, and patents, by using the key words \"breast cancer\", \"BRCA1 mutation\", and \"BRCA2 mutation\" in Chinese characters. From the identified publications, we excluded those of sporadic breast cancer, animals, and those about patients marked with \"early diagnosis\", \"triple-negative\", and \"bilateral\" but without age indication, \"male\", and from non-mainland Chinese. Using similar approaches but in English, we also searched the PubMed database to identify non-Chinese publications reporting BRCA mutations from mainland Chinese patients (Figure 1).\n\n    We applied multiple steps to ensure the reliability of the identified variants, including: 1) only including variants detected or validated by Sanger sequencing; 2) re-annotating all variants following HGVS nomenclature using the reference sequences U14680 for BRCA1 and U43746 for BRCA2, regardless of original annotation; 3) using the BIC database (13-Mar-2015 version) as a reference to classify variants as known variants with BIC designation or novel variants without BIC designation; 4) excluding synonymous variants and un-interpretable variants from analysis; and 5) annotating novel variants by referring to their effects on coding changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2. We used U14680 and U43746 as the reference sequences for BRCA1 and BRCA2 annotation, as they were used as the standard references by most of the cited publications and BIC database. However, different BRCA databases may use different BRCA reference sequences, which can generate differences for certain variants. For example, Clinvar database uses NM_007294 and NM_000059 as the references for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (64). To facilitate data comparison with BRCA variants annotated by Clinvar database, we also included the variants annotated by using these two references (Supplementary Tables 3, 4). All variants were annotated following HGVS nomenclature.",
        "Results": "    We identified 32 Chinese publications, including 24 peer-reviewed papers and eight graduate theses (Supplementary Table 1), and 11 peer-reviewed English papers. This totaled 43 publications covering between 2003 and 2015 reported BRCA variants from mainland Chinese familial breast and ovarian cancer patients.\n\n    From these publications, we identified familial breast cancer cases using the inclusion criteria described in each publication: at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer irrespective of age; breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 35 years with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer; at least one or two first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer at any age; at least three relatives affected by breast cancer or breast and ovarian cancer; triple-negative breast cancer patients diagnosed before the age of 45 years; bilateral breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 years; one or more primary breast/ovarian cancers in first- or second-degree relatives; and at least one relative with cancer other than breast and ovarian cancer that is known to be BRCA1-related. From these publications, we also collected pedigree and genotype information available from family members although most publications only analyzed the proband without such information (Supplementary Table 2).\n\n    We identified a total of 3,844 familial breast and ovarian cancer cases from the original studies. All of these were analyzed for BRCA1 (3,129 covered all exons), and 3,024 were analyzed for BRCA2 (2,854 covered all exons); 92% of the 3,844 cases were Han Chinese and the rest were from other ethnic groups (Hui, Mongol, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Russian) (Table 1). These studies were performed in 15 provinces or cities in mainland China, mostly in the densely populated, economically advanced eastern coast area, with the exception of Xinjiang and Ningxia regions (Figure 2). The information highlights the need to analyze the population in so far uncovered regions to fully determine the prevalence and spectrum of BRCA mutations in the entire mainland Chinese population.\n\n    Multiple assays including hetero-duplex formation, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and Sanger sequencing were used in the original studies. All BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants collected in our current study were identified by either direct Sanger sequencing or by Sanger sequencing validation for the results from other assays (Table 1).\n\n    By mining the variant data from the 3,844 cases, we identified a total of 137 distinct BRCA1 variants in 409 cases, and 80 distinct BRCA2 variants in 157 cases (Table 2, Supplementary Table 3; Table 3, Supplementary Table 4). Of the 137 BRCA1 variants, 33 (24.6%) were detected by at least two different studies; of the 80 BRCA2 variants, 22 (27.2%) were detected by at least two different studies.\n\n    The prevalence of the variant carriers was 10.6% (409/3,844) for BRCA1 and 5.2% (157/3,024) for BRCA2 (Of the 3,844 cases, all were used for BRCA1, but 3,024 were used for BRCA2). The total number of cases used for all exon analysis was 3,129 in BRCA1 and 2,854 in BRCA2. Thus, the total number of cases in the BRCA2 group accounted for 91.2% of the BRCA1 (2,854/3,129). Therefore, the different prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variations is unlikely caused by the analysis of different cases in each group but instead reflects the fact that BRCA1 has a higher prevalence than BRCA2 in Chinese population. This pattern differs from that in the neighboring Korean population, which has a much higher prevalence of BRCA2 variation than BRCA1 variation. The variation types included frameshift, nonsense, missense, and splicing changes. Majority of the variants except a few do not have frequency information in genome databases, indicating that the variants are mostly rare in human population (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Table 4).\n\n    We compared exon distribution frequencies of BRCA variations between mainland Chinese patients and other patient populations represented in the BIC database. We compared the ratios calculated as: number of variation cases in each exon / total number of variation cases in each data set. The total number of variation cases (entries) in the BIC dataset was 15,311 for BRCA1 and 14,914 for BRCA2; the total number of variation cases in this study was 409 for BRCA1 and 157 for BRCA2. The results showed that the distribution frequencies in 13 out of 24 BRCA1 exons were significantly different between between mainland Chinese and BIC populations (Figure 3A). Variants in mainland Chinese were particularly lower in exons 2 and 20 but higher in exons 11A, 11C, and 11D (exon 11 is arbitrarily divided into 11A, 11B, 11C, and 11D by the BIC database because of its large size) and exon 24 than in other populations. The variants in BRCA1 exons 11A, 11C, 11D and exon 24 occurred in 299 of the 409 (73.1%) Chinese BRCA1- variation cases. In BRCA2, the differences were smaller with only 6 out of 27 exons showed significant difference between mainland Chinese and BIC populations. Exon 10 was the highest in mainland Chinese with 44 of the 157 (28%) Chinese BRCA2-variation cases (Figure 3B). Therefore, BRCA1 exon 11A, 11C, 11D, exon 24, and BRCA2 exon 10 are the variation hot spots in mainland Chinese patients.\n\n    Fifty-six (40.3%) BRCA1 and 34 (42.5%) BRCA2 variants exist in the BIC database (Figure 4). Of these, 27 BRCA1 and 23 BRCA2 variants are classified by BIC as Class 5 (Pathogenic), 27 BRCA1 and 9 BRCA2 variants as Pending [most were variants of unknown significance (VUS)], and two BRCA1 and two BRCA2 variants as Class 1 (Benign). The most common pathogenic BRCA1 variant was c.981_982delAT (p.Cys328*) in exon 11A (n = 18), confirming the previous observation in a smaller group of patients. The frequency of this variant was substantially higher in mainland Chinese than in non-Chinese populations: 18 of 409 (4.4%) Chinese BRCA1 variant carriers carried this variant, compared with only 18 of 15,311 (0.1%) BRCA1 variant carriers in the BIC database. The most common BRCA1 Pending variant was c.3548A>G (p.Lys1183Arg) in exon 11D (n = 34; frequency in 1000 Genomes: 0.3526) and c.3113A>G (p.Glu1038Gly) in exon 11C (n = 31, frequency in 1000 Genomes: 0.3357, in Han Chinese Beijing: 0.689). Three Pending variants [c.5470_5477delATTGGGCA (p.Ile1824Aspfs*3), c.5503C>T (p.Arg1835*)] c.5521delA (p.Ser1841Valfs*2) with high frequencies were located at exon 24, which contributes to the BRCT domain of BRCA1 (Figure 3A). The most common Pathogenic BRCA2 variant was c.3195_3198delTAAT (p.Asn1066Leufs*10) in exon 11B (n = 5) and c.5576_5579delTTAA (p.Ile1859Lysfs*3) in exon 11E (n = 5), and the most common Pending variant was c.865A>C (p.Asn289His) in exon 10 (n = 13; frequency in 1000 Genomes: 0.0737). Except for the BRCA1 c.981_982delAT variant, other known pathogenic and Pending variants in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 are unlikely to be founder mutation candidates among mainland Chinese patients due to their lower prevalence or higher frequency in normal population.\n\n    No variants were found to overlap with other ethnic-specific BRCA founder mutations, including BRCA1 185delAG (c.66_67delAG, HGVS nomenclature) and 5382insC (c.5263_5264insC) and BRCA2 6174delT (c.5946delT) in Ashkenazi Jews; BRCA1 c.4153delA (c.4035delA), C61G (c.-58C>G), and 5382insC (c.5263_5264insC) in Poles; BRCA1 c.303T>G, c.5324T>G, c.1623dupG, and c.4122_4123delTG in Africans; BRCA1 ex9-12del in Mexicans, and BRCA2 c.7480C>T in Koreans.\n\n    Eighty-one (59.4%) BRCA1 variants and 46 (57.5%) BRCA2 variants are not recorded in the BIC database (Figure 4). A total of 19 of these 81 BRCA1 variants and 15 of the 46 BRCA2 variants were detected in at least two cases, with c.919A>G (p.Lys307Glu) in BRCA1 exon 11A (n = 10), c.7142delC (p.Pro2381Hisfs*13) in BRCA2 exon 14 (n = 5) having the highest frequencies. We compared these novel variants with the BRCA variant dataset from Asian populations, and identified 35 overlapping variants (18 in BRCA1 and 17 in BRCA2). Thirty-three (94.3%) of these overlapping variants were from Chinese ethnicity but not from other ethnicities (Supplementary Table 6), confirming that these novel variants are mainland Chinese-specific. The presence of multiple novel variants provides a rich resource to identify new BRCA pathogenic mutations in mainland Chinese population.\n\n    In conclusion, our study indicates that BRCA variations are common in mainland Chinese familial breast and ovarian cancer patients. The absence of such information in current international BRCA databases appears to largely reflect the poor communication between Western and Chinese scientific communities. Our study also indicates while the prevalence of BRCA variation is similar to that of other populations, the spectrum of BRCA variation in Chinese patients differs substantially with the hot spots of BRCA1 exons 11A, 11C, 11D, 24 and BRCA2 exon 10. Except the c.981_982delAT in BRCA1 exon 11A, there is no strong evidence showing the presence of common founder BRCA mutations in mainland Chinese patients, although such a possibility may exist in certain subpopulations of specific geographic regions or ethnic groups in mainland China.",

        "Title": "    PALB2 mutations in BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast and ovarian cancer patients from Poland",
        "Abstract": "    The PALB2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity. Germline inactivating mutations in PALB2 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The prevalence and spectrum of recurrent PALB2 germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancer patients from Poland is not clearly defined.\n\n    PALB2 exons were amplified from 460 BRCA1/2-mutation negative women with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer and early-onset breast cancer using AmpliSeq technology and sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. In addition, eight selected variants were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 807 BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast cancer patients and 1690 healthy women.\n\n    Two recurrent PALB2 mutations, c.172_175delTTGT and c.509_510delGA, were identified, along with one novel mutation, c.347insT. In total, PALB2 pathogenic mutations were detected in 7/460 (1.5%) patients. Furthermore, in breast and/or ovarian cancer patients, several single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected in the PALB2 coding region. In an additional group of 807 patients, eight (1%) carriers of two pathogenic mutations, c.172_175delTTGT (0.5%) and c.509_510delGA (0.5%), were identified. The c.509_510delGA mutation was not identified in healthy controls, while c.172_175delTTGT was identified in 4/1690 (0.24%) of control women.\n\n    Germline mutations in the PALB2 gene were observed at a frequency of approximately 1.5% in Polish breast and/or ovarian cancer patients. Our study confirms two recurrent PALB2 mutations; c.172_175delGA and c.509_510delGA.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. About 5-10% of breast and 10% of ovarian cancers are thought to be hereditary. Mutations in the two main susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for 20% of hereditary breast cancer (HBC) and 30% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Other genes participating in DNA-damage response pathways, including CHEK2, NBS1, ATM, BRIP1, and PALB2, are also involved in HBC and HBOC.\n\n    The PALB2 (MIM 610355, Partner and  Localizer of  B RCA 2) gene was identified in a search for novel components of endogenous BRCA2 containing complexes. The PALB2 protein interacts with both BRCA1 and BRCA2 through its N-terminal coiled-coil and C-terminal WD-40 domains, respectively. These three proteins form a \"BRCA complex\" in which PALB2 acts as a bridge between BRCA1 and BRCA2. The \"BRCA complex\" is crucial for initiating homologous recombination in the DNA-damage response.\n\n    Biallelic inactivating germline mutations in the PALB2 gene lead to Fanconi anemia (Fanconi anemia type N), whereas monoallelic mutations are associated with an increased risk of breast, pancreatic, and possibly ovarian cancer. Germline mutations in PALB2 are responsible for 1-3.9% of HBC. Similar to BRCA2, germline mutations in PALB2 are also associated with hereditary predisposition to male breast cancer. To date, approximately 50 truncating mutations in PALB2 have been detected in breast cancer families worldwide.\n\n    The first breast cancer family-based association study estimated that a relative risk of 2.3 (95% CI: 1.4-3.9) is conferred by mutations of PALB2. Most recently, Antoniou and colleagues. applied a modified segregation procedure to show that the age-specific risk of breast cancer in female mutation carriers overlaps with that conferred by BRCA2 mutations.\n\n    In a previous study, we demonstrated that in a group of 512 patients for whom targeted BRCA1/2 mutation testing did not show any pathogenic variants, sequencing of BRCA1/2 exons identified 52 carriers of mutations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of PALB2 germline mutations in a group of 460 BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast and/or ovarian cancer patients and identify the optimal panel of recurrent mutations for genetic screening of PALB2.",
        "Methods": "    DNA samples were chosen from the repository of the Genetic Counseling Unit, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. In-depth interviews assessed personal and familial cancer history. Healthy women with no known history of cancer were enrolled from the National Colorectal Cancer Screening Program. Patients comprised a group of 460 BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast cancer patients (with a median age of 43 years, range 17-68 years) and included 165, 103, and 192 women with HBC, HBOC, and early-onset breast cancer (EOBC), respectively. This group of patients had undergone full BRCA1/2 sequencing using the Ion AmpliSeq BRCA1 and BRCA2 Panel (Thermo) on a PGM sequencer as part of our previous study.\n\n    An additional group, comprising 807 selected BRCA1/2-mutation negative women, was surveyed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. This group had a median age of 48 years (range 20-85 years); included 322, 81, and 404 HBC, HBOC, and EOBC patients, respectively; and were negative for 20 selected BRCA1/2 mutations, including 11 mutations in BRCA1, namely, c.66_67delAG, c.181T > C, c.3756delGTCT, c.3700_3704del5, c.4035delA, c.3777delT, c.4065delTCAA, c.4041delAG, c.5263delC, c.5213G > A, and 5370C > T, and nine mutations in BRCA2, namely, c.1408G > T, c.5946delT, c.5239insT, c.6447delTA, c.5964delAT, c.7910del5, c.9382C > T, c.8924delT, and c.9402delT.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, as previously described. DNA concentrations were determined using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo) and the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo). For library construction, the Ion AmpliSeq  Library Kit 2.0 (Thermo) and Ion AmpliSeq PALB2 custom primers, comprising 27 primer pairs spanning 5.29 kb, were used to amplify the coding regions of the PALB2 gene. Library concentrations and size distributions were determined with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo) and a High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent), respectively.\n\n    Up to 48 libraries were combined in equimolar concentrations following their loading onto an Ion Chef for DNA template preparation with a set of reagents from an Ion PGM IC 200 Kit and an Ion 316 Chip Kit v2 BC (Thermo). Sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent PGM in a mode with 500-flow runs. Data were analyzed on the Ion Torrent server using the Torrent Suite software (Thermo). Sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome and fitted to PALB2 designed amplicons. The coverage analysis and variant caller plug-ins were run with optimal settings to identify germline variants. PALB2 gene variants were annotated using data from ClinVar-NCBI and LOVD.\n\n    Mutations found with NGS were validated by Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, eight selected variants, namely 172_175del4, c.347insT, c.509_510delGA, Gln559Arg, Glu672Gln, Leu939Trp, Gly998Glu, and Thr1100Thr were analyzed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Thermo) on an ABI 7900HT qPCR system (Thermo), as previously described.",
        "Results": "    We evaluated the frequencies of PALB2 germline mutations in 460 BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast and/or ovarian cancer patients. Of the 460 women, 268 had HBC and/or HBOC, and 192 had EOBC, with a median age at breast cancer diagnosis of 43 years (range 17-68 years).\n\n    In this group, we identified seven unrelated carriers (1.5%) of the three PALB2 truncating mutations: c.172_175delTTGT (n = 4), c.347insT (n = 1), and c.509_510delGA (n = 2) (Table 1). Six of the seven carriers (2.2%) were among the 268 HBOC patients, and one (0.5%) was in the EOBC group.\n\n    In addition to these pathogenic mutations, we detected 10 SNVs in the coding region of the PALB2 gene (Table 2).\n\n    Using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays, the frequencies of eight selected variants, including three truncating mutations (c.172_175delTTGT, c.347insT, c.509_510delGA), a rare missense variant (Leu939Trp), and four common polymorphisms (Gln559Arg, Glu672Gln, Gly998Glu, Thr1100Thr), were tested in an additional group of 807 breast and/or ovarian cancer patients (median age, 48 years; range 20-85 years), and 1690 healthy women (median age, 58 years; range 26-79 years).\n\n    The pathogenic mutation, c.172_175delTTGT, was identified in 4/807 (0.5%) breast cancer patients and in 4/1690 (0.24%) healthy controls (Table 2). The c.509_510delGA mutation was detected in four breast cancer patients, and was not found in healthy control subjects. The c.347insT mutation was identified in neither additional cancer patients nor healthy controls.\n\n    The frequencies of the four common polymorphisms were similar in cancer patients and healthy controls; therefore, the clinical significance of these polymorphic variants could not be confirmed. In addition, the Leu939Trp missense variant was detected in six of 807 (0.7%) cancer patients and three of 1690 (0.2%) healthy controls; hence, the incidence of this change was not significantly different between patients and controls.",
        "Conclusion": "    In summary, our study confirmed two PALB2 recurrent mutations, c.172_175delGA and c.509_510delGA, in BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast and/or ovarian cancer patients from Poland. The c.509_510delGA mutation contributed to familial cancer but was absent in non-familial cancer patients, while the c.172_175delTTGT mutation was identified in both familial and non-familial cancer patients.",
        "Discussion": "    We identified three pathogenic PALB2 mutations among 460 BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast and/or ovarian cancer patients. The two recurrent mutations identified in our study were c.172_175delTTGT and c.509_510delGA. The novel pathogenic mutation c.347insT was found only in one young patient with HBC. The two recurrent mutations were identified in five patients with HBC and one patient with EOBC, but without any family history. In the cancer patient group, the recurrent variants (c.172_175delTTGT and c.509_510delGA) accounted for 86% (6/7) of PALB2 mutations. Our NGS and TaqMan genotyping studies indicate that the pathogenic c.509_510delGA mutation contributes to familial breast and/or ovarian cancer (0.9%); however, the c.172_175delTTGT mutation was identified both in familial (0.6%) and non-familial cancer patients (0.7%). The recurrent mutation c.509_510delGA is a European founder mutation that has been identified in breast cancer patients from Poland, Belarus, Russia, and Germany. This mutation has been detected in 0.6-1.4% of breast cancer patients in three independent studies in Poland. The other recurrent PALB2 mutation, c.172_175delTTGT, was identified in breast cancer patients from the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\n    The PALB2 gene mutation rate (1.5%) determined for our group of breast and/or ovarian cancer patients was similar to those reported by other studies. PALB2 germline mutations have been identified in Finland, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, Italy, Spain, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, Canada, USA, China, and South Africa, with rates ranging from 0.1 to 3.9%, depending on the population. In breast cancer families with both female and male breast cancer, PALB2 mutation rates increased to 6.7% in a UK study and to 9.0% in a Spanish study.\n\n    In addition to clearly pathogenic mutations, we detected 10 missense variants in the coding region of the PALB2 gene. Identifying variants of unknown significance in cancer susceptibility genes represents a real problem in genetic counseling. It should be stressed that, to date, no PALB2 missense variant has been classified as definitely pathogenic in any large population study. Park et al. reported that the rare missense variant, Leu939Trp, is associated with altered direct binding of PALB2 to the RAD51C, RAD51, and BRCA2 proteins. Functionally, the Leu939Trp mutant displays a decreased capacity for DNA double-strand break repair and an increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. In our group of breast and/or ovarian cancer patients, the missense variant, Leu939Trp, was detected in two (0.4%) breast cancer patients, one (0.4%) patient with HBOC, and in one (0.5%) with EOBC. Interestingly, in our study, the missense variant rate was 3.5 times more frequent in breast cancer patients (0.7%) than in healthy controls (0.2%), although the differences were not statistically significant. Consistent with this observation, a recent large case-control study by Southey et al. found no evidence of association of the Lys939Trp variant with breast cancer risk. Furthermore, Catucci and colleagues have also recently shown that the Lys939Trp variant does not disrupt the homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair activity of PALB2 and they concluded that this variant should be regarded as neutral with no clinical relevance to risk of breast cancer.",

        "Title": "    Spectrum of BRCA1/2 variants in 940 patients from Argentina including novel, deleterious and recurrent germline mutations: impact on healthcare and clinical practice",
        "Abstract": "    BRCA1/2 mutations in Latin America are scarcely documented and in serious need of knowledge about the spectrum of BRCA pathogenic variants, information which may alter clinical practice and subsequently improve patient outcome. In addition, the search for data on testing policies in different regions constitutes a fundamental strength for the present study, which analyzes BRCA1/2 gene sequences and large rearrangements in 940 probands with familial and/or personal history of breast/ovary cancer (BOC). In non-mutated DNA samples, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification assays (MLPA) were used for the analysis of large rearrangements.\n\n    Our studies detected 179 deleterious mutations out of 940 (19.04%) probands, including 5 large rearrangements and 22 novel mutations. The recurrent mutations accounted for 15.08% of the total and only 2.87% of the probands analyzed, very different from a Hispanic panel previously described.\n\n    In conclusion: a) this first comprehensive description of the spectrum in BRCA1/2 sheds light on the low frequency of recurrent mutations; b) this information is key in clinical practice to select adequate sequencing studies in our population, subsequently improve patient outcome and prevent damage associated to false normal reports resulting from the use of invalid population panels; c) panels of mutations from other populations should be cautiously validated before imported, even those of apparently similar origin, a concept to be considered beyond significance in Argentina.",
        "Introduction": "    Germline mutations in one of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 (MIN #113705) or BRCA2 (MIN#600185), are the major and most widely known risk factors for breast and/or ovarian cancer (BOC) hereditary syndrome (HBOC), although they are present in about 40% of cases with strong family BOC background. HBOC occurs in 5-10% of all BOC cases; in turn, individuals with such inheritance have a 50-80% risk of developing breast cancer and a 30-50% risk of ovarian cancer in their lifetime, while other malignancies such as prostate and pancreatic cancer have been less frequently observed. Furthermore, cancer types such as melanoma and colon have been detected in families with BRCA2 mutations.\n\n    Since the discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, thousands of genetic variants with different clinical significance have been described in the Breast Cancer Information Core Database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/ access in october 2015), with near 2000 of them being classified as pathogenically responsible for HBOC. The large extension of these genes and the rare hot spot mutations generate a genetic diversity with more than 700 pathogenic mutations described only once.\n\n    The frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers in women with BOC depends on the population analyzed but appears to be similar across ethnicity. However, significant variation has been demonstrated in the spectrum of BRCA1/2 mutations according to ethnic and/or geographical diversity. Racial mixture in the South American population has been reported in epidemiological and molecular studies. In particular, the Argentine population consists of an admixture of European ancestry -mainly from Spain and Italy- and an Amerindian component in a variable degree which is observed in more than 50% of the population.\n\n    The epidemiology of HBOC in Argentina has been described in a single report, which reveals racial admixture and clinically relevant genetic variants, including deleterious mutations previously unexplored. Other studies have reported a Hispanic panel including 9 recurrent deleterious mutations which account for 53% of the total, although it should be pointed out that the composition of the so-called Hispanic population analyzed in this publication reflects the Mexican and Central America/Caribbean origin for these probands, completely different from Argentine ethnicity. Big efforts have been made to select a panel of mutations for South American populations such as Peru, Mexico, Chile and Colombia and they all share a common goal: to lower study costs. Although attention needs to be drawn to the implementation of a mutation panel as a putative screening standard anticipating its impact on health care, \"non-mutation detected\" results for this panel should be followed by the full sequence of BRCA1/2. A panel may become, however, the only analysis in a patient's lifetime, at least in Argentina; in other words, he/she might never be analyzed for the total sequence because of our heterogeneous health insurance system. This secondary effect may prove harmful and confusing for patients and doctors, who may never realize the test performed is practically useless. In addition, limited data on testing outcome and the need for information on testing policies in different regions around the world makes this study all the more relevant. A review has been recently published describing the current knowledge on BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in 4835 women from Latin America, the Caribbean and the Hispanic population in the United States. The study concludes that countries with high prevalence of BRCA pathogenic variants may benefit from more aggressive testing strategies, while testing of recurrent variant panels might present a cost-effective solution for improving genetic testing for hereditary cancer in some, but not all countries.\n\n    These arguments highlight the importance of analyzing BRCA1/2 gene sequences and large rearrangements, searching for a regional spectrum of variants to contribute to the clinical application of genetic data and the evaluation of HBOC risk in a Hispanic population of different origin. In this context, the present report analyzed 940 probands with HBOC from the Argentine population.",
        "Methods": "    The study includes 940 patients with ages ranging from 23 to 90 years old, recruited between 2005-2012 from the report and the rest of the patients from January 2013 up to December 2015. They were selected by age at diagnosis before 40 and/or a family history with at least 2 relatives (one of 1st and one of 2nd degree) with breast, ovary or related cancers to BRCA1/2, as described in Table 1, which also summarizes the results from the present report. Study eligibility after genetic counseling required signing an informed consent as a result of the routine procedures for genetic analysis (including Ethics Committee approval) at CEMIC (Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas), which also complies with the Traditional Pretest Counseling for Susceptibility Testing (purpose of testing) described in the American Society of Clinical Oncology Policy Statement Update.\n\n    As mentioned, a total of 940 samples were analyzed. The first 298 samples were processed with the same methodology used in a previous report and subsequent analysis of the samples was performed by NGS as described below. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood by MagNA Pure  LC instrument with total DNA isolation kit I (Roche Diagnostics). PCR amplification of the regions of interest was done to construct a library with a community panel for BRCA1 and BRCA2 using a pool of primers with technology ampliseq  to amplify exons and exon-intron boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Sequencing of the amplified regions was performed with the next generation platform Personal Genome Machine  System. As a control, the STR variants of every sample were traced before and intra NGS was used to ensure the identification of the sample and avoid possible processing errors (Genia Laboratory, Zonamerica, Uruguay). The few codifying sequences with low readings were analyzed by Sanger reaction in order to reach 100% coverage, as was the case for every clinically relevant mutation.\n\n    Large rearrangements were measured by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) with reagents from MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, ND and software Coffalyser.net was used for data analysis.\n\n    Variant nomenclature follows the guidelines for the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Genetic variants detected in a sequence were verified in the Cancer Information Core Internet Website (BIC) as December 2015 (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/), for clinical importance and to determine whether a variant report (otherwise novel) exists. The effects of those missense mutations which were neither reported nor recorded as clinically unknown (CU) in the BIC were predicted by virtual analyses of functional compatibility for aminoacid changes using software Align-GVGD (http://agvgd.iarc.fr/) and SIFT (http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html).",
        "Results": "    The analysis of 940 probands revealed 179 (19.04%) deleterious mutations including five large rearrangements: 105 found in the BRCA1 and 74 in the BRCA2 gene, all of them detailed in the Supplementary table, with the exception of the novel mutations listed in Table 2. The distribution of the mutations was as follows: a) 105 probands bore a mutation in the BRCA1 gene, with 8 cases having breast/ovary cancer diagnosis, 11 cases with ovary cancer diagnosis (one is a novel mutation, c.2728C > T, p.Gln910*) and 85 with breast cancer diagnosis, 6 of which were bilateral; b) in 74 probands the mutation was detected in the BRCA2 gene and include 6 cases with breast/ovary cancer diagnosis (two of them with a novel mutation: c.8754+1G > A and c.8463dupT, p.Ile2822Tyrfs), 2 cases with ovary cancer diagnosis (one is a novel mutation, c.7805+2_7805+3delTA, in intron 16) and the rest with breast cancer diagnosis, 5 female bilateral cases and 3 male cases, one of them bilateral.\n\n    It may be worth highlighting that 230 patients analyzed from a total of 940 had a family history but no personal history of cancer. However, and even if their health status may result from not having inherited the allele with the mutation, they were included in the total patients, as 22 (mean age = 39, range 18-68) out of these 230 were found to be carriers of a mutation (for the non-carriers, n = 208, mean age = 41, range = 23-61).\n\n    Table 2 lists the 22 novel (at the moment of the detection) deleterious mutations, 8 in BRCA1 and 14 in BRCA2, which represent 12.3% of total mutations. All of them are tier 1, as the resulting stop codon from the frameshift mutation is already associated with a deleterious effect. Table 3 lists a total of 8 novel variants, 2 in BRCA1 and 6 in BRCA2, with probably deleterious effect on the resulting protein, as observed in in silico analyses. In both groups, the vast majority had breast cancer diagnosis, with only two cases of ovarian cancer (one with a mutation in each BRCA gene, both novel variants) and two cases with both breast and ovary cancers (both with a mutation in BRCA2), all of them in the novel variant group (Table 2).\n\n    Recurrent mutations are listed in Table 4, which shows four different deleterious mutations detected 4 or more times in 27 probands, and which represent 2.87% of the total probands analyzed and 15.08% of the patients with a detected mutation. Two additional mutations, the c.5123C > A p.Ala1708Glu in BRCA1 and c.9026_9030delATCAT p.Tyr3009_His3010fs in BRCA2 were found in three probands each, increasing frequency of recurrent mutations from 2.87% to 3.52% of the total probands analyzed.\n\n    Preliminary results from the sequencing of an additional series of 50 ovary cancer patients (own data in process) showed three instances of the BRCA1 mutation c.4964_4982delCTGGCCTGACCCCAGAAGA, p.Ser1655_Glu1661?fs. Even if not included in the recurrent panel, this 19bp deletion in our patients appears worth mentioning, as it is listed twice in the Supplementary table and thus renders a 5-time frequency of clinical relevance.\n\n    Also worth highlighting, no Ashkenazi mutations were found out of the Ashkenazi ethnicity, as confirmed two detections of the 6174delT (BIC nomenclature) (c.5946_5946delT, p.Ser1982Argfs) with grand/great-grandparents of such ethnic origin.\n\n    The large rearrangements listed in Table 5 prove to be rather infrequent mutations in our population, representing only 0.53% (5 of the 940) and all of them corresponding to the BRCA1 gene, in agreement with patients' ethnic origin as previously described.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our results in the sequence analysis of the BRCA1/2 genes in HBOC probands reveal novel mutations, recurrent mutations and other findings contributing to the knowledge of BRCA1/2 comprehensive sequence.\n\n    We emphasize the following findings: a) no hot spots for BRCA1/2, up to date, have been found in patients from our country; b) recurrent mutations have a frequency of 2.87% in the population analyzed and 15.08% in the total mutations, and should therefore, in our opinion, not be implemented for clinical purposes; c) caution must be taken in importing panels for clinical purposes from apparently similar populations; d) panels can make a contribution to shortening studies, but users must be aware of the limitations and alert clinicians and patients, whenever possible.\n\n    Further studies and the analysis of the admixture, as a result of successive generations following original immigration, might help understand the origin of inherited mutations in cancer.",
        "Discussion": "    This report is to date the first study in our country to summarize the relevant findings of the local experience in the full sequencing of the BRCA1/2 genes through the analysis of 940 probands (Supplementary table) in two centers in Argentina.\n\n    This study is also the largest on Hispanic families from one country with breast/ovarian cancer in South America, confirming differences from Hispanic families in the United States. In US Hispanic families, recurrent mutations represent 53% of total mutations, which indicates potential for cost-effective ancestry-informed genetic screening Weitzel et al.. In contrast, recurrent mutations in the Hispanic population of South America represent only 15.08% (Table 4), which highlights the importance of clinical genetic strategies adapted to each population's needs and intrinsic genetic characteristics.\n\n    One of the important features of our report is the number of probands analyzed. Recently, a very elegant review studying the spectrum of BRCA1/2 alleles in Latin America and the Caribbean combined 4835 individuals from 13 countries. This review concludes that the Hispanic population of Latin America and the US may benefit from genetic-based cancer prevention options, a strategy that should combine knowledge on hereditary cancer in those populations and improved access to genetic testing. Also in this review, only 10.4% of 167 BRCA pathogenic variants identified were shared between US Hispanics and Latin America, a finding regarded as consequence of the limited sample size available for some of the countries. The present study, however, describes results for 940 probands from a single country and still shows the same discrepancy described in the review, which clearly proves differences to be associated to real genetic diversity and not limited sample size.\n\n    The use of the NGS sequencing technique was crucial in improving our previous report, expanding the analysis from about a hundred cases to nearly a thousand probands. Out of these 940 probands, 179 revealed deleterious mutations, which constitutes 19.04%, an expected rate of detection (Supplementary table). Tables 2 and 5 show novel mutations and large rearrangement, respectively, the latter including 5 cases which represent 0.54% of the series.\n\n    In the 179 probands analyzed, an expectable correlation was found between cancer type and gene mutation: we found most cases with ovary cancer diagnosis to have mutations in BRCA1, 12 cases (one novel) compared with probands with a mutation in BRCA2, 2 cases (one novel). The breast and ovary cancer cases were similar for both genes with 7 and 6 cases for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively, while the 3 cases of male breast cancer (one bilateral) presented a mutation only in BRCA2 (Supplementary table).\n\n    Large rearrangements are frequent in few ethnic groups and represent only 0.54% of total cases in our study, which is consistent with our patients' ethnic origin detailed in Table 5. These results confirm the differences between the Hispanic families from South America and the United States, where large rearrangements represent 11% of the total. Moreover, the Mexican founder large deletion described by Weitzel et al was not found in our series.\n\n    These discrepancies may be due to the differences between the Mexican and Central America/Caribbean origin of these probands, which is remarkably different from Argentine ethnicity, mostly European (Spanish, Italian and German) and Amerindian. Worth pointing out, the Hispanic families from the United States included only 36 probands from South America.\n\n    In our population, a single mutation -c.211A > G, Arg71Gly, reported as of Spanish origin- out of the 15 recurrent mutations included in the Hispanic panel has four or more probands; regarding other mutations described in the panel, three were found up to three times in our population: Ala1708Glu (c.5123C > A) and Arg1443* (c.4327C > T) in BRCA1 and c.9026_9030del5, p.Tyr3009_His3010fs in BRCA2. In other words, if the Hispanic panel were applied, these mutations would altogether reach 1.8% of the total probands and 9.5% of the mutated samples. These numbers mean that sequencing the 15 mutations described in 100 probands would render less than 2 patients bearing one of the mutations. Remarkably, the 185delAG (c.66_67delAG, p.Leu22_Glu23LeuValfs) mutation was never found in our series and is included in the Hispanic panel, although it has always been described to occur on the Jewish haplotype.\n\n    In agreement with the concept of eventual regional variants and/or population heterogeneity, we have previously reported novel mutations in other genes in our population, detected by direct sequencing such as protooncogen RET, Lynch Syndrome, APC in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.\n\n    Few novel missense variants evaluated in silico were found with protein damage prediction programs (Table 3), which heightens the need for cautious interpretation of the variants detected.\n\n    No hotspots were detected in our population with the variants distributed along both genes (Figure 1), which rules out the possibility of a hot spot zone in the gene or a panel of mutations that might allow the implementation of a low cost initial assay for BRCA1/2 analysis as attempted in other studies.\n\n    These striking differences are a warning sign against the import of panels from apparently similar populations. This is a key issue in many aspects: a) clinicians and patients may be misinformed, even in cases with accomplished genetic counseling; b) when a panel is the first analysis, in our health system, insurance may reject further analyses in the same line, i.e. twice the analysis \"of the same genes\", which might also be inaccurate, as a full sequencing test is required after a non-mutation has been detected in a panel; c) if health insurance covered both analyses (the panel of mutations and the full sequencing), 97% of the patients analyzed for the recurrent mutations would need full sequencing of BRCA1/2, which is not even economically convenient; d) attention needs to be drawn to the correct interpretation of results, as \"normal\" is considered equivalent to \"uncompleted analysis\" at two levels: the restricted number of mutations analyzed and the limitations of the BRCA1/2 analysis itself, a restraining concept for the initial study of a complex genetic study.\n\n    Future work will focus on the study of non-BRCA predisposing breast and ovarian cancer genes through multigene panels, although it might be not being easy as the highly conflicts generated by those panels.\n\n    This is an important point to be considered in providing the best healthcare possible, mostly in South American countries where the supporting economy is frequently in crisis and low cost studies are attractive. There is a real need for the implementation of highly supported medical care on both ethical and genetic grounds. This will render profits from funds invested in health, mostly in the prevention of high costs for cancer treatments and analyses in hereditary cancer, to be used in prevention (first goal) and early detection.",

        "Title": "    Development and Validation of a Next-Generation Sequencing Assay for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Variants for the Clinical Laboratory",
        "Abstract": "    The objective of this study was to design and validate a next-generation sequencing assay (NGS) to detect BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. We developed an assay using random shearing of genomic DNA followed by RNA bait tile hybridization and NGS sequencing on both the Illumina MiSeq and Ion Personal Gene Machine (PGM). We determined that the MiSeq Reporter software supplied with the instrument could not detect deletions greater than 9 base pairs. Therefore, we developed an alternative alignment and variant calling software, Quest Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (QSAP), that was capable of detecting large deletions and insertions. In validation studies, we used DNA from 27 stem cell lines, all with known deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, and DNA from 67 consented control individuals who had a total of 352 benign variants. Both the MiSeq/QSAP combination and PGM/Torrent Suite combination had 100% sensitivity for the 379 known variants in the validation series. However, the PGM/Torrent Suite combination had a lower intra- and inter-assay precision of 96.2% and 96.7%, respectively when compared to the MiSeq/QSAP combination of 100% and 99.4%, respectively. All PGM/Torrent Suite inconsistencies were false-positive variant assignments. We began commercial testing using both platforms and in the first 521 clinical samples MiSeq/QSAP had 100% sensitivity for BRCA1/2 variants, including a 64-bp deletion and a 10-bp insertion not identified by PGM/Torrent Suite, which also suffered from a high false-positive rate. Neither the MiSeq nor PGM platform with their supplied alignment and variant calling software are appropriate for a clinical laboratory BRCA sequencing test. We have developed an NGS BRCA1/2 sequencing assay, MiSeq/QSAP, with 100% analytic sensitivity and specificity in the validation set consisting of 379 variants. The MiSeq/QSAP combination has sufficient performance for use in a clinical laboratory.",
        "Introduction": "    Every year, more than 200,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in the United States. Of these, approximately 2% to 5% are associated with loss-of-function variants in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. With the exception of Ashkenazi-Jewish women, who have a 2% to 5% carrier frequency for 3 founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, the estimated carrier frequency in the general population is 1:300 for BRCA1 and 1:800 for BRCA2. Patients with deleterious mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a 50% to 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 20% to 40% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. Triple-negative breast cancers:those that do not express estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or Her2/neu and are characterized as being more aggressive:account for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers; they are associated with BRCA mutations at frequencies between 4% and 42%, depending on the characteristics of the study population (eg, proportion of women who are Ashkenazi Jewish).\n\n    The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has developed guidelines for assisting healthcare providers in identifying patients and family members at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer and who may benefit from cancer genetic risk assessment. Genetic risk assessment can include genetic testing but is a dynamic counseling process. Determining whether a woman with breast cancer is BRCA1/2 positive can assist in appropriate counseling regarding increased surveillance and the risks and benefits of undergoing contralateral mastectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy, both of which have been shown to be protective against breast cancer. Identifying a deleterious BRCA1/2 variant in a patient can also be helpful to family members, who may need access to genetic counseling and testing to assess their cancer risk and identify appropriate management. The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends BRCA1/2 testing for individuals from high-risk populations, including those with early onset breast cancer (diagnosed before age 50); two primary breast cancers, either bilateral or ipsilateral; family history of early onset breast cancer; male breast cancer; personal or family history of ovarian cancer (particularly nonmucinous types); Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish heritage in the setting of a newly diagnosed breast cancer or family history of breast cancer; previously identified BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in the family; triple-negative breast cancer at <=60 years of age; or pancreatic cancer associated with a family history of hereditary breast and ovarian related cancer.\n\n    Comprehensive BRCA testing consists of sequencing all the coding exons and the splice junction regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2, plus analysis of large rearrangements. In our laboratory we are performing the large rearrangement analysis using Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) kits purchased from MRC Holland. This article describes only the sequencing based part of our comprehensive BRCA test. PCR-based sequencing methods, including Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) systems that use PCR amplification, may yield false-negative results due to allele drop-out when polymorphisms are present in amplification or sequencing primer sequences. The use of bait tile library exon capture followed by NGS can avoid this potential cause of false-negative testing. Bait tiles are biotinylated 125-bp RNA molecules used to capture relevant fragments. Since the bait tiles are 100 bases longer than typical PCR or sequencing primers and RNA/DNA hybrids are stronger than DNA/DNA hybrids, polymorphisms are less likely to interfere with the exon capture. A second major advantage of bait tile capture versus PCR based sequencing methods is the avoidance of false positive results due to clonal bias in PCR or library formation. We developed an NGS-based assay using bait tile exon capture for detection of BRCA1/2 variants in a reference laboratory. Two different NGS platforms were employed: the Illumina MiSeq System and the Life Technologies Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. Here we report the validation of this assay, results from the first 521 clinical samples obtained using both NGS platforms, and an additional 1006 results obtained using duplicate MiSeq runs. We have not previously offered BRCA testing in our laboratory. Our complete offering includes large rearrangement testing for all coding expos using MLPA.",
        "Methods": "    Fig 1 illustrates the general overview of the NGS assay for detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants.\n\n    DNA samples from cell lines with known deleterious variants in BRCA1 (n = 21; Table 1) or BRCA2 (n = 6; Table 1) were purchased from the Coriell Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). These reference samples contained both pathogenic and nonpathogenic variants. We also obtained blood samples from 67 unaffected individuals previously untested for BRCA mutations and performed Sanger sequencing to determine the presence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variations. In all, 352 benign variants were identified in the volunteer population and were used in the technical validation. All 67 subjects provided written informed consent. The protocol for this study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board.\n\n    Genomic DNA from peripheral blood cells was isolated in 96-well microtiter plates using a Roche Magnapure system from Roche Molecular Systems (Indianapolis, IN) per the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was randomly sheared to an average size of 250 base pairs using adaptive focused acoustics technology (E220 Focused Ultra-Sonicator, Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    Immediately after shearing, the DNA was concentrated 2-fold and DNA molecules with inadequate sizes were removed. This was accomplished with SPRI (solid-phase reversible immobilization) beads (AMPure Beads, Agencourt, Beverley, MA). The beads were suspended in a solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG), EDTA.\n\n    The ends of the DNA molecules were repaired prior to adaptor ligation. This was accomplished using a DNA polymerase that has both 5' to 3' polymerase activity and 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, thereby filling in 5' overhangs and removing 3' overhangs to generate blunt ends. In addition, the 5' end of the DNA fragments were also phosphorylated in this process.\n\n    Each 5' adaptor contains a unique molecular identification (MID) sequence (barcode) that is used to identify individual DNA samples. In addition, it contains a portion of the P5 sequence. The 3' adaptor is universal to all specimens and contains a portion of the P7 MiSeq sequence. Neither adaptor is 5' phosphorylated. A short complimentary oligonucleotide for each of the adaptors is also included in the ligation reaction to ensure that the adaptors are only ligated to the DNA fragments and not to themselves. During ligation the molar ratios of the two adaptors are equal to each other but are in excess in comparison to the fragmented DNA. Following this procedure, approximately half of all ligation products are the preferred species, namely: 5'-(P5)-MID-BRCA_GeneDNA-universal (P7)-3'. The samples are cleaned using SPRI beads as described above, and the nicks at the ligation site are repaired by a DNA polymerase. The polymerase adds nucleotides at the nick site creating a primer binding site for PCR amplification.\n\n    In order to increase the ratio of adapted DNA fragments non-allele specific PCR was performed. The primers used were complementary to the 5' and the 3' adaptor sequences.\n\n    All bar coded patient DNA fragments were pooled to create a \"library,\" and were added to a hybridization reaction mixture and incubated for 12 hours at 65 C. This mixture contained the biotinylated RNA baits. The baits were complimentary to BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (exonic regions and splice junction sites, and a selected intronic region) to allow hybridization to the appropriate patient DNA fragments. After the hybridization, the library was combined with streptavidin coated beats to adsorb the biotinylated RNA baits. The library-RNA bait hybrids were washed at 70 C to remove the non-BRCA DNA.\n\n    Additional sequences required for either the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) or Ion Torrent Personal Gene Machine (PGM) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) sequencing platforms were added to the 5' and 3' adaptors using fusion primers. The DNA library was divided into two halves. One half was amplified with fusion primers (P5 and P7 sequences) that have a portion complementary to the 5' and 3' adaptors and add additional sequences for MiSeq sequencing and the other half was amplified with a set of primers (P1 and A sequences) that add additional sequences for PGM sequencing.\n\n    The high sensitivity Qubit kit (Life Technologies), which uses an intercalating dye based method, was used to quantify DNA.\n\n    The library was diluted so that amplification generated well-separated clusters of identical products from a single DNA molecule (clonal amplification) The MiSeq and PGM NGS protocols were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols.\n\n    The single-stranded library was loaded into well 21 of the MiSeq sequencing cartridge. The instrument flushed the library through the flow cell where it hybridized to the antisense P5 and P7 oligonucleotides that are complimentary to the adaptors on the library. The library was diluted so that amplification generated well-separated clusters of identical products from a single DNA molecule (clonal amplification). This was accomplished by isothermal bridge amplification. Fluorophore-labeled nucleotide triphosphates were applied to the flow cell and then excited by a laser. The emission spectra was recorded by the MiSeq, and then the nucleotide blocker, which inhibited further synthesis, was cleaved, allowing for addition of the next nucleotide triphosphate. In this manner, fragments were sequenced.\n\n    The PGM uses emulsion PCR, the amplification inside of tiny water droplets floating in oil. Emulsion PCR is performed to get many copies of a single DNA molecule onto a single sequencing \"bead\" (clonal amplification). These beads are then used to generate the sequence. The beads used in the amplification solution are covered with covalently bound oligonucleotides that are antisense to the P1 sequence of the library. Micro-chambers are created by the Ion Torrent One Touch Instrument 2 (OT2, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), which carries out clonal amplification.\n\n    The strand of DNA that results from extension of the anti-sense P1 oligonucleotide is then hybridized at its 3' end with a sequencing primer that binds at the anti-sense A oligonucleotide. DNA polymerase is added to the beads and then the beads are deposited into tiny pores on the surface of a computer chip-like surface. Each of the four dNTPs is then sequentially flowed in excess over the surface of the chip. The DNA polymerase extends the growing strand when the required nucleotide is made available. Whenever a nucleotide is added, a hydrogen molecule is released resulting in a pH change in the pore containing the sequencing bead. The magnitude of the pH change is approximately equal to the number of nucleotides incorporated and is detected and measured along with which of the four nucleotides that flowed through.\n\n    Following the sequencing reaction, sequence alignment and allele assignment was performed. Initially, for the MiSeq we used the MiSeq Reporter software supplied with the instrument. However, when it became clear that this combination consistently did not identify deletions larger than 9 bp, we developed our own, proprietary bioinformatics pipeline called QSAP. The BRCA1/2 advanced sequencing bioinformatics modular workflow manages the sequence information from Illumina MiSeq FASTQ files to final reporting in the CLIA and CAP certified laboratory. The workflow uses the IDBS Biomolecular Hub (ID Business Solutions Ltd, Guildford, Surrey, UK) as well as customized visualization to manually review the results for nomination to the clinical report. The QSAP is the specialized portion of the overall workflow that integrates open source, in-house developed and licensed modules for sequence analysis. The analysis pipeline, using a high performance computing infrastructure, includes a Piccard tools, the Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA) for mapping and alignment to the hg19 genome, the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) (for de-duplication, Smith-Waterman realignment and variation calls), as well as a QC Metrics report generator (e.g. number of reads, mean coverage, minimum coverage) followed by result parsing and cataloging in purpose-built databases. The pipeline is designed to maximize the accuracy of variant calls, reduce time of analysis and permit ready access to sample Binary alignment/Map format (BAM) and Variant Call Format (VCF) files.\n\n    The de-identified VCF files were transferred to Ingenuity (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) for an automated preliminary assessment, and an annotated XML file was returned. The initial automated assessment leverages variant molecular classification (e.g. synonymous, missense, nonsense, frameshift), comprehensive clinical evidence (largely curated by scientists from peer-reviewed literature) and provides evidence-based clinical decision support that assists the initial classification of the observed variants. The preliminary automated assessment improves the turnaround time and maximizes the information used for the final clinical assessment of variants. The automated assessment has two additional fundamental features. First, the assessment was configured using Quest Diagnostics pre-defined scoring and classification rules with American College of Medical Genetics recommended guidelines being the central advisement combined with a compilation of evidence including the most recent literature. Second, the software provides reviewers with direct access to the relevant literature for variants as well as providing transparency to how the automated assessments were derived to facilitate review of primary data. Subsequent manual review through Ingenuity's VCS web interface, additional locus-specific databases and confirmatory queries were carried out to complete the final classification.\n\n    For the PGM data, bioinformatics analyses were performed using the Torrent Suite software supplied with the instrument.\n\n    Variant assessment is performed manually by a team of variant scientists (VS) according to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics. VCF files are analyzed by the software program Alamut that provides genomic coordinents and SIFT in vitro functional analysis. The VS rechecks the quality metrics of the individual run and, if the run passes QC proceeds to the assessment. At this point the deletion / duplication results from the MLPA reactions are also reviewed. The VS then double checks the called variants to assure concordance with the IGV data. If variant identification is accurate, the variants are loaded from Alamut HT into a proprietary database called QuestIQ. The following fields are automatically filled by the Alamut HT software interface: Gene Variant, Variant ID, Ref Seq, DNA level, Mutation type, Code Interpretation, PUC, Gene Code, Exon, Nucleotide, Change, Codon, Amino Acid, dbSNP rs#, dbSNP link, SIFT, Species conservation, Link to VUS analysis text, link to Splicing Report, MolGen accessions. The VS will then search for further information using the gene specific databases UMD, BIC, LOVD, IARC, ClinVar, ARUP, kConFab, HGMD, InSIGHT. This is followed by assessing the variant frequency using ESP and dbSNP. If applicable, post translation predictive databases with be used such as NetPhosk, NetPhos, ScanSite: S, T,Y phosphorylation predictions, Yin o Yang: O-linked GlcNac. Spicing predictions are made using linked software in Alamut HC, using the RefSeq database. The functional predictive programs SIFT and PolyPhen2 are then used.\n\n    Subsequently, a manual literature search is performed to determine if there is further supporting data on the particular variant using a Google search through Alamut, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and BioMed Central. All relevant results are entered into the IQDB database. The final variant classification is made according to the ACMG guidelines and the result entered into the IQDB database. Classifications are scored as Benign, Likely Benign,VUS, Likely Pathogenic, Pathogenic. This result is then passed to Director for Secondary review and report writing.",
        "Results": "    During assay development, the MiSeq sequencing system using the supplied MiSeq Reporter software was unable to identify 2 of the pathological BRCA1 variants in tested Coriell samples. Both variants were deletions of >9 bp: the 40-bp deletion c.1175_1214del40 and the 10-bp deletion c.3481_3491del10. These were the only deletions of >9 bp in these samples. We therefore developed a proprietary bioinformatics pipeline for alignment and allele assignment (QSAP) as described above. Fig 2 shows the alignment representation for the sample containing a 40-bp deletion. This deleterious mutation was identified by the PGM/Torrent Suite software but not the MiSeq/MiSeq Reporter software. However, the deletion was clearly identified when using MiSeq with QSAP software (Fig 2). Similar findings were seen for the 10-bp deletion, with MiSeq/MiSeq reporter consistently missing the deletion and the PGM/Torrent Suite and MiSeq/QSAP always identifying the deletion (data not shown). The MiSeq/QSAP and the PGM/Torrent Suite combinations both showed 100% sensitivity for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in the validation set. We therefore entered technical validation using both platforms.\n\n    Since NGS sequencing errors can result from PCR or clonal amplification errors, we developed a QC metric to overcome these potential problems, taking advantage of the fact that random shearing leads to library clones that have different starting and ending positions. Therefore the bioinformatics analyses were able to differentiate among reads from the same versus different library clones. This enabled us to develop a minimum QC metric, whereby each targeted base must have high quality sequence from a minimum of 20 unique clones. Typically however, we were able achieve an \"average depth of read\" of 335 unique reads.\n\n    Intra-assay precision was established by analyzing the DNA extracted from 3 blood samples, in 5 replicates on each platform. Each sample had at least one BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant. All variants identified in each sample were 100% concordant within the 5 replicates when detected on the MiSeq/QSAP combination. However, the PGM/Torrent Suite platform exhibited a low level of random sequencing errors. Overall intra-assay concordance on the PGM instrument was only 96.2%. In 1 sample, a single base insertion was detected in the fifth replicate that was not detected in the other replicates. In addition, a benign variant was not identified in the fourth replicate. In another sample, the fifth replicate contained 4 SNPs that were not present in any of the other replicates, and one SNP was called in replicate 3 that was not called elsewhere.\n\n    In comparing the MiSeq/QSAP allele calls to the PGM/Torrent Suite calls, there were several discordances. One sample showed discordance at 2 SNP sites between the 2 platforms: PGM/Torrent Suite called an A insertion at position 32906554 on chromosome 13 in one of the replicates that was not identified in the remainder of the PGM/Torrent Suite replicates or on the MiSeq/QSAP platform. The PGM/Torrent Suite also did not detect rs1799949 at position 41245466 on chromosome 17 in one replicate. As a result, intra-specimen concordance was 88% between the 2 platforms for this specimen. The second sample was concordant on all variant calls from both platforms, resulting in a concordance of 100% between platforms. The third sample was discordant at 5 of 11 SNPs due to sequencing errors on PGM/Torrent Suite (1 of 5 replicates for each SNP), for a concordance rate of only 64%.\n\n    DNA from remnant laboratory samples from 67 presumably unaffected individuals, plus the 27 DNA specimens from Coriell, were analyzed in 3 replication set-ups. Two negative controls (a quality control blank [QCB]) and a no-template control [NTC]) were also included in each run. Libraries prepared for each run were detected on both the MiSeq/QSAP and PGM/Torrent Suite platforms. All variants detected in 3 replication runs from both the PGM and MiSeq instruments were verified by manual review using IGV (version 2.3.14). Specimens failing in 2 or more of the replication runs were excluded from the inter-assay variability assessment.\n\n    Fewer verified variants were detected on the PGM/Torrent Suite platform than on the MiSeq/QSAP platform, owing to higher assay failure rate on the former (Table 2). The inter-assay precision was 96.7% for the PGM/Torrent Suite and 99.4% for the MiSeq/QSAP (Table 2). Of note, discrepant calls detected among the 3 replicates on the MiSeq/QSAP platform represented false-positive results; most came from a single sample on a single replicate, likely indicating a problem with sample preparation or well contamination.\n\n    Specimen failure was defined as failure to achieve an average coverage depth of >40x at any exon. For the MiSeq instrument, there were no failures in replications 1 and 2 and 8 specimen failures in replication 3. Therefore, the overall failure rate was 8.5% (8/94) for replication 3, or 2.8% (8/282) overall. For the PGM, the failure rate was 9.6% (9/94) for replication 1, 13.8% (13/94) for replication 2, and 26.6% (25/94) for replication 3; the overall failure rate was 16.7% (47/282). All the failed specimens with low coverage were among the control specimens from consented subjects, possibly reflecting higher DNA quality in the Coriell DNA samples.\n\n    Four specimens failed in replication 3 on the MiSeq/QSAP platform and in all 3 replication runs on the PGM/Torrent Suite platform. This finding suggests specimen quality issues, although the same specimens were successfully sequenced for all regions in replications 1 and 2 on the MiSeq/QSAP platform. All the specimens that failed on the MiSeq/QSAP platform were from replication 3. The failure rate on the PGM/Torrent Suite platform was also highest for replication 3. This points to a sample preparation issue for that replication, as the sample libraries for both platforms were prepared together up to and through the hybrid capture step.\n\n    As there were more failures in the PGM runs than in the MiSeq runs, we were only able to verify a subset of discrepant variant calls from the MiSeq/QSAP platform with calls from the PGM/Torrent Suite platform. All 8 discrepant variant calls from MiSeq/QSAP were from replication 2. Four of the 8 were similarly observed in replication 2 on the PGM/Torrent Suite platform. In addition, 5 of the 8 variant calls were observed in a single sample.\n\n    The NTC and the QCB bar coded specimens were carried throughout the assay and handled identically to all other specimens. The number of reads mapped to the hg19 genome sequence was compared to the average aligned reads per sample. For the MiSeq/QSAP platform in replication 1, no reads were mapped to the human genome for either the NTC or the QCB. In replication 2, the QC blank had no reads but the NTC had 1,486 reads. This totaled 1.1% of the average number of reads on the plate and was well below the 20% threshold for an allele call. In replication 3, the NTC had 46 reads, representing 0.044% of the average number of reads in plate 1.\n\n    For the PGM/Torrent Suite platform, the NTC and QCB demonstrated 0.255% and 0.029% aligned reads in plate 1. In plate 2, the NTC had 9.2% of the average aligned reads while the QC blank had zero. The values for the 3rd replication plate were 0.268% and 0.063% for the NTC and QCB, respectively. The NTC and QCB demonstrated an acceptably low overall number of aligned reads on both platforms. The aligned reads were either not detectable or well below our cutoff threshold of 20% for variant calls.\n\n    We defined the LOD as the lowest DNA concentration (ng/muL) at which the average read depth over the exonic region was maintained at >=40 reads per base. To determine the LOD, we undertook the following experiments. Two Coriell DNA samples, GM14094 and GM14096, and a single random DNA sample chosen from the 67 control individuals lacking pathogenic BRCA were serially diluted. On the MiSeq/QSAP platform, the control DNAs failed to achieve the required average read/coverage depth at 5 ng/muL demonstrating that the minimal sample input (LOD) for the MiSeq/QSAP platform must be greater than 5 ng/muL (all shearing reactions were carried out in 80 muL volumes). In addition, all variants were consistently called (i.e., 100% concordant) at each concentration for the 3 specimens above this lower limit. On the PGM/Torrent Suite platform, the samples failed at 5 ng/muL, demonstrating that the minimal sample input must also be greater than 5 ng/muL (400 ng of DNA). On both platforms, the 40-bp and 11-bp deletion mutations were successfully detected at all concentrations. However, only 99.96% of the called variants were concordant for the non-Coriell control sample. At 15 ng/muL, an insertion was called in the control DNA using the PGM/Torrent Suite platform that was not present in any of the other concentrations and was likely due to a sequencing error.\n\n    The 27 DNA specimens obtained from Coriell were included in this validation study, in 3 separate runs, on both MiSeq/QSAP and PGM/Torrent Suite platforms. All previously known BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in the specimens were successfully detected by both platforms and in all 3 validation runs (i.e., 100% accuracy for cancer-associated mutations). In addition, we determined the overall accuracy of variant calls for the 352 benign sequence changes detected in the 67 control samples. There was only one missed call on the MiSeq/QSAP platform, which was due to low read depth (coverage). This error could have been avoided by adjusting the minimum depth requirement in our QC metric as this was implemented prior to going live with the assay. The PGM/Torrent Suite platform yielded 2 false-positive calls, one sequencing error, and 37 missed variant calls, most of which were observed in only one of the three validation runs. However, there were 4 variants not called by Ion Reporter, which were detected by manual review of the alignment software. Overall, the error rate was <0.1% (1/1056) for the MiSeq/QSAP platform and 3.7% (39/1056) for the PGM/Torrent Suite platform. With the adjusted QC parameters, the MiSeq/QSAP combination had 100% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity. With manual review of all positive samples, the MiSeq/QSAP combination also achieved 100% specificity.\n\n    For the initial clinical test release, mutation analyses were performed using both the MiSeq/QSAP platform and the PGM/Torrent Suite platform variant calling software. For samples with discrepant results on the 2 platforms, we either manually reviewed the cases to determine the cause of the discrepancy or retested the samples for confirmation. There were 35 discrepancies in the first 521 reported cases, with 34 due to PGM/Torrent Suite errors. The single MiSeq/QSAP platform sequencing error was a false-negative result for a benign polymorphism. Manual review of the alignment revealed that this was due to a combination of strand bias (19% variant) and low coverage. We then adjusted our QC parameters to take advantage of the fact that random shearing allows the filtering of duplicate reads. The QC acceptance metric requires that each base in each assay be analyzed from at least 20 independent reads. This typically resulted in an average depth ranging from several hundred to a few thousand. Using adjusted QC parameters, the MiSeq/QSAP combination had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. For all positive cases, the alignments are manually reviewed as a further quality measure.\n\n    After making these adjustments to the QC metrics, the MiSeq/QSAP platform has made no further errors in more than 500 consecutive analyses. However, the PGM/Torrent Suite combination suffered 2 false-negative results for pathogenic BRCA1 variants: a 10-base pair insertion and a 64bp deletion. Both of these pathogenic variants were detected with the MiSeq/QSAP platform. Fig 3 shows the QSAP alignment for this 64-bp deletion. Following this observation we discontinued the use of the PGM/Torrent Suite platform. To be certain that our new quality metric would ensure the identification of all variants, we began performing all MiSeq/QSAP analyses in duplicate. Duplication would ensure that any false-positives or false-negatives due to strand bias, low coverage, or library creation would be detected. In 1006 consecutive duplicate MiSeq/QSAP runs with more than 5000 variants detected, there were no discrepant results between duplicate analyses (data not shown). Therefore, we have now eliminated the duplicate run requirement.\n\n    An advantage of NGS platforms over standard Sanger sequencing is their ability to determine if 2 SNPs are cis or trans in orientation. If two variants are captured in a single read (in this case less than 250 bases), they are revealed as being in cis. If they are captured on separate reads, then they are revealed to be in trans. Fig 4 shows an individual who has two point mutations in cis. We have already seen 2 such linked variants in the first 521 clinical samples. In addition, in routine operations, the MiSeq/QSAP platform was considerably more robust than the PGM/Torrent Suite platform. We therefore decided to discontinue the PGM/Torrent Suite platform test and are now performing duplicate MiSeq/QSAP runs for each case to determine if there are any potential problems with false-positives or false-negatives due to library formation.\n\n    There was a single discrepancy between the duplicate MiSeq runs in noted in the initial 100 duplicate samples. This was a benign polymorphism that was detected in one run, but not dectected in the second run. Examination of the sequencing data revealed that there was significant strand bias in the second sequencing run leading to 19% a variant frequency for the variant. Our QC cut-off at the time was 20%. In order to prevent reoccurrence of this error we completely revamped our QC metric for variant calling. The random fragmentation of the DNA causes each individual DNA fragment to have a unique starting and ending nucleotide. This allows the bioinformatics to uniquely identify the clones sequenced. We adjusted our QC metric to require that each base in every coding exon and 50 base pairs into the exon be sequenced from at least 20 different clones. This eliminates errors due to sequencing bias, since reads from an overrepresented clone with be ignored, and by requiring a minimum number of clones to be sequenced, heterozygotes have close to a 50% representation. After making this adjustment, no discrepancies were found in more than 1006 consecutive analyses.\n\n    For the intial 521 clinical samples, confirmation of positive MiSeq / QSAP results was performed by the PGM / Torrent suite platform. Subsequently confirmation of results were performed by comparing duplicate MiSaq / QSAP analysis for the next 1006. We subsequently eliminated the requirement for duplicate MiSeq/ QSAP runs.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Our data demonstrate that neither the Illumina MiSeq sequencer with the supplied MiSeq Reporter software nor the Life Technologies PGM with the supplied Torrent Suite software are suitable for clinical laboratory sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2. The MiSeq system's inability to detect insertions and deletions larger than 9 bp makes it unacceptable for BRCA testing, as many of the described deleterious mutations are in that size range. Similarly, the inability of the PGM with Torrent Suite software to detect a 10-base pair insertion and 64-bp deletion disqualifies that platform from clinical BRCA testing. However, by combining random shearing with bait tile capture, the MiSeq platform with the bioinformatics of the QSAP alignment and allele calling software, and our quality metrics, we were able to design an assay with 100% sensitivity and specificity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequence variations in our technical validation series. Real-world performance may not reach this level of precision.\n\n    The use of NGS with bait tile exon capture offers several advantages. First, bait tile exon capture prior to NGS decreases the likelihood of false-negative results due to allele drop-out, which may occur with PCR-based methods when polymorphisms are present in amplification or sequencing primer sequences. Second, with 5x redundant tiling, each exon is captured by multiple baits, further reducing the chance of a false-negative result due to individual sequence variation. A third advantage of bait tile capture versus PCR-based target enrichment methods is the avoidance of false-positive results due to amplicon bias in PCR or library formation. If a base substitution error occurs in an early PCR or library amplification cycle, the error will be propagated and result in a mixed population prior to sequencing. If an error occurs in a single amplicon, and the amplicon is preferentially sequenced, this can result in a false-positive result. With the bait tile capture approach, genomic DNA is randomly sheared to fragments of approximately 250 bp prior to bait tile capture. Library formation occurs after capture. Thus, each fragment has different 5 and 3 prime termini, and the sequence alignment software can detect if 2 reads are generated from the same fragment. Filters can be set to only accept reads from unique fragments, thereby eliminating the possibility of sequencing errors due to early PCR or library amplification errors. The selected quality control metrics require reads from at least 20 different clones, minimizing the risk of false-positive sequencing results in NGS.\n\n    Relative to Sanger sequencing, NGS also has the advantage of detecting the phase of SNPs within approximately 250 bp (i.e., the length of sheared genomic DNA fragments). Since this technology sequences a single molecule, 2 SNPs that are in cis orientation will appear together in the same read; if the orientation is trans, the 2 SNPs will appear in separate reads. Sanger sequencing cannot differentiate between cis and trans orientation without resorting to family studies.\n\n    In conclusion, we describe the development and validation of a rapid, high-throughput sequencing assay for the detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants suitable for the clinical laboratory. Results from the initial 1006 clinical samples tested in duplicate with the MiSeq/QSAP combination showed no discrepant variant calls.\n\n    All sequencing data have been uploaded to the NCBI BioSample Database (www.biospecimens.samples.gov, permanent accession number is SAMN03946419).",

        "Title": "    Heterogeneity of germline variants in high risk breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in India",
        "Abstract": "    Breast and ovarian cancers now account for one in three cancers in Indian women and their incidence is rising. Major differences in the clinical presentation of breast and ovarian cancers exist between India and the United Kingdom. For example, Indian patients with breast cancer typically present a decade earlier than in the UK. Reasons for this could be multifactorial, including differences in underlying biology, environmental risks, and other systematic factors including access to screening. One possible explanation lies in variable incidence or penetrance of germline mutations in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. We performed a methodical database and literature review to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of high-risk cancer susceptibility genes in Indian patients with breast and ovarian cancers. We identified 148 articles, but most studies were small, with inconsistent inclusion criteria and based on heterogeneous technologies, so that mutation frequency could not be reliably ascertained. Data were also often lacking on penetrance, histopathology, and survival outcomes. After filtering out unsuitable studies, only 13 remained, comprising 1028 patients. Large-scale research studies are urgently needed to determine mutation prevalence, spectra, and clinico-pathological features, and hence derive guidelines for screening, treatment, and prevention specific to the Indian population.",
        "Introduction": "    The global cancer burden is expected to increase from 14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012, to 21.7 million cases and 13 million deaths by 2030. However, these large numbers are contrasted by the very diverse nature of cancer that makes every patient unique. Precision medicine has enormous potential to transform cancer care by identifying genomic and epigenetic markers for screening, treatment, and prognosis. These gains are particularly relevant for countries such as India, grappling with both a rising cancer burden and competing demands for essential health care. India's cancer burden, currently estimated at over 1.5 million new cases is predicted to nearly double in the next 20 years, with age-adjusted mortality rates of 64.5 per 100 000 (GLOBOCAN 2012). Cumulatively, breast, cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancers account for more than 70% of cancers in women in India, thus establishing tackling women's cancers as high priority for healthcare providers and research.\n\n    Significant phenotypic differences exist in breast and ovarian cancers between patients in India and in the UK. The incidence of breast and ovarian cancer is relatively low in India in comparison with the UK: breast cancer 23.8 versus 92.9 cases per 100 000 women in the UK, ovarian cancer 4.9 versus 11.7/100 000 women in the UK (GLOBOCAN 2012). However, a high proportion (~11-26%) of Indian patients with breast cancer present at ages younger than 35 years. Conversely, approximately half of newly diagnosed breast and ovarian cancer cases occur in women aged 65 years and older in the UK, compared with only 15% in India (Fig. 1). The incidence of the more aggressive histological type of breast cancer, triple-negative disease, is also estimated to be higher at 31% in India, nearly double that of the UK. Breast cancer incidence also fluctuates substantially across India, with age-standardised incidence rates varying between 41/100 000 rate in urban centres such as New Delhi and 12.4/100 000 in rural cancer registries, thus adding a further layer of complexity.\n\n    These phenotypic differences could be a result of differences in tumour biology such as differences in the incidence of high-risk germline susceptibility genes, environmental modifiers, or systematic factors such as access to screening and treatment. Germline mutations in high-risk susceptibility genes (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2) account for 5-10% of breast cancers and up to 20% of ovarian cancers in white Europeans. Women with a germline BRCA1 mutation have a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer by age 70 years of up to 63% and of breast cancer by age 70 years of up to 85%. Risks of ovarian and breast cancers in women by age 70 years among BRCA2 carriers are reported to be up to 27% and 84%, respectively. Other genes in which germline mutations confer susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer, albeit with lower frequency and penetrance include PALB2, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, STK11, CHEK2, RAD51, and ATM.\n\n    We systematically reviewed the literature and relevant data repositories to characterise the prevalence and spectrum of germline variants in breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in the Indian population, including putative BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations. We excluded SNPs with high frequency in the population. We investigated the literature for details of clinical, family history, pathology, and survival data in these patients.",
        "Methods": "    A comprehensive literature search was performed to include articles published between 1 January 1990 and 1 December 2016 using the following search terms on ethnicity, condition, and high penetrance genes (Table 1): 'India and (breast cancer or ovarian cancer) and (BRCA1 or BRCA2 or PALB2 or TP53 or PTEN or CDH1 or STK11 or CHEK2 or RAD51C or RAD51D or ATM or BARD1 or NBN or MLH1 or MSH2 or MSH6 or PMS2 or EPCAM)' in EMBASE and PubMed/Medline to identify relevant published and unpublished studies as well as studies in progress. Further searches were carried out in the BIC database using the keyword 'Indian' in the ethnicity fields and also in the ClinVar database. Additional database searches included the 1000genomes, TCGA, COSMIC, dbSNP, ICGC, HGMD, ExAC, and the GWAS catalog.\n\n    This initial search was supplemented by checking reference lists, and contact with authors of included studies for information on any relevant published or unpublished studies. No language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and keywords to select potentially relevant studies from the retrieved list of articles.\n\n    All studies included in the analysis met the following inclusion criteria: (i) data reported on any genes included in Table 1; (ii) at least 10 patients of Indian origin; and (iii) contained DNA sequence variation data. The susceptibility genes selected are those commonly tested in clinical practice. Lynch syndrome genes were included as they confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer in addition to colon and uterine cancers (Table 1). Importantly, inclusion was not restricted by NCCN or Manchester definitions of familial risk to ensure broad inclusion of studies with available data.\n\n    The exclusion criteria were: (i) articles containing data limited to loss of heterozygosity and/or methylation studies; (ii) duplicate publications; (iii) studies that did not perform direct DNA sequencing to validate variants detected by PCR-based techniques using re-amplified genomic DNA; and (iv) studies that did not screen the entire susceptibility gene. If studies had overlapping data, only the latest or largest study was included (Fig. 2).\n\n    The first step of a two-stage selection process involved screening titles and abstracts. Subsequently, for all references categorised as 'include' or 'uncertain' by both reviewers, full text was retrieved wherever possible and final inclusion decisions were made on the full paper. Data extraction was carried out using pre-designed and piloted data extraction forms with differences resolved by consensus and/or arbitration involving a third reviewer.\n\n    Three reviewers extracted detailed information relating to variants; clinical evidence, including family history when available; clinical diagnosis; and histopathology. The information collected included the following: year of publication; authors' names; journal; geographic location of study; cancer type; genotyping methods; details of germline variant, total numbers of cases and controls; frequencies of variant carriers in cases and controls; histopathology; overall and progression-free survival where available; and age of presentation.\n\n    All variants extracted from the publications were queried against the BIC database for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and ClinVar to confirm whether they had been reported previously by other studies and to obtain their pathogenic classification. The SNP identifier for each of the variants, where available, was obtained from the dbSNP database.",
        "Results": "    The combined search for key terms led to the selection of 148 articles. After screening titles, abstract, and keywords, we extracted 120 full texts of articles considered eligible for inclusion. After reviewing the full texts and citations, we identified 67 studies meeting the inclusion criteria of which 31 contained data suitable for extraction. Of the 31 articles, only 13 articles contained usable data that satisfied both the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig. 2, Table 2). These publications included familial breast and/or ovarian cancer as well as sporadic cases. For the purposes of this review, we used a broad definition of FEOTN (familial/early-onset/triple-negative) based on the studies included in the review, specifically one or more of the following: at least one first-degree relative with breast and/or ovarian cancer irrespective of age; early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer diagnosed with a family history; relatives affected first or second degree; triple-negative breast cancer in an early onset case; or bilateral breast cancer diagnosed < 50 years. Data were included from probands and from family members who were carriers, where given. We also included data from sporadic cancer patients where the paper contained this information. However, none of the publications on sporadic cases reviewed reported any pathogenic germline variants and therefore we focused our analysis on FEOTN cases (Fig. 2).\n\n    We identified a total of 1028 breast and/or ovarian cancer cases from the 13 studies. A breakdown of the number of studies from different categories of breast and/or ovarian cancer is presented in Table 3. The majority of the studies were conducted in or near the largest cities of India with the exception of two that were carried out within the Indian populations of Malaysia and Singapore. The patients recruited in any study usually resided in or near the big cities, which are densely populated and are more affluent than the rural populations of India (Fig. 3).\n\n    Many different platforms were used for genetic testing in the 13 studies, with the majority using PCR-based approaches including hetero-duplex formation, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC), and Sanger sequencing.\n\n    Only two studies with a cohort size of 141 and 91 used next generation sequencing (NGS) with Illumina HiScanSQ system, and these also reported the highest proportions of variants in the cohort.\n\n    All 13 FEOTN publications reported data on BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 and only three studies tested for other susceptibility genes such as TP53, RAD50, RAD52, ATM, and CHEK2, with mutations in these found very rarely if at all. We therefore limited our analysis to BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Twelve studies reported previously identified pathogenic BRCA1 variants and 10 reported novel variants they considered likely to be pathogenic. The novel variants were not present in any of the online databases listed in the Methods section. Initially, we considered variants causing protein truncation only to be likely pathogenic. We then predicted the functional effects of non synonymous missense variants using SIFT, PolyPhen and CADD and identified 2 additional variants, 5360A>C and 5377G>A, considered deleterious/probably damaging by all three algorithms (Supplementary Table 1). In total, we identified 26 previously reported pathogenic variants and 18 novel likely pathogenic variants for BRCA1 from a total cohort of 926 (Tables 4 and 5). In combination, the previously reported and the novel variants were detected in 71/926 cases, 39 of whom carried the 'Ashkenazi' 185delAG mutation.\n\n    For BRCA1, there were seven additional recurrent mutations, five in BIC and/or ClinVar and two that were novel (Tables 4 and 5). Of the five previously reported variants, c.2275C>T, c.2338C>T, c.3352C>T, and 4838delAGinsGCC each occurred in two cases and the other, c.4485-1G>A, occurred in three cases. The two novel variants were c.1052delT and c.632insT, the former detected in four cases and the latter in two cases, all from single studies (Table 5).\n\n    For BRCA2, there were four variants previously reported as pathogenic in ClinVar detected in the FEOTN cases; these were detected in 6/974 cases. The only recurrent variant, 6079del4, was detected in 3/974 cases from two different studies (Table 6). The number of variants reported to be novel and likely pathogenic was 16, and each of these variants was detected in single cases in single studies (Table 7). Furthermore, there were 9 non synonymous missense variants of which only one,c.3578T>C, was considered deleterious/probably damaging by SIFT, POlyphen and CADD (Supplementary Table 2).\n\n    Ten of the 13 studies reported data on the putative founder mutation BRCA1 185delAG (Fig. S1, see online supplementary material). The mutation was detected in 39/927 (4.2%) cases with breast or ovarian cancer, the majority being from South India or Malaysians of Indian descent. The frequency of 185delAG varied, for example one study from New Delhi found only one carrier in 204 cases, but a high prevalence was reported in Bangalore (10/61 cases, 0/100 controls, Fisher exact test P = 3.7x10-5) and Chennai (10/91 cases, 0/2 controls) (Table 2).\n\n    The reported BRCA2 founder mutation 6174delT was not detected in any of the studies included in our analysis. Frequencies of BRCA mutations identified in the included studies in the Indian population are contrasted with those of white European populations (Tables 4 and 6).\n\n    The BIC and the ClinVar databases contain DNA sequence variations reported by genetics clinics from across the world. The majority of the DNA variants in these repositories are unpublished. The most frequent reported entry in BIC for the BRCA1 gene was 185delAG, which was also the most prevalent in our analysis (Table 8). Eight out of the 20 top entries in BIC were also detected in our literature survey, although not all of these variants were shown to be pathogenic (Table 8). None of the pathogenic BRCA2 variants identified from our literature search were present in the top 20 BIC entries for BRCA2 (Table 9).\n\n    A search in BIC using the keyword 'Indian' in the ethnicity field revealed 23 BRCA1 variants and 11 BRCA2 variants. All these variants were detected in patients of Indian descent from Singapore or Malaysia. Seven of the BRCA1 variants were present in our dataset collated from the literature (Tables 10 and 11). However, of the seven variants that overlapped, only two (180delA and 185delAG) were classed as pathogenic in BIC and ClinVar (Tables 10 and 11). Of the 11 BRCA2 variants present in BIC with Indian ethnicity, three were also present in our literature dataset and of the three only one was classed as pathogenic, Q2957X. Another interesting observation was that the BRCA2 variant E1593D present in both our dataset and in the subset of 11 BIC variants, was also reported in two additional Pakistani patients in BIC.\n\n    The same search performed in ClinVar with 'Indian' detected 40 variants for BRCA1 and 30 for BRCA2, which included all variants also present in BIC.\n\n    Individual searches in additional databases such as TCGA, ICGC, dbSNP, GWAS catalogue, COSMIC, and HGMD did not yield any results. Although these databases contain ethnicity data, they use a very broad definition of 'Asians', yet the ethnicity data in the 1000genome database are region-specific and therefore this makes comparisons difficult. Furthermore, there were no data in ICGC on breast and ovarian cancers from India.\n\n    Studies in the literature used very heterogeneous criteria to define a family history of disease. Mutation prevalence in women with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer was presented in 11 of the 13 studies, but only seven of these provided clear criteria for family history (>=1 first degree relative affected with breast or ovarian cancer at any age). Women with sporadic breast or ovarian cancer were reported in seven publications. None of the 13 studies provided penetrance data. One small study with 91 patients presented survival information and found no significant association with pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\n\n    Two studies provided some data on breast cancer histopathology, with none describing complete histological details such as grade of cancer, hormone receptor, and HER2 status. Eachkoti et al. reported the majority of cases (22/25) to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) with two inflammatory carcinomas (an aggressive type of breast cancer) and one Paget's disease. Similarly Thirthagiri et al. identified IDC as the commonest histological type for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Where grade was available, tumours were of grade 2 and 3, with no grade 1 tumours identified. BRCA1 tumours were largely triple negative and less commonly HER2 positive, whereas BRCA2 tumours were more likely to be hormone receptor positive. The data, however, were not available for the three markers in eight cases and for at least one of the three markers in an additional seven cases out of the total 28 tumours included. No studies were identified including information on the histology of ovarian tumours.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We have reported the findings of a methodical review of reported germline variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other high-penetrance breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes within women of Indian descent. Our searches highlight both the diversity of the Indian population as well as the paucity of data on germline variants in these genes in the Indian population. There are very limited Indian-specific data and, even where these are available, there is great variability in inclusion criteria, definition of high-risk groups (such as those with a family history), mutation detection methods, geographical origin, and ethnicity, thus making any India-wide assessment unreliable. The small cohort size mean that the spectrum of mutations identified in BRCA genes is unlikely to be representative of the Indian population and is indeterminate for other high-risk susceptibility genes in this population. Our searches have identified 18 BRCA1 and 16 BRCA2 variants in the Indian population that had not been previously reported elsewhere, nor currently present in BIC or ClinVar. There were no studies of sporadic or unselected cases and also very limited data on penetrance or survival that could be used for calculating cancer risks and hence implementing counselling and screening in Indian populations.\n\n    The spectra of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been characterized in a number of different populations worldwide, with significant variation among populations in the contributions of these genes to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Founder mutations account for differing proportions of cancer in different populations; for example in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [12], three founder mutations have a combined population frequency of 2% and represent 60% of breast cancer families with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. Similarly, BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations account for 78% of families with hereditary breast cancer in Chile.\n\n    Our search reveals a much lower frequency (2.3%; 39/1700) of the putative Ashkenazi founder mutation 185delAG in Indian patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer. The carriers of this mutation were usually from the south of India. Other studies have explored how this variant arose in the Indian population. Kadalmani et al. examined the haplotypes of carriers of this variant and their families, and concluded that it arose independently from the Ashkenazi variant. Another study by Laitman et al. came to a similar conclusion based on haplotype analyses of carriers from ethnically diverse backgrounds, which included Indians from Cochin, south India. Other founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were not detected in any of the Indian patients with breast and ovarian cancers, and no India-specific founder mutations were detected.\n\n    Our literature search shows that variation in the prevalence of high-penetrance alleles in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 may contribute to the reported differences in breast and ovarian cancer incidence across India, in Indians in other countries, and between India and the west. The earlier average age of breast cancer among Indian women is especially intriguing in this respect. Data are, however, very limited and have not been collected systematically in terms of inclusion criteria, details such as family history, and critical clinical co-variates such as histopathology. Furthermore, very limited work has been published to address environmental risk factors specific to the Indian population and distinct from Western populations, such as consanguineous marriage, betel quid consumption, and pregnancies. Current guidelines on cancer screening and prevention in gene carriers are based on evidence predominantly derived from white populations of northern European origins. Work is needed to modify existing risk-prediction models such as Manchester or BOADICEA for use in women of different ethnicities. Indeed, previous work has found that overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive-predictive values were lower in the Asian population than in Caucasian populations. In conclusion, there is an urgent unmet need for large-scale studies in geographically distinct regions, with high-quality data and longitudinal studies of relatives to help elucidate the role of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in the Indian population. Understanding these differences through research to derive India-specific paradigms for diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment is critical and essential to improving women's health in India. Clinics in countries with the Indian diaspora and established clinical genetics services may be able to contribute to penetrance and survival data and further tease out the differences in environmental risk factors between Indian diaspora and Indian patients.",

        "Title": "    Comparison of Ion Personal Genome Machine Platforms for the Detection of Variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2",
        "Abstract": "    Transition to next generation sequencing (NGS) for BRCA1/BRCA2 analysis in clinical laboratories is ongoing but different platforms and/or data analysis pipelines give different results resulting in difficulties in implementation. We have evaluated the Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) Platforms (Ion PGM, Ion PGM Dx, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the analysis of BRCA1/2.\n\n    The results of Ion PGM with OTG-snpcaller, a pipeline based on Torrent mapping alignment program and Genome Analysis Toolkit, from 75 clinical samples and 14 reference DNA samples were compared with Sanger sequencing for BRCA1/BRCA2. Ten clinical samples and 14 reference DNA samples were additionally sequenced by Ion PGM Dx with Torrent Suite.\n\n    Fifty types of variants including 18 pathogenic or variants of unknown significance were identified from 75 clinical samples and known variants of the reference samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and/or NGS. One false-negative results were present for Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller for an indel variant misidentified as a single nucleotide variant. However, eight discordant results were present for Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite with both false-positive and -negative results. A 40-bp deletion, a 4-bp deletion and a 1-bp deletion variant was not called and a false-positive deletion was identified. Four other variants were misidentified as another variant.\n\n    Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller showed acceptable performance with good concordance with Sanger sequencing. However, Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite showed many discrepant results not suitable for use in a clinical laboratory, requiring further optimization of the data analysis for calling variants.",
        "Introduction": "    About 10% of the breast cancers are known to be hereditary and the most commonly associated gene with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes (HBOC) are BRCA1 and BRCA2. The detection of genetic variants in HBOC patients and the carriers have enormous impact on the management and decision for further therapeutic options. Thus, performing BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis is recommended in patients suspected of HBOC. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, genetic risk assessment and genetic testing is required in patients with pedigrees suggestive of or known genetic predisposition. Sanger sequencing has been the gold standard for BRCA1/BRCA2 variant analysis for HBOC. However, due to the relatively large size of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and the lack of mutational hotspots, performing Sanger sequencing in multiple samples is often time consuming and expensive; thus, the implementation of next generation sequencing (NGS) for BRCA1/BRCA2 analysis is being considered in diagnostic settings. Many studies have evaluated the use of NGS for the detection of BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants in HBOC and some recent studies have evaluated the analysis of BRCA1 or BRCA2 with NGS in the clinical laboratory setting. In this study, we have assessed the results of NGS assays for BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants performed by an amplicon based method with Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Ion PGM Dx (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in consideration of implementing the platforms in a diagnostic laboratory. Since different platforms and data analysis pipelines give different results, platforms available for diagnostic use were considered. Ion PGM Dx is a class II medical device approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration used in conjunction with the instrument-specific reagents and data analysis software, Torrent Suite. Ion Torrent systems measures the pH to detect polymerization events and is known to be prone to homopolymer errors, thus OTG-snpcaller, an optimized pipeline based on Torrent Mapping Alignment Program (TMAP) and Genome Analysis Tool kit (GATK) for single nucleotide polymorphism calling from Ion Torrent data were used as the analysis pipeline with the Ion PGM data. The results of BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis with Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller and Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite were compared to those from Sanger sequencing. Since there are no studies with the Ion PGM Dx platform, we have evaluated the results of Ion PGM and Ion PGM Dx for BRCA1/BRCA2 analysis with clinical and reference samples.",
        "Methods": "    Clinical samples were collected from 75 breast cancer patients suspected of hereditary breast cancer for detection of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic variants as a routine clinical practice. Seventy-five consecutive samples were included in this study. In addition, 14 reference DNA samples from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Cell Repository (https://catalog.coriell.org/) with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS) were included in this study. The sample numbers used are NA13705, NA13715, NA14090, NA14094, NA14634, NA14636, NA14637, NA14638, NA14684, NA141-70, NA14622, NA14623, NA14624, and NA14639. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the institution (IRB-B-1508-310-302).\n\n    The genomic DNA was extracted by QIAamp Blood DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for the clinical samples and the reference DNA samples were obtained. For 75 clinical samples and 14 reference samples, the comparison of results of Sanger sequencing and NGS with Ion PGM was made and among the clinical and reference samples, 24 samples (10 clinical samples and 14 reference samples), were performed additionally with Ion PGM Dx for comparison.\n\n    The target regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were amplified by the Ion Ampliseq BRCA1 and BRCA2 Panel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The panel includes three primer pools (167 amplicons) which cover the entire coding region and 10 to 20 bp of the intronic flanking sequences of coding exons. For amplification, 4 muL of 5x Ion Ampliseq HiFi Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 muL of 2x Ion Ampliseq primer pool, 20 ng of genomic DNA per reaction, and 4 muL of nuclease-free water were mixed. The temperature profile applied with the final 20 muL of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture were 99oC for 2 minutes, 99oC for 15 seconds, and 60oC for 4 minutes 19 cycles, with a final hold at 10oC. The primer sequences were partially digested and adapters and barcodes were ligated to the amplicons according to the Ion AmpliSeq Library 2.0 Kit manual. A unique adapter was applied for each library with the Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters 1 to 16 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantification of amplified library was performed with the Qubit ver. 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, diluted to approximately 100 pmol/L. Ion OneTouch 2 System and the Ion OneTouch ES Instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used according to the user guide with the 200-bp chemistry kits. All barcoded samples were sequenced on the Ion PGM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 316 chips using 12 samples on a single chip per sequencing run.\n\n    For Ion PGM Dx, Ion PGM Dx Library Kit, Ion OneTouch Dx Template Kit, and the Ion PGM Dx Sequencing Kit was used. All barcoded samples were sequenced on the Ion PGM Dx with the Ion 318 Dx Chip using 12 samples on a single chip per sequencing run. Sequencing data were analyzed with the Ion Torrent Suite software TS 4.0.0 and contextually with Ion Reporter.\n\n    For Ion PGM, we have adopted an optimized pipeline based on TMAP and GATK, the OTG-snpcaller for single nucleotide variant based on a previous study. Briefly, the raw data from Torrent Suite 4.6 was mapped with TMAP 3.6 (https://github.com/iontorrent/TAMP) and the duplicates were removed with Remove Duplicates according to the Alignment Score Tag. To reduce the false negative results of single nucleotide variant in a gap site, Alignment Optimize Structure filtering method was incorporated. Then the variant calling was performed with GATK tool. Local mutational hotspot files were included for annotation of the variants identified.\n\n    For Ion PGM Dx, the sequence data were processed using Ion Torrent Suite software 4.0 processed on the Torrent Server (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n    Sequence alignments for variants with discordant results were manually inspected with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) 2.3.\n\n    All clinical samples were sequenced for the entire coding regions by Sanger sequencing. B-Pure EasySeq PCR plates for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Nimagen, Nijmegen, Netherlands) were used for amplification and the PCR products were purified and sequenced with BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA) and products were run on 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The data was analyzed by Mutation Surveyor 4.0 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA) with the reference sequence NM_007294.2 for BRCA1 and NM_000059.3 for BRCA2. The variants were described as recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature (http://varnomen.hgvs.org).\n\n    The characterization of the variants was made primarily by Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) from National Human Genome Institute (https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/), Short Genetic Variations database (dbSNP, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/index.html), and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) professional 2016.2 (Qiagen, Boston, MA) as of date September 10, 2016. BIC classifies variants into five classes: class 1 for not pathogenic/low clinical significance, class 2 for likely not pathogenic/little clinical significance, class 3 for uncertain variants, class 4 for likely pathogenic variants, and class 5 for pathogenic variants. HGMD classifies variants into disease causing mutation, likely disease causing mutation, disease associated polymorphism, disease associated polymorphism with additional supporting functional evidence, frameshift or truncating variant with no disease association reported yet, polymorphism affecting the structure, function or expression of a gene but with no disease association reported yet.\n\n    To analyze for large gene rearrangement or deletion/duplication, multiple ligation probe amplification (MLPA) was performed for all clinical samples. MLPA kits (P002 for BRCA1 and P045 for BRCA2) (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands) were used with Veriti 96-well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) and the data was analyzed with GeneMarker 2.0 (SoftGenetics).",
        "Results": "    For BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis, on average, 233,185 reads per patients were obtained with a mean amplicon length of 139 base pair (bp) with Ion PGM in 89 samples. The mean sequencing depth was 1,377x (775x to 2,237x) and 96.40% of the reads were on the targeted region of BRCA1 and BRCA2. The uniformity of coverage was 97.22%. Twenty-four samples were performed concurrently with Ion PGM Dx and the mean read length was 149 bp, the mean mapped reads were 280,200 bp and on target rate was 97.80% with a mean depth of 1,796x (1,062x to 4,332x) and the mean uniformity of 96.23%.\n\n    Pathogenic variants and VUS identified in 75 clinical samples and reference DNA samples are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. MLPA results showed no deletions or duplications for BRCA1 and BRCA2 in clinical samples. In clinical samples, six pathogenic or VUS were found in BRCA1 including two nonsense variants, one frameshift variant, and three missense variants. Twelve pathogenic or VUS were identified in BRCA2 including seven frameshift and five missense variants. All pathogenic or VUS identified in the clinical samples were previously reported variants. A list of all variants (n=50) identified in clinical samples are shown in the S1 Table. In total, 19 variants were identified in BRCA1 including 18 exonic and one intronic variants. Six synonymous, nine missense variants, two nonsense variants, and one frameshift variants were identified in the exons. In BRCA2, 31 variants were identified with 30 exonic variants and one intronic variant. There were seven frameshift variants, 13 missense and 10 synonymous variants. In total, 14 pathogenic/VUS variants were found in the reference DNA samples in this study, which included nine variants in BRCA1 (one nonsense, one splice site, and seven frameshift variants) and five variants in BRCA2 including one missense and four frameshift variants.\n\n    The variants identified by the NGS and Sanger sequencing were compared. The different parameters for variant calling in Ion Torrent variant caller for Ion PGM Dx are shown in S2 Table. In Ion PGM, the \"Generic-PGM-Germline Low stringency\" parameter was used for variant calling while the default option was used for Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite.\n\n    The discordant sequencing results including those from clinical and reference DNA samples are shown in Table 3. Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller and Sanger sequencing showed only one discrepant result in BRCA1 for c.922_924delinsT in which Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller identified the indel as a single nucleotide variant, c.922A>T (Fig. 1). All the other pathogenic variants or VUS identified were in concordance with Sanger sequencing. However, eight discrepant results were present between Sanger sequencing and Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite. One false-positive variant in BRCA1, c.117_118delTG was identified by Ion PGM Dx but not present by visual inspection with the IGV. Three false-negative results were present with Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite in which pathogenic variants of BRCA1, c.1175_1214del40, c.4065_4068delTCAA and a pathogenic variant of BRCA2, c.994delA were not called by the Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite (Fig. 2). Four other discordant results were present misidentifying a variant as another variant with Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite and of these discordant results, two variants were recurrently present in seven samples among 24 samples tested with Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite. Single nucleotide variants of BRCA1, c.3113A>G and c.3548A>G, were called as c.3107_3112delTTAAAG and c.3548_3549delAA. The other misidentified variant was c.922_924delinsT which was called as c.922A>T as in Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller and a 4-bp deletion in BRCA2, c.3741_3744delTGAG, which was c.3744_3747delAGTG by Sanger sequencing.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The implementation of NGS to a clinical laboratory requires validation and thorough evaluation. Many studies have shown comparison results of BRCA1 and BRCA2 with NGS to Sanger sequencing, which has been considered the golden standard for variant analysis. However, different NGS platforms and data analysis pipeline showed variable performance, which lead us to the evaluation of Ion PGM and Ion PGM Dx, which were candidates of NGS platforms to our laboratory. Our data showed that Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller showed comparable results to Sanger sequencing with one false negative results for an insertion/deletion variant. However, Ion PGM Dx with the supplied Torrent Suite software alone was not suitable for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis in a diagnostic setting, due to false negative and positive errors.\n\n    In total, 50 variants including 12 pathogenic variants/VUS and 38 benign variants were found in 75 clinical samples and the known pathogenic or VUS of the 14 reference Coriell DNA samples were confirmed with Sanger sequencing and NGS. Most of the variants were identified with Sanger sequencing and Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller except for one discordant result for a pathogenic variant. An indel variant in BRCA1, c.922_924delinsT was identified as a single nucleotide variant (c.922A>T) with Ion PGM/OTG-snpcaller and this variant was also not correctly called by Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite.\n\n    Several other discrepancies were present with Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite, showing recurrent false positive and negative variant assignments. Three recurrent false positive variants in BRCA1, c.3107_3112delTTAAAG and c.3548_3549delAA, which corresponded to c.3113A>G and c.3548A>G by Sanger sequencing were present in the variant call format (VCF), however there were no insertions or deletions manually confirmed by IGV. We have speculated that these false positive assignments occur when multiple possible variants are listed for a chromosome position which includes a hotspot variant inserted prior to analysis. Therefore, to minimize the discrepancies by Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite, we have deleted the two recurrent hotspot variants from the local database and those recurrently misidentified as a pathogenic variant were not reported in the VCF files. However, the manual deletions of these hotspot variants would be not advisable in populations where these variants are reported. Moreover, since incorrect hotspot IDs were matched to the variants, we have developed a simple program with python 2.7, \"Filter Dx\" which selects homozygous or heterozygous variants and eliminates the assigned hotspot variants when there are multiple alternative alleles, where errors were found to be prone. This program condenses the long list of variants with possible germline variants (provided at request).\n\n    False-negative results were present by Ion PGM Dx missing a 40-bp deletion in BRCA1 (c.1175_1214del40), a 4-bp deletion in BRCA1(c.4065_4068delTCAA) in reference DNA samples and a 1-bp deletion in BRCA2 (c.994delA) (Fig. 2). The 40-bp deletion have been reported as being difficult in NGS for detection and not detected in certain platforms requiring modification of data analysis pipelines. Not many parameters were adjustable in the Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite platform in processing the data acquired from the Ion PGM Dx, thus requiring further modification of the variant calling pipelines in Torrent Suite as suggested in previous studies for its use in the clinical laboratory setting.\n\n    As in a previous study, we have also found that Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite reported a variant with AGTG deletion from chr13:32912234 (c.3742_3745del), whereas a deletion of TGAG from chr13:32912236, c.3744_3747delTGAG was detected in Sanger sequencing and the discrepancy in codon numbers occurs since the HGVS nomenclature requires that the most 3' position possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed. Thus, confirming the variants with IGV and checking the HGVS nomenclature is essential for reporting variants.\n\n    Ion Torrent platforms is known to have disadvantages in homopolymer errors, false indel detections; however, many studies have shown that Ion Torrent platforms can be used in clinical settings when sufficient read depth can be obtained and quality control measures are implemented. In our study, modifying the data analysis algorithm with TMAP and GATK (OTG-snpcaller) with Ion PGM reduced the calling errors and identified the variants not called by Ion PGM Dx/Torrent Suite, showing the importance of optimizing data analysis pipeline for implementing NGS.\n\n    The reference DNA samples allowed confirmation of pathogenic variants with the various methods, helping the evaluation of procedural evaluations as incorporated in many of the validation studies with NGS.\n\n    Although approved as class II medical device, the use of Ion PGM Dx with the vendor supplied Torrent Suite analysis software showed both false-negative and -positive results not suitable for use in a clinical laboratory. Further optimization of the data analysis pipeline is necessary for use of Ion PGM platforms to be used in a clinical laboratory.\n\n    Conflict of interest relevant to this article was not reported.",

        "Title": "    Simultaneous detection of BRCA mutations and large genomic rearrangements in germline DNA and FFPE tumor samples",
        "Abstract": "    The development of breast and ovarian cancer is strongly connected to the inactivation of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes by different germline and somatic alterations, and their diagnosis has great significance in targeted tumor therapy, since recently approved PARP inhibitors show high efficiency in the treatment of BRCA-deficient tumors. This raises the need for new diagnostic methods that are capable of performing an integrative mutation analysis of the BRCA genes not only from germline DNA but also from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Here we describe the development of such a methodology based on next-generation sequencing and a new bioinformatics software for data analysis. The diagnostic method was initially developed on an Illumina MiSeq NGS platform using germline-mutated stem cell lines and then adapted for the Ion Torrent PGM NGS platform as well. We also investigated the usability of NGS coverage data for the detection of copy number variations and exon deletions as a replacement of the conventional MLPA technique. Finally, we tested the developed workflow on FFPE samples from breast and ovarian cancer patients. Our method meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements for the genetic diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancers both from germline and FFPE samples.",
        "Introduction": "    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have reshaped the image of molecular biology. These rapidly evolving technologies provide unprecedented scale and efficiency in DNA sequencing with many potential advantages over traditional Sanger sequencing. The introduction of benchtop NGS platforms opened the way for clinical diagnostic laboratories to incorporate this technology into their daily diagnostic routine. Performance comparison of different benchtop NGS platforms showed substantial differences between them in the quality of data and throughput capacity. These differences have to be considered carefully when searching for the most suitable NGS platform to achieve specific diagnostic requirements and goals. Parallel to the spreading of different NGS methods, several target-enrichment technologies have also been introduced to isolate and prepare regions of the genome for NGS. However, the efficiency and specificity limitations of different target-enrichment methods still represent a bottleneck for targeted NGS. The diversity of sample preparation and NGS techniques used in research can offer a wide spectrum of solutions for DNA sequencing in the clinical practice. However, performance and quality criteria expected from NGS are markedly different in diagnostics and research. To meet regulatory requirements, clinical sequencing assays must be robust and reproducible, with well-defined sensitivity and specificity values so that results can be applied with confidence when making treatment decisions.\n\n    Germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOCS) representing up to 10% of all breast cancers diagnosed annually. Pathogenic mutations in these genes confer an estimated 40% to 85% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 15% to 40% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Selection of women for genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 follows general guidelines based on their family history of cancer. However, not all HBOCS patients fulfil these criteria mostly because of paternal inheritance of the susceptibility or the effect of a small family. The mutational status of these patients often remains unclarified.\n\n    BRCA genes are also involved in the development of sporadic breast and ovarian tumors. Several studies have reported somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a considerable proportion of breast and ovarian cancers. The mutational status of the BRCA genes is important for selecting patients for personalized treatment, as patients carrying a germline or somatic BRCA mutation have shown to give a positive response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-inhibitors (PARPi). Recently, several studies have pointed out that the miRNA expression pattern also has a significant effect on the progress and outcome of breast and ovarian cancer. Assessing the molecular signature of tumor samples is thus a crucial step in the proper management of breast and ovarian cancer patients.\n\n    In clinical laboratories, the diagnostic sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is often performed by Sanger sequencing of individually amplified PCR products. This method is suitable for the detection of single-base substitutions, small insertions, and deletions. For the detection of copy number variations (CNV), alternative methods such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) have to be used. Due to the lack of mutational hotspots in the BRCA genes and their relatively large size, the traditional capillary sequencing-based diagnostic process combined with MLPA analysis represents an expensive and time-consuming solution. In addition, tumor samples are usually heterogeneous containing normal and tumor cells in variable amounts, which often makes Sanger sequencing and MLPA analysis unreliable. The advent of different NGS and target-enrichment methods offered the possibility to relocate the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation detection workflow onto these high-throughput platforms. Several NGS systems have already been evaluated using these two genes. The majority of the studies reporting BRCA diagnostic methods focus on the detection of germline mutations using blood samples, from which high-quality genomic DNA can be prepared. However, the majority of tumor samples are formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical specimens and thus DNA isolated from these samples has specific characteristics which often make the subsequent mutational analysis difficult: the amount of DNA isolated from FFPE samples is often limited, and the quality is poor due to deamination and cross-linking during formalin-fixation. Only a limited fraction of the available studies present some solution to somatic BRCA mutation detection from FFPE samples.\n\n    Given the diversity of sample types (blood, FFPE) and possible mutations (SNP, indels, CNVs) in BRCA analysis and due to the appearance of PARP inhibitors, there is a strong clinical demand for an integrative diagnostic solution to detect the various mechanisms of BRCA inactivation.\n\n    In this work, we present a multi-sided BRCA diagnostic method based on multiplex PCR amplification, next-generation sequencing, and computational variant identification that is versatile to face all the challenges mentioned above. Using previously validated sample pools, we optimized and validated the sequencing and mutation detection performance on the two most popular benchtop sequencing platforms: Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM. We further demonstrate that the sample processing method used for the detection of germline mutations is also suitable for the identification of whole exon deletions and duplications. Most importantly, we show that the method performs well on FFPE samples of breast and ovarian tumors and is suitable for somatic mutation detection. Therefore, combining the multiplex PCR/NGS sequencing method with the appropriate NGS platform results in a complete integrative and robust diagnostic pipeline for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis.",
        "Methods": "    DNA samples from cell lines with known deleterious variants in BRCA1 (n=18; Table 1) or BRCA2 (n=6; Table 1) were purchased from the Coriell Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). These reference samples contained both pathogenic and non-pathogenic variants. We also obtained 22 blood samples (Table 2) from patients previously diagnosed with BRCA mutations validated by Sanger sequencing (Kecskemet Hospital, HU). For FFPE testing, we received DNA samples from the Department of Pathology, University of Szeged (HU): ten ovarian tumor samples with matching non-tumorous FFPE or lymphocyte DNA. All patient samples were collected with appropriate consents approved by the regulatory and ethical authorities. Genomic DNA was isolated using PureLink  Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA-USA) for the blood samples and High Pure FFPET DNA Isolation Kit (Roche, IN, USA) for the FFPE samples.\n\n    The target region consisted of all coding exons of BRCA1 (NM_007294.2) and BRCA2 (NM_000059.3) as well as of the intronic sequences adjacent to each exon boundary. The adjacent intron length ranged between 10 and 50 bp, except for the 3' end of BRCA1 exon 9 and BRCA2 exon 9, 14, and 17, where it was shorter due to primer design parameter constrains. Although mutations further into intronic sequences have been reported, their frequency appears to be low, and their significance is often unclear. Overall, target regions are expected to encompass the majority of pathogenic sequence changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 including all intronic splice site mutations.\n\n    Primer design was performed using the freely available software Primer3. All primers were checked for primer-dimer interactions, both for self-dimers and cross-dimers, to prevent template-independent primer extension. The resulting primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa, USA) and tested in simplex PCR reactions on 20 ng of genomic DNA using 10 muM per primer; the other parameters were the same as those of the multiplex PCR described below. The multiplex PCR-based strategy considerably reduced the number of amplification reactions: four multiplex reactions for BRCA1 and five multiplexes for BRCA2 resulting in altogether 80 PCR fragments sized between 186 and 812 base pairs. Multiplex PCR reactions for BRCA1 were performed in 35 mul volumes containing 1 x PCR buffer, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), and 20-50 ng of template DNA. Thermal cycler conditions were: 95 C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 95 C for 20 s; 63.5 C for 30 s; 72 C for 50 s; and, finally, 2 min at 72 C. BRCA2 multiplexes were carried out in 25 mul volumes using 0.7 units Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase with 5xHF buffer and 10 mM dNTPs (Thermo Scientific). Thermal cycler conditions were: 98 C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 98 C for 20 s; 63.5 C for 30 s; 72 C for 50 s; and, finally, 2 min at 72 C. In all multiplex reactions, primer concentrations were optimized and varied between 0.05 pmol/mul and 0.2 pmol/mul final concentrations. PCR reactions were run on a 4% agarose gel for amplification quality control.\n\n    After successful amplification of all BRCA fragments, multiplex PCR products belonging to the same sample were pooled together (40% - BRCA1 and 60% - BRCA2) and purified with a PCR cleanup kit (Geneaid, Taiwan). The large size-range of amplicons (200-800 bp) in the multiplex PCR reactions requires further fragmentation to overcome the limitation of sequencing length for the Illumina and IonTorrent NGS platforms. We decided to use restriction enzyme-based fragmentation, a highly efficient and reproducible way of DNA fragmentation, which also makes the upstream step of adaptor ligation easier. We searched among enzymes with 4-nucleotide recognition sites as, theoretically, these provide an ideal fragmentation pattern of 250 bp long DNA. We carried out in silico fragmentation of the target genes with different 4-mer recognition enzymes that generate sticky ends using Clone Manager 9 (Scientific & Educational Software, Denver, CO, USA). The tested enzymes were ranked based on the number and size of fragments generated and the compatibility of sticky ends generated after digestion. Finally, three enzymes fulfilled our criteria: MseI (NEB, Ipswich, MA), Csp6I, and FspBI (Thermo Scientific). These restriction enzymes have an optimal cleavage site distribution along the target genes to generate DNA fragments between the size ranges of 50 and 300 base pairs (Figure 2). It was important to use more than one enzyme to ensure the presence of overlapping fragments similar to a random shearing with sonication. Most importantly, in case an enzyme site is inactivated by a point mutation the coverage of the respective region is ensured by the two neighboring enzyme sites. The possibility of two consecutive cleavage sites being inactivated was ignored. In most of the cases, additional enzyme sites were generated near the 5' end of the primers to ensure the above mentioned optimal fragmentation conditions.\n\n    Restriction enzyme digestions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and were purified using the Small DNA Fragments extraction Kit (Geneaid, Taiwan). Custom barcoded adaptor sequences specific for Illumina or Ion PGM were ligated to the fragmented samples using T4 DNA Ligase (Thermo Scientific). Nick translation was carried out with DNA Polymerase I (Thermo Scientific). Generated DNA fragment libraries were checked for adapter dimers and size range (~170-400 bp) using gel electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Samples were re-isolated from the gel with a DNA fragment extraction kit (Viogene, Taiwan). Fragment library quantification was carried out using the q-PCR-based quantification method (Kapa Biosystems) on LightCycler480 qPCR (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).\n\n    Illumina sequencing was carried out on the Illumina MiSeq system with Standard flow cell v2, following the manufacturer's instructions. For IonTorrent PGM sequencing, we used the Ion PGM  Template OT2 200 Kit together with the Ion OneTouch  2 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The generated ion sphere particles (ISP) were enriched using the ES module and were sequenced with an Ion PGM in a 200-bp configuration on 316 chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\n    In addition to commercially available softwares, sequencing data were analyzed using the in-house developed NGSeXplorer bioinformatics software. A trial version of the software will be available at request from the authors.\n\n    The mapping algorithm of NGSeXplorer is composed of two distinct steps. In the first step, the software identifies alignment start positions using Burrows-Wheeler Transformation (BWT). The start position is defined as a 20-nucleotide-long key sequence from both ends of the reads (the first and last 4 nucleotides of each read is excluded from the search process). This key sequence is then tested against the reference in forward and reverse directions using the preset error threshold values. In this case, the default value is 2, which means that the alignment is acceptable only if the maximum difference between the key and the reference sequence does not exceed 2. In the second step, the software performs an accurate local alignment from the previously identified starting positions using the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm. In our case, the scoring matrix of the SW algorithm prefers mismatches over indels as follows: match 10, mismatch -8, indel -9. There are no open gap or extended gap penalties in the scoring matrix. Starting positions of reads that are in close proximity to each other (<5 nucleotides) are combined together, and a mapping process is carried out with them. The first possible mapping result is picked out, and a linear run time rearrangement algorithm is applied on it to optimize for gaps and mismatches. Each rearrangement is scored based on the number of matches/mismatches and the number and length of indels. Our default scoring matrix is based on resequencing known samples and empirically determining the values to reach the maximum correctly mapped reads. The scoring matrix is: 100 for match, 30 for mismatch, 10 for deletion, and 1 for insertion; indels longer than 5 counted as match. In this way, the software can identify the best scored version of a read for the final alignment procedure. Since some primer positions occur within exons, alignments beginning at primer sites with sequences partially or exactly matching these primer sequences were soft-clipped. In other cases, primer sequences could hide real mutations during the variant calling process.\n\n    NGSeXplorer permits ready access to sample Binary alignment /Map format (BAM) and Variant Call Format (VCF) files. The VCF files are then further processed resulting in a preliminary classification of the observed variants: molecular classification (e.g. synonymous, missense, nonsense, frameshift) and clinical relevance based on locus-specific databases (BIC, UMD, Ensembl.org). Variant assessment is then performed manually by the operator by rechecking the quality metrics of the individual variants and its concordance with the IGV data. If the variant identification is accurate, the variants are loaded into a traceable database where the following fields are automatically filled by the NGSeXplorer software interface: Gene, Exon, Nucleotide, Change, dbSNP rs#, HGVS designation, and VAF (Variant Allele Frequency). All called variants were identified according to the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen). For variant calling from Ion Torrent sequencing data, we developed specific tests and a filter set with the purpose of reducing the high frequency of homopolymer sequencing errors specific to this platform:\n\n    The test filters out those variants that were detected only from one sequencing direction or whose frequency on the forward and reverse strands showed great difference (greater than 35%).\n\n    Due to the enzymatic fragmentation of PCR fragments, sequencing of a nucleotide can start from several well-defined positions. The number of wild-type and mutant sequences arising from different start positions (different depths) is subjected to Mann-Whitney U test. The test filters out those variants in which the pattern of depth distribution between wild-type and mutant reads shows a significant difference.\n\n    To further correct Ion Torrent homopolymer sequencing errors, we created a database from the sequencing data of 20 DNA samples that were considered wild-type for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The database contains the percentage values of insertion and deletion events for every base position, representing the basic error frequency of the platform for BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequencing. Those positions where the indel frequency is lower than 10% (reliable error) are considered low-error-frequency positions, and indel frequencies of newly sequenced samples measured for these positions are reliable and considered true variants if their frequency reaches or exceeds the indel detection limit of 25%. In high-error-frequency positions, where the frequency of indel events is higher than 10%, the following filters have to be applied to distinguish between sequencing errors and true indels:\n\n    This filter presumes that if a true single nucleotide insertion takes place in a homopolymeric region of a sample, this insertion frequency will be higher than the value measured in the database for the same insertion. Moreover, in the above mentioned case the frequency of two nucleotide insertions will also be significantly higher than in the database.\n\n    If a true single nucleotide deletion event takes place in a homopolymer region, it will result in a shift of the ratio of plus and minus 1 nucleotide-long indels relative to the ratio measured in the database for the same position; thus, when the ratio of deletions increases and the ratio of insertions decreases in the same sequence position it refers to a true deletion event.\n\n    Based on our observations, the ratio of an indel measured in a homopolymer position often requires correction due to the high frequency of sequencing errors in these regions. The correction we apply here is the difference between the frequencies of the opposite event in the database and in one particular sample, called HP-opposite. The frequency of an insertion or deletion corrected with this value is called HP percentage. The filter uses a well-defined decision-algorithm for the correction process (Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Table S4).\n\n    This experimental tool finds all non-homopolymer, larger than one nucleotide indels with low allele frequency and realigns all sequences near the found indels to maximize the possible length of insertions and deletions.\n\n    The overall mutation detection workflow using the above mentioned filters and tools is summarized in Figure 4.\n\n    We evaluated the capacity of our multiplex PCR/NGS sequencing method to detect large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) using coverage data from Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Coverage data of two test samples (Table 2) were compared after normalization to the average of three reference samples with normal copy number. The normalization calculation and the comparison procedure of count data were performed separately for each of the four BRCA1 multiplex PCRs as described previously. Briefly, to determine the dosage quotient (DQ) of an amplicon in a given individual, the total absolute read count per specific multiplex was determined as the sum of the read counts for all amplicons of that specific multiplex. Per individual, the relative read count was determined for every amplicon as the ratio of the read count for that amplicon over the total absolute read count of the specific multiplex to which the amplicon belongs. The ratio of the relative read count of an amplicon of a test individual over the average relative read counts in the reference individuals results in the DQ for that amplicon in that individual. In short: DQi test = (RCi/RCall)test/(RCi/RCall)ref with \"RC\"= read count; \"i\" = amplicon i; \"all\" = all amplicons; \"test\" = test individual; and \"ref\" = reference individual. The copy number of the samples used in these calculations was initially determined using the MLPA BRCA1 kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    We amplified the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from the ten FFPE tumor samples and matching normal tissue/lymphocytes complementing the multiplex amplification with singleplex PCR reactions where it was necessary. We generated a fragment library and sequenced the samples on an Illumina MiSeq platform. For mutation detection, we used the NGSeXplorer with settings adapted for somatic variant calling: minimum coverage value of 100x and variant frequency threshold of 10%. We used mutant and non-mutant FFPE DNA mixtures in a serial dilution to demonstrate sensitivity limitations: one FFPE tumor sample with known BRCA pathogenic mutation (BRCA1: c.5263_5264insC) was mixed with non-mutant FFPE tumor DNA to make 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 admixtures.",
        "Results": "    A total of 24 DNA samples with known pathogenic germline mutations were used to calibrate the routine procedure, that is, multiplex PCR amplification, library preparation, and bioinformatics analysis parameters. To adequately address diagnostic issues, this sample set was composed of difficult cases, for example, insertions and/or deletions of various sizes and mutations occurring in homopolymer regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Table 1). Samples were pooled and sequenced together but remained readily identifiable using barcodes (indices) ligated to the amplicons during library preparation. The application of optimized experimental conditions resulted in a full coverage of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 regions of interest with uniform representation of each PCR amplicon in the coverage distribution (Figure 1). The average number of reads mapped per sample was 133,067 resulting in an average coverage of 689x.\n\n    During the optimization of the mutation detection algorithm, we paid special attention to large indels represented by two samples in the training set: an 11-bp deletion (GM14096) and a 40-bp-long deletion (NA14094). These indels were correctly mapped and identified by the in-house developed NGSeXplorer software (Supplementary Figure S1). As in the validation set we did not have the possibility to include other samples with long indels, we evaluated the reproducibility of the identification of large indels by analyzing the above mentioned two samples in two independent sequencing runs. The coverage data and variant calling results of this reproducibility test are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n    After the initial optimization process, we blindly validated the diagnostic method on 20 samples each containing a unique pathogenic mutation (Table 2). At the same time, we compared the mutation detection performance of the two most popular NGS platforms: Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM. Sequencing parameters, number of reads, and coverage values were evaluated for both sequencing platforms and are summarized in Table 3. The average read length was similar for both sequencing platforms and was mainly determined by the length of the DNA fragments generated after the restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products (Figure 2). Each manufacturer uses unique software implementations to generate base-quality score predictions, thus, direct comparison of these scores between different platforms is difficult, even taking into account that Ion Torrent PGM generally underestimates quality scores while Illumina MiSeq slightly overestimates them. Based on the alignment of sequencing reads, we conclude that the substitution error rates produced by the two platforms are similar (0.29 and 0.23 substitutions per 100 bases for Illumina and Ion Torrent, respectively). Comparison of the frequency of insertions and deletions demonstrated that the Ion Torrent PGM reads had 1.27 insertions and 0.67 deletions per 100 bases (Table 3), while in the case of Illumina MiSeq insertion and deletion events were nearly absent (0.01 and 0.04, respectively). The allelic ratio for mutation detection was adjusted to 25% both for single nucleotide variation (SNV) and indel detection, with a minimum depth of coverage of 50x.\n\n    Our in-house developed software (NGSeXplorer) correctly identified the known variants in all 20 retrospective samples and correctly assigned homozygosity and heterozygosity, with no false-positive or false-negative variant predictions (Table 4). Illumina sequencing resulted in an experimental sensitivity [TP/(TP + FN)] of 100% where TP is true-positive and FN is false-negative. In the absence of true-negative variants, specificity was estimated by using the false-positive (FP) rate FP/(FP + TP), resulting in 0%. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for the validation set of 20 samples used in the performance comparison between the two platforms.\n\n    During the initial phase of mutation detection, all called variants (1148 variants per 20 samples) were retrieved from the Ion Torrent PGM sequence data set without applying any of the specific bioinformatic filters. After this, different filter thresholds were computed in order to minimize the number of false-positive calls without the introduction of false-negative results (Table 5). The filter thresholds were set as follows: depth test 5, insertion overrun 20%, deletion displacement 30%, HP percentage 25%, and strand bias 35%. Modification of filter thresholds in order to reduce the number of false-positives would lead to the appearance of false-negative results.\n\n    From the 20 samples sequenced with Ion Torrent, in the case of 9 samples only the true pathogenic mutations remained after variant filtering. In the case of 10 other samples, 1-4 false-positive pathogenic mutations remained in addition to the real one. In the case of the remaining one sample, the true pathogenic mutation was discarded by one of the variant filtering steps. This was a Cytosine to Adenine substitution (c.5645C>A) followed by a four-mer Adenine repeat. The mutation was filtered out by the Strand bias test because the average quality value of the surrounding bases (due to the homopolymer sequence) on the reverse strand was below threshold (Q10), hence, the majority of these reads were ignored during variant detection. In conclusion, Ion Torrent variant calling of pathogenic mutations resulted in an experimental sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 97.3% calculated as follows: [TN/(TN + FP)]. The overall accuracy [TP + TN/(TP + TN + FP + FN)] of the assay was 97.2%.\n\n    To identify CNVs in the BRCA1 gene with our multiplex PCR/NGS sequencing method, we used Illumina MiSeq read counts as readout. We calculated the average DQs for all the 36 BRCA1 amplicons in four different groups representing the four multiplex reactions used for BRCA1 amplification. This DQ results from the comparison of normalized amplicon amounts between a test individual and control individuals as detailed in Materials and Methods. We presented the four DQs in a single scatter plot. The DQ values of the 36 BRCA1 amplicons can be separated into three ranges of 0.5 (range 0.55-0.63), 1.0 (range 0.81-1.2), and 1.5 (1.45), corresponding to the number of copies present in the individuals. Based on this segregation, we conclude that in one of the test samples, a deletion of exon 21 and 22 has occurred, while in the other sample a duplication of exon 13 can be observed (Figure 3). The results are in concordance with those obtained with MLPA analysis.\n\n    The complementation of multiplex amplification with singleplex PCR reactions in case of FFPE samples ensured 100% coverage similarly to the germline samples. The mean depth of coverage was 2009x and 841x for the FFPE/matched normal samples with an average read number of 458,832 and 230,779, respectively. During the variant calling process, we identified pathogenic mutations in four of the ten tumor samples, all of them present in BRCA1: a frame-shift insertion (c.5263_5264insC) and two nonsense mutation (c.628C>T and c.5251C>T). Mutational analysis of the matching normal samples revealed that three of the four identified mutations were germline, and only one tumor sample contained a somatic mutation (Table 6) that has not been recorded yet in the COSMIC database (c.628C>T; p. Q210*). All four pathogenic mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing. The newly identified somatic mutation (Q210*) was reported to COSMIC database (accession number: 41127). The tumor samples and their normal match also contained some common germline variants that are present in the majority of the population (Supplementary Table S2). In the case of the mutant and non-mutant FFPE DNA mixture, the mutant allele was detected in the first two admixtures (1/2 and 1/4) by the automated variant calling process. Visual inspection of filtered variants revealed the presence of the mutant allele also in the other two admixtures with frequencies below the variant detection threshold of 10% (Supplementary Table S3). The differences between the expected and observed allele frequencies are possibly due to the difference in the amount of amplifiable DNA in the FFPE samples used to generate the admixtures.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this paper, we describe an integrative diagnostic solution for the analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This method offers the possibility of detecting different mutation types such as point mutations, small deletions, and exon or allele losses both from germline and FFPE samples. The complete workflow is based on a multiplex PCR amplification and enzymatic fragmentation strategy to generate patient DNA library followed by NGS sequencing and data analysis. The use of restriction enzymes for NGS fragment library preparation is not a widespread method, but it has significant advantages when the copy number of the DNA to be sequenced is limited such as often in the case of FFPE-derived samples. For example, MseI restriction digestion has been successfully used for DNA fragmentation in single-cell whole-genome analyzing studies. Here we complemented the MseI-mediated fragmentation with two other restriction enzymes that recognize four-base motifs: Csp6I and FspBI. All three restriction enzymes generate TA overhangs at the 5'end of DNA fragments, which makes the subsequent ligation of adapter sequences easier.\n\n    For the optimization of the methodology, we used a training set of 24 DNA samples from stem cell lines with previously identified germline BRCA mutations. After adequate optimization of the multiplex PCR conditions and the library preparation process, all 24 samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. For NGS data analysis, initially we used platform-specific bioinformatics tools (Torrent Suite Software in the case of Ion Torrent and MiSeq Reporter software for Illumina). However, when it became clear that these tools do not fulfil all our expectations we developed our own bioinformatics pipeline, the NGSeXplorer. The software contains an accurate alignment module, a coverage generator, and a variant calling unit with several variant filtering algorithms for Ion Torrent PGM sequencing data. The software uses the Breast Cancer Information Core, the UMD, and the Ensembl.org databases for variant annotation. The most important factor for accurate mutation detection during NGS is the complete coverage of the target region as well as the optimal depth of coverage inside the target region. Coverage results of the training sample set clearly demonstrated that 100% of the target region was successfully covered by the PCR fragments amplified in multiplex setting. A major challenge in the multiplex PCR enrichment method is the uniform representation of different amplicons in the reactions and later in the coverage data. This was successfully overcome here by adjusting the primer concentrations and PCR conditions (Figure 1). Regarding the minimal depth of coverage for germline mutation detection, we took into account the range of 50-fold coverage, as suggested by several studies on BRCA analysis. In addition to fulfilling these conditions, all the pathogenic mutations in the 24 training samples were accurately identified without any false-positive alterations, including the large indels that were identified in two independent sequencing runs (Supplementary Table S1).\n\n    After the initial optimization, a subsequent group of 20 samples were selected for the validation of the diagnostic process on Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM. Different NGS platforms have already been evaluated using the BRCA1-2 genes as a model: some of these studies tested Ion Torrent PGM, while others worked with Illumina HiSeq or GS Junior from Roche 454. However, the direct comparison of these platforms using the same methodology in the context of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation detection performance is limited. In our comparison of the two benchtop NGS platforms, Illumina MiSeq correctly identified all the pathogenic mutations in the 20 samples without the application of any of the variant filters. No false-positive mutations were identified. For Ion Torrent mutation detection, we used a set of variant filters developed to reduce sequencing error-derived false-positive results (Table 5). The main disadvantage of Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing relative to Illumina chemistry is associated with the inaccuracy of length determination in homopolymers. These errors tend to increase in genomic regions where the occurrence of true polymorphisms is also higher and, thus, it is analytically challenging to reduce these errors without compromising detection sensitivity. In our case, the application of the variant filter set developed within the frames of NGSeXplorer led to a drastic reduction of false-positive results illustrated by the specificity of 97.3%. Though, in one of the 20 samples a true pathogenic mutation was also discarded by one of the above mentioned filters resulting in an experimental sensitivity of 95.0%. Despite the fact that this false-negative case can be traced back to special reasons, missing even a single true-positive variant is unacceptable in a diagnostic setting. Visual inspection of the variant list before accepting the results of different filters could prevent the automatic rejection of true pathogenic mutations in the case of Ion Torrent sequencing (Figure 4).\n\n    A comprehensive diagnostic workflow for BRCA1 and BRCA2 must include the ability of specific and accurate detection of large genomic rearrangements in these genes. It has already been demonstrated that multiplex PCR reactions can be used to determine the copy number of the amplified targets by calculating their DQ in the case of multiplex amplicon quantification (MAQ) or quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). A precondition for CNV detection using the multiplex PCR/NGS method is that the normalized read counts are stable over different samples. For this reason, homogeneously prepared, high-quality DNA must be used with similar amplification kinetics. Our multiplex PCR/NGS sequencing pipeline provides promising results regarding LGR detection since the CNVs present were correctly identified (Figure 3).\n\n    In the recent years, the ability to detect BRCA mutations in tumor samples of ovarian cancer patients has become increasingly important. For these reasons, we tested the performance of our method on DNA samples isolated from FFPE tissue blocks of 10 ovarian cancer patients. Despite the fact that based on the results of other studies the frequency of somatic BRCA mutations in ovarian cancer is relatively low (5-8%), their detection is important since patients with somatic BRCA pathogenic variants may benefit from treatment with PARPi, similarly to patients with germline BRCA mutations. In addition to FFPE DNA, we also tested blood DNA since we share the suggestion made by others that FFPE analysis should not be used as a substitute for comprehensive germline BRCA analysis. From the four pathogenic BRCA mutations identified in the FFPE samples, 3 were confirmed to be present in the germline as well. Consequently, one out of the ten analyzed tumor samples contained a somatic mutation not reported before. This highlights the importance of BRCA mutation detection from FFPE tumor samples. The frequency of the identified somatic mutation was higher than 80% suggesting the loss of the second non-mutated allele (loss of heterozygosity (LOH)) in the tumor (but not the normal tissue). However, the experiment that we carried out with mutant and non-mutant FFPE DNA mixtures demonstrated that our method is potentially able to detect mutations of low frequency (Supplementary Table S3).\n\n    To our knowledge, this is the first time the performance of an integrative NGS-based approach developed to perform comprehensive genetic testing of the BRCA genes has been evaluated on both germline and FFPE samples, simultaneously targeting a large spectrum of genetic alterations such as SNPs, indels, and LGRs. For germline mutations, the method was validated on the two most popular benchtop NGS platforms: Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM. Our custom-designed NGS workflow for the genetic testing of germline BRCA mutations in combination with Illumina MiSeq sequencing meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements for the genetic diagnosis of HBOCS.",

        "Title": "    Molecular genetics analysis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients in India",
        "Abstract": "    Hereditary cancers account for 5-10% of cancers. In this study BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2*(1100delC) were analyzed for mutations in 91 HBOC/HBC/HOC families and early onset breast and early onset ovarian cancer cases.\n\n    PCR-DHPLC was used for mutation screening followed by DNA sequencing for identification and confirmation of mutations. Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were computed for five-year survival data on Breast and Ovarian cancer cases separately, and differences were tested using the Log-rank test.\n\n    Fifteen (16%) pathogenic mutations (12 in BRCA1 and 3 in BRCA2), of which six were novel BRCA1 mutations were identified. None of the cases showed CHEK2*1100delC mutation. Many reported polymorphisms in the exonic and intronic regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were also seen. The mutation status and the polymorphisms were analyzed for association with the clinico-pathological features like age, stage, grade, histology, disease status, survival (overall and disease free) and with prognostic molecular markers (ER, PR, c-erbB2 and p53).\n\n    The stage of the disease at diagnosis was the only statistically significant (p < 0.0035) prognostic parameter. The mutation frequency and the polymorphisms were similar to reports on other ethnic populations. The lack of association between the clinico-pathological variables, mutation status and the disease status is likely to be due to the small numbers.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Chennai with the crude incidence rate (CIR) being 30.1/100,000 in the Madras Metropolitan Tumor Registry (MMTR). A significant increasing trend in the incidence of breast cancer was seen during 1982-2005 with an average annual increase of 0.72 per 100,000. The trend of rising incidence rate is likely to continue due to further changes in life style factors such as age of first child birth and dietary habits.\n\n    BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes had been identified by linkage analysis and positional cloning on large breast cancer families in the early 1990's. This has improved the understanding of the molecular genetics of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer thus providing scope for better management in these patients and in offering predictive testing, aggressive screening and preventive strategies to the unaffected carriers in the same family. The CHEK2*1100delC mutation confers a low risk of breast cancer in non-BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers. The average cumulative risk of breast cancer in a BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carrier is 65% and 45% by the age of 70 years, respectively. For ovarian cancer the risk is 39% and 11%, in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers by 70 years, respectively. Slightly elevated risk of colon and prostate cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers and increased risk of other malignancies including pancreatic, stomach and head and neck cancers and a large increase in the relative risk for male breast cancer is seen in BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\n    Other genes like TP53, ATM, SKT11, PTEN, PTCH MLH1, MSH2, PMS1, PMS2, MSH6 have been associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer as part of other cancer syndromes. Recently genome wide association study identified four plausible causative genes namely FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 and LSP1 that confer moderate susceptibility to breast cancer.\n\n    Generally, hereditary breast cancers are earlier in onset and have a higher prevalence of bilateral breast cancers. Breast tumors from BRCA1- carriers are more likely to be highly proliferative; poorly differentiated (grade III); more likely to have a medullary or atypical medullary-like appearance with high degree of lymphocyte infiltration; and show excess of continuous pushing margins. Moreover these tumors are more often ER, PR and c-erbB2 negative and frequently show p53 alterations. Lakhani and Bell et al report BRCA2 tumors to be of higher grade than the sporadic group, but this was not confirmed by Eelora et al, 2005. The BRCA2 tumors are likely to be ER positive. BRCA1 mutation carriers have an earlier onset of ovarian cancer that is histologically high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. We had earlier published the data of BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2*1100delC mutation status in 22 cases. Here, we report the clinico-pathological features, BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2*1100delC mutation status and their correlation with prognostic markers in 91 cases.",
        "Methods": "    Ninety-one eligible cases including the 22 published that fulfilled the criteria for gene testing were screened for BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2*1100delC mutations. The criteria were as follows: Early onset of breast cancer (<=35 years of age) or ovarian cancer (<=40 years of age); Two cases of breast cancer diagnosed under the age of 50 years in a family (first and second degree relatives); Three or more cases of breast cancer diagnosed at any age; Presence of breast and ovarian cancer in the family or in the same individual; Male breast cancer with a relative (of either sex) with breast cancer; Family history of Prostate or pancreatic or colorectal cancer or sarcomas, with breast cancer in the family. The study includes 65 unilateral, 6 bilateral breast cancer cases, 14 ovarian cancer cases, 3 cases with both breast and ovarian cancer in the same individual without any family history of cancer, 2 cases each with family history of breast cancer and soft tissue sarcoma and 1 case of prostate cancer with family history of prostate and breast cancer. Of the 91 cases, 54 were with Family history (including 35 Hereditary Breast Cancer families, 15 Hereditary Breast & Ovarian Cancer families, 3 Hereditary Ovarian Cancer families and 1 with family history of Prostate and breast cancer). There were 31 early onset breast cancer (<= 35 yrs) and 3 early onset ovarian cancer (<= 40 yrs) cases without family history of cancer. Three patients had breast and ovarian cancers, without a family history. All the patients provided their informed consent for the study, which was cleared by the Institutional Ethical committee.\n\n    The sample collection, DNA isolation, PCR-DHPLC and sequencing were carried out as previously described.\n\n    The secondary structure and the tertiary structure of the normal CHEK2 gene sequence and the two missense variants were predicted by submitting the sequences to Chou Fasman secondary structure prediction site and at ExPaSy server for tertiary structure prediction using Swiss model.\n\n    IHC was done for ER, PR, p53 and c-erbB2 expression studies on available breast cancer cases. IHC was performed as per the standard methodology using primary antibodies; clone ID5 (ER), clone PgR636 (PR), clone HER2/neu (c-erbB2), and clone DO7 (p53) and secondary antibodies; rabbit anti mouse for ER, PR and p53 and swine anti rabbit for c-erbB2 from Dako. The antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:35 for ER and PR (Dako pharma), 1:350 for HER2/neu (Dako pharma) and 1:200 (Biogenex) or 1:50 (Dako pharma) for p53. Positive (known positives for each of the markers) and negative controls (omission of primary antibody) were included in each run. The scoring was done as described previously.\n\n    Chi-square test of independence was used for testing the statistical significance of association between the variables like age, stage, grade and histological type with disease status (i.e. disease free or disease present) and between clinico-pathological features and with each of the prognostic markers like ER, PR, c-erbB2 and p53 status for the breast cancer cases. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status i.e. mutation positivity or negativity were tested for statistical association with disease status and prognostic molecular markers. Yates correction was made wherever indicated. Fisher's exact probability test was employed to deal with small frequencies. Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were computed for five-year survival data on Breast and Ovarian cancer cases separately, and differences were tested using the Log-rank test. All the statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 10.0 software.",
        "Results": "    Fifteen out of the 91 (16%) samples analyzed had a deleterious mutation. Twelve mutations were in BRCA1 and three in BRCA2 gene. The mutations and genetic variants were designated according to HUGO recommendations. The gene, mutation, exon, and the details of age of onset and family history are given in Table 1. Six of the 15 pathogenic mutations were novel and have been submitted to the GenBank .\n\n    Apart from the pathogenic mutations, many known missense variations both in the exonic and the intronic regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were seen in our study. The common missense variations in the exons and introns of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene are given in Table 2. 85/91 (93%) cases showed at least one variation either in the exon or intron of BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Six cases did not show any variations either in exon or intron of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene. 28/91 (31%) did not show any variations in BRCA1 and 20/91 (22%) cases did not show any variations in BRCA2 gene.\n\n    In our study none of the 91 samples analyzed showed the CHEK2*1100delC mutation. However, two missense mutations were seen in three cases. c.1217G>A; p.R406H which is a known missense mutation was seen in two patients, both with breast cancer and a family history of breast cancer. The second missense variation was c.1175C>T;p.A392V seen in an early onset breast cancer case without any family history of cancer. The Chou Fasman secondary structure prediction showed extension of beta sheet and loss of a turn in the A392V and R406H missense mutation, respectively when compared with the normal sequence (Figure 1). The Swiss model for tertiary structure prediction show marked variation in the structure of A392V missense change. The R406H missense mutation, however did not show any change in its tertiary structure in the Swiss model (Figure 2).\n\n    In our study 10/15 BRCA1 mutation positive cases were breast cancer and 2/16 were ovarian cancer cases. 8/10 BRCA1 mutation positive breast cancer cases were ER and PR negative and 5/8 were p53 positive. c-erbB2 data was available for 6 cases, of which 5 were negative and 1 was positive. Of the three BRCA2 mutation positive cases data was available for only one case, which was negative for ER, PR and p53. Clinico-pathological variables like age, stage, grade, histology, ER, PR, c-erbB2 and p53 status for 65 unilateral, 6 bilateral breast cancers and 14 ovarian cancers are given in Table 3. Of the 91 cases, ER, PR, c-erbB2 and p53 data was available only for 59, 57, 50 and 48 cases respectively. Data was not available for 32 cases; 10/32 patients were being managed outside the Institute and either declined or were unable to provide paraffin blocks. In the remaining cases only FNAC was done for the diagnosis of the disease, and not enough slides were available for all the marker study.\n\n    Statistical analysis between clinico-pathological variables, disease status and prognostic markers revealed association between the stage of the disease at diagnosis and the disease status, which was statistically significant (p < 0.0035). There is a positive association between earlier stage at diagnosis and disease free status. No other variables like grade, age and histological types had significant association with the disease status and the prognostic molecular markers. In addition, no significant association between the mutation status and the clinico-pathological variables were seen.\n\n    The 5 year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer cases was 75% and 65% and for ovarian cancer cases was 30% and 22% respectively. The Plogrank = 0.30 for overall survival and Plogrank = 0.72 for disease-free survival in breast cancer cases and for ovarian cancer cases it is Plogrank = 0.42 and Plogrank = 0.89 respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curve for the breast and ovarian cancer cases are given in Figure 3 and Figure 4.",
        "Conclusion": "    We have looked at the prevalence of BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK1100delC mutation in breast and ovarain caner patients in India. The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutaion is similar to other population. CHEK1100delC mutation was not seen our study series. Asoociation between the clinico-pathological variables and mutation status with disease status and prognostic markers revealed significant assocaition between the stage at diagnosis and disease free status alone.",
        "Discussion": "    In our study on 91 patients, 15 pathogenic mutations (16%) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were detected. This is similar to the data from several studies including the study by Wagner et al who had reported 17% mutation in either of the BRCA genes.\n\n    There is a four fold greater incidence of BRCA1 mutation (12) compared to BRCA2 (3) mutations in our series of South Indian patients. This is different from the North Indian data wherein almost equal distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was seen in two studies and in the study by Hedau et al, 4/24 mutations reported, were all in BRCA1 gene. The two South Indian studies have looked at BRCA1 mutations only.\n\n    7/35 HBC families (20%) had mutations in either BRCA1 (5 mutations) or BRCA2 gene (2 mutations). Four of 15, HBOC cases were found to harbor mutations in BRCA1 gene (30%). Zelada-Hedman et al showed that 35% of the HBOC families have mutation in BRCA1 gene, but others report a higher percentage (58% and 43% respectively) of mutation in BRCA1 gene in HBOC families. The German consortium (2002) study showed 10% mutation in BRCA2 gene in HBOC families. In our series we did not find mutation in BRCA2 gene in HBOC families, which is similar to the results from a study in the Japanese population. Three of 31 early onset (<= 35 years) breast cancer cases had deleterious mutation, 2 in BRCA1 (7%) and 1 in BRCA2 (3%) gene. Peto et al also report 3.5% and 2.4% mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene, respectively in early onset (<= 35 years) breast cancer cases. Of the three hereditary ovarian cancer families studied, one had a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene.\n\n    Results published from other Indian groups on BRCA1 &BRCA2 give varying results. Initial studies on smaller sample size gave higher percentage of mutation detected. Saxsena et al reported 2.9% (6/204) mutation with largest sample size so far analyzed. However, this study includes 34 cases with family history and the rest being sporadic cases. The table 4 details the published results from the different groups from India. The mutation c.68_69delAG; p.Glu23Val fsX16 was seen in four cases (two in HBOC families and two in early onset breast cancer case is the only recurrent mutation seen in this study. The above mentioned mutation has been identified as founder mutation in various populations like the Ashkenazi Jews; however haplotype analysis was not performed in these four families to check for common ancestor. These four families are unrelated and are from different parts of South India, and ethnically different.\n\n    Many common missense variants were seen in our series both in the exon and intron of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Most have them been previously reported in other populations. The exonic variants seen in BRCA1 have been reported as unclassified variants in many studies. In the BIC data base, most of the variants have been classified as having no clinical significance or of unknown clinical significance. Case control studies have shown no difference in the frequencies of these alleles in cases and controls. However, we have not analyzed the frequency of the missense heterozygotes in our control population i.e. unaffected controls with out any family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. The most common exonic missense variant of BRCA2 gene seen in our cases was N372H. Studies have shown that N372H appears to confer a small increased risk for breast cancer. The missense variants seen in the intronic region of the BRCA1 gene and other less common exonic and intronic variants in BRCA2 have also been previously reported in other populations.\n\n    The CHEK2*1100delC mutation reported in the western populations were also screened for in our cases. Though no CHEK2*1100delC mutation was detected, two missense mutations in the CHEK2 gene (p.R406H and p.A392V) were seen in three cases. The residues, arginine and alanine at positions 406 and 392 are conserved across species. Additionally, the secondary structure prediction using the Chou-Fasman algorithm predicts changes in the secondary structure for both the missense variations.\n\n    The Swiss Model software too shows a marked change in the structure for the A392V missense variation, though the R406H did not show a visible change. The variation (R406H) was not seen to be associated with breast cancer cases in French Canadian women. The pathogenicity of the variations can however be confirmed by segregation analysis in other affected family members or other functional studies or screening the normal controls. Two out of the three cases had a family history of breast cancer but we could not get the sample from the other affected family member for testing. The patient with the A392V mutation was an early onset breast cancer patient without any family history. Rest of the coding region of the CHEK2 gene was not screened for mutations.\n\n    In our series, nearly 80% of the breast cancer patients were <= 45 years of age at diagnosis, with 52.7% being <= 35 years at diagnosis, as in other studies. Majority of the breast cancer cases were high-grade tumors (56%). Ho et al reported that 25%-37% of hereditary breast cancers not associated with BRCA1 mutations were ER negative but we found 68% to be negative for ER expression in our study. This correlates well with our hospital statistics in sporadic cancers, wherein 62% of the pre-menopausal patients harbor tumours, which are ER negative.\n\n    Our study looked at the association between clinico-pathological features, disease status, and prognostic markers. We also looked at the association between the mutation status with disease status and prognostic markers. The stage of the disease at diagnosis and the disease status alone emerged to be statistically significant, wherein a positive association between earlier stage at diagnosis and disease free status was observed. None of the other parameters showed any association. Disease free and overall survival of BRCA mutation positive breast or ovarian cancers did not significantly differ from the BRCA mutation negative cases. Other groups have also not found any survival difference between BRCA mutation positive versus negative cases.\n\n    Of the 91 cases analyzed, 13 (14%) of the affected probands were issues of consanguineous marriage and had either ovarian cancers (3) or breast cancers (10). Though susceptibility to breast cancer is inhereited as an autosomal dominant trait, modifier genes when present in homozygous state might further increase the risk of cancer.",

        "Title": "    Double Heterozygosity for BRCA1 Pathogenic Variant and BRCA2 Polymorphic Stop Codon K3326X: A Case Report in a Southern Italian Family",
        "Abstract": "    Here, we describe a patient with bilateral breast cancer and melanoma, and with a concomitant double variant, namely p.Gln563Ter in BRCA1 and p.Lys3326Ter in BRCA2. The BRCA2 p.Lys3326Ter (K3326X) (rs11571833) mutation identified in our patient is a debated substitution of thymidine for adenine which is currently regarded as benign polymorphism in main gene databases. Recent studies, however, describe this variant as associated with breast and ovarian tumors. Based on the observation of the cancer's earliest age of onset in this subject, our purpose was to reevaluate this variant according to recent papers indicating a role of powerful modifier of the genetic penetrance. Genetic testing was performed in all consenting patient's relatives, and in the collection of the clinical data particular attention was paid to the age of onset of the neoplasia. Following our observation that the our patient with double heterozygosis had an early age of onset for cancer similar to a few rare cases of double mutation for BRCA1 and BRCA2, we also performed an extensive review of the literature relative to patients carrying a double heterozygosity for both genes. In line with previous studies relative to the rare double heterozygosity in both BRCA1/2 genes, we found the earlier onset of breast cancer in our patient with both BRCA1/2 mutations with respect to other relatives carrying the single BRCA1 mutation. The presence of the second K3326X variant in our case induces a phenotype characterized by early onset of the neoplasia in a manner similar to the other cases of double heterozygosity previously described. Therefore, we suggest that during the genetic counseling, it should be recommendable to evaluate the presence of the K3326X variant in association with other pathogenic mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are oncosuppressor genes involved in DNA repair and are commonly mutated in a number of cancers. The identification of molecular mechanisms in inherited diseases as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) has emphasized the role of these genes in cancer, allowing subjects at risk of cancer to be screened for prevention and, hopefully, early diagnosis.\n\n    Although mostly somatically mutated, in a relevant number of subjects these genes are expressed with germline mutations that, however, recur within the general population with a prevalence variable equal to 1/400 up to 1/800 individuals. Several ethnic groups carrying constitutional mutations show significantly higher prevalence, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish with increased prevalence equal to 1/40 subjects of 185delAG and 5382insC and 617delT founder mutations in both BRCA1/2 genes. For the same reasons, the presence of double mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is extremely rare in the general population, although not exceptional in Ashkenazi breast-cancer patients. Compared to the huge amount of mutational analysis data for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, only a few studies report dual mutations in non-Ashkenazi subjects, mostly consisting in the description of a single or of a small number of families.\n\n    In the present study, we describe a case of coexisting BRCA1 p.Gln563Ter and BRCA2 p.Lys3326Ter double variant in a southern Italian family. The BRCA2 variant, also known as K3326X, was firstly interpreted as pathogenic, but its identification in control populations with no increase in breast or ovarian cancer occurrence led to its reinterpretation of benign polymorphism. Interestingly, new evidence of a significant association with cancer risk has been described and recent studies reassessed the association of K3326X BRCA2 mutation with the risk of developing melanoma, urothelial, pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancers, while its role as modifier of genetic penetrance has been also reported. By exploring the effect of this variant in our patient, we revealed clinical aspects apparently common to those previously described in patients with double BRCA1/BRCA2 heterozygosity, including the earlier age of onset of cancer.\n\n    Therefore, we reviewed the literature with regard to double mutations on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in order to search for similarities in genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding diagnostic and clinical implications.",
        "Methods": "    A 65-year-old woman was referred to our Oncogenomic Research Center for genetic counseling, including a pedigree analysis and a complete medical examination. The patient reported her personal and familial history of breast cancer since, at age of 40 years, she was diagnosed as having breast cancer on the left, and underwent a quadrantectomy. The pathologist described undifferentiated ductal, infiltrating carcinoma of the breast (G3:pT1N0M0), showing the estrogen receptor (ER) at 25% in tumor cells whereas the progesterone receptor (PgR), proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67) expression and HER-2 were undetectable. Seven years later, the patient developed a second ductal cancer still on the residual left breast with peculiar molecular aspects, namely triple-negative with a Ki-67 of 30%. At the age of 54, a further cancer on the right breast was diagnosed, and the patient underwent a mastectomy. The tumor was still triple negative, and showed Ki-67 expression on 48% of tumor cells. Together with the third breast cancer, the patient developed a pigmented flat cutaneous neoplasm of 1.1 cm in diameter, with irregular margins, that was surgically removed and described by the pathologist as melanoma in situ. A paraffin-embedded sample of the melanoma was recruited. Germline molecular analyses with sequencing of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were completed.\n\n    Once mutational data were available, we extended the genetic screening to all family members to complete a co-segregational analysis (Figure 1). Written informed consent was obtained from each participating individual, and the study was performed under the Ethics Committee of the University of Bari approvals (number 5329, 5 July 2017) and in accordance with the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    The patient's sister also developed a breast cancer, histologically documented as a moderately differentiated ductal left breast carcinoma (G2:pT1Nsn0), with Ki67 at 60% and HER-2 at 90% on tumor cells, while both ER and PgR were not expressed.\n\n    Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of the patient using the DNeasy  blood and tissue Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA, USA) and quantified with a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies , Carlsbad, CA, USA). We employed 10 ng of DNA to prepare the barcoded library using the Ion AmpliSeqTM Library kit 2.0 and the Ion XpressTM barcode adapters (Life Technologies ) on the Ion AmpliSeq  BRCA1 and BRCA2 Panel (Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The library was purified with Agentcourt AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA) and quantified with the Ion Library Quantitation Kit (Life Technologies ) on the StepOne Plus system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA 94404, USA). Template preparation was performed with the Ion OneTouchTM 2 System (Life Technologies ) and Ion OneTouchTM ES. Finally, sequencing was performed on a personal genome machine (PGM) using the Ion PGMTM Hi-QTM View Sequencing kit (Life Technologies ) on the Ion 314 chip v2 set (Life Technologies ) at the 500 flows standard. The results of sequence analysis were analyzed using Torrent Suite Software 5.0.4 (Life Technologies ) aligning all reads to the human reference hg19 genome. Variant calling was performed running the Torrent Variant Caller plugin version 5.0.4.0.\n\n    Specific sequencing reactions to confirm NGS data were performed using a Big Dye Terminator on a 3500 Series Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Foster City, CA 94404, USA). In order to exclude pre-analytical and analytical errors, PCR reactions and sequencing analyses were carried out on two different DNA extractions. For the control of both primer design and results, we referred to the ENSEMBL sequence BRCA1 (ENST00000357654.7) and BRCA2 (ENST00000380152.7).\n\n    We evaluated possible genetic factors contributing to the hereditary melanoma. For this reason, molecular screening for the CDKN2A with p14 (specific exon-1beta) and CDK4 genes was performed both on the proband and the cousin (III.4) affected by melanoma, as previously described.\n\n    Each identified variant was investigated in its potential pathogenic role using prediction algorithms such as SIFT and Polyphen, and web databases such as the Breast Cancer Information Core , COSMIC , Leiden Open Variation Database , dbSNP , Ensembl  and the Human Gene Mutation Database .",
        "Results": "    Molecular analysis of the proband showed BRCA1 c.1687C>T (p.Gln563Ter, rs80356898) and BRCA2 c.9976A>T (p.Lys3326Ter; K3326*, rs11571833) heterozygous mutations bearing in both cases a premature stop codon in BRCA1 at exon 10, and BRCA2 at exon 27, respectively (Figure 1). The mutations recurred by genetic transmission to the patient's asymptomatic daughters (Figure 2): the first, namely a 36-year-old (IV.1) inherited both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations; whereas the younger, aged 30 (IV.3) showed only the BRCA2 variant. The proband's asymptomatic 91-year-old mother (II.9) bore only the mutation in BRCA1 in a similar fashion to the sister with breast cancer who died at 56 years of age (III.3), and for whom the analysis was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Mutational analysis, which turned out to be negative, was later extended to the proband's 70-year-old husband, since he was reported as having a degree of relationship (first-degree cousins) with his mother (II.7), who died of breast cancer at the age of 70, and with the maternal grandmother of the proband (I.3), who died also at the age of 70 of breast cancer.\n\n    Genetic testing was also performed in other consenting relatives, and the following data refer to the presence of germinal BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. The mother's sister had died at 60 years of age for a metastatic ovarian cancer (II.10) one year earlier. She had three children: a 53-year-old son (III.4), who had received a diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma two years before, but with no mutations; a 51-year-old daughter (III.5) carrying no mutations; and an asymptomatic 48-year-old daughter (III.6) positive to the mutation of the BRCA1 gene. An additional sister of the mother's proband (II.11) died at 80 years of age for causes unrelated to cancer, while her son died at 55 years of age of pancreatic cancer (III.9). Two other sons of 70 (III.7) and 64 (III.8) years of age were apparently asymptomatic, but both of them bore mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Furthermore, three more cousins, daughters of the asymptomatic 80-year-old sister of the mother's proband (II.13) of 57 (III.13), 55 (III.14) and 45 (III.15) years of age, were negative to the mutational analysis.\n\n    Since the BRCA2 p.Lys3326* mutation has often been found in linkage disequilibrium with the presence of a pathogenic frameshift BRCA2 c.6275_6276delTT (Leu2092ProfsTer7) and a non-pathogenic BRCA2 c.9257-16T>C (IVS24-17T>C) mutation, we extended the analysis of both variants to all consenting subjects. None of the analyzed subjects presented these sequence variants. The sequence analysis performed on the proband paraffin-embedded melanoma samples revealed the presence of the two BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and a novel BRCA2 c.4297G>A somatic variant (p.Gly1433Arg). According to the data shown on the variant annotation file generated by analysis on Ion Reporter v.5.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), the somatic mutation BRCA2 c.4297G>A has a PolyPhen score of 0.916 and a SIFT score of 0.22. Using the WEB-tool PolyPhen-2 (genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) this mutation is predicted to be possibly damaging, with a score of 0.777 (sensitivity: 0.85; specifity: 0.92); while using another web tool SIFT Human Coding SNPs  this mutation is predicted to be tolerated, with a SIFT score of 0.23. This variant is classified in the COSMIC database  (COSM5842418) and described with a functional analysis through hidden Markov models (FATHMM) prediction as pathogenic (score 0.72).\n\n    Finally, molecular screening of CDKN2A, p14 (specific exon-1beta) and CDK4 genes, which are involved in approximately 20-40% of large, high-risk families, performed both on the proband and on the cousin affected by melanoma (III.4), did not identify any pathogenetic sequence variant.\n\n    We further completed an extensive review of world-wide literature using the PubMed database  and reviewing the references of retrieved articles. All studies involving Jewish Ashkenazi patients were deliberately excluded. In two papers we have amended the calculation of two patients (Table 1). From 1998 to 2017, 19 articles described 33 families with 54 subjects carrying a double BRCA mutation. Table 1 summarizes the main data, including ethnicity, description of mutations, matrilineal or patrilineal transmission of variants, cancer type and age of onset, for a total of 56 cases (34 probands and 22 relatives), with the addition of our current report.\n\n    The types of mutations and combinations of mutations on BRCA1 and BRCA2 did not occur in any of the probands and/or families studied. In 18 cases out of 34, the paternal and maternal transmission is not determined. Analysis of data, documented with molecular analysis, shows that in 8 cases one of the parents transmitted both variants, in 3 cases both parents had a mutation, and in 2 cases a single variant was transmitted by one parent while the other one was wild-type. Finally, in 2 cases one of the mutations had been identified in one of the parents while the other had not been analyzed. The phenotypic expression in double heterozygosity varied from unilateral breast cancer at the age of 26, to asymptomatic at the age of 72. Forty-two cases (75%) had a primary cancer: 35 breast, 2 ovary, 2 prostate, and 1 case for cervix, caecum and stomach, respectively. Fourteen subjects (25.0%) were asymptomatic (ranging from 30 to 72 years of age), 8 of whom (14.2%) were older than 40. A secondary neoplasia was detected in 14 out of 42 patients.\n\n    Finally, the median age at diagnosis for breast cancer was 38 years (range 26 to 76), while the median age at diagnosis calculated for all primary cancers was 40 (range 26 to 76). In very few cases was it possible to compare the age at the onset of the first cancer of subjects carrying the double mutations, with their single heterozygous relatives. In particular, Heidemann et al., described six German non-Jewish subjects with double mutation in whom the onset of the first breast cancer was at 39.6 years mean age, compared to their single heterozygous female relative with a mean age of 52.4 years. Expanding the analysis to the available literature on Caucasian double heterozygote (DH) patients, the authors confirmed the occurrence of the first cancer at a mean age of 41.4 years in patients with double mutation in contrast to 53.0 years in the relatives carrying a single BRCA mutation. The 95% confidence intervals between double heterozygotes and their single heterozygous relatives did not overlap.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    BRCA1 c.1687C>T (p.Gln563Ter/Q563X, previously named 1806C>T) variant is a well-known and fully characterized mutation which is particularly common in European populations. In Austria and Slovenia, for example, it recurs approximately in 15% and 26% respectively of all BRCA1 pathogenic variants, and haplotype analysis suggests a potential Austrian origin. This mutation, related to lung, gastric and bilateral breast cancers, was found with remarkable frequency in Spain and with a strong founder effect in hereditary ovarian/breast cancer Polish patients. In 2003, Johannsson O.T. et al., linearized a breast lymph node metastasis from a 53-year-old Swedish woman carrying the Q563X mutation. The histological analysis revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A complete expression dataset is on the website Gene Expression Omnibus .\n\n    The BRCA2 c.9976A>T (p.Lys3326*) variant was identified for the first time in 1996 during a mutational screening program completed on families with recurrent breast cancer in Nebraska. The study was carried out on 513 breast cancer patients and concluded that this mutation does not confer a highly penetrant susceptibility for inherited breast cancer. Despite a number of observations supporting the theory of a close association between this variant and breast, pancreas, esophageal and squamous-cell lung cancers, parallel equally detailed studies supported the non-pathogenicity of this variant. In particular, in a study of 95 families carrying the mutation, Higgs et al., showed that the previously reported associations with increased cancer risk are in many cases due to the concomitant presence of a pathogenic frameshift BRCA2 mutation c.6275_6276delTT (Leu2092ProfsTer7) as well as to the non-pathogenic BRCA2 c.9257-16T>C (IVS24-17T>C) that are often found in linkage disequilibrium with p.Lys3326*. In 2015 Thompson et al., on the basis of a study performed on 2634 Australian breast and/or ovarian cancer patients, provided evidence on the association with a low to moderate increase of breast cancer risk. More recently, a molecular screening of Swedish cutaneous malignant melanoma patients reported the presence of the p.Lys3326* mutation in 12 out of 452 unrelated patients, 8 of them with obvious familial transmission, and 4 with sporadic melanoma. Finally, a further study performed on a Chinese population of 6064 patients and 8661 controls showed that BRCA2 p.Lys3326* plays an important role in the genetic susceptibility to urinary tract cancers since it is apparently associated with increased risk of bladder cancer.\n\n    More recently, a massive epidemiological study evaluated the association between this BRCA2 variant and the risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. In this regard, researchers at the Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study (COGS), analyzed data from 76,637 breast/prostate patients, including 7183 BRCA1 and 5101 BRCA2 mutation carriers in comparison with 83,796 control subjects. The study confirmed the association of the BRCA2 K3326X variant with an increased risk of developing triple-negative breast and serous ovarian cancers irrespective of additional BRCA2 pathogenic variants, while no association with prostate cancer risk was found. Finally, in a study of 48 women with ovarian cancer and high risk of genetic inheritance but negative for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, Stafford et al., observed two patients carrying the K3326X variant, one with a concomitant RAD51D nonsense mutation and the other with an ATM frameshift mutation, having both developed breast and ovarian cancer. Therefore, the authors argued that this variant is of minimal risk when inherited alone, but may acquire the function of strong modifier of penetrance when concomitant with a second BRCA pathogenic mutation.\n\n    In relation to the effect on cellular and biochemical properties of this variant in cancer cell lines, several complete studies have already been reported. In some cases the results show that the K3326X variants had no effect on the BRCA2 function and indicate it as \"neutral variant\". However, a study performed in mouse cells deleted for the COOH terminus of BRCA2 (amino acids 3140-3328) and irradiated with gamma-radiation shows that the deletion of BRCA2 could accelerate cell proliferation and stimulate cancer by defective MmRadSl-mediated DNA repair.\n\n    However, to date in the Breast Cancer Information Core database , the K3326X variant, which is found with a frequency of about 1% in the population, is still clinically classified in the \"pending\" category.\n\n    In our study, we have identified double heterozygosity in the proband and in her asymptomatic daughter. The asymptomatic mother of the proband has transmitted only the BRCA1 mutation and, since the father's sampling was not available, we cannot argue whether or not the BRCA2 K3326X was due to a \"de novo\" variant, or to a patrilineal transmission. Unfortunately, all relatives of the father died without leaving children. The proband developed the first breast cancer at the age of 40, while the sister, with only the BRCA1 mutation, had an age of diagnosis of 56 years. Furthermore, the maternal aunt and the maternal grandmother, both obligate carriers for the BRCA1 variant, developed an ovarian cancer at the age of 59 and a breast cancer at 70, respectively.\n\n    From the overall examination of the mutational state and the pedigree, we have drawn some considerations. First, we observed that the proband and her sister, both suffering from ductal breast carcinoma, had a very different age of onset with a marked difference of about 16 years. Neither had preventive mastectomy or oophorectomy and the two patients lived in the same household with the same eating habits, environmental and lifestyle factors. The observation of all other relatives only carrying BRCA1 mutations leads us to consider that the pathogenic variant p.Gln563Ter, despite bearing a premature stop codon at exon 10 in the BRCA1 gene, is present with a low penetrance in this family. A paradigmatic example is offered by the mother of the two sisters (II9), a carrier of the mutation but not affected by any neoplasia despite her age of 90 years, and the maternal aunt (II10), an obligate carrier and with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer at 59 years of age. These differences cannot only be explained by anticipation, since the proband's cousins, III6, III7 and III8, are also carriers of the BRCA1 mutation but not affected by neoplasia at 48, 70 and 64 years, respectively (mean age 60.6 years).\n\n    We focused on the cancer's earliest age of onset in the subject with double heterozygosity and a careful examination of literature revealed that this is in agreement with previous findings and was not unexpected in patients carrying double heterozygosity for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Similarly, a few published works also report earlier age of breast cancer onset in women with a double mutation for both BRCA genes while, to our knowledge, there are no similar data concerning a double mutation involving the K3326X BRCA2 variant.\n\n    The first observations of a double mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was found in 1997 in a casistica of patients of Ashkenazi origin affected by breast and ovarian cancer carrying both the 185delAG in the BRCA1 and the 6174delT BRCA2 gene mutations. In this population, three founder mutations, BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC and BRCA2 6174delT, are particularly common with an approximate frequency of 1%, 0.1%, and 1.4%, respectively. Therefore, on the basis of predictive statistical calculations, the population carrier frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the Ashkenazi population should be approximately 3%, with a presumable occurrence of double heterozygosity of 1 in 1800 individuals. In a BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutational study performed on 10,000 subjects, including 3022 Ashkenazi, Frank et al., identified double mutations exclusively in the Ashkenazi population with a frequency of 11 of the 3022 tested individuals (0.36%), and 11 on 617 positive cases (1.8%). In a review of the literature on 34 Ashkenazi ancestry patients with double heterozygosis for BRCA1 and BRCA2, Leegte et al., described no genotype-phenotype correlation between the double mutational status and the age of onset, the cumulative lifetime risks and the presence of multiple primary tumors. In an additional Ashkenazi cohort of 1191 BRCA mutations, with carriers from 567 families, Lavie et al., identified 22 subjects (1.84%) from 17 families (2.9%) bearing the double BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation. However, all 22 subjects were females, 7 of whom had breast cancer (46%) and 1 had ovarian cancer (6.6%). The authors noted a younger age at the occurrence of cancer in patients carrying the double mutation (44.6 +- 13 years) with respect to patients with a single mutation (48.1 +- 13 years), deducing from the absence of other clinical differences among the two groups of patients that none of them would have benefited from dedicated diagnostic or therapeutic measures.\n\n    Conversely, in the non-Ashkenazi population the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers is approximately 0.24% and double heterozygosity is a rare phenomenon recurring in approximately 1 in 190,000 subjects. However, data relative to carriers of the double mutation are available only in a very limited number of studies that usually describe only single case reports.\n\n    As accurately described in the results section, after a careful examination of the literature we have identified 19 articles describing 33 families with 54 subjects carrying a double BRCA mutation.\n\n    The examination of these data therefore suggests that the presence of the second K3326X variant in our case induces a phenotype characterized by early onset of the neoplasia in a manner similar to the other cases of double heterozygosity previously described. However, we must also keep in mind data from recent studies describing the mild association with the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers and assigning to this variant the role of a strong modifier of penetrance. These findings should be considered during the counseling of carriers of a pathogenic mutation and a concomitant K3326X variant for a potentially earlier age of onset of the first cancer, as suggested also in other studies.\n\n    Finally, we would like to focus the melanoma found in our patient, in which next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected a somatic BRCA2 variant c.4297G>A (p.Gly1433Arg) reported as pathogenic by the COSMIC database. As mentioned above, a recent study showed a significant association between the K3326X variant allele and melanoma. Intriguingly, this missense mutation identified in our work has been previously reported as a somatic mutation in genetic screening performed on samples from patients affected by metastatic melanoma. To date, the association between mutations of the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes and the onset of melanoma is still being studied with the presence in literature of controversial or inconclusive evidence. However, as suggested by other authors, patient carriers of a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations should be informed about the risk of skin cancer and be subjected to a periodic dermatological control.\n\n    We hope that our observations may add knowledge to this topic and contribute to further studies needed to verify these findings.",

        "Title": "    Germline variation in BRCA1/2 is highly ethnic-specific: Evidence from over 30,000 Chinese hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients",
        "Abstract": "    BRCA1 and BRCA2 play essential roles in maintaining the genome stability. Pathogenic germline mutations in these two genes disrupt their function, lead to genome instability and increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA mutations have been extensively screened in Caucasian populations, and the resulting information are used globally as the standard reference in clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention of BRCA-related cancers. Recent studies suggest that BRCA mutations can be ethnic-specific, raising the question whether a Caucasian-based BRCA mutation information can be used as a universal standard worldwide, or whether an ethnicity-based BRCA mutation information system need to be developed for the corresponding ethnic populations. In this study, we used Chinese population as a model to test ethnicity-specific BRCA mutations considering that China has one of the latest numbers of breast cancer patients therefore BRCA mutation carriers. Through comprehensive data mining, standardization and annotation, we collected 1,088 distinct BRCA variants derived from over 30,000 Chinese individuals, one of the largest BRCA data set from a non-Caucasian population covering nearly all known BRCA variants in the Chinese population (https://dbBRCA-Chinese.fhs.umac.mo). Using this data, we performed multi-layered analyses to determine the similarities and differences of BRCA variation between Chinese and non-Chinese ethnic populations. The results show the substantial differences of BRCA data between Chinese and non-Chinese ethnicities. Our study indicates that the current Caucasian population-based BRCA data is not adequate to represent the BRCA status in non-Caucasian populations. Therefore, ethnic-based BRCA standards need to be established to serve for the non-Caucasian populations.\n\n    What's new?\n\n    Currently, Caucasian population-based BRCA mutation data are used worldwide as the standard reference for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of BRCA-associated cancers. Recent studies however suggest that BRCA variation can be ethnic specific. Here, the authors carried out a comprehensive comparison of BRCA mutation data between the Chinese and worldwide non-Chinese populations and found substantial differences. The study suggests that BRCA mutations are highly ethnic specific and that the current Caucasian population-based BRCA data is not adequate to represent the BRCA status in non-Caucasian populations. Developing new standard references using ethnic-based BRCA mutation data is needed to better serve non-Caucasian ethnic populations.",
        "Introduction": "    Approximately 10-15% of breast cancer cases are caused by hereditary genetic mutations.1 The most penetrating mutations are those in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) genes,2, 3 which are essential for maintaining the genome stability. Women carrying pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 have a 72% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, while those with BRCA2 mutations have a 69% risk.4 Mutations in BRCA also increase the risk for ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Identification of BRCA mutation carriers before the development of cancer is crucial in order to protect them from developing cancer by taking preventive measures of early cancer surveillance, chemoprevention and preventive surgery.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Extensive efforts have identified a large number of BRCA mutations, mainly in the Caucasian populations of Europe and North America. BRCA databases with well-documented, annotated and freely accessible BRCA information have been developed and used worldwide as the references for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of BRCA associated cancers.\n\n    Studies have revealed that human BRCA1 and BRCA2 are rapidly evolving under positive selection to effectively protect genome stability.10, 11 Recent studies have further suggested that the variation in human BRCA could be ethnic-specific in different ethnic populations. For example, BRCA variants within Latin American populations are highly heterogeneous,12 and BRCA variants in Asian populations differ substantially from those in other populations.13 Understanding the ethnic-specificity of BRCA variation is important, as it can provide a precise genetic basis to study the relationship between human evolution and diseases. Furthermore, it will determine whether the Caucasian-based BRCA data is adequate to serve as a universal reference to determine BRCA status in non-Caucasian populations around the world, or whether the ethnicity-based BRCA mutation data should be developed instead. However, the answer remains elusive owing to the lack of BRCA data from most of the non-Caucasian populations.12, 13, 14, 15 For example, in the recently completed CIMBA study that collected BRCA data from 49 countries across six continents, the data available from any single, non-Caucasian ethnic populations remain very limited.15 To fully prove the existence of ethnic-specific BRCA mutations, a comprehensive data from particular ethnic populations will be required.\n\n    The Chinese population is the largest one in the world.16 Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Chinese women, with 260,000 new breast cancer cases diagnosed and 70,000 mortalities annually.17 With nearly two decades of BRCA studies in China, in particular in the recent years owing largely to the adoption of next-generation sequencing technologies, BRCA data exclusively derived from the Chinese population are increasingly reported.17, 18, 19 Thus, the Chinese population can serve as an ideal model to test the presence of ethnic-specific BRCA mutations. Through a comprehensive data mining, standardization and annotation, we collected nearly all BRCA variant data currently available for the Chinese population and developed the data into a public database dbBRCA-Chinese (https://dbBRCA-Chinese.fhs.umac.mo). Using this rich data set, we studied the similarities and differences in BRCA variation between Chinese and non-Chinese populations. The data from our study provides a convincing evidence for the existence of ethnic-specific BRCA mutation. Here, we report detailed information from the study.",
        "Methods": "    We searched for resources reporting BRCA variation data from individuals of Chinese ethnicity, including publications in PubMed, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database (http://oversea.cnki.net/kns55/default.aspx) and WanFang (http://www.wanfangdata.com/COJ/intr.asp#China Online), as well as Chinese-derived BRCA variants in existing BRCA databases.19 For the collected BRCA variants, we performed extensive standardization and reannotation, following HGVS20 and ACMG guidelines.21 The reference sequences used for BRCA1 analysis were: cDNA NM_007294.3, protein NP_009225.1, genome hg19, BIC cDNA: U14680.1 and BIC protein: AAA73985.1; those used for BRCA2 were: cDNA NM_000059.3, protein NP_000050.2, genome hg19, BIC cDNA: U43746.1 and BIC protein: AAB07223.1, respectively22 (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1070). The transcript-oriented position of each variant was converted to its respective genome position in hg19 using the Position Converter tool in Mutalyzer,23 and the consistency with HGVS nomenclature was confirmed using the Name Checker DNA tool.24 The variants were annotated using ANNOVAR with eight reference databases namely: RefGene, dbSNP (version 150), 1000genome, ESP6500, ExAC, ClinVar, InterVar and DBNSFP.24 Following BRCA databases were used for the comparative analysis: BIC 25 (https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/, accessed February 20, 2018), ClinVar26(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/, accessed February 20, 2018), BRCA Exchange (http://brcaexchange.org, accessed February 20, 2018), ENIGMA27 (downloaded from BED database, http://brcaexchange.org, accessed February 20, 2018), BMD (http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/BRCA/Home/BRCA1_landing.php,http://www.arup.utah.edu/database/BRCA/Home/BRCA2_landing.php)(https://www.aruplab.com/topics/breast-cancer/brcadatabase, accessed February 20, 2018), LOVD28 (http://www.lovd.nl/3.0/home, accessed February 20, 2018) and CIMBA.15 The Chinese variants present in these databases were classified as known variants; those absent were classified as novel variants and deposited in ClinVar database29 (accession number nstd165). Five categories based on ACMG guidelines were used: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign for the variant classification of known variants using ClinVar database.30, 36 For those variants not matched with the variant list using the above-mentioned resources, their classifications were predicted from InterVar database using ANNOVAR annotation tool.30 For these variants not being able to classified, they were included as \"Unclassified\" group. BRCA variants in Latin population were extracted from Villarreal-Garza et al.,12 BRCA variants in Asian populations were extracted from,13 and BRCA variants in the Indian population were extracted from,13, 31 respectively.\n\n    Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the differences between the Chinese and non-Chinese variant data. p < 0.05 was considered as significant difference.",
        "Results": "    The majority of Chinese BRCA variation data was gathered from mainland China (90.2%), and the remainder were from Hong Kong (6.4%), Taiwan (1.6%), Singapore (0.9) and Malaysia (0.4%) (Table S1A, S1B, Supporting Information). In total, 31,689 cases with Chinese ethnicity were tested for BRCA mutations and their results were reported between 1999 and 2017; of these, 69.3% were reported between 2016 and 2017. Nearly all BRCA variants were from breast and/or ovarian cancer patients under different clinical criteria, except for four variants that were derived from 1,043 healthy control individuals.32\n\n    We collected and summarized the clinical information reported from each of the reference studies (Fig. S1 and Table S2, Supporting Information). The data showed several unique features as follows: 1). BMI is considered as one of the risk factors for breast cancer. However, according to our data, 83.7% of Chinese patients were within the normal range of 18.5-22.9 BMI and 10.5% were seen to have even lower than 18.5 BMI, indicating that obesity had no significant role in increasing risk for breast and ovarian cancer in these Chinese patients; 2). Family history is considered as a high-risk factor for hereditary breast cancer. However, 72.3% of patients from our study did not report any family history of cancer, suggesting that family history was not an essential factor in this disease cohort; 3). Stage II breast cancer cases accounted for 66.2% whereas stage I cases only 6.3%, indicating the lack of earlier diagnosis.\n\n    A total of 3,791 BRCA mutation carriers were identified (12%, 2,123 BRCA1 and 1,688 BRCA2), of which 1,978 carriers (52.2%, 990 BRCA1 and 988 BRCA2) were within the clinically reported mutation categories of pathogenic or likely pathogenic. By standardizing and re-annotating all the variants following Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS)-recommended nomenclature, we identified a total of 1,088 distinct BRCA variants (557 in BRCA1 and 531 in BRCA2) of which 519 (47.7%, 278 in BRCA1 and 241 in BRCA2) were recurrent, and 50% were either detected or validated by Sanger sequencing (Tables S4-S5, Supporting Information). Except the 26 variants specifically from Uygur ethnic population, all variants were from Han Chinese population. We developed the dbBRCA-Chinese database as an open source to host the entire set of BRCA variants and their annotation information (https://dbBRCA-Chinese.fhs.umac.mo).\n\n    The 1,088 BRCA variants were distributed with different frequencies among the 3,791 BRCA variant carriers. The age distribution data show that 52.3% of the cancer developed at early age (<40 years) in these BRCA variant carriers (Table S1C, Supporting Information). About half of the variants were detected only once in single individuals (46.5% in BRCA1, 54.6% in BRCA2), and the rest variants were distributed between 2 to 100 individuals with increased frequencies (Table S1D, Supporting Information).\n\n    We classified the BRCA variants into five classes:pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign:following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) standards and guidelines. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, which are clinically reportable, accounted for 46% of BRCA1 variants and 52% of BRCA2 variants. Such higher rates do not necessarily imply high BRCA variation rate in Chinese breast and ovarian cancer patient population but reflect the fact that the cancer patients included in many of the studies were selected from high-risk patients of strong family history or early age of cancer development. Importantly, 13% and 8% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were classified as of uncertain significance, and 30% of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants remained as unclassified variants (Fig. 1 a). This fact indicates that much effort needs to be made in order to determine the function of these BRCA variants existing in Chinese population.\n\n    We compiled ethnic origins of currently existing BRCA variation data to know the status of BRCA study across ethnic human populations. By combining the BRCA variants from the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, BRCA Exchange Database (BED), BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Database (BMD), Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) and ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles), we generated a single BRCA variation data set containing 6,343 distinct BRCA1 and 8,884 distinct BRCA2 variants (S6A). Classification of the ethnic origins of these variants showed that 62% were from Caucasian populations and 15% from the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The remaining 23% were originated from non-Chinese Asian (13%), Latino (5%), African (3%), and Chinese (2%) populations (Fig. 1 b and Tables S6B, S6C, Supporting Information). Of the 5,925 CIMBA BRCA variants data with defined ethnicities, 80.2% were from Caucasian, 2.4% from Ashkenazi Jews, 10.8% from Asian, 3.8% from Hispanic and 2.8% from African American.15 The analysis shows that the current BRCA variant data contains very limited information from non-Caucasian populations.\n\n    We performed the multi-layer analyses to investigate the similarities and differences in BRCA variation between Chinese and non-Chinese populations.\n\n    GnomAD: It contains extensive normal population variation data collected from human population by the largest exome and whole-genome sequencing projects. The comparison aimed to determine the similarities and differences of the normal BRCA variants present between Chinese and non-Chinese populations;\n\n    BIC, BED, BMD, ClinVar, ENIGMA and LOVD: These are the major BRCA databases, with the data mostly derived from Caucasians as indicated by our analysis (Fig. 1 b). Comparison with these databases aimed to determine the similarities and differences of BRCA mutation between Chinese and Caucasian (mostly) populations;\n\n    CIMBA data: It contains BRCA data collected from 49 countries across six continents. The comparison aimed to determine the similarities and differences between Chinese and worldwide non-Chinese populations including more non-Caucasian data;\n\n    Latin America and the Caribbean data: The data were from Latin American population of Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, Venezuela and the Hispanic population in the United States.12 The comparison aimed to determine the similarities and differences between Chinese and Latin America populations;\n\n    Non-Chinese Asian populations: BRCA data are available from Bangladeshi, Filipino, Iranian, Israeli, Japanese, Korean, Lebanese, Malay, Oman, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Thai and Turkish populations.13 These populations were genetically and geographically closer to the Chinese population than other non-Chinese populations. The comparison aimed to determine the similarities and differences between Chinese and the non-Chinese Asian populations;\n\n    Indian population: India has the 2nd largest population in the world, with highly diversified genetic background. Several large-scale BRCA studies were reported recently with substantial BRCA data collected from the Indian patients.13, 31 The comparison aimed to determine the similarities and differences between Chinese and Indian populations, the two largest populations in the world.\n\n    In order to determine the similarities and differences of BRCA variation between Chinese and non-Chinese populations, we made a comprehensive comparison between Chinese and any available non-Chinese BRCA data as represented below. The rationale for comparing with each database are:\n\n    Matching the Chinese BRCA data with those in GnomAD from the largest exome and whole-genome sequence data collection33 showed that only 76 of the 557 (13.6%) Chinese BRCA1 had matches in 2,476 (3%) BRCA1 variants in GnomAD and 97 of the 531 (18.2%) Chinese BRCA2 had matches in 3,674 variants (2.6%) in GnomAD. The results indicate that the vast majority of the Chinese BRCA variants were not present in the population data provided by current exome and whole-genome sequencing studies (Table 1A and Table S7A, Supporting Information). For those with the matches, their abundance as judged by the East Asia population frequencies were mostly at lower levels [62/76 (81.5%) BRCA1 variants and 73/97 (72.3%) BRCA2 variants <0.001], highlighting their pathogenic potential.\n\n    Comparing the Chinese BRCA data with non-Chinese BRCA data in these major BRCA databases shows that 38% of BRCA variants were present only in the Chinese population [186 (33.4%) of 557 BRCA1 variants and 226 (42.6%) of 531 BRCA2 variants] (Fig. 1 c, Table 1B). Of all databases used for the comparison, the ClinVar database had the highest matching rates of 60.1% and 53.4% in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively due to its large data collection.\n\n    Comparing the Chinese BRCA data with the recent CIMBA data enriching non-Caucasian data shows that 17.6% of the 1,088 Chinese BRCA variants had matches [BRCA1: 106/557 (19%) and BRCA2: 86/531 (16.2%). There are 15 Chinese BRCA1 variants and 16 Chinese BRCA2 variants included in both our Chinese data and the CIMBA data. These shared Chinese variants were removed in order to know the similarity and differences between Chinese and non-Chinese populations included in the CIMBA data. After the removal, the overall matched rate decreased to 14.9% [BRCA1: 91/557 (16.3%) and BRCA2: 71/531 (13.4%)] (Table 1C and Table S7B, Supporting Information).\n\n    Comparing the Chinese BRCA data with those from Latin America and the Caribbean found that 97.8% of total variants [544 (97.7%) BRCA1 variants and 520 (97.9%) BRCA2] were specific only to the Chinese population (Table 1D and Table S7C, Supporting Information).\n\n    Comparing the Chinese BRCA data with those in non-Chinese Asian populations found that 78.6% of total variants [436 (78.2%) of BRCA1 and 420 (79.2%) of BRCA2] were present only in the Chinese population (Table 1E and Table S7D, Supporting Information).\n\n    Comparison shows that only 23 (4.1%) BRCA1 and two (0.4%) BRCA2 variants were shared between the Chinese and Indian populations (Table 1F and Table S7E, Supporting Information).\n\n    Through these extensive comparisons, we were able to determine that around 40% of the BRCA data in Chinese was explicit and absent from the current BRCA data derived from non-Chinese population.\n\n    We compared the variant distribution across BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons between Chinese and non-Chinese populations using the data from BIC database as a testing model. For both BRCA1 and BRCA2, the distribution of variants differed significantly in multiple exons between the two data sets (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). For BRCA1, the proportions of variants in exons 2, 11D, 16, 20 and 24 were higher in the BIC data than in the Chinese data, whereas the proportions in exons 11B and 11C in the Chinese data were significantly higher than in the BIC data; in BRCA2, the proportions in exons 11A, 25 and 27 were higher in the BIC data than in the Chinese data, whereas the proportions in exons 2, 11F, 14, 21 and 22 were higher in the Chinese data than in the BIC data, respectively. The results show the presence of differences of exon distribution between Chinese and non-Chinese BRCA variants.\n\n    We compared single-base changes and other variant types between Chinese and BIC data. The results show the significant differences present in multiple types of base changes between the two data sets, including G > A, C > T and delT in BRCA1, and A > C, delA, delG and delC in BRCA2. In BRCA1, delT had higher frequency in the Chinese population than in the BIC data (6.8% versus 3.5%, p < 0.0034); in BRCA2, delA, delG and delC were more frequent in the Chinese data than in the BIC data (11.5% versus 4.1%, 6.7% versus 1.6% and 5.1% versus 2.4%, respectively, p < 0.000, 0.000, 0.004, accordingly) (Table 2A). Significant differences were also present in the missense, nonsense, stop gain, splice variants and intronic variant types in both BRCA1 and BRCA2, and in frameshifts in BRCA2 (Table 2B).\n\n    We compared the clinical categories: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign between Chinese BRCA data and BIC data. The results showed significant differences in multiple categories between the two data sets. For example, 12.7% of BRCA1 variants in Chinese were variants of uncertain significance, which was much higher than the value of 0.57% in the BIC data (p < 0.0000); the proportion of BRCA2 pathogenic variants in the Chinese population was also significantly higher than that in the BIC data (p < 0.0005), and the proportions of unclassified variants in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 were much higher in the BIC data than in the Chinese variants (Table 3).\n\n    Firstly, we checked if the Chinese variant data contained any BRCA founder mutations known in other populations, including BRCA1 c.66_67delAG (185delAG), c.5263_5264insC (5382insC), and BRCA2 c.5946delT (6174delT) in Ashkenazi Jews;34 BRCA1 c.-58C > G (C61G), c.4153delA (c.4035delA), and c.5263_5264insC (5382insC) in Poles;35 BRCA1 c.303 T > G, c.1623dupG, c.4122_4123delTG and c.5324 T > G in Africans;14 BRCA1 ex9-12del in Mexicans,36 BRCA1 390C > A in Koreans and Japanese; and BRCA1 c.470_471delCT, BRCA2 c.7480C > T in Koreans.37 We observed that many of these founder mutations were either absent or present at low prevalence, hence they could not be considered as founder mutations in the Chinese population. Secondly, we searched for potential BRCA founder mutation candidates in the Chinese population by referring to 1) the abundance as calculated by the total number of variant carriers divided by the total number of individuals tested although haplotype data will be required to finally determine the true founder mutations; and 2) additional criteria for removing the variants unlikely to be founder mutations in order to focus on the variants as potential candidates: more than 100 tested individuals (a founder mutation should have a reasonable prevalence in a given population. 100 was set as a minimal cut-off for the population size); at least two detected variant carriers (as a founder mutation, it cannot be only present in a single individual. Therefore, 2 cases were set as the minimal number of mutation carriers. In this way, all variants detected only in single individuals will be eliminated); carrier frequency > 1% (a precondition for founder mutation as pathogenic one is its lower population frequency in population. We set 1% of mutation carrier as the minimal cut-off to eliminate these with high population frequency, which are mostly normal polymorphism); and variants in the categories of pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, or unclassified (Founder mutations must be pathogenic. Restricted the candidates to these classes will narrow down the founder mutation candidates by eliminating the benign and likely benign variants as they do not increase cancer risk). Using these conditions, we tested whether the data could support the Chinese BRCA founder mutations proposed by previous studies including BRCA1 c.981_982delAT (1100delAT),38 BRCA1 1081delT(1081delG),39 BRCA1c.5154G > A and BRCA1c.5468-1del8;40 and BRCA2 c.3109C > T, BRCA2 c.7436_7805del370 and BRCA2c.9097_9098insA.38 With an exception for BRCA1c.5154G > A variant, our data do not support the above-mentioned variants as the founder mutations. Next, we searched for high-frequency variants meeting the same criteria as above and identified a total of 16 pathogenic, two likely pathogenic, 22 unclassified variants, and five of uncertain significance in BRCA1; and ten pathogenic, one likely pathogenic, and 11 unclassified variants in BRCA2 (Table 4 and Table S8, Supporting Information), respectively. The higher prevalence and clinical pathogenicity of these variants supported them as potential candidates for BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations in the Chinese population. Despite of the higher prevalence, the unclassified variants or those of uncertain significance cannot be regarded as potential founder mutations unless their pathogenicity is determined.\n\n    BRCA1 c.5154G > A. This variant had the highest prevalence of 5.6% (15 out of 266 detected by five studies). It is a stop-gain pathogenic mutation, present in the BIC, BMD, LOVD, ClinVar, BED databases and was reported as a Chinese founder mutation by a previous study (31).\n\n    BRCA1 c.4258C > T. This variant had a prevalence of 2.5% (3 out of 118), is pathogenic, and is present in the BIC, BMD, LOVD, ClinVar and BED databases.\n\n    BRCA1 c.3296delC. This variant had a prevalence of 2.4% (3 out of 124), is pathogenic, and is present in the BIC, BMD, ClinVar, BED and LOVD databases.\n\n    BRCA1 c.5533_5540delATTGGGCA/delTACCAGTG. This variant had a prevalence of 2.5% (3 out of 125), is pathogenic, and is absent from other BRCA databases.\n\n    BRCA2 c.7655_7658delTTAA. This variant had a prevalence of 3.7% (4 out of 107, reported by four studies), is a pathogenic frameshift deletion and is present in the BIC, ClinVar and BED databases.\n\n    BRCA2 c.2636_2637delCT. This variant had a prevalence of 2.2% (4 out of 180), is pathogenic, and is present in the BIC, BMD, ClinVar and BED databases.\n\n    BRCA2 c.2339C > G. This variant had a prevalence of 2% (2 out of 99), is pathogenic, and is present in the BMD, ClinVar, BED and LOVD databases.\n\n    The most significant variants found were the following:\n\n    Although these high-frequent BRCA mutations suggests the presence of certain potential founder mutations in Chinese population, it is also obvious from the data that there are unlikely to be high-prevalence founder mutations in the Chinese population as these in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. However, the Chinese population is composed of highly heterogeneous ethnic groups with different genetic features, and even the dominant Han ethnic group is not homogeneous. Therefore, there remains a possibility for the presence of certain high-prevalence founder mutations in certain specific ethnic groups, and in certain populations located at specific geographical locations.\n\n    It is of interest to know whether BRCA ethnic-specificity exists within the Chinese population, given the fact that it has 56 ethnic groups with divergent genetic backgrounds.41 We tested this possibility by using Uygur group as a model. Uygur group is the largest minority group in Xinjiang, northwestern China, with its unique genetic features.41 A series of BRCA studies have been carried out in Uygur group, with the identification of 70 BRCA variants. Of these, 20 BRCA1 variants and 6 BRCA2 variant were present only in the Uygur group. Of the 26 Uygur-specific BRCA1 variants, one was likely pathogenic, one was uncertain significance, one was likely benign, and 23 remain unclassified (Table S9, Supporting Information). The results indicate the presence of Uygur-specific BRCA variants within the Chinese population.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    By using the rich Chinese BRCA variation data as a representative of non-Caucasian populations, our study provides solid evidence to conclude the presence of ethnic-specific BRCA mutation. This likely reflects the human evolutionary history of genetic diversity and environmental adaptation.11 The variants shared between different ethnic populations were likely originated before their diversification, whereas the ethnic-specific variants were likely generated after their diversification. Since BRCA reference data plays key roles in identifying the mutation carriers, lack of ethnic-specific data in the present references implies that they have inadequate power in locating the mutation carriers with non-Caucasian ethnic background. This is vividly exemplified by the presence of only 16 BRCA variants derived from mainland Chinese among the 3,791 BRCA variants in the BIC database.19 In order to identify the mutation carriers with various ethnic background, ethnic-specific BRCA references need to be developed. Combined usage of both ethnic-specific and existing BRCA reference databases should provide comprehensive identification of BRCA mutation carriers in different ethnic populations, a critical step towards precision medicine. Developing ethnic-specific BRCA references will certainly be a challenge both scientifically and financially, but this task needs to be completed sooner or later for the sake of prevention of BRCA-related cancers in the non-Caucasian populations. The issue of ethnic-specific germline mutation could also exist in other cancer predisposition genes. Experiences from developing ethnic-specific BRCA references should provide a valuable example to address the same issue in these genes.",

        "Title": "    Mutation analysis of BRCA1/2 mutations with special reference to polymorphic SNPs in Indian breast cancer patients",
        "Abstract": "    Germline mutations BRCA1 and BRCA2 contribute almost equally in the causation of breast cancer (BC). The type of mutations in the Indian population that cause this condition is largely unknown.\n\n    In this cohort, 79 randomized BC patients were screened for various types of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations including frameshift, nonsense, missense, in-frame and splice site types.\n\n    The purified extracted DNA of each referral patient was subjected to Sanger gene sequencing using Codon Code Analyzer and Mutation Surveyor and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods with Ion torrent software, after appropriate care.\n\n    The data revealed that 35 cases were positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 (35/79: 44.3%). BRCA2 mutations were higher (52.4%) than BRCA1 mutations (47.6%). Five novel mutations detected in this study were p.pro163 frameshift, p.asn997 frameshift, p.ser148 frameshift and two splice site single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, four nonsense and one in-frame deletion were identified, which all seemed to be pathogenic. Polymorphic SNPs contributed the highest percentage of mutations (72/82: 87.8%) and contributed to pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign, benign and variant of unknown significance (VUS). Young age groups (20-60 years) had a high frequency of germline mutations (62/82;75.6%) in the Indian population.\n\n    This study suggested that polymorphic SNPs contributed a high percentage of mutations along with five novel types. Younger age groups are prone to having BC with a higher mutational rate. Furthermore, the SNPs detected in exons 10, 11 and 16 of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were higher than those in other exons 2, 3 and 9 polymorphic sites in two germline genes. These may be contributory for BC although missense types are known to be susceptible for cancer depending on the type of amino acid replaced in the protein and associated with pathologic events. Accordingly, appropriate counseling and treatment may be suggested.",
        "Introduction": "    The continuing global demographic and epidemiologic transitions signal an ever-increasing cancer burden over the next decades, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LIMC), with over 20 million new cancer cases expected annually as early as 2025. Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common and dreadful diseases affecting Indian women. It is actually considered the main type of cancer among new cases in India. It has been divided into two subtypes, early-onset and late-onset, based on age-specific cancers. Mutation in BRCA1 is thought to account for about 45% of families, whose locus is to chromosome 17p. The second one is mapped to chromosome 13q and responsible for the early onset of BC. About 200 mutations in both genes have been reported and are widely scattered across them. Most mutations of these genes affect the structure and function of the gene, altering protein synthesis and function (34% BRCA1 and 38% BRCA2 mutations), and others are missense types that alter amino acids but do not truncate the protein. Hence, the mutation of BRCA1/2 results in the gene's function silencing or over-activation.\n\n    According to the GLOBOCAN project set up by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 145,000 new cases were diagnosed and 70,000 deaths occurred in India in 2012. Considering the size of the population, the incidence of BC in India appears to be lower, when compared to developed countries such as the USA (233,000 cases) and the European union (362,000 cases). But the ratio of death in India was much higher (48.3%) in comparison with the USA (18.9%) and the European union (25.4%). Thus, the frequency of BC patients seems to be lower than in the developing countries, but mortality is higher in our country attributable to lifestyle changes, delay in introduction of cancer screening centers and limited medical awareness including treatment.\n\n    The relatively high death rate from BC in the Indian health care system thus demonstrates a need for a cost-effective method of early detection, screening and treatment. However, early detection of hereditary BC is essential to reduce this type of cancer in a developing country like India. Hence, this study was undertaken to detect the germline mutations using molecular diagnostic methods and their correlation with pathogenic events for its better treatment in addition to other factors, such as age, in our cohort. Emphasis is also paid to the involvement of missense mutations occurring in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes of BC patients in the Indian population.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 79 referral, diagnosed, pre- and post-menopausal BC cases from India were selected. EDTA blood samples and a request for biological specimens were collected from the respondents after completion of consent forms and counseling. The patients provided test reports which were used for our current research. This work was approved by Gujarat University (Ahmedabad, India) Human Ethical Committee (GUHEC/001/2015) for investigation.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from 3-4 mL of peripheral EDTA blood using automated DNA extraction method (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The concentration of DNA was determined using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\n    For targeted NGS analysis, the Ion AmpliSeq  BRCA1 and BRCA2 Panel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 167 primer pairs in three pools (Pool 1 is 56 pairs, 2 is 56 pairs and 3 is 55 pairs) was used. Multiplex PCR was performed using 10-30 ng genomic DNA with a premixed primer pool and Ion AmpliSeq  HiFi master mix; Ion AmpliSeq  Library Kit 2.0; Cat. no. 4480441) for 2 min at 99 C, followed by 19 cycles of denaturation at 99 C for 15 s and annealing and elongation at 60 C for 4 min, ending with a holding period at 10 C. The PCR amplicons were treated with 2 microL FuPa reagent to partially digest primer sequences and phosphorylate the amplicons at 50 C for 10 min, followed by 55 C for 10 min, then 60 C for 20 min. The amplicons were ligated to adapters with the diluted barcodes of the Ion Xpress  Barcode Adapters kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 22 C, then 72 C for 10 min. Adaptor-ligated amplicon libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Cat no. A63881) reagents (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The library concentration was determined using an Ion Library Quantitation Kit (Cat no. 4468802) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), then each library was diluted to 4-8 pmol/L and the same amount of libraries was pooled for one sequence reaction. Next, emulsion PCR was carried out using the Ion OneTouch  2.0 System and Ion PGM  Hi-Q  OT2 (Cat no. A27743) reagents, or Ion 540  OT2 (Cat no. A27752) reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Template-positive Ion Sphere  particles were then enriched with Dynabeads MyOne  Streptavidin C1 Beads (Cat no. 65001) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an Ion OneTouch  ES system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Purified Ion Sphere particles were loaded on any of chip types 314, 316, or 318 (Compatible with Ion PGM) or 520, 530, or 540 (Compatible with Ion S5 System) Chip. Massively parallel sequencing was carried out on a Personal Genome Machine (PGM) sequencer (Ion Torrent ) using the Ion PGM  Hi-Q  Sequencing Kit or Ion S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Ion S5 Sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed using 500 flow runs that generated ~200 bp reads.\n\n    Possible high confidence variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. PCR primers were designed using the OligoCalc (http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu/OligoCalc.html) to determine the properties of designed primers and Primer Blast (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) was also used to check whether our region of interest was covered. Primers were synthesized at 100 nM scale and cartridge purified (Eurofins, Bengaluru, India). PCR amplification was carried out using Takara Taq  Hot Start Version 2.0 PCR mix with each primer at 10 pM concentration under standard conditions. These PCR amplifications were all carried out in duplicate along with a known normal control cell line sample. Successful PCR products were purified prior to sequencing using ExoSAP-IT (Cat no. 78201) reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing technique in both forward and reverse orientations with the same primer sequences used for PCR at 10 pM final concentration using BigDye  v3.1(Cat no. 4336917) according to the manufacturer's cycling conditions. BigDye  v3.1 sequencing reactions were then purified using EDTA (Cat no. 194822) and sodium acetate (Cat no. 567418) according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed on 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sanger sequencing data were analyzed using Codon Code Aligner v5.0.2, (CodonCode Corporation, Centerville, MA, USA) and Mutation Surveyor v5.0, (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA).\n\n    The sequence data were processed using standard Ion Torrent Suite  Software running on the Torrent Server (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw signal data were analyzed using Torrent Suite  version 4.4, 4.6 or 5.0. The pipeline included signaling processing, base calling, quality score assignment, adapter trimming, PCR duplicate removal, read alignment to human genome 19 reference (hg19), quality control of mapping quality, coverage analysis, and variant calling. Coverage analysis and variant calling used Torrent Variant Caller plugin software (Version 4.4, 4.6 or 5.0) in the Torrent Server. The variant caller parameter setting was germline PGM high stringency. Following data analysis, annotation of single-nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and splice site alterations were performed by the Ion Reporter  Server System (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which identified nonsynonymous mutations. Splice site alteration were analyzed 2 bp upstream or downstream of exon-intron boundaries. Sequence data were visually confirmed with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and any sequence, alignment, or variant call error artifacts were discarded. Nonsynonymous mutations were annotated using the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database (https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/projects/bic/index.shtml) and ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). Minor allele frequency was determined from the 1000 Genomes Project database. The 5000 Exome project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) and The Human Genetic Variation Database (http://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SnpDB) were used to identify the pathogenic conditions of the BRCA1/2 gene mutations.\n\n    Percentage was calculated wherever necessary.",
        "Results": "    After analyzing 79 referral cases of women ranging in age between 23 and 72 years, 35 BC-positive (44.30%) cases were detected with germline gene mutations. Among them, 11 cases were with BRCA1 gene mutations (31.4%) followed by 15 with BRCA2 gene mutations (42.9%), and both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were found in nine cases (25.7%) (Figure 1).\n\n    A total of 82 mutations, 39 with BRCA1 (39/82; 47.6%) and 43 with BRCA2 (43/82; 52.4%), were identified in 35 cancer patients. A total of 72 (72/82) missense mutations (87.8%) with amino acid replacement (BRCA1, 36/82, 43.9%; BRCA2, 36/82, 43.9%) were detected with two novel mutations (BRCA1; two splice sites). Among other types, five frameshift mutations (5/82:6.1%) were detected in five cases (exon 1, exon 14 in BRCA1; exon 6, exon 10, exon 11 in BRCA2), where three were novel types. Others were four nonsense mutations of BRCA2 (4/82:4.9%) and one in-frame deletion of BRCA1 (1/82:1.2%). A total of five novel mutations were present with three frameshift and two missense (splice site) mutations in our study (Table 1; Figure 2). Moreover, familial (20) and sporadic (15) cases were not significantly different (Table 1).\n\n    The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency was higher in exons 10, 11 and 16 of BRCA1 and BRCA2 followed by exons 9, 2 and 3. In BRCA1, exon 9 had two splice site SNPs which were pathogenic and one SNP likely benign (total of three). Exon 10 had seven SNPs benign, two each with likely pathogenic and variant of unknown significance (VUS) (total of four). Exon 11 contributed 12 SNPs, each with two amino acid changes showing likely benign and two with VUS having two amino acid changes. The exon 16 possessed six benign and two with VUS. In BRCA2, exon 10 showed nine SNPs likely benign/benign/likely pathogenic, four SNPs likely benign/likely pathogenic and one with VUS, respectively. Exon 11 exhibited seven SNPs likely benign/benign/likely pathogenic and three likely benign/benign. It also had three VUS with two amino acid changes followed by one likely benign. Exon 16 showed six SNPs likely benign, whereas exon 3 and exon 2 had one each of VUS and benign SNPs (two), respectively (Table 2). The SNPs of each exon percent of two germline genes, i.e., BRCA1 (36) and BRCA2 (36), are shown in Figures 3 and 4.\n\n    The average age was 47.3 +- 3.2 ranging from 23 to 72 years. The age group 41-60 years (18 patients) had a high frequency of mutations (45/82: 54.9%) followed by >61 years (six) with 20 (20/82: 24.4%) and <40 years (11) with 17 (17/82: 20.7%). However, the 23-60 years group had 62 mutations (62/82: 75.6%) (Figure 5).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    BC can be caused by germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, or by several other genes. In our cohort, we analyzed 79 referral cases using NGS and gene sequencing of Sanger with other reports of clinicians for phenotypic variations. Only 35 cases (44.30%) detected positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2. The mutations in BRCA2 (52.4%) were marginally higher than those in BRCA1 (47.6%) in our study. Similar results were observed in a North Indian population where BRCA2 had maintained equal distribution of BRCA1/2. BRCA2 mutations contribute more than BRCA1 mutations in Philippine women in support of our data. Jang et al in Korean cases found no variations between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. But in a South Indian population, BRCA1 mutations were more than BRCA2 germline mutations.\n\n    Others included five frameshift mutations, where protein was truncated altering its structure and function. In these, three were novel types - BRCA2 (exon 6) of c.484-484delG, BRCA2 (exon 10) of c.2169_2170InsA and BRCA1 (exon 14) of c.4442_4442delG) - and the other two were referenced in BIC and the SNP database. All were pathogenic and familial in our study. Four nonsense mutations were found in our cancer patients, with two each of familial and sporadic in BRCA2 mutations, and these could lead to premature termination of protein due to change in specific amino acid proving lethal, and referenced in database. Furthermore, only one in-frame deletion in exon 10 of BRCA1(c.3328_3330delAAG) was detected in our cohort which was familial and deleterious. Finally, in our study, five novel mutations were detected, i.e., splice-site missense (two) and frameshift (three) types. Similar mutations are well reported globally in BC and ovarian cancer women except novel mutations in our report.\n\n    High frequency of missense polymorphism (72) in women with BC is seen in our study, which was equal in both genes. Exons 10, 11 and 16 were more than exons 2, 3 and 9 of both genes, and all these may be responsible for BC in these patients depending upon amino acid substitution and its subsequent effect on protein structure and function. Few missense polymorphic SNPs detected in Algerian populations were tested negative for both gene mutations, but could have a role as a susceptibility BC marker in BRCA1/2. In both familial (20) and sporadic (15) cases, few expressed multiples of polymorphic sites as found by others. In these mutations, two were found to be novel (two splice sites) in BRCA1 only, i.e., c.5137+1G>A in two cases in which G was replaced by A, and others were registered. In our cohort, as per database of ClinVar (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI]), dbSNP and BIC revealed most of them were benign in BRCA1 except two splice site types (c.5137+1G>A) which were pathogenic (No. 8, 11 of Table. 1) and one with VUS (p.A841T). In BRCA2, five SNPs, p.Cys315Ser, p.Gly1593Asp(2), p.Lys2077Asn and p.Asn2106Ser were with VUS and others in both genes, and were benign only. However, these can be confirmed further by other predictive programs such as POLYPHEN 2, SIFT and PROVEN as in silico analysis may not provide the pathogenicity of them. However, controversial reports exist about the role of SNPs in these BRCA1/2 genes for the induction of human breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Dombernowsky et al reported that missense mutations cannot explain the risk of HBOC in women with familial history. Contrarily, Dodova et al in their study implicated the role of missense variants which may be deleterious. In an Iranian population, Neamatzadeh et al detected these polymorphic SNPs at higher frequency in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes compared to control subjects supporting our data. Valarmathi et al in their study indicated that many of these variants are proposed to be deleterious in the Indian population. We further propose that polymorphic sites in BRCA1 and BRAC2 genes to cause cancer are dependent on the frequency and nature of amino acid replaced in the protein in regard to their lethality. These SNPs of BRCA1/2 could be related to the pathological condition of BC patients which differ from pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign and likely benign, VUS or mixed types. It requires further elucidation by analyzing BRCA1/2 haplotypes in relation to gene mutations.\n\n    In our study, young age groups (23-60 years) had more frequency of mutations 62/82 (75.6%). This indicated that age is also one of the factors to be noted including other lifestyles, ethnicity and geographic distribution for these differences in their frequency as reported earlier. Mannan et al found in their cohort, that the mutation rate was proportionally higher in patients aged <50 years. Wong et al reported that early age is to be considered for higher rate of BRCA gene variants in HBOC patients in support of our observations. In the Indian population, the proportion of patients with early onset of mutations to BC is also much higher than in Caucasians. In North India, lower BRCA mutations in early age were reported in comparison with other ethnic populations. Vaidyanathan et al detected a high rate of germline mutations with early age, like that of Mannan et al and our report. This discrepancy in these cohorts is related to the latest technologies including the gene panel used for monitoring gene mutations profiles in Indian patients.\n\n    In conclusion, BRCA2 gene mutations were marginally more than BRCA1 mutations. Young age groups had high frequency mutations which were also positively comparable. Polymorphic SNPs were higher than others, with five novel mutations, i.e., three frameshift and two spice site types, where synthesis of premature or truncating proteins occurs by amino acid replacement for their termination, respectively. Nonsense, in-frame and frameshift with splice site were pathogenic, and other polymorphic SNPs were benign, pathogenic and variant of unknown significance. The association of these mutations with haplotypes of BRCA1/2 needs to be evaluated in our future work in addition to age. This may help understand the role of SNPs in the causation of BC for better treatment and genetic testing highlighting sporadic and familial types in the Indian population.\n\n    Author contributions\n\n    Drs Nidhi D Shah and Parth S Shah contributed to writing the results and discussion during manuscript preparation when they visited India.

        "Title": "    Landscape of Germline Mutations in DNA Repair Genes for Breast Cancer in Latin America: Opportunities for PARP-Like Inhibitors and Immunotherapy",
        "Abstract": "    Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) genes are present in about 50% of cases of hereditary breast cancer. Proteins encoded by these genes are key players in DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). Advances in next generation sequencing and gene panels for breast cancer testing have generated a large amount of data on gene variants implicated in hereditary breast cancer, particularly in genes such as PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, RAD51, MSH2, and BARD1. These genes are involved in DNA repair. Most of these variants have been reported for Caucasian, Jewish, and Asian population, with few reports for other communities, like those in Latin American (LA) countries. We reviewed 81 studies from 11 LA countries published between 2000 and 2019 but most of these studies focused on BRCA1/2 genes. In addition to these genes, breast cancer-related variants have been reported for PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, BARD1, MLH1, BRIP1, MSH2, NBN, MSH6, and PMS2 genes. Some of these variants are unique to LA populations. This analysis may contribute to enhance breast cancer variant characterization, and thus to find therapies and implement precision medicine for LA communities.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with about 627,000 deaths in 2018. About 5-10% of all breast cancer is caused by germline variants in BRCA1/2. Moreover, about 50% of hereditary breast cancer (HBC) cases present germline mutations in BRCA genes. BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants confer more than 50% risk of breast cancer development. Since the identification of breast cancer genes BRCA1/2 in 1994 and 1995, respectively, a large amount of data on the risks conferred by these genes for breast and other cancers has been generated. These genes play an important role in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA by homologous recombination (HR) along with a plethora of additional proteins.\n\n    About 50-60% of cases of HBC show variants in BRCA1/2 genes. The remaining percentage involves moderate and low penetrance variants in non-BRCA genes. Next generation sequencing (NGS) and other technologies are still identifying variants in genes associated with breast cancer. Non-BRCA variants have been observed in genes like ATM, PALB2, RAD51, and BARD1. Like BRCA genes, these genes codify for proteins participating in DNA repair.\n\n    The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for genetic assessment in hereditary breast cancer (version 3.2019) recommends genetic evaluation of ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, NBN, NF1, and PALB2 in addition to BRCA1/2 genes. There is accumulative evidence that variants in BARD1, BRIP1, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, RAD51C, and RAD51D are also causative of HBC, although some of these gene products participate in other DNA repair pathways and there is insufficient evidence for establishing management strategies. This generates a paradigm for genetic counseling and assessment. Based on the absence of functional studies evaluating the activity of these genes, genetic advisory is being challenged by patient management.\n\n    Notably, most of the data on HBC variants represent Caucasian populations. HBC accounts for about 15% of breast cancer cases in Latin America (LA). This population, resulting from the combination of Native American, Spanish, African, and other communities, is highly heterogeneous, even within the regions of the different countries where they live. This diversity impacts the genetic variation involved in HBC in this large community. Unfortunately, the data on HBC variants for this population is scarce and mainly focused on BRCA1/2; few cumulative reports on these variants have been reported. This information will be required to implement programs of precision medicine for HBC patients belonging to this population, like those that are being implemented for prevention and therapy of BRCA1/2 variants, particularly with Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Additionally, studies are suggesting that some tumor types with mutations in DNA repair genes are amenable for immunotherapy approaches. This review analyzes 81 studies of germline mutations in breast cancer from 11 LA countries published between 2000 and 2019, with the focus on BRCA and non-BRCA genes involved in DNA repair.",
        "Methods": "    We searched the PubMed database  for all breast cancer studies in 21 LA countries. Studies published between 2000 and April 5, 2019 were considered. A total of 7901 studies were retrieved using the following search terms \"Breast cancer\" and 21 LA countries (\"Argentina\", \"Belize\", \"Bolivia\", \"Brazil\", \"Chile\", \"Colombia\", \"Costa Rica\", \"Cuba\", \"Dominican Republic\", \"Ecuador\", \"El Salvador\", \"Guatemala\", \"Honduras\", \"Mexico\", \"Nicaragua\", \"Panama\", \"Paraguay\", \"Peru\", \"Puerto Rico\", \"Uruguay\", and \"Venezuela\"); as well as \"BRCA1 and BRCA2\". Studies published in English and Spanish were included. Titles and abstracts were reviewed, and ineligible reports were discarded. The inclusion criteria considered research papers, case reports, and germline mutation data. A diagram showing the process of data acquisition is presented in Figure 1.\n\n    Considering the inclusion criteria, 81 studies were selected for extensive analysis. Eleven countries reported germline gene variant data in breast cancer (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Venezuela). Six hundred and ninety-two variants were found in BRCA1/2 genes. Additionally, 126 variants were reported in 43 non-BRCA genes of patients from 7 countries. All variants were investigated in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)  and the ClinVar  databases. The COSMIC database is the largest curated resource, with cancer mutation data from over 32,000 genomes including samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). ClinVar was used to measure the clinical significance of the reported data.\n\n    Among variants in BRCA1/2 genes, 202 were not found in the databases, 316 were classified as pathogenic, 59 as benign, and 115 were classified as \"conflicting interpretations\", \"uncertain significance\", \"likely pathogenic\", and \"likely benign\". Regarding the variants in non-BRCA genes, 22 variants were classified as pathogenic, 10 as benign, 57 as \"conflicting interpretations\", \"uncertain significance\", \"likely pathogenic\", \"likely benign\", \"drug response\", \"risk\" and \"risk factor\", and 37 were not found in the databases. Variants classified as \"conflicting interpretations\", \"uncertain significance\", \"likely pathogenic\", \"likely benign\", \"drug response\", \"risk\", and \"risk factor\", were grouped as variants of unknown significance (VUS) for the purposes of this study.",
        "Results": "    From our literature analysis, only 11 out of 21 countries documented germline data for breast cancer cases. Brazil led the list of reports (32), followed by Chile, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina. Cuba and Venezuela only had one report each (Table 1). No germline data were found for studies performed in Ecuador, Paraguay, Panama, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Belize. Most of the data for germline variants in HBC accounts for the BRCA1/2 genes and just a few studies include non-BRCA genes in a few LA countries.\n\n    The study found 363 variants in BRCA2 and 329 variants in BRCA1 in 11 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Venezuela). In addition, variants were also observed in 43 non-BRCA genes like ATM, TP53, CHEK2, BARD1, MLH1, PALB2, BRIP1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, and PMS2 in Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico (Table 2, Figure S1).\n\n    Studies conducted in some LA countries have established frequent and founder BRCA1/2 mutations in the region. The BRCA1 3450del4, c.5123C>A variant and BRCA2 3034del4 are considered founder mutations in Colombia. The variants 5382insC in BRCA1 and 6633del5 and 156_157insAlu in BRCA2 are prevalent in Brazil. Three variants observed in the Ashkenazi community, c.66_67delAG and c.5263insC in BRCA1, and c.5946delT in BRCA2 were reported in Argentina. In Mexico, the BRCA1 ex9-12 deletion is reported as a founder mutation, while the variants, 2805_2808delAGAT and 3124_3133delAGCAATATTA in BRCA1, and 2639_2640delTG and 5114_5117delTAAA in BRCA2 are reported as pathogenic. In Puerto Rico, the variant E1308X in BRCA2 is present in most cases of HBC, while in Chile, the variants c.3331_3334delCAAG and c.3759dupT in BRCA1 and c.4740_4742dupTG, c.5146_5149delTATG in BRCA2 are more prevalent. In Peru, three recurrent mutations were described, 185delAG and 2080delA in BRCA1, and mutation 3034del4 in BRCA2 have been observed. In Costa Rica, BRCA2 variants such as the 5531delTT are frequently reported. No recurrent mutations in BRCA1/2 genes were found in Venezuela. No reports on BRCA1/2 variants were registered for Belize, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay. This evidence suggests that some variants are preferentially distributed in particular LA countries.\n\n    Some other BRCA1/2 variants are observed in more than one LA country (Table 3), like the pathogenic variant BRCA2 c.2808_2811del variant reported in seven countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela) and the pathogenic BRCA1 variants c.68_69delAG and c.211A>G observed in six countries. Remarkably, the BRCA2 variant c.7469T>C classified as benign in ClinVar was observed in HBC cases in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela, prompting a reconsideration of its reclassification. In summary, there are shared and specific BRCA1/2 variants in HBC patients, reflecting the ethnic heterogeneity in Latin America.\n\n    There are also reports of large genomic rearrangements (LGR) in BRCA1/2 in LA countries (Table 4). Brazil has reported 18 different LGR in BRCA genes, more than in other LA countries. The deletion of exons 1-2 in BRCA1 was reported in three cases in Brazil and Puerto Rico. The 6kb duplication in exon 13 in BRCA1 was reported in seven Brazilian patients. In Mexico, the exon 9-12 deletion in BRCA1 is considered as a founder mutation that has been found in 25 cases so far. Interestingly, the LGR g.26826_30318del in BRCA2 found in Brazil was associated with high-risk male breast cancer. There are also descriptions of LGRs in BRCA1/2 in breast cancer patients from Peru, Puerto Rico, and Uruguay.\n\n    Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Uruguay are the only LA countries that have conducted screenings for non-BRCA genes in breast cancer cases. We found 126 variants in 43 non-BRCA genes (Table 5). Variants were found in ATM, TP53, CHEK2, BARD1, MLH1, PALB2, and BRIP1. The most frequent variants of ATM, TP53, CHEK2, and BARD1 are represented in Figure 2 as lollipop plots following published instructions. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene was the most reported in LA breast cancer cases. Seventeen variants were found in ATM in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, 11 variants in TP53 (Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay) and 8 variants in CHEK2 (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay). Furthermore, six variants in each of the following genes were found in HBC cases: BARD1, MLH1, PALB2 and five variants in BRIP1 (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay). The pathogenic classification of these variants is described according to ClinVar and COSMIC databases in Table S1. The CHEK2 variant c.1100delC reported in Brazil and Chile presents conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity according to ClinVar and is not reported in the COSMIC database. The TP53 variant c.1010G>A (p.R337H) observed in Brazil is considered to be pathogenic by ClinVar, but it is not classified as such by COSMIC.\n\n    Non-BRCA genes with at least two reported variants in LA countries are presented in Figure 3A. Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia are the countries with more reported variants in non-BRCA genes. Non-BRCA genes with only one variant reported in LA are described in Figure 3B. A total of 10 non-BRCA genes with one variant are reported in Mexico. Additionally, only one variant was found in RAD51, XRCC3, CDH1, MSH3, POLQ, SMAD4, and XPC genes in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia.\n\n    Cock et al. reported germline mutations in non-BRCA genes (PALB2, ATM, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6, and TP53) in Colombia. Among their findings, the mutation c.137G>T in PMS2 was identified in a patient with early-onset breast cancer (31 years old), an invasive ductal carcinoma, HR-, HER2+, and positive family history. Another patient diagnosed at 36 years with invasive ductal carcinoma HR+, HER2-, had a PALB2 mutation c.1240C>T. There was another patient diagnosed at 48 years with invasive ductal carcinoma and positive history of familial cancer carrying the ATM c.43del variant. VUS were also reported in patients carrying PMS2, BARD1, RAD51C, BRIP1, MSH6, and MSH2 variants. A previously study of Mexican patients carried out by Quezada et al. describes variants in DNA repair genes including ATM, ERCC3, FANCI, ATR, MLH1, NBN, RAD51C, non-BRCA genes (54%) and BRCA1/2 (46%).\n\n    In addition to cancer-associated variants in BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA genes in breast cancer, there have been reports of biallelic mutations in Australia, Italy, Denmark, Spain, Korea, and other Caucasian populations. Mutations in FANCM, ATM, FANCE, and PALB2 contribute to locus heterogeneity, besides BRCA1/2. Cases harboring biallelic and double heterozygosity are listed in Table 6. The study performed in Colombia by Cock et al. found cases caused by locus heterogeneity involving BRCA1, MSH6, RAD51, PMS2, PALB2, BRCA2, and SMAD4. Interestingly, patients with double heterozygosity presented a familial cancer history and were diagnosed at early ages (before 40 years). In addition, HBC cases caused by biallelic variants in BRCA1/2 genes affecting young patients were reported in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. Notoriously, a 12-year old Argentinian patient with a triple-negative breast tumor was double heterozygous for BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants classified as benign, although she also carried some other non-reported variants. Studies in communities like those described here may help to define the clinical phenotypes of HBC cases caused by locus heterogeneity.\n\n    Nowadays, a plethora of commercial testing panels are available including \"Breast Next\" from Ambry Genetics, \"OncoGeneDx\" from GeneDx, \"My Risk\" from Myriad Genetics, and others. These panels along with NGS and exome analysis provide a large amount of data yet to be analyzed for breast cancer risk and its management. According to the NCCN guidelines, genetic evaluation of genes like BRCA1/2, ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, NBN, NF1, and PALB2 is recommended for HBC prevention. Other genes associated to breast cancer risk included in the NCCN guidelines are BARD1, BRIP1, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, RAD51C, and RAD51D, but they are not considered for breast cancer management and assessment. The growing number of genes and variants associated with HBC is a challenge to the standardized systems used for clinical testing, including the re-evaluation of the variants of unknown significance (VUS). VUS are not rare, for example, there are thousands of VUS reported for BRCA1/2 genes. The increased number of VUS in BRCA genes correlates with the discovery of new variants in non-Caucasian ethnic groups. In individuals of European ancestry across the United States, VUS account for approximately 5-6% of the variants reported in clinical tests, and up to 21% in patients with African-American ancestry. Recent studies show a higher rate of VUS in BRCA1/2 for non-Caucasians (36%) than in Caucasians (27%). Testing laboratories in Europe estimate that up to 15% of alterations in BRCA1/2 are VUS. Furthermore, reported variants in non-BRCA genes increase the complexity of pathogenicity classification and genetic counseling.\n\n    Information on non-BRCA gene variants in LA is scarce due to the low coverage for genetic testing in the health systems of the region, among other reasons. This hinders the identification of new variants, their evaluation for clinical significance, and the risk management assessment.",
        "Conclusion": "    DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are among the first procedures that take place in cancer formation and progression because of endogenous and exogenous factors. With DSB, two main mechanisms may be activated during the repair process, HR and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Most of the non-BRCA genes frequently reported in breast cancer participate in different DNA repair pathways. Reported DSB repair variants in breast cancer comprise PALB2, NBN, RAD51, ATM, CHEK2, ATR, RAD50, and WRN. Likewise, reported variants include genes participating in mismatch repair (MMR) such as MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1 and genes participating in the Fanconi Anemia repair pathway like FANCM, FANCI, FANCB, FANCC, FANCL. In addition to these pathways, variants in XPC, ERCC1, ERCC2 and ERCC3 genes relate to nucleotide excision repair. Variants in XRCC1 and MUTYH participate in base excision repair.\n\n    DNA repair genes display high mutation incidence in cancer, when DNA repair pathways are compromised, mutation rate arises because alternative error-prone repair pathways are used by the cell. The study of the repair pathway mechanisms has identified new targets for therapy that might be useful in some types of cancer. For instance, PARP inhibitors such as Olaparib are used for ovarian cancer treatment based on the concept of synthetic lethality and are currently being studied in breast, prostate and gastrointestinal cancers. Besides PARP, there are other key components with potential for targeted therapy; ATR and ATM are major targets for inhibition as well as CHEK1/2 and DNA-PKs. For instance, M6620, the first inhibitor of ATR has been tested and ATM inhibitors such as M3541 are currently in clinical trials.\n\n    A different therapy approach that displays promising results in cancer treatment is immunotherapy with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. High expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) results in exhaustion of T cells and an attenuated tumor-specific immunity that promotes tumor progression. Diverse studies show a possible relationship between altered DNA repair pathways that increase the mutational burden and immunotherapy response. For example, colorectal cancer patients with altered MMR pathways display high microsatellite instability, expression of PD-L1, as CD3+, CD8+ TILs and tumor-associated macrophages located at invasive fronts of the tumor. The mutational burden was associated with mutations in ATM, MMR deficiency, and therefore loss of expression in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. In addition, patients with tumor DNA repair deficiencies such as POLE and POLD mutations, are considered good candidates for checkpoint immunotherapy. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study by Chae et al. showed that tumors with altered HR genes, MMR genes or POLE contained higher mutational load than tumors with wildtype DNA repair genes. These tumors also contained higher infiltration of T cells and other cells that perform anti-tumor activity. The best treatment responses were observed in patients with high mutational burden with PD-1 inhibitors. The group of better responder patients displayed a neoantigen load and mutations in POLE, POLD1, and MSH2. Based on the premise that DNA repair loss results in elevated anti-tumor immune response, improved clinical outcomes were observed in patients with DNA repair gene mutations. Therefore, mutations in DNA repair genes in lung cancer were linked to increased TILs as CD4+ and CD8+ in the tumor. For patients with higher mutational burden, there is a greater likelihood of the formation of immunogenic epitopes expressed only in cancerous cells. Similarly, in high-grade ovarian cancer altered BRCA1/2 results in a higher mutational load, therefore, tumors harbor more tumor-specific neoantigens, increased TILs including CD3+ and CD8+ and PD-1 and PD-L1 expression. Strickland et al. found that tumors with altered HR repair show higher neoantigens along with improved overall survival. They inferred that high grade serous ovarian cancer with mutations in BRCA1/2 may be more sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors PD-1 and PD-L1 in comparison with tumors proficient in HR repair.\n\n    Breast cancer patients with compromised DNA repair mechanisms display high-risk tumor characteristics such as changes in cell morphology that promote invasion. When HR is compromised, alternative error-prone DNA repair pathways are used and thus there is a chance that errors will occur, such as indels in the cell. There are frequently mutated DNA repair genes in breast cancer and their analysis is fundamental to determine the tumor phenotype and clarify if a high mutational load is due to deficient DNA repair performance. PARP inhibitors are approved for some breast cancer cases, Olaparib was approved by the FDA for germline BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer on January 12, 2018. Similarly, Talazoparib was approved for germline BRCA-mutated HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer by the FDA in October, 2018. Moreover, several studies in Clinical Trials  are focused on DNA repair genes. For instance, the study NCT03495544 focuses on the association between germline DNA repair genes mutations and PD-L1 expression level in breast cancer. Studies for PARP inhibitors such as Rucaparib have been completed, studies for Niraparib are still recruiting for Phase I and Phase III trials, and BMN673 is being tested in advanced breast cancer. On the other hand, immunotherapy studies in breast cancer like the one conducted by Schmid et al. for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) showed that the combination of PD-L1 inhibitor Atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel resulted in improvement in overall survival with a median of 9.5-month (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.86) in patients with PD-L1 positive immune infiltration. Another combined therapy for TNBC of Pembrolizumab an anti-PD-1 with chemotherapy increased the pathological complete response rates. The potential for immunotherapy in breast cancer is promising, suggesting combination therapies for future clinical trials.\n\n    Even though novel cancer treatment strategies are appearing, in Latin America the availability of these therapies is challenging. Over the last five years, about 64% of medicine newly released to the market was sold exclusively in the US, 24% of these new drugs were sold in Western Europe and 7% in Japan. Therefore, the remaining 5% is distributed in the rest of the world. Between 2009 and 2013, 37 new cancer drugs were launched worldwide and only 17 of them are available in Mexico and 10 in Brazil, and access to high-cost cancer drugs is a barrier in the LA region. In LA countries, use of novel drugs differs widely by insurance type, therefore, one promising solution to improve access to these therapies is participation in clinical research. For breast cancer, chemotherapy with anthracyclines is accepted in the region, however, targeted therapy drugs such as Trastuzumab is not accessible to all patients. Restrictions to access new drugs leaves patients with few therapeutic alternatives, disease progression, and consequently, poor outcomes. Therefore, one option for new drugs to be available in LA countries is through participation in clinical trials. Some of these countries are currently participating in clinical trials that are focused on PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Velaparib, Talazoparib, and Olaparib are PARP inhibitors and currently, active clinical trials NCT01506609, NCT02595905, and NCT02163694 are testing Velaparib in combination with Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Cisplatin in breast cancer patients harboring BRCA mutations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Mexico. Similarly, a phase 3 study NCT01945775 in Brazil is currently testing Talazoparib in patients with metastatic breast cancer and BRCA mutations. In addition, Olaparib is currently being tested in metastatic breast cancer patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutation in Peru and Mexico in a phase 3 study (NCT02000622). Also, some immunotherapy agents are currently in clinical trials in Latin America countries. Pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, is being tested (NCT02447003) in metastatic TNBC in Puerto Rico. Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (NCT03036488) is being tested in Colombia and Brazil. Clinical trial NCT03797326 is studying Pembrolizumab in combination with Lenvatinib in Chilean TNBC patients. Clinical trial NCT03725059 is currently recruiting patients in Brazil and Colombia to test neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with Pembrolizumab in early stage ER positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The PD-1 inhibitor Nivolumab is being tested in combination with Daratumab in TNBC patients in Puerto Rico. Atezolizumab a PD-L1 inhibitor, is being tested as an immunotherapy strategy in phase 3 clinical trial NCT02425891 in combination with Nab-Paclitaxel in metastatic TNBC in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. Similarly, clinical trials NCT03498716, NCT03197935, and NCT03125902 are recruiting TNBC patients in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina to test Atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, Anthracyclines, Taxanes, Paclitaxel.\n\n    Based on the reported mutation data for LA countries, we consider that breast cancer patients might benefit from novel targeted therapies like PARP-inhibitors and immunotherapy. In the same way, patients with germline mutations in DNA repair genes like PALB2, NBN, RAD51, ATM, CHEK2, ATR, and RAD50, might benefit from PD-L1 inhibitors and PARP inhibitors. In Latin America countries, germline mutations in BRCA and non-BRCA genes have been reported mostly in patients with early onset, advanced disease or TNBC. With this in mind, PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy might be a good strategy for breast cancer patients harboring these previously mentioned mutations. Consequently, further studies focusing on DNA repair gene mutations and their role as novel predictive markers are needed for immunotherapy response and targeted therapy in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. We hypothesize that breast cancer patients in Latin America that have mutations in the DNA repair pathway could benefit from these kinds of therapies.\n\n    In this study, several BRCA1/2 variants that are considered susceptible to PARP inhibitors were found according to the JAX Clinical Knowledgebase (JAX-CKB)  and the Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer database . In these databases, seventeen variants in each BRCA1 and BCR2 genes are considered to be sensitive to PARP inhibitors due to loss of function or predicted loss of function. These variants were reported in some LA countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela). Interestingly, some variants such as c.211A>G and c.68_69delAG in BRCA1 were each reported in six countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay); and for BRCA2, variant c.5946delT was observed in five countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru).\n\n    For non-BRCA genes like ATM, PARP inhibitors are suggested for inactivating mutations or loss of function variants; in the same way as for BARD1, CHEK2, MSH2, NBN, and PALB2 genes. Consequently, we consider that patients in different LA countries harboring these variants could benefit from PARP inhibitors therapies.\n\n    In this work, even though rare variants are often reported and counted as mutations, most of them have not been tested in functional analysis. Herein, variants that have been reported in at least two countries for breast cancer are included, suggesting that they may have biological significance.\n\n    Understanding germline mutations in BRCA and non-BRCA genes in Latin American communities is necessary to improve screening strategies and to implement and develop viable precision medicine practices. This study shows that more information and analyses are required to define the prevalence of gene variants involved in HBC in LA, to define their pathogenicity and for reclassifying VUS and variants of conflicting interpretation in this population. This information will facilitate the implementation of HBC screening programs and targeted therapies in Latin America, particularly of those treatments that address DNA repair mechanisms.\n\n    The importance of more breast cancer studies, including non-BRCA genes, is to analyze the DNA repair capacity status for a better understanding of the relationship between DNA repair and breast cancer tumor aggressivity, potential biomarkers for prognosis along with immunotherapy recommendations and possible novel targets in DDR. Therefore, patients with mutations in DNA repair genes might also be candidates for targeted therapy in order to improve their outcome. Future studies focusing on non-BRCA genes, mainly DNA repair genes, will be of great benefit for LA breast cancer patients.\n\n    BRCA1/2 are the most analyzed and studied genes in LA countries, few studies report non-BRCA gene status in breast cancer.\n\n    In addition to BRCA1/2, non-BRCA genes provide information about the DNA repair capacity status.\n\n    Targeted therapy such as immunotherapy and mainly PARP inhibitors are focused on DNA repair gene status for better response.\n\n    Studies focusing on non-BRCA genes are needed in LA countries.",

        "Title": "    A Biobank of Breast Cancer Explants with Preserved Intra-tumor Heterogeneity to Screen Anticancer Compounds",
        "Abstract": "    The inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of breast cancer needs to be adequately captured in pre-clinical models. We have created a large collection of breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs), in which the morphological and molecular characteristics of the originating tumor are preserved through passaging in the mouse. An integrated platform combining in vivo maintenance of these PDTXs along with short-term cultures of PDTX-derived tumor cells (PDTCs) was optimized. Remarkably, the intra-tumor genomic clonal architecture present in the originating breast cancers was mostly preserved upon serial passaging in xenografts and in short-term cultured PDTCs. We assessed drug responses in PDTCs on a high-throughput platform and validated several ex vivo responses in vivo. The biobank represents a powerful resource for pre-clinical breast cancer pharmacogenomic studies (http://caldaslab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/bcape), including identification of biomarkers of response or resistance.\n\n    We developed a biobank of breast cancer patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs)\n\n    PDTXs represent diverse molecular subtypes and retain intra-tumor heterogeneity\n\n    PDTX-derived tumor cells (PDTCs) were used for high-throughput drug testing\n\n    PDTXs/PDTCs are a robust platform for pre-clinical pharmacogenomic studies\n\n    Development and analysis of a collection of breast-cancer-patient-derived xenografts indicate that the xenografts and cell cultures derived from them preserve the heterogeneity of the original tumors and can be used for drug screening.",
        "Introduction": "    Molecular stratification is the first step toward precision cancer medicine. Recently, we reported and validated a genome driver-based molecular taxonomy of breast cancer. Modeling this diverse inter-tumor heterogeneity of breast cancer is challenging and requires generation of explant models representing the ten identified integrative clusters (IntClust).\n\n    Cancer cell lines have been extensively used for drug development and biomarker discovery but are successful at predicting clinical responses in only a handful of examples. The modest clinical predictive value of cancer cell lines results from their recognized shortcomings: limited capacity to recapitulate inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity and adaptation to growth in artificial conditions. These limitations are significant because both tumor subtype and cancer genome evolution, resulting in intra-tumor heterogeneity, remain the main challenges to successful cancer treatment.\n\n    The increasing understanding of cancer biology has led to the availability of targeted therapies. These drugs typically explore oncogene addiction or synthetic lethality. Unfortunately, the inherent heterogeneity of cancer means that either primary or acquired resistance nearly always occurs. Successful early drug development hence requires molecular stratification and characterization of intra-tumor heterogeneity.\n\n    Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs) have emerged as powerful pre-clinical models to recapitulate the diversity of human tumors. The greatest promise of PDTXs is their potential to improve the rates of attrition in cancer drug development. However, generalized use of PDTXs in high-throughput drug studies is unrealistic, for both cost and animal welfare reasons. Moreover, it has not been clear whether PDTXs retain the heterogeneity of the original tumor. Here, we demonstrate molecularly characterized PDTXs and their matched PDTX-derived tumor cells (PDTCs) in short-term culture do retain this heterogeneity and may be used as a platform for cancer drug screening with the potential to uncover molecular mechanisms of therapy response.",
        "Methods": "    Further information and requests for material may be directed, and will be fulfilled by the corresponding author Carlos Caldas (carlos.caldas@cruk.cam.ac.uk).\n\n    A bank of human breast cancer explants has been maintained at the CRUK Cambridge Institute (Figure 1A and Table S1) over the past 4 years, by combining efforts from Addenbrookes Hospital and collaborating hospitals in Europe (Institute Curie, Paris and VHIO, Barcelona), US (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah) and Canada (UBC, Vancouver). The PDTX biobank in Cambridge continues to expand with routine implantation of, on average, 3 breast cancer samples per week. The time from patient collection to mouse implantation ranges from 30-180 min.\n\n    Surgically resected primary breast cancer tissue, biopsies from brain, skin, liver, bone, axilla and lymph node metastasis, and pleural effusions or ascites samples were obtained from consenting patients. The research was done with the appropriate approval by the National Research Ethics Service, Cambridgeshire 2 REC (REC reference number: 08/H0308/178). Tissue samples were embedded in matrigel and then implanted subcutaneously into 2-4 female severe immune compromised NSG mice. Pleural effusion and ascites samples were centrifuged, washed with water twice to eliminate red blood cells, and cell pellets resuspended in 50% matrigel:FBS solution before subcutaneous injection into mice.\n\n    PDTXs were serially implanted into multiple hosts to allow in vivo expansion of each model (established model). Xenograft samples were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and freezing media (FBS/10%DMSO) at each passage, from each mouse. Genotyping of all samples was always performed to confirm matching with the originating patient derived sample (see below). All models tested to date could be rescued by re-implantation of cryopreserved tissue. This includes successful implantation of PDTX samples obtained from the network of collaborators, which were all obtained under the appropriate Institutional Review Boards and transferred to Cambridge under Materials Transfer Agreements. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the rigorous Home Office framework of regulations (Project License 707679).\n\n    Xenograft tissue, either freshly collected or cryopreserved in FBS/10%DMSO was minced using sterile scalpels and dissociated for a maximum of 90 min in DMEM/F12/HEPES (GIBCO), 1mg/ml Collagenase (Roche), 100U/ml Hyaluronidase (Sigma), 25% BSA fraction V (GIBCO), 5 mug/ml Insulin and 50 mug/ml Gentamycin (GIBCO). This was followed by further dissociation using trypsin (GIBCO), Dispase (StemCell technologies) and DNase (Sigma). Red blood cell lysis was done by washing the cell pellet in a 1:4 solution of HF media (GIBCO): Ammonium Chloride (StemCell technologies). Cells were resuspended in MEGM (Lonza) and filtered through a 40 mum filter. For high throughput drug screens, cells were plated in MEGM in 384 well plates at a concentration of 1x106 cells/ml. Other in vitro assays used cell concentrations outlined in the individual methods.\n\n    Each sample ID follows the structure XXXX-A0C0, where\n\n    XXXX: name of the model\n\n    A: Type of sample (T: tumor, N: normal, X: xenograft)\n\n    0: If the sample is a xenograft, number of passage (starting with zero)\n\n    C: C indicates PDTC\n\n    0: Number of days of culture\n\n    Any R, R1 in the name indicates a replicate.\n\n    In, STG139 was labeled as SA577, STG143 as SA536 and STG201 as SA541.\n\n    Tissue microarrays were prepared using duplicate 0.6mm cores extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks containing material from patient tumors and xenografts.\n\n    These were run using Leica's Polymer Refine Kit on their automated Bond platform. The HIER's (sodium citrate and tris EDTA pre-treatments) are all run at 100 C, for the time indicated in the table. The DAB Enhancer (used for all antibodies apart from ER and PR) reference is AR9432. The de-waxing and re-hydration prior to IHC are done on the automated Leica ST5020, as is the post-IHC de-hydration and clearing. Finally, the mounting is done on Leica's CV5030. The slides were reviewed by a pathologist.\n\n    PKH26 assay (Sigma) was performed as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly; 1x107 cells from xenograft single cell suspensions were incubated for 5 min in 2x10-6M PKH26. Cells were then cultured in suspension in MEGM media (Lonza). Aliquots were taken periodically, and fixed in 2% Neutral buffered formalin prior to flow cytometric analysis.\n\n    Pan-centromeric FISH was performed using human and mouse specific Star*FISH  chromosome paints (Cambio). The protocol was performed on 3-6 micron FFPE tissue sections as per manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    Frozen xenograft samples were prepared as single cell suspensions. Non-specific antibody labeling was blocked by incubation in 10% normal rat serum for 30 min. Percentage mouse stromal content was quantified using FITC anti-mouse H-2Kb/H-2Db Antibody [Clone: 28-8-6] (Biolegend UK Ltd).\n\n    CellTiter-Glo (CTG): The methodology was adapted from the protocol previously described for cell lines.\n\n    CyQUANT Direct Cell Proliferation Assay (C35011). The manufacturer's instructions were adapted to suit PDTC culture. Briefly, 20 mul of 10X detection reagent was added to 70 mul of drug treated cells. The cells were incubated at 37 C and Fluorescence was read on the Pherastar plate reader after both 1 and 8 hr of incubation.\n\n    SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain - 5 mM Solution in DMSO (S7020). Briefly, 500mM EDTA (pH 7.0) stock diluted 1:100 in TBS, filtered through 0.45 mum membrane was used as dilution buffer. 5mM SYTOX stock was diluted 1:1000 in dilution buffer and 10 mul was added to cells. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 6 hr. 5 mul of 1% Saponin solution with 0.04% Sodium Azide was added to the cells and incubated for 20 hr at room temperature. Fluorescence was read on the Pherastar plate reader. These comparisons were performed using 10 doses per drug.\n\n    Single cell suspensions generated from a 1.5 cm3 PDTX tumor were plated in triplicates at 40.000 cells/well into 384-well plates. Drug was added to wells after 24h. To quantify drug responses in PDTCs, cell viability reading intensities were obtained 6 days post-treatment and normalized against positive and negative values. To independently validate data from our drug screening approach using CellTiter-Glo (CTG), a selection of 8 models were screened with 18 drugs and cell viability determined in parallel by CTG and two further tests (CyQUANT and SYTOX).\n\n    The following reagents were used for in vivo validations upon randomization of tumor bearing NSG mice: MK-8669/Ridaforolimus as an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor (1mg/kg, 5IW), BKM120/Buparlisib as a pan-PI3K and BYL719 and GDC0032/Taselisib as PI3K-alpha inhibitors (27.5, 35mg/kg 6IW and 5 mg/kg, respectively), LEE011/Ribociclib as a CDK4/6 inhibitor (75mg/kg), AZD2281 (Olaparib/Lynparza) as a PARP inhibitor (50mg/kg, 5IW), AZD1775 as Wee1 inhibitor (120mg/kg, 5dON 9dOFF) and Tamoxifen (10mg/ml, 100mul daily) as an ER pathway inhibitor. Tumor volumes were normalized to the starting tumor volume and mean volumes were plotted and compared to vehicle-treated controls. Details such as number of mice used and mean volumes per treatment arm are shown in Table S7.\n\n    All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Committee and by the Vall d'Hebron Hospital Clinical Investigation Ethical Committee and Animal Use Committee.\n\n    One of the main goals of this project was to study variability in the molecular features of the tumors engrafted and the drug responses in PDTCs. For that, different levels of replication were used: tumor biological replicates (where different pieces of originating cancer sample were engrafted), PDTX biological replicates (where different mice were engrafted with different samples from the same PDTX sample), PDTC biological replicates (where the same PDTX was cultured at least twice as PDTCs) and technical replicates for both PDTXs and PDTCs.\n\n    No specific strategy for randomization was employed, and no blinding was used, except for in vivo validations of drug response as described in the previous section. As this is a pilot study and we had no prior estimates of variability between engraftments, no sample size calculations were done. There were no criteria of exclusion for tumor engraftment.\n\n    Throughout all the analysis description, we refer to \"model\" as a collection of a primary tumor, matched normal samples, matched PDTX passages or PDTCs, and \"sample\" as any of the instances of a given model.\n\n    Statistical parameters including the exact value of n in terms of number of samples and models and the definition of location and dispersion measures for each figure are reported in the Figures and the Figure Legends.\n\n    Number of samples sequenced: 1\n\n    Number of different models: 1\n\n    STG139M\n\n    Number of samples sequenced: 193\n\n    Number of different models: 33\n\n    AB521M, AB551, AB555, AB559, AB580, AB630, CAMBMT1, HCI001, HCI002, HCI004, HCI005, HCI008, HCI009, HCI010, HCI011, IC007, STG139, STG139M, STG143, STG195, STG201, STG282, STG316, STG335, VHIO039, VHIO089, VHIO093, VHIO098, VHIO102, VHIO124, VHIO131IGFRES, VHIO179, VHIO244\n\n    Number of different samples: 132\n\n    Number of different models: 32\n\n    AB521M, AB551, AB555, AB559, AB580, AB630, CAMBMT1, HCI001, HCI002, HCI004, HCI005, HCI008, HCI009, HCI010, HCI011, STG139, STG139M, STG143, STG195, STG201, STG282, STG316, STG335, VHIO039, VHIO089, VHIO093, VHIO098, VHIO102, VHIO124, VHIO131IGFRES, VHIO179, VHIO244\n\n    Number of samples sequenced: 68\n\n    Number of different models: 33\n\n    Average number of CpGs with at least 5 reads: 2,355,537\n\n    AB521M, AB555, AB559, AB564, AB572, AB580, HCI001, HCI002, HCI004, HCI005, HCI006, HCI008, HCI009, HCI010, HCI011, HCI012, HCI014, IC006, STG139, STG139M, STG195, STG201, STG282, STG316, STG335, VHIO039, VHIO089, VHIO093, VHIO098, VHIO102, VHIO124, VHIO169, VHIO179\n\n    Number of samples: 153\n\n    Number of different models: 39\n\n    AB521M, AB551, AB555, AB559, AB580, AB630, HCI001, HCI002, HCI004, HCI005, HCI006, HCI008, HCI009, HCI010, HCI011, HCI014, IC006, IC007, STG139, STG139M, STG143, STG195, STG201, STG282, STG316, STG335, VHIO006, VHIO039, VHIO089, VHIO093, VHIO094, VHIO098, VHIO102, VHIO124, VHIO131, VHIO161, VHIO169, VHIO179, VHIO244\n\n    Single-Drug Tests:\n\n    Number of total single-drug tests (with technical replicates): 6634\n\n    Number of single-drug tests: 2550\n\n    Number of different models: 20\n\n    Number of different models/passages: 37\n\n    Number of different drugs: 104\n\n    Combinations:\n\n    Number of total combination tests (with technical replicates): 288\n\n    Number of combination tests: 144\n\n    Number of different models: 8\n\n    Number of different models/passages: 10\n\n    Number of different combinations: 18\n\n    HCI002, HCI009, HCI010, HCI001, HCI005, HCI008, HCI011, IC007, STG139, STG139M, STG143, STG201, STG195, STG282, STG316, STG335, VHIO098, VHIO179, VHIO169, VHIO244\n\n    The analysis of sequencing data from PDTXs is hampered by the presence of mouse stroma contamination. Due to the high homology between the two genomes, a proportion of mouse reads can still map to homologous regions of the human genome, likely with some mismatch, heavily affecting downstream analysis.\n\n    To develop a computational approach able to tackle this issue, we carried out a Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) experiment in a controlled setting where fixed amounts of human and mouse DNA were mixed, ranging from a pure human sample to a pure mouse sample.\n\n    The adopted strategy was to align the reads against a combined human-mouse genome with Novoalign. This way, although mouse reads could be mapped against the human genome, they will likely map with higher score in the corresponding mouse locus. Reads mapping with identical scores in two (or more) locations were discarded.\n\n    The table below shows the performance of our approach. When a pure human DNA sample or a pure mouse DNA sample is mapped against the combined genome, 99.9% of the reads or more are mapped correctly.\n\n    We found a non-linear relationship between the percentage of human DNA content and the percentage of reads mapped on the human genome. The bias is likely caused by the capturing step, since probes specifically designed against human exons were used. Therefore, we derived a calibration curve using a loess regression (Figure S2B), making it possible to estimate the human DNA content in independent samples.\n\n    WES libraries were prepared using Nextera Rapid Capture Exome (Illumina Inc., USA) following manufacturer's instructions (Enrichment Guide version #15037436 Rev. J, Illumina Inc., USA). Briefly, PDTX DNA was quantified using Quant-iT broad range dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher, USA) and 50ng used as input into the Nextera exome library preparation. Pre-capture libraries were normalized to 20nM and pooled for shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS). Pre-capture libraries were quantified using qPCR and their average length was assed using DNA1000 chip on Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). 500ng of each library was pooled for three-plex exome capture, and after 11 cycles of PCR amplification were again normalized to 15nM and pooled for high-coverage paired-end exome sequencing.\n\n    The sequencing was performed using 125bp paired-end reads. Short reads were aligned using novoalign (Novocraft) with our custom pipeline to remove mouse contamination. Bam files were merged, sorted and indexed using samtools. Duplicates were marked using Picard tools and insertions and deletions (indels) were realigned using GATK.\n\n    For quality control purposes and to check for sample labeling mistakes, all samples were genotyped using GATK HaplotypeCaller and a few errors were identified and corrected. HaplotypeCaller was also employed for variant calling, and after that several filters were applied using the Bioconductor package VariantAnnotation: for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), a minimum genotyping quality of 20, at least 5 reads at the variant position, a strand bias Phred-scale p value smaller than 40 and no presence of homopolymers in the surrounding region. For indels, we increased the width of the region to detect nearby homopolymers. Genotypes and variant allele frequencies (VAFs) were computed from these calls.\n\n    All variants were annotated using annovar version March 2015 for gene/exon annotation, 1000 genomes version Oct 2014, dbSNP version138, repetitive regions genomicSuperDups database, SIFT, Polyphen 2, MutationTaster and MetaLR, all versions ljb26.\n\n    Variants in intergenic, intronic or ncRNA intronic positions were discarded.\n\n    In order to quantify variability in matched tumor/PDTX, different passages of PDTXs or matched PDTX/PDTC, all variants detected in at least one sample of each model were obtained. For those samples where those variants had not been detected GATK HaplotypeCaller was run again on those positions to see if this was a consequence of no reads in that region for that sample or a real absence of the variant.\n\n    Normal contamination estimates were obtained for each tumor sample combining copy number calls from shallow sequencing (see next section) and SNV calls. First, we selected heterozygous SNPs in the matched normal sample (if available, otherwise all heterozygous variants in the tumor were considered), and then looked at only those in regions of copy number loss in the tumor, as defined by a segmented mean copy number log ratio smaller than -0.1. In these regions, as a loss of heterozygosity has occurred, it is expected that all variants will have a VAF of 0 or 1 (if no normal contamination is present). For the AB SNPs that are left to B genotype, the expected value of contamination would be 2 * VAF - 1, assuming that all tumor cells acquired the deletion. As this is a downward estimate, we chose as the tumor content estimate the maximum of the density function of the VAF of those variants. These estimates were used to correct tumor VAFs or copy numbers where needed in the rest of the analyses.\n\n    All variants that were present in the 1000 Genomes database or in any of our normal samples were labeled as germline. Regions marked as repetitive were also filtered, and insertions that represented a segmental duplication were removed if they were not present in at least three-fourths of all the samples for a given model or in 3 of them. Somatic variants that were not filtered were compiled for each model. Some manual curation was needed for genes like PI3KCA, where variants from a region of segmental duplication were included after manual inspection.\n\n    Frequencies of mutations were compared to TCGA.\n\n    Pearson correlations between VAFs in tumor and PDTX, different passages of the same model, PDTX and PDTCs of the same passage, mice replicates, technical replicates of the same sample and different tumors were computed.\n\n    To quantify tumor heterogeneity two methods were used: MATH and PyClone. MATH essentially quantifies the ratio of the width of the center of the VAF values, while PyClone is a Bayesian clustering method that infers the clonal population structures for each sample from each model. Briefly, PyClone takes as input the allele frequencies of somatic mutations in each sample and clusters mutations that shift together across the samples, predicting the cellular frequency for each cluster in each sample accounting for copy number changes and normal cell contamination. Because PyClone requires absolute allelic copy number information to be inputted for each mutation, ASCAT v2.2 was ran for that task. ASCAT was run using the log ratios from the shallow sequencing when available and the VAFs from the exome sequencing. For those samples with no shallow sequencing, CopywriteR was run on the whole exome sample. When possible, tumor/normal paired analysis was run on ASCAT. Filtering and quality control was carried out prior to running ASCAT; samples were removed if the mean coverage across all the mutations was less than 20. Mutations that were not sequenced to a depth of at least 10 reads in either the cancer or normal sample were also excluded.\n\n    We then applied Pyclone to a total of 22 PDTX models, ranging between 2 and 15 samples for each model. Only mutations with a median coverage of at least 50 across all model samples were used. Additionally, for each model, mutations with a coverage smaller than 15 in any of the samples were removed from the analysis. Germline mutations (SNPs, duplications, and repeats present in the normal sample) were not utilized (but note that germline filtering was less stringent for PyClone analysis; in particular, variants that were present in the 1000 Genomes database were not removed, as we observed some VAF changes between samples that would be useful to distinguish variability from real changes). Mutations with low variant allele frequency (< 0.1) across all samples were also excluded. In cases where greater than 300 high quality mutations remained after filtering, the 300 mutations with the highest median coverage were used as input for PyClone. Normal cell contamination estimations for each tumor sample were also used (the PDTX and PDTC samples have a theoretical contamination of 0). PyClone was run for 40,000 iterations with a burn in period of 20,000 iterations using a beta binomial parameter of 500. To measure the clones whose prevalence changed significantly between time points, we compute the 90% credible intervals and those clusters that had a sample not overlapping with the rest were called significant. These mutations were considered cancer driver genes if they were part of the 40 MutDriver genes. For clarification, and as recommended in the original PyClone paper, we only plotted those clusters with more than one mutation.\n\n    Mutational profiles were computed for each of the samples using the package deconstructSigs. Signatures were not computed due to the small number of variants in many samples.\n\n    The sWGS workflow uses low-coverage sequencing of the pre-capture exome-sequencing libraries to generate high-quality CNA calls. This is efficient in PDTX DNA usage, low-cost (around $30 per sample), and generates better quality copy-number data than what is achievable from WES. As described above in exome sequencing analysis, libraries were prepared using Nextera Rapid Capture Exome (Illumina Inc., USA). Pre-capture libraries were normalized to 10uM and pooled for shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS).\n\n    50 bp single-read whole-genome shallow sequencing was performed in parallel with the exome sequencing to provide a clean and accurate estimate of copy number. Alignment was performed using bwa with our custom pipeline to remove mouse contamination. Bam files were merged, sorted and indexed using samtools. Duplicates were marked using Picard tools. The data were analyzed using the Bioconductor package QDNaseq. This method divides the genome in regions of 100Kb and counts all the reads within those bins. Those reads are then corrected for mappability and GC content and segmented using DNAcopy. Some additional filtering was applied to account for regions not properly mapped.\n\n    We also observed that in a few occasions, the method shifted the log2 ratios because of the median normalization. Those cases were inspected perusing the VAF plots obtained with ASCAT and fixed.\n\n    The segmented means of the tumors were corrected for normal contamination (as described in the exome pipeline) and copy numbers (HOMD, Homozygous deletions, HETD, Heterozygous deletions, NEUT, neutral copy number, GAIN, single copy gains and AMP, high-level amplifications), were called based on thresholds on the segmented mean log2-ratio (-1, -0.4, 0.25, 0.75).\n\n    Pearson correlations between segmented means in tumor and PDTX, different passages of the same model, PDTX and PDTCs of the same passage, mouse replicates, technical replicates of the same sample and different tumors were computed.\n\n    RNA expression was analyzed using the Illumina HT-12 v3 platform. Raw data were processed with the beadarray package. The BASH algorithm was employed to correct for spatial artifacts. Summarization and probe selection based on quality was performed on the bead-level data using the detection thresholds recommended in the package and the re-annotation of the Illumina HT-12v3 platform as described previously. The samples were classified into the intrinsic subtypes using PAM50, and the Three Gene classifier. ER, Her2 and PR status was inferred fitting a mixture model with the package mclust.\n\n    Classification into Integrative Clusters (IntClusts). The PDTX samples were classified into one of the 10 Integrative Clusters using the scripts provided in and the R package iC10. Each sample was classified into the 10 Integrative Clusters and the assignment to each model was done by consensus (that is, the majority group for all the samples from that model). Copy number and expression data were used when available (n = 21). If not, only expression data (n = 17) or only copy number data (n = 0, no model had all samples with only copy number data). Comparing the assignments done with copy number and expression to the ones using only one type of data, there were no models that changed when using only expression data versus using combined CNA-expression data and 12 that changed when using only copy number data versus using combined CNA-expression data (2 from IntClust 1 to IntClus 9, 1 from InClust 5 to IntClust 10, 1 from IntClust 7 to IntClust 8, 2 from IntClust 10 to IntClust 3, 1 from IntClust 10 to IntClust 4, 5 from IntClust 10 to IntClust 9).\n\n    As the PDTX cohort might not represent all types of breast cancers, we included the 1980 Metabric samples and quantile-normalized them together with the PDTX samples to obtain more accurate classifications on all methods.\n\n    Pathway activation scores. We downloaded the c6 oncogenic signatures from the Molecular Signatures Database (and incorporated an in-house PI3K/AKT/mTOR and an in-house DNA Damage Response DDR signature) and applied the GSVA package to infer sample specific pathway activation. Similarly, as the PDTX cohort might not represent all types of breast cancers, we also included the 1980 Metabric samples and quantile-normalized them together before converting the expression values into z-scores. For pathways that had a subset of genes that should be upregulated (UP) and another subset that should be downregulated (DOWN), the final score was obtained as UP-DOWN.\n\n    Heat maps and cluster analysis were performed using Euclidian distance and the Ward method.\n\n    Pearson correlations between log-intensity expression values or pathway activation scores in tumor and PDTX, different passages of the same model, PDTX and PDTCs of the same passage, mice replicates, technical replicates of the same sample and different tumors were computed.\n\n    A detailed comparison of pathway activity scores in tumor and PDTX and PDTX passages was performed fitting, to each pathway, a generalized additive model using the R package mgcv with the score of the tumor as the dependent variable and a smooth function of the score of all the PDTX passages as the independent variable. The deviance and the Spearman Correlation were computed as measures of predictive ability and reproducibility. Similar models were fit using the first PDTX passage as dependent variable and the rest of the passages as independent.\n\n    RRBS sequencing was performed using 125bp paired-end reads. Alignment was carried out using Bismark with our custom pipeline to remove mouse contamination. Only CpGs with at least 5 reads were selected for subsequent analysis. Methylation levels were obtained as the proportion of Cs in the CpG sites.\n\n    Pearson correlations between proportion of methylation in CpG sites in tumor and PDTX, different passages of the same model, PDTX and PDTCs of the same passage, mice replicates, technical replicates of the same sample and different tumors were computed. A filter of 1,000,000 reads was applied for this analysis.\n\n    For downstream analysis, a filter of 1.5 million reads was applied to select samples and for each gene promoter methylation score was computed as the mean value in the CpG sites in the region +- 2,000 around the TSS.\n\n    The observed response was computed as: 100 - (100 * (intensity-negative control)/(positive control - negative control). Quality Control was performed comparing response values in plates and screenings done in similar dates. Non-parametric isotonic regression using the R function isoreg was fit to the set of technical replicates of a given drug response for a given sample. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed on the model fits using the package flux which uses the trapezoid rule. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was predicted fitting a smoothing spline to the isotonic regression line. As a measure of variability around the AUC and IC50 estimates, isotonic regression curves were fit to each of the technical replicates individually and their AUC and IC50 also computed, producing error bars for the overall estimates based on the standard deviation. In order to compare IC50 estimates from drugs with different range of doses, we computed the IC50 as a percentage dose using the formula 100 * (IC50 - minimum dose tested) / (range of doses tested).\n\n    (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n\n    (0, 0, 0, 0, 50)\n\n    (0, 0, 0, 50, 90)\n\n    (0, 0, 30, 50, 90)\n\n    (0, 25, 50, 75, 100)\n\n    (0, 50, 60, 80, 100)\n\n    (60, 60, 60, 60, 60)\n\n    (100, 100, 100, 100, 100)\n\n    Unsupervised clustering using Euclidean distance and the Ward method on the fitted dose-response curves showed eight different patterns that corresponded to different expected responses. We then established eight theoretical curves based on the percentage of cells dead at the five dosage points:\n\n    These curves cover increasingly sensitive response patterns, from no response to full toxicity. Each response was classified into these theoretical curves by a minimum squares approach.\n\n    Pearson correlation between technical replicates was computed on the drug responses (AUC) of the same sample and the same drug. Pearson correlation between biological replicates was computed on the drug responses (AUC) of the same model and the same drug.\n\n    Data from drug combinations was subject to the same normalization as in the single drug pipeline. As each combination screening contained also two single drug responses (for each drug in the combination), the Pearson correlation was computed comparing these and the single drug screen (previously obtained) for the same model/drug. Isotonic regression curves and AUC were fitted to the single response curves of the drugs in the combination. Synergistic effects were measured using the Bliss model, which compares the observed response under a given combination of two drugs and the expected response under a model of independence. That is, if the proportion of cells dead with a dose i of a drug X is rx(i) and the proportion of cells dead with a dose j of a drug Y is rY(j), the expected proportion of cells dead under a combination of i and j is rx(i) + rY(j) - rx(i) rY(j). These values were computed by fitting an isotonic regression on each single drug response and compared with a bivariate isotonic fit on the drug combination obtained with the R package isotonic.pen. The residuals of the Bliss model were defined as the difference between the observed and the expected response. These values were taken merely as descriptive markers and no inferences were performed on them.\n\n    Custom scripts to run the analyses are available at figshare: https://figshare.com/s/4a3f6bc543e5ba85834c\n\n    Raw sequencing and microarray files are available at EGA: EGAS00001001913.\n\n    Normalized/Summarized data files are available at figshare: https://figshare.com/s/4a3f6bc543e5ba85834c.

        "Results": "    We have established a large bank (n = 83) of live human breast cancer explants by implantation of tumor samples in highly immunodeficient mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ or NSGs; see STAR Methods). Comprehensive clinical information on the patients and originating cancer sample implanted to generate PDTXs can be found in Table S1. To date, PDTXs have been successfully established from both primary (n = 46) and metastatic (n = 37) sites, and more than 50% (n = 50) are from ER+ disease (Table S1). The PDTX growth rates upon initial engraftment and after subsequent re-implantation were variable across models, remained mostly stable upon serial engraftment, and tended to be faster in explants originated from ER- tumors (Figure 1A shows data for 31 models). Importantly, all established models tested to date could be flash frozen and subsequently successfully engrafted, ensuring the persistence of the living biobank.\n\n    In order to be classified into one of the IntClust using the method we described, the PDTXs were subject to copy number profiling, by shallow whole-genome sequencing (\"sWGS\"), and expression profiling, by microarrays (\"RNAexp\"). The copy number profiles of PDTXs classified into each IntClust were similar to those reported in primary tumors (; Figure S1A). The goodness of fit scores of IntClust assignment were computed (for IntClusts with more than one xenograft model: IntClust1; IntClust3; IntClust4; IntClust5; IntClust6; IntClust9; and IntClust10), and with one exception (IntClust3), these scores were very similar to classifying primary tumors (Figure S1B).\n\n    Copy number aberrations (CNAs) in known breast cancer driver genes present in the PDTXs included gains/amplifications of MYC (78%), CCNE1 (34%), ZNF703 (25%), CCND1 (31%), MDM2 (25%), and ERBB2 (9%) and deletions of PTEN (41%), PPP2R2A (72%), CDKN2A (47%), and CDKN2B (47%). This CNA frequency distribution is different from that seen in a breast cancer clinical population (METABRIC dataset) and reflects both the origin of the PDTXs (around 45% were from metastatic biopsies) and the disproportionate engraftment of triple-negative basal-like cancers (IntClust10) and more-aggressive subtypes of ER+ tumors (IntClust1 and IntClust9; Figure 1B). In contrast, we observed lower engraftment of ER+ tumors from better-outcome subtypes (IntClust3, IntClust4, IntClust7, and IntClust8; Figure 1B; Table S1).\n\n    Downstream analysis of mRNA expression data using the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) approach, a method to estimate pathway activity, also showed that the diversity of activity scores in cancer-related pathways (Molecular Signatures Database; http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) in PDTXs was similar to that observed in the breast cancer clinical population (Figure S1C). Furthermore, in matched pairs, the activity of breast-cancer-related pathways (e.g., PTEN, Tp53, BRCA1, Her2, and Cyclin D1) in the PDTXs was correlated with and predicted the activity scores in the originating breast cancer samples (Figure S1D).\n\n    The subtype distribution of engrafted PDTXs was also reflected by the mutation frequencies identified using whole-exome sequencing (\"WES\"). The most-commonly mutated genes in ER- breast cancers were mutated at similar frequencies in ER- PDTXs (Figure 1C). In contrast, frequencies of mutated genes in ER+ PDTXs mirrored those found in more-aggressive subtypes of ER+ tumors. As an example, PIK3CA mutations were found in only 27% of ER+ PDTX models (Figure 1C), compared to 46% and 38% in the METABRIC and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts, respectively.\n\n    In summary, these data show that we have successfully generated a living biobank of breast cancer xenografts, representing the clinical and molecular diversity of the disease.\n\n    Histologically, PDTXs (23 models analyzed) showed similar morphology to the originating tumor; tubule formation and associated stroma were present in the xenograft, as seen in the matched patient cancer sample (Figure S2A). Histological review of multiple PDTX passages (Table S2) revealed that tumor tissue morphology remained stable with serial engraftment. Analysis of immunohistochemistry for epithelial markers (CK5, CK8, CK14, CK18, E-cadherin, and epithelial specific antigen) and for clinical biomarkers (ER, PR, Her2, Ki67, and p53) showed these features were similar in matched pairs of PDTX model and originating breast cancer sample and were consistently retained with passaging (Figure S2A and Table S2 for summary of the data).\n\n    The PDTX samples were comprehensively molecularly characterized at several passages using sWGS (for CNAs), WES (for single nucleotide variations [SNVs]), reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (\"RRBS\") (for DNA methylation), and RNAexp (for global expression and pathway activity profiling).\n\n    The analysis of sequencing data from PDTX samples is complicated by the presence of a variable and unknown amount of mouse cells. To address this, a serial dilution series of control samples with known mixtures of human and mouse DNA was created to develop a robust computational pipeline to discriminate human and mouse reads with an accuracy >99.9% (see Figure S2B and STAR Methods for details). This pipeline identified three spontaneous mouse tumors arising at or near the implantation site, which were discarded from further experiments. Post-filtered aligned data from this pipeline were used for somatic copy number and mutation calling (see STAR Methods).\n\n    We used these data to determine how implantation, serial passaging, and replicate engraftment affected gene expression, cancer pathway activation scores, allelic fractions of somatic mutations, CNAs, and DNA methylation. This analysis, done also for comparison in reference sets (different tumor samples and technical and biological replicates), revealed a high degree of correlation in matched sample pairs for all data types (Figure 2A).\n\n    The biological relevance of the models was evidenced by similar gene expression profiles between the originating tumor and the PDTX (RNAexp n = 44; r = 0.95; interquartile range [IQR] 0.94-0.97), oncogenic pathway scores (r = 0.67; IQR 0.44-0.79), CNA profiles (sWGS n = 45; r = 0.91; IQR 0.84-0.93), SNV allelic fractions (WES n = 82; r = 0.81; IQR 0.74-0.88), and DNA methylation profiles (RRBS n = 8; r = 0.82; IQR 0.79-0.84). The biological robustness of the models across serial passaging was also remarkable, with retention of gene expression profiles (RNAexp n = 217; r = 0.98; IQR 0.97-0.99), oncogenic pathway scores (r = 0.87; IQR 0.80-0.93), CNA profiles (sWGS n = 109; r = 0.97; IQR 0.92-0.98), SNV allelic fractions (WES n = 201; r = 0.92; IQR 0.87-0.95), and DNA methylation profiles (RRBS n = 37; r = 0.82; IQR 0.78-0.90; Figure 2A). Mutational signatures in matched PDTXs across serial passages and the originating sample were also conserved (Figure 2B). Representative examples across the molecular data types for individual PDTX models are shown in Figure 2B.\n\n    In summary, the comprehensive characterization of histopathological characteristics, somatic genomic aberrations (CNAs and SNVs), methylation profiles, and gene expression of the biobank of human breast cancer explants confirms these models have a remarkable level of multi-dimensional molecular resemblance with their matched cancer of origin, significantly extending the observations we and others had previously reported. Our findings robustly demonstrate these multi-dimensional molecular features are conserved through serial engraftment in the mouse.\n\n    Breast cancer PDTXs retain similar architecture to the originating tumor and, through passaging, this remains stable. This occurs despite mouse stroma replacing the human stroma. We used the custom sequencing analysis pipeline described above (Figure S2B; STAR Methods) to deconvolute the proportion of mouse DNA sequences in PDTX samples as a surrogate for mouse stromal cell content. Out of the 94 xenograft samples examined, only five had more than 40% mouse cells. Replicates obtained from these five had lower mouse stromal content, reflecting intra-PDTX heterogeneity (Figure S2C). The data from multiple PDTX models also showed the proportion of mouse content does not change significantly across passages (Figure S2C). Two independent methods were used to validate these observations: fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of PDTX-derived single-cell suspensions with an MHC-class I anti-mouse H-2Kb/H-2Db antibody and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with mouse and human centromeric probes in tissue sections (; Figure S2D).\n\n    In summary, these data show the mouse stroma contribution to the xenografts is stable across serial passaging.\n\n    Human breast cancers are composed of clones differing in mutation content, resulting in intra-tumor genomic heterogeneity. This intra-tumor heterogeneity, although variable across tumors, is already present at diagnosis and evolves dynamically in space and time.\n\n    WES data were used to interrogate both intra-tumor heterogeneity and clonal architecture in matched originating tumor, initial engrafted, and serially passaged xenografts.\n\n    Quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity using the mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) method revealed that the originating patient tumor samples had a range of scores (from low to high), as expected given their diverse IntClust subtype. The heterogeneity scores in multiple passages of matched PDTXs were similar, demonstrating explants preserve intra-tumor heterogeneity (Figure S3A).\n\n    Clonal architecture in individual samples and clonal dynamics upon engraftment and across serial passaging were assessed on 104 samples from 22 models using PyClone, as we recently described. PyClone identified 190 clonal clusters across the samples analyzed, but only 38 clonal clusters (20%) had significant changes in cellular prevalence estimates (Table S3 for extended information from PyClone analysis in all models tested). Clonal selection was seen upon initial engraftment (average change in clonal prevalence 0.21) but minimal through serial transplantation (average change in clonal prevalence 0.07; Figure S3B). We next asked whether clonal clusters showing engraftment-associated dynamics were enriched for cancer drivers. Recently, our group used a ratiometric method to identify 40 breast cancer mutation driver genes in 2,433 breast cancers. Remarkably, in only 4 of the 38 clonal clusters that changed significantly after engraftment or during passaging could we identify a mutation driver: BAP1 in STG139 (cluster 12); KDM6A in HCI004 (cluster 3); MAP3K1 in STG143 (cluster 3); and PIK3CA in HCI008 (cluster 2; Table S3). These data strongly suggest that most of the clonal dynamics within xenografts are not associated with known driver genes. Figure 3A shows examples both of individual clonal cluster plots and of variant allele frequency distributions for individual genes within these clusters. Figure S3C shows all individual clonal cluster plots generated from the 22 models analyzed to illustrate the full diversity of clonal architectures observed in the PDTX biobank.\n\n    We analyzed in detail the clonal architecture of two cases for which we had both primary and subsequent metastasis samples: STG139 and a lung metastasis 12 months later, STG139M, and AB521 and a liver metastasis 8 months later, AB521M. For the first patient, we generated a xenograft from the primary tumor (STG139-X) and a xenograft from the lung metastasis (STG139M-X), and for the second patient, we generated a xenograft from the liver metastasis (AB521M-X). Figure 3B shows the clonal cluster plots and a heatmap of variant allele frequencies derived from WES data for sample sets from both patients. Clonal clusters shared by both the originating primary tumor and metastatic samples (STG139: clonal clusters 1, 7, and 8; AB521: clonal clusters 2, 8, and 10) had stable cellular prevalence across passaging. These clusters contained around 80% of all SNVs detected in these two cases (Figure 3B) and included not only the stem or truncal cluster but significantly also included sub-clonal and even very minor clusters (estimated cellular prevalence <5%). Metastasis-only clonal clusters (STG139: cluster 4; AB521: cluster 7) were also preserved upon serial passaging. Finally, there were clusters detected only in engrafted-derived samples (clonal clusters 3, 11, and 12 in STG139 and 6 in AB521, respectively). Although these results need a degree of cautious interpretation (only two cases analyzed), it demonstrates that both originating tumor and xenografts contain multiple clones, and the dynamics of clones in the patient (by comparing primary and metastasis biopsies) and in the mouse (by comparing passages) have both similarities and differences. Detailed analyses of clonal dynamics in more matched primary metastatic samples and their derived PDTXs, with mirrored treatment regimes, will be extremely informative toward understanding the mechanisms that are operative in tumor clonal ecosystems.\n\n    From one large breast cancer brain metastasis (CAMBMT1), we obtained five spatially separate biopsies, which were implanted into five different NSG mice. WES data from all five biopsies showed similar clonal architectures (Figure 3C, left panel; Table S3). This case allowed us to compare the clonal architecture of the five xenografted samples, revealing remarkable similarity, despite some variation in the originating cellular prevalence in the separate biopsies (see, for example, variant allele frequencies of GATA3, OTOGL, and BTD; Figure 3C, right panel). These near identical clonal dynamics upon engraftment strongly suggest deterministic mechanisms operate on clonal selection and validate our previous hypothesis that specific mutations act as genetic markers of fitness and dictate evolutionary trajectories.\n\n    In summary, these data show PDTXs constitute a pre-clinical model that captures the most-clinically relevant feature in human cancer: heterogeneous genomic architecture that dynamically evolves. Moreover, the data also indicate that the clonal dynamics of the derived and serially passaged explants are not stochastic.\n\n    The PDTXs described constitute a living biobank of breast cancer explants that retain through passaging the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity encountered in the clinic. We therefore developed a method to enable the use of this valuable resource for high-content pre-clinical drug screening, similar to the approach widely used with cell lines. The method involved optimizing short ex vivo culture of cells isolated from the PDTXs (named PDTCs). These short-term PDTC cultures were successfully generated from all models where attempted (n = 27, at least two different passages from each; Figure S4A; see STAR Methods).\n\n    Sequencing data confirmed that the PDTCs had a proportion of mouse-derived cells similar to that found in the originating PDTX (Figure S4B). Cell proliferation, cell viability, and cell divisions (measured by PKH26 assay) were analyzed in the cultures and showed the expected variability across models, reflecting the diversity of the originating cancer (Figures S4C and S4D).\n\n    PDTCs derived from ten of the PDTX models were extensively characterized using WES, sWGS, and RNAexp. Analysis of these data showed the short ex-vivo-cultured PDTCs retained the molecular features of the originating PDTX (Figures 2A and 2B), including similar clonal architecture (Figures 3A, S3B, and S3C; Table S3). The average absolute change in clonal cluster cellular prevalence in matched PDTC-PDTX pairs was 0.08 (Figure S3B, left panel).\n\n    In summary, PDTCs can be systematically and consistently generated from PDTXs and retain their genomic features, making them an excellent model system for high-throughput drug screens.\n\n    We tested the use of PDTCs as a pre-clinical drug-screening platform with an approach similar to that which we previously reported for cell lines and organoids. A selection of 22 different PDTX models were plated as PDTCs and 24 hr later screened with 108 compounds, representing a total of 6,634 drug tests performed (see STAR Methods). The compounds used were either approved cancer treatments or drugs targeting key cancer pathways (Table S4). The effect of drug treatment on cell viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo (CTG) and drug responses represented by (1) the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), (2) the dose-response curve, and (3) the area under the dose response curve (AUC). In total, 2,550 drug-PDTC combinations were tested, with a range of 5-20 (mean = 16) PDTC models screened per drug. For most models, the drug treatment was performed in at least three technical replicates (same model, same passage, and same mouse) and in two or three biological replicates (same model, different passage).\n\n    One significant limitation of these analyses is that these measurements (IC50 and AUC) did not account for cell division rates across the different PDTC models. Growth rate inhibition metrics have recently been shown to provide more-reliable measurements of sensitivity to cancer drugs. Nevertheless, we have been able to make several observations that attest to the value of the drug screening results obtained despite this caveat.\n\n    First, the observed AUC values across all drugs and models tested were highly correlated across technical (Pearson correlation of 0.94) and biological replicates (Pearson correlation of 0.78; Figure 4A). These results are highly similar to those we previously reported in established cell lines or tumor organoids. To further verify the robustness of these in vitro drug response data, we tested in eight PDTC models a set of 19 drugs using CyQUANT and Sytox endpoint assays, in addition to CTG (see STAR Methods). The results of these experiments revealed highly correlated drug responses independently of the assay used (Figure S4E; Table S5).\n\n    Second, analysis of AUC data for compounds targeting the same pathway or with similar mechanism of action showed highly correlated response profiles. One example with inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (NVP-BEZ235/dactolisib, AZD8055, GDC0941/pictilisib, AKT inhibitor, and MK-2206) is shown in Figure 4B. Another example with compounds targeting homologous recombination repair defects (PARP inhibitor BMN-673/talazoparib and cisplatin, a DNA cross-linking agent) is shown in Figure 4C.\n\n    Distinct PDTC models can sometimes share the same IC50 and AUC values for a compound and have very different dose-response curves. Hence, a new method, based on the pattern of the slope of the dose-response curve, was developed to classify drug sensitivity patterns into eight groups (see STAR Methods). Figure S5A shows for each compound the proportion of drug responses classified into each of the eight drug sensitivity patterns across all models tested with that drug. Clustering of drug sensitivity patterns (Figure S5B) confirmed the high reproducibility and biological robustness of the data: different passages of the same model and compounds with similar mechanisms of action and target specificities clustered together.\n\n    Third, we explored whether the combined analysis of PDTC drug responses and molecular data recapitulated known mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance. For example, sensitivity to the EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor BIBW2992 (afatinib) was seen in two of the three Her2+ models tested (Figure S6A). Sensitivity to PARP inhibition was seen in a model with somatic BRCA1 promoter methylation and consequent lack of expression (STG201) and in a model from a patient with a germline-truncating BRCA1 mutation (VHIO124; Figures S6B and S6C; Table S6, and Figure 6 for ex vivo and in vivo data, respectively). Interestingly, two models from BRCA1 germline mutation carriers were resistant to PARP inhibitors, and these had inactivating mutations of 53BP1 (STG316: c.134+3A > C) and MAD2L2 (VHIO179: c.66_67delAG; Table S6; Figure 6). Resistance to PARP inhibitors due to loss of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) has been previously reported for both 53BP1 and MAD2L2. These data therefore further demonstrate breast cancer explants recapitulate known mechanisms of both drug sensitivity and resistance.\n\n    Finally, we explored multiple layers of molecular data in the context of PI3K pathway inhibition. In Figure 4D, we present a schematic of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway to illustrate the complexity of the associations. Sensitivity to the PI3Kalpha inhibitor GDC00941 (pictilisib) was seen in models with PIK3CA-activating mutations (3/15), PTEN loss (5/15), INPP4B loss (2/15), high p-AKT levels (4/15), or a combination of these features (Table S6). The difference in response (measured by AUC) to pathway inhibitors was compared in the presence or absence of a biomarker in the pathway (based on expression, SNVs, CNAs, or promoter methylation). This showed models with mutant versus wild-type PIK3CA responded better to PI3Kalpha and AKT inhibitors, but not to mTOR and PI3Kbeta inhibitors. We did a similar analysis for JQ1, a BET inhibitor recently tested in breast cancer models. We tested 19 models, and seven were JQ1 sensitive, including 4/7 ER+ (IntClust1 [3] and IntClust10 [1]) and 3/12 ER- (IntClust10 [2] and IntClust9 [1]; Table S6).\n\n    These data highlight the heterogeneous nature of single biomarker/drug-response associations in breast cancer and suggest integrative analysis of molecular and drug response data are more informative. Further improvements are expected in the future using new drug-response metrics that are insensitive to cell division rates.\n\n    Combination therapy is increasingly being used as an approach to combat development of resistance in cancer treatment. To test the use of PDTC models in high-throughput drug-drug combination assays, we designed a 5 x 5 matrix with standard of care chemotherapy agents (cisplatin and paclitaxel) and six clinically relevant targeted compounds (Figure S7A). Single-agent drug responses in these drug-drug combination assays were highly correlated with those obtained from the 108 individual compound screen (Pearson correlation 0.84), further confirming the robust and reproducible performance of our PDTX/PDTC platform (Figure S7B). The Bliss model (see STAR Methods), an approach that does not require precise estimates of IC50s, was used to compute synergy and antagonism. The performance of the Bliss model was validated by showing in a Her2-positive model (HCI008) synergy of an Hsp90 inhibitor (17-AAG or tanespimycin) in combination with paclitaxel, which has been previously reported (; Figure 5A). The testing of pairwise combinations using the six targeted compounds (Figure S7A) confirmed the rationally predicted synergistic effects of combining an IGFR1/INSR1 inhibitor (BMS-754807) with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235) or an EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib/Iressa; Figure 5B).\n\n    In summary, these data show that PDTCs can be successfully used to test drug-drug combinations.\n\n    We next tested whether PDTC drug responses ex vivo predict responses in vivo in a series of pre-clinical trials using PDTXs as xenopatients. This step was crucial to validate the utility of the platform reported here, given that PDTXs have recently been shown to predict human clinical trial drug responses. We selected 40 ex vivo PDTC drug responses tested in eight different models for in vivo validation. Significantly, even though different compounds with the same specificity had sometimes to be used in PDTXs (for formulation or bioavailability reasons), 33 out of 40 (82.5%) ex vivo drug responses were recapitulated in vivo (Figure 6 for examples; Table S7 for details on all ex vivo and in vivo drug tests performed). This included validation of responses in vivo for PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, ER, PARP, Wee1, and IGFR1 inhibitors (Figure 6A; Table S7). We also validated in vivo the predicted synergistic combinations of PI3K plus IGFR1/INSR1 inhibitors (Table S7).\n\n    Overall, these results show the value of PDTCs as predictive drug response models prior to in vivo testing using PDTXs.",

        "Discussion": "    The use of PDTXs in pre-clinical cancer drug development has become widespread. The data available, to which we add extensively here, show PDTXs share most molecular and architectural features with their originating patient tumor sample. A recently published large study of 1,000 PDTX models adds a further crucial piece of evidence supporting their potential utility by showing the use of xenograft models to predict human clinical trial drug responses. The dataset presented here shows the unique value of a living biobank of breast cancer explants that preserve intra-tumor heterogeneity as a platform for drug screening, including the demonstration of reproducible drug responses across different xenograft passages.\n\n    A significant limitation of PDTXs as a pre-clinical platform is the fact that in vivo studies are not well suited for high-throughput drug screening. The PDTX/PDTC platform presented here overcomes this limitation, and we have demonstrated its use for both high-throughput single and drug-drug combination studies. The platform has remarkably good reproducibility and selectivity, similar to that observed in analogous studies using cell lines or organoids. The demonstration that compounds affecting the same pathway or target and those with similar mechanisms of action shared the same drug responses across models testifies to its biological robustness. We independently tested a set of drug responses in a selection of models with a DNA-based method, showing very good correlation with CTG results (which is based on ATP levels), as others have recently reported. Further refinement of the in vitro screening will come from introducing growth rate inhibition metrics. The in vivo validation of 33 out of 40 in-vitro-predicted drug responses tested suggests that, in the future, PDTCs can be used as a drug-screening platform prior to downstream testing with the 1X1X1 PDTX clinical trial design.\n\n    Crucially, we found that PDTXs and PDTCs are communities of clones of varying complexity and that these explants display intra-tumor heterogeneity similar to that that is found in the clinical population. The preservation of clonal communities within heterogeneous tumors in pre-clinical models has recently re-emerged as key to improving therapeutic strategies. This feature uniquely positions PDTXs as a human pre-clinical model to study breast cancer biology and drug responses.\n\n    The framework we developed of ex vivo PDTC drug screening followed by in vivo PDTX response validation is a cost-effective pipeline for pre-clinical drug development. The extensive detailed STAR Methods accompanying this report, including both processed and raw molecular profiling and drug sensitivity information, constitutes a publicly available dataset that we will continue to expand with more models and further drug testing. We will provide viable xenograft fragments to academic collaborators and will also make models available to the wider community through licensing. The extensive data generated already represent a valuable resource, which can be easily browsed in a purpose-built public web portal (http://caldaslab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/bcape). We are using the PDTX/PDTC platform to study mechanisms of drug resistance, to unravel clonal dynamics in response to therapeutic perturbation, and to perform genome-wide perturbations with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and CRISPR-CAS libraries, and these newly generated data will be continually deposited into the public domain.",
