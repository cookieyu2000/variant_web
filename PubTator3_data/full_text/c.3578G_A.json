        "Title": "    In silico validation revealed the role of  SCN5A  mutations and their genotype-phenotype correlations in Brugada syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare genetic disease that causes sudden cardiac death (SCD) and arrhythmia. SCN5A pathogenic variants (about 30% of diagnosed patients) are responsible for BrS.\n\n    Lack of knowledge regarding molecular characteristics and the correlation between genotype and phenotype interfere with the risk stratification and finding the optimal treatment in Vietnam. Therefore, we identified SCN5A variants and evaluated the genotype-phenotype correlation of BrS on 117 Vietnamese probands.\n\n    The clinical characteristics and blood samples of BrS patients were collected. To determine SCN5A variants, Sanger sequencing was conducted, and subsequently, these variants were analyzed by bioinformatic tools.\n\n    In this cohort, the overall rate of detected variants in SCN5A was 25.6%, which could include both pathogenic and benign variants. In genetic testing, 21 SCN5A variants were identified, including eight novels and 15 published variants. Multiple bioinformatic tools were used to predict variant effect with c.551A>G, c.1890+14G>A, c.3338C>T, c.3578G>A, and c.5484C>T as benign, while other variants were predicted as disease-causing. The family history of SCD (risk ratio [RR] = 4.324, 95% CI: 2.290-8.269, p < 0.001), syncope (RR = 3.147, 95% CI: 1.668-5.982, p = 0.0004), and ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (RR = 3.406, 95% CI: 1.722-5.400, p = 0.0035) presented a significantly higher risk in the SCN5A (+) group, consisting of individuals carrying any variant in the SCN5A gene, compared to SCN5A (-) individuals.\n\n    The results contribute to clarifying the impact of SCN5A variants on these phenotypes. Further follow-up studies need to be carried out to understand the functional effects of these SCN5A variants on the severity of BrS.\n\n    This study aims to identify SCN5A variants and evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation of Brugada syndrome on 117 Vietnamese probands. Multiple bioinformatic tools were carried out to classify SCN5A variants as benign and disease-causing. In addition, the genotype-phenotype correlation was also revealed.",
        "Introduction": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) (OMIM: 600163) is an inherited disorder of cardiac electrical conduction, characterized by a specific ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3) on the electrocardiogram (ECG), strongly associated with the high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death (Antzelevitch, ). Clinical presentation of BrS also involves sudden infant death syndrome and sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome. About 4% of all sudden death cases and at least 20% of sudden death cases with typical heart structures are associated with BrS (Kusano, ). The overall prevalence of BrS is globally estimated at 0.05% and found to be of different incidences in different regions. The highest prevalence of BrS is verified in Southeast Asia (3.7 per 1000 population), followed by the Middle East and South Asia, with both rates of 1.8 per 1000 population (Vutthikraivit et al., ). Males show a higher prevalence and more severe clinical manifestations than females (Benito et al., ). Mutations in SCN5A gene are associated with BrS, accounting for approximately 30% of BrS cases (Brugada et al., ). Variety of genes have been identified to be related to BrS, but SCN5A gene is the most dominant when occupied by >5% of positive genotyped patients (Ackerman et al., ). According to The European Society of Cardiology guidelines, SCN5A genetic testing is recommended in cases of Class I: the family with carriers of SCN5A mutation in BrS, Class IIa: the patients suspected with BrS based on clinical features, family history, and electrocardiographic (ECG) testing, Class IIb: the patients with ECG type 2 and type 3 of BrS (Priori et al., ). The genetic testing in affected family members plays a pivotal role in treatment classification which comprises at-risk (+) and precaution (-) groups.\n\n    SCN5A gene is located on chromosome 3p21 and has 28 exons that encode for the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.5). Nav1.5 contains four transmembrane domains (DI-DIV) connected by inter-domain linkers. Each domain includes six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) joined by intra-extracellular loops (Rook et al., ). Segments S1-S4 in each domain are essential to forming a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) that is activated to generate sodium current (Chen-Izu et al., ). Nav1.5 induces the depolarization of atrial and ventricular action potentials, thus creating the up-stroke of the cardiac action potential (Jiang et al., ). To date, more than 900 SCN5A variants are associated with cardiac disorders and scattered throughout different gene regions. The variants induce the diversity of BrS phenotypes as well as causing loss-of-function or gain-of-function of sodium channel via altered voltage- and time-dependent activation/inactivation and decelerated recovery from inactivation (Savio-Galimberti et al., ). Therefore, identifying SCN5A variants and their functional assessment are vital in optimizing and personalizing patient treatment.\n\n    In Vietnam, data regarding the molecular characteristics of SCN5A variation are still lacking. Very few studies have determined the association between the genotype and phenotype of SCN5A variants in Vietnamese patients. Recently, computation tools have become widely used to assess the consequence of variants potentially causing disease (Thusberg et al., ). Thus, we conducted this study to screen for SCN5A variants and evaluated the genotype-phenotype correlation of BrS on 117 probands. The results will support risk stratification of BrS for treatment and provide detailed information to clinicians for genetic counseling.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 117 Brugada patients were included from the Vietnam National Heart Institute from January 2017 to April 2022. The patients were diagnosed with BrS according to the diagnostic criteria of the European Heart Rhythm Society. All individuals participated in the current study and signed informed consent.\n\n    Clinical characteristics of patients included age, sex, family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD) (<45 years old), clinical treatments, comorbidities, ECG measurements, sodium channel blocker challenge test, and electrophysiological study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hanoi Medical University (Hanoi Medical University Institutional Review Board, Hanoi, Vietnam, reference number: 48/HDDDDDHYHN).\n\n    The genomic DNA of each participant was isolated from peripheral blood using a QIAamp Blood Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, DNA concentration was measured using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and stored at -20 C until use.\n\n    The SCN5A coding regions were amplified by PCR using the designed primers at flanking intronic sequences described Park et al. . Twenty microliters of PCR mix contains GoTaq Hot Start Master Mix 2X, 5 pmol primer, DNA template, and distilled water. PCR cycle was carried out by initial denaturation at 95 C for 5 min, followed by 37 cycles of denaturation at 95 C for 30 s, annealing at T  m  of primers for 30 s, and extension at 72 C for 30 s, and final extension at 72 C for 5 min. PCR products were observed on 1.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis. Next, PCR amplicons were purified and direct sequenced on ABI 3500 genetic analyzer system (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing data were assembled to reference sequences on NCBI (NG_008934 and NM_198056) to determine the SCN5A variants by CLC Main Workbench 6.0 software.\n\n    To determine the large genomic alteration, including deletions and insertions, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was carried out by using the SALSA MLPA probe mix P108-B2 SCN5A (MRC Holland). Results were analyzed with Coffalyser software (MRC Holland).\n\n    We analyzed the results on eight computational tools, including six separated predictors: Mutation Assessor (http://mutationassessor.org/r3/), Polyphen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), Mutation Taster (https://www.mutationtaster.org/), PROVEAN (http://provean.jcvi.org/index.php), FATHMM (http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk/), SIFT (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/index.html), and two meta-scores: BayesDel addAF and MetaSVM (Adzhubei et al., ; Choi & Chan, ; Feng, ; Kim et al., ; Reva et al., ; Schwarz et al., ; Shihab et al., ; Sim et al., ). These algorithms were evaluated based on the structure and function of the targeted protein and evolutionary conservation in its sequence.\n\n    A quantitative variable is presented as mean +- standard deviation. Fisher's exact test was calculated to determine the significance of categorical variables. A risk ratio (RR) was applied to determine the correlation between phenotype and genotype of SCN5A variants. A two-tailed p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All tests were computed by GraphPad Prism 8 software package (San Diego, USA).",
        "Results": "    The clinical manifestations and electrocardiographic variables of the 117 participants in this study are summarized in Table 1. Of those participants, males were the majority with 97.4% (114/117) compared to females with 2.6% (3/117). Genetic testing of SCN5A gene categorized the participants into two groups: SCN5A genotype positive and SCN5A genotype negative, accounting for 25.6% and 74.4%, respectively. For the purposes of this analysis, patients with any detected variants in SCN5A were included in the genotype-positive group, including benign variants as well as pathogenic variants. The average age was 47.5 +- 12.4 years, ranging from 23 to 79 years. However, no significant difference was observed in age (p = 0.056), whereas there was a different significance related to family history with sudden death in both groups (p < 0.0001).\n\n    Of all collected patient features, SCN5A (+) was identified with different rates in syncope, nocturnal agonal respiration, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), and cardiac arrest survivors by 66.33%, 13.33%, 20%, and 13.33%, respectively, compared to 29.89%, 8.05%, 2.3%, and 3.45% of SCN5A (-). The prevalence of syncope and the incidence of VT/VF presented the statistical difference between SCN5A (+) and SCN5A (-) groups with p = 0.002 and 0.0035, respectively. Neither clinical treatment methods nor comorbidities and types of BrS in ECG did show any different significance in both groups (p > 0.05). In addition, SCN5A (+) group had a higher rate of flecainide testing than the SCN5A (-) group (23.33% vs. 2.30%; p = 0.001). By contrast, a higher electrophysiology study testing was recorded in SCN5A (-) group than SCN5A (+) group, with the rate of 51.72% and 33.33% (p > 0.05), respectively.\n\n    To assess the risk of SCN5A genotype to BrS phenotype, we evaluated the RR of the clinical characteristics associated with SCN5A mutation. The results are shown in Table 2. The increased risk of 4.324 with a family history of sudden death (<45 years old) in SCN5A (+) probands (95% CI: 2.290-8.269; p < 0.0001) compared to SCN5A (-) probands. The relative risk for syncope, VT/VF, and flecainide testing were also evaluated at 3.147 (95% CI: 1.668-5.982; p = 0.0004), 3.406 (95% CI: 1.722-5.4; p = 0.0035), and 3.652 (95% CI: 1.957-5.737; p = 0.001), respectively, according to SCN5A-positive and -negative groups.\n\n    In our study, eight of 21 SCN5A variants were found as novel variants and were not previously recorded in the databases (ClinVar: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/; LOVD: https://www.lovd.nl/; dbSNP: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). All SCN5A variants are displayed in Table 2 and Figure 1. The location on the protein sequence was followed by the UniprotKB (Q14524), as described: the N-terminus (aa 1-131), domain I (DI S1-S6, aa 132-410), inter-domain linker I-II (aa 411-717), domain II (DII S1-S6, aa 718-938), inter-domain linker II-III (IDL II-III, aa 939-1206), domain III (DIII S1-S6, aa 1207-1466), inter-domain linker III-IV (IDL III-IV, aa 1467-1529), domain IV (DII S1-S6, aa 1530-1771), and the C-terminus (aa 1772-2016). The novel variants were located mainly in the DI, accounting for 15.15%, compared to 6.06% in both N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Among SCN5A variants, a frameshift variant was determined in two patients, such as c.325_327delAAC (N109del) in exon 3. Also, genomic duplication was observed in two patients who showed a duplicate of exon 2 and 3 by MLPA. Five missense variants were identified along 28 exons of SCN5A: c.551A>G (Exon 5), c.754G>A (Exon 7), c.797T>A (Exon 7), c.980G>A (Exon 8), c.5389A>T (Exon 28), produced the amino acid change at His184Arg, Asp252Asn, Leu266His, Gly327Glu, and Ile1797Phe, respectively. A synonymous variant c.5484C>T was found in a single patient at nucleotide position 5484 with no effect on the wild-type 1828 Alanine amino acid residue (Ala1828Ala).\n\n    Aside from novel variants, 13 known SCN5A variants were recorded in this study. Of these, 11 missense variants have been verified in the dbSNP, containing c.1100G>A (R367H) in exon 9 (rs28937318), c.1712G>C (S571T) in exon 12 (rs199473126), c.1975C>T (R659W) in exon 13 (rs730880205), c.2236G>A (E746K) in exon 14 (rs199473582), c.2678G>A (R893H) in exon 16 (rs199473172), c.2893C>T (R965C) in exon 17 (rs199473180), c.3338C>T (A1113V) in exon 18 (rs199473194), c.3578G>A (R1193Q) in exon 20 (rs41261344), c.4171G>A (G1391R) in exon 24 (rs780405533), c.4534C>T (R1511W) in exon 26 (rs137854602), and c.5693G>A (R1898H) in exon 28 (rs370694515). Two patients carried c.1890+14G>A (rs145427253) at the splice site region of intron 12 and a TCT deletion at the position 4850 to 5852 (c.4850_4852delTCT) (rs749697698), which caused frameshift on protein sequence (I1617del) was found in exon 27.\n\n    To determine the impact of SCN5A variants in BrS, multiple bioinformatics tools were utilized; if the results of >=4 tools were in agreement on pathogenicity, a variant was considered damaging. The results are revealed in Table 3. Of a total of 21 variants, 15 were predicted as disease-causing by at least four algorithms. Significantly, the variants c.797T>A, c.980G>A, c.1100G>A, c.2678G>A, c.2893C>T, and c.4534C>T were indicated as potentially pathogenic variants by all algorithms. Conversely, five variants were identified as benign, including c.551A>G, c.1890+14G>A, c.3338C>T, c.3578G>A, and c.5484C>T.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our study initially evaluated the genotype-phenotype correlation of SCN5A variants with patients of BrS in Vietnam. The presence of SCN5A variants shows a significantly higher risk in the family history of sudden death, syncope, and arrhythmia. Aside from published SCN5A variants, seven additional variants were predicted to cause functional alteration in cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.5). Follow-up studies should be conducted to clarify the impact of SCN5A variants on the clinical characteristics of BrS.",
        "Discussion": "    BrS is a rare inherited cardiac disorder and is generally related to sudden death during sleeping in South East Asia. Most BrS patients are diagnosed without clarifying clinical manifestations, leading to the challenge of early diagnosis. SCN5A gene encodes for the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.5) and is responsible for the incidence of BrS. The SCN5A variants are estimated in up to 30% of the patients. Loss-of-function mutations on SCN5A have been investigated to cause dilated cardiomyopathy and lower expression levels of SCN5A or produce defective Nav1.5 proteins (Wilde & Amin, ). Therefore, genetic screening of SCN5A is necessary for the clinical diagnosis of BrS patients, identification of non-genetic carriers, and selection of promising strategies to prevent genetic carriers in the offspring.\n\n    BrS is well known to be more distributed and severe in males than in females. The vast frequency of affected males in this study was marked at 97.43%, in agreement with prevalence in Asia (Milman et al., ). Several hypotheses have been postulated to clarify the gender discrepancy. Variable sex receptors containing estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are discovered in the cardiac myocytes; thus, the alteration of sex hormone concentration can cause fluctuation in the performance and expression of myocardial ion channels (Lizotte et al., ).\n\n    In our study, the prevalence of SCN5A variants was determined at 25.6%, higher than Taiwanese and Hispanic populations, which accounted for 8% and 16%, respectively (Garcia-Castro et al., ; Juang et al., ). Syncope and SCD are common clinical characteristics in BrS-related SCN5A variants. We found that syncope and a risk family history of SCD were presented in 38.46% and 31.62% of our BrS patients, respectively. The syncope symptom of those who carried SCN5A variants (66.33%) has a significantly higher risk than those of non-carriers (RR = 3.147, [95% CI: 1.668-5.982], p = 0.004). A similar rate was obtained in a meta-analysis, which was evaluated at 35.9% in the occurrence of syncope related to SCN5A (+) (RR = 1.12, [95% CI: 0.87-1.45], p = 0.37) (Raharjo et al., ). Moreover, our data contrast with the result of Yamagata et al. , who did not observe a statistical difference in the family history of SCD (p = 0.5); however, a significantly higher rate of cardiac events was recorded between SCN5A (+) and SCN5A (-) groups (HR = 1.1, 95% CI: 1.1-3.8, p = 0.02) (Yamagata et al., ). In addition, BrS could be related to the major arrhythmic events (MAEs), comprising VT and VF (RR = 3.406, [95% CI: 1.722-5.4], p = 0.0035). Sommariva et al.  indicated that the patients harboring SCN5A variants had an increased risk of MAEs than none of those (p = 0.024) (Sommariva et al., ). Nishii et al. determined the existence of SCN5A variants related to early and frequent recurrence of VF in symptomatic BrS patients, not in the first onset of VF (21.7% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.373) (Nishii et al.,). The variable correlation of BrS clinical phenotype may be produced by inter-individual genetic differences, regulating excitation-contraction physiology and affecting arrhythmia susceptibility among distinct ethnicities (Splawski et al., ; Suh & Vijg, ).\n\n    In the current study, 21 different SCN5A variants were successfully identified. Interestingly, one genomic duplication (Ex2-Ex3 dup) (2/117) was detected in our patients. To date, very few publications have shown the large rearrangement in SCN5A. Eastaugh et al.  first described a major deletion in SCN5A. The c.999-424_1338 + 81del causes loss of exon 9 and 10 of SCN5A, resulting in haploinsufficiency (Eastaugh et al., ). The deletions of SCN5A were expressed in the other regions such as promoter, exons, and even the whole SCN5A gene (Hertz et al., ; Jenewein et al., ; Trujillo-Quintero et al., ). It is a fact that genomic instability always leads to the complete loss of function of the affected gene; therefore, these variants are more likely to induce the BrS phenotype. Several studies have been performed to identify the genomic imbalance in SCN5A, but the frequency rearrangement was 0% (Garcia-Molina et al., ; Koopmann et al., ). These findings suggest that MLPA technique should be included when conducting genetic screening for BrS, even though the rearrangement rate is infrequent.\n\n    The novel variant c.325_327delAAC (N109del) was located on the N-terminal of Nav1.5 protein. N-terminal is a conserved region and plays a crucial role in regulating the cardiac sodium channel. The alteration of N-terminal can cause the increase or decrease of function on the channel, involving a quality control mechanism (Clatot et al., ). Following this mechanism, cells carried mutants use endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) as a protective role to degrade proteins that fail to acquire their native conformation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Brodsky & Scott, ). The majority of our novel missense variants were discovered scattered from S2 to S6 segments of DI, consisting of c.551A>G (H184R), c.754G>A (D252N), c.797T>A (L266H), and c.980G>A (G327E). Most of these variants were predicted as pathogenic variants, except c.551A>G (H184R) as benign (Figure 1; Table 4). The S1-S4 components of each domain are considered as the voltage sensor domain (VSD), which plays a central function in controlling the activity of the channel, while S5-S6 segments assemble to form the pore domain and are responsible for the ion selectivity of Nav1.5 (Chen-Izu et al., ). Thus, minor structure modifications can initiate the dysregulation functioning of the channel. Additionally, two novel variants, c.5389A>T (I1797F) and c.5484C>T (A1828A), were found on the C-terminal of Nav1.5 and predicted as disease-causing and benign, respectively. The substitutions in the C-terminal domain have been explored to modulate channel inactivation (Glaaser et al., ). Although the synonymous c.5484C>T (A1828A) variant did not change the amino acid sequence, it may disrupt mRNA transcription, translation, and splicing (Goymer, ; Stergachis et al., ).\n\n    Together with novel variants, 13 known variants also were identified. The c.1100G>A (R367H, rs28937318) variant has been evaluated to cause loss-of-function in Nav1.5 channel and is also associated with atrial standstill and early repolarization in idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (Kapplinger et al., ; Takehara et al., ; Watanabe et al., ). The c.1890+14G>A variant was found in the intronic region and was predicted benign on the ClinVar database (rs145427253) (Duzkale et al., ). Other variants were determined to occur at 28.57% (6/21) on the internal domain linker, such as DI-II (c.1712G>C (S571T), c.1975C>T (R659W)), DII-III (c.2893C>T (R965C), c.3338C>T (A1113V), c.3578G>A (R1193Q)), and DIII-IV (c.4534C>T (R1511W)) (Abe et al., ; Chimparlee et al., ; Kapplinger et al., ; Meregalli et al., ; Shen et al., ). Of these variants, c.3338C>T (A1113V) and c.3578G>A (R1193Q) were predicted as benign, and damage was evaluated in the other. The mutation rate on the linker domains on Nav1.5 was relatively high, accounting for 35% in the study of Kapplinger et al.  Several studies have reported the affection of SCN5A variants on internal domain linkers. They indicated that these linkers play a valuable function in pathogenesis (Smits et al., ; Wehrens et al., ; Yamamura et al., ). Variant c.2236G>A (E746K) (DII/ S1-S2) was a hot spot for BrS and related to the reduced activation process on Nav1.5 channel (Huang et al., ; Zaytseva et al., ). An alteration c.2678G>A caused the change of amino acids from Arg to His at position 893, also detected on DII. This variant induced loss-of-function, showing a significant decrease in the current density peak than the wild-type through patch clamp (Ishikawa et al., ). The c.4171G>A (G1391R) variant was first reported by Szperl et al.  in the Polish population. Genotype and phenotype analysis showed that the carriers with G1391R variant presented a higher risk of cardiac events in females than in males (Szperl et al., ). The minor deletion c.4850_4852delTCT (F1617del) variant was found to be associated with LQT3 syndrome, which induced the change of fast inactivation by decreasing gating charges (Chen et al., ). According to te Riele et al. , the missense variant c.5693G>A (R1898H) led to a decrease at 36% in peak sodium current (p = 0.002), also in the abundance of Nav1.5 (p = 0.005) on fluorescence microscopy and N-Cadherin (p = 0.026) clusters at the intercalated disk (te Riele et al., ).\n\n    Our study's genotype-phenotype correlation and the functional prediction of all variants were only approached by statistical analysis and bioinformatic tools. Further, follow-up studies should be performed to provide insight into the role of SCN5A variants in the severity of BrS and promptly specify the most appropriate treatment for each patient.",

        "Title": "    Genetic Characteristics and Transcriptional Regulation of Sodium Channel Related Genes in Chinese Patients With Brugada Syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Objective: To investigate the genetic characteristics and transcriptional regulation of the SCN5A gene of Brugada syndrome (BrS) patients in China.\n\n    Methods: Using PubMed, Medline, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), and Wanfang Database, Chinese patients with BrS who underwent SCN5A gene testing were studied.\n\n    Results: A total of 27 suitable studies involving Chinese BrS patients who underwent the SCN5A gene test were included. A total of 55 SCN5A gene mutations/variations were reported in Chinese BrS patients, including 10 from southern China and 45 from northern China. Mutations/variations of BrS patients from southern China mostly occurred in the regions of the alpha-subunit of Nav1.5, including DIII (Domain III), DIV, DIII-DIV, C-terminus regions, and the 3'UTR region. Furthermore, we analyzed the post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) throughout the Nav1.5 protein encoded by SCN5A and found that the PTM changes happened in 72.7% of BrS patients from southern China and 26.7% from northern China.\n\n    Conclusions: SCN5A mutations/variations of BrS patients in southern China mostly occurred in the DIII-DIV to C-terminus region and the 3'-UTR region of the SCN5A gene, different from northern China. PTM changes were consistent with the mutation/variation distribution of SCN5A, which might be involved in the regulation of the pathogenesis of BrS patients.",
        "Introduction": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inheritable arrhythmogenic disease. The typical electrocardiographic manifestations include ST segment elevation >=2 mm and T wave inversion on the right thoracic lead (V1-V3) of ECG. BrS is prone to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death while the heart structure is normal. It is more prevalent in Asian population with an onset age of 30-40 years old, and the ratio of male to female is 8-10:1. The mortality accounted for 4-12% of sudden death each year and even for 20% sudden death without organic heart disease in Southeast Asia.\n\n    Up to date, 23 genes have been confirmed to be related to BrS, including gene mutations/variations that lead to ion channel dysfunction such as sodium, calcium, and potassium ions. About 30-35% of BrS patients were identified with pathogenic mutant genes, while SCN5A mutations/variations encoding the Nav1.5 alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel accounted for 20 to 30%. Currently, the recommended treatment for BrS is ICD implantation and medication (quinidine, isoproterenol, etc.); however, therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory.\n\n    The mutations/variations from BrS patients can significantly reduce the inward Na+ current by delaying activation, accelerating inactivation, delaying reactivation, or reducing the membrane expression of ion channels. Furthermore, the decrease in the inward Na+ current has influence on the depolarization and repolarization of the cardiac action potential, thus causing the generation of typical ECG of BrS. Genetic distribution characteristics of BrS on the SCN5A mutations/variations from the world and Japan had been reported. However, there are no genetic distribution analyses on the SCN5A mutation/variation location sites in Chinese BrS patients until now. In the present study, we aim to analyze the reported SCN5A mutation/variation location sites of Chinese BrS patients and predict the PTMs affected by the mutations/variations.",
        "Methods": "    Two investigators searched Medline, PubMed, CNKI, and Wanfang Database. The query terms were \"Brugada syndrome\" \"China\" and \"SCN5A.\" Articles published in Chinese or English in peer-reviewed journals that met the following criteria were included in our study.\n\n    A. Inclusion of subjects with BrS were as previously defined.\n\n    B. Chinese patients.\n\n    C. Who underwent SCN5A gene DNA sequencing.\n\n    In addition, we also contacted the corresponding author of several studies in order to obtain more specific experimental data that were not included in the article. In order to resolve any difference or uncertainty between the two investigators, a third investigator was responsible for reexamining the source data and consultation.\n\n    First, we retrieved the amino acid sequence and analyzed the domain details of the alpha-subunit of SCN5A protein in the following website: https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q14524, then predicted the PTM sites with the software on the amino acid sites and mapped on the mutation/variation sites reported from the literature in China. Furthermore, we analyzed the change of PTMs in the natural variant.\n\n    Categorical variables were expressed as percentage and analyzed using the chi-square test. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.",
        "Results": "    A flow chart of the data research is shown in Figure 1. We excluded 306 unqualified studies that did not match the inclusion criteria or were duplicates. A total of 27 suitable studies were included, and details are shown in Table 1. Duplicated loci were removed, and a total of 55 mutations/variations including 45 sites from northern China and 10 sites from southern China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Hainan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Taiwan) were included. Further analysis of these loci was performed as detailed below.\n\n    The Nav1.5 channel has four highly conserved homologous transmembrane-spanning domains (DI-DIV) that are connected by an interdomain linker (IDL), and each domain consists of six transmembrane alpha spins (S1-S6). In order to visualize the distribution of these loci, we marked the mutation/variation sites on Nav1.5 protein (excluding introns and 3'UTR, which were not translated into amino acids), as shown in Figure 2. The blue dots represented the SCN5A mutations/variations from northern China, and the red dots represented the SCN5A mutations/variations from southern China.\n\n    The whole SCN5A gene was divided into 5'-UTR, N-Term (N-terminus), D I, IDL I-II, DII, IDL II-III, DIII, IDL III-IV, DIV, C-Term (C-terminus), 3'-UTR, and other regions. Mutation/variation loci distribution is shown in Figure 3. Distinguished by those 12 parts, the distribution in southern China and northern China were 5'-UTR (0 vs. 0), N-Term (0 vs. 11.1%), DI (10 vs. 8.9%), IDL I-II (0 vs. 22.2%), DII (0 vs. 6.7%), IDL II-III (0 vs. 11.1%), DIII (10 vs. 2.2%), IDL III-IV (0 vs. 0), DIV (30 vs. 6.7%), C-Term (30 vs. 8.9%), 3'-UTR (10 vs. 2.2%), and other (10 vs. 20%), respectively. It was found that SCN5A mutations/variations in northern China were mainly concentrated (60%) in 5'-UTR, N-Term, DI, IDL I-II, DII, and IDLII-III while mostly distributed (80%) in DIII, IDL III-IV, DIV, C-Term, and 3'-UTR in southern China.\n\n    Furthermore, the locations of SCN5A gene mutations/variants were divided into five parts as follows: N-Term, Transmembrane regions, IDL, C-Term, and others as shown in Figure 4A. The mutation/variation site distributions of SCN5A in southern China and northern China were 0, 50, 0, 30, and 20%, and 11.1, 24.5, 33.3, 8.9, and 22.2%, respectively (p = 0.000).\n\n    On the other hand, the locations of SCN5A gene mutations/variants were divided into three parts as follows: before-DIII, after-DIII, and others as shown in Figure 4B. The mutation/variation site distributions of SCN5A in southern China and northern China were 10, 80, and 10% and 60, 20, and 20%, respectively (p = 0.001).\n\n    Then, we compared the distributions of mutations/variations among China (southern China and northern China), Japan, and the world, as shown in Figure 5A. Japanese data refer to a Japanese multicenter register, and the global data are from the website http://triad.fsm.it/cardmoc/. We distinguished the SCN5A mutation sites on the protein Nav1.5 structure by N-term, Transmembrane regions, IDL, and C-term and found 0, 62.5, 0, and 37.5% for each part in southern China; 14.3, 31.4, 42.9, and 11.4% in northern China; 4.4, 66.7, 20, and 8.9% in Japan; and 4.8, 71, 18.4, and 5.8% in the world, respectively (p = 0.000).\n\n    In addition, the structure of Nav1.5 protein was divided into two parts: DI, IDL I-II, DII, and IDL II-III were set as the first half part (before-DIII), and DIII, IDL III-IV, DIV, and C-Term were set as the second half part (post-DIII) as shown in Figure 5B. The results indicated that 88.9% of the mutation sites were located in the post-DIII region in southern China, while only 22.9% in northern China, 42.2% in Japan, and 47% in the world (p = 0.000).\n\n    As mutations that cause changes in amino acids may have influences on protein modification, we predictively analyzed the PTMs of SCN5A with software and mapped on the mutations/variations in China (Table 2), and found a tendency for amino acids to acquire more modification sites after mutation. PTM change was likely to occur in 72.7% of BrS patients from southern China and 26.7% from northern China (p = 0.000).",
        "Conclusion": "    The mutation sites of BrS patients from southern China mostly distributed in the DIII-DIV to C-terminus region and the 3'-UTR region of the SCN5A gene, which was different from northern China, Asia, and other countries around the world. PTM change might be involved in the regulation of the pathogenesis of BrS.\n\n    While BrS is a rare disease, it is especially young-male predominant and accounts for 20% sudden death without organic heart disease in Southeast Asia, which causes more and more concerns. We analyzed the genetic characteristics of SCN5A mutations/variations and found that SCN5A mutations/variations of BrS patients from southern China mostly occurred in the DIII-DIV to C-terminus region and the 3'-UTR region of the SCN5A gene, which was different from northern China, Japan, and the world. PTM changes predicted by the mutations/variations may be involved in the regulation of the pathogenesis of BrS. Our findings provide new ideas and directions to further study the role of Nav1.5 in the pathogenesis of BrS.",
        "Discussion": "    Our main findings in the study of the genetic characteristics of SCN5A in Chinese BrS patients were as follows: (1) More SCN5A gene mutations/variations were found in northern China than in southern China. (2) SCN5A mutations/variations of BrS patients in southern China mostly occurred in the DIII-DIV to C-terminus region and the 3'-UTR region of the SCN5A gene. (3) PTM changes were consistent with the mutation/variation distribution of SCN5A, which might be involved in the regulation of the pathogenesis of BrS patients.\n\n    BrS can be found all over the world, and the prevalence of BrS can reach 0.5%0 in high-prevalence areas. BrS is the leading cause of death for men less than 40 years old, only second to the death rate of traffic accidents in Southeast Asian countries. In southern China, BrS patients were anticipated to have a relatively high incidence rate. However, our study revealed that SCN5A gene mutations published were found to be more in northern China than southern China. The possible reasons may be that BrS is a rare disease, and the total number of cases reported at present was not large and patients in many studies did not undergo DNA sequencing, which results in data bias. We will continue to pay attention to relevant reports and continue to collect cases to further confirm the data.\n\n    Further analysis showed that the locations of mutation sites had their own characteristics in southern China. Most mutation sites were clustered in the transmembrane regions in southern China statistically different from northern China. Mutation sites were mostly located in the second half part of the protein structure (post-DIII) in southern China, while in the first half part positions (before-DIII) in northern China, Japan, and the world.\n\n    The SCN5A gene, located on chromosome 3p21, contains 28 exons with a total length of about 80 kb and encodes the alpha-subunit protein Nav1.5. Some mutations lead to a decrease in current density, others do not lead to a decrease in INa, while some location-specific SCN5A mutations resulted in poorer outcomes during follow-up. As different mutation locations lead to different pathological changes, we try to analyze whether protein functional modifications are involved in the mechanism.\n\n    PTM is a crucial modification method for protein transcription, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation, which may bring a broad range of effects, such as protein stability, enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, and interactions. Multiple kinases including cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK II) phosphorylate regulate Nav1.5 channel physiology and pathology including SUMOylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, etc. In our previous study, we revealed that miR-192-5p bound to the 3'-UTR of human SCN5A to negatively regulate the expression of Nav1.5 and reduce INa density. Our study demonstrated an important post-transcriptional role of miR-192-5p in post-transcriptional regulation of Nav1.5.\n\n    Hence, we predicted the PTM sites with software and mapped on the mutations/variations in China. PTM change was likely to occur in 72.7% of BrS patients in southern China and 26.7% in northern China, suggesting that PTMs might be involved in the regulation of the pathogenesis of BrS, which provided new ideas and directions to further study the role of Nav1.5 in the pathogenesis of BrS.",

        "Title": "    Identification of Novel SCN5A Single Nucleotide Variants in Brugada Syndrome: A Territory-Wide Study From Hong Kong",
        "Abstract": "    The aim of this study is to report on the genetic composition of Brugada syndrome (BrS) patients undergoing genetic testing in Hong Kong.\n\n    Patients with suspected BrS who presented to the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong between 1997 and 2019, and underwent genetic testing, were analyzed retrospectively.\n\n    A total of 65 subjects were included (n = 65, 88% male, median presenting age 42 [30-54] years old, 58% type 1 pattern). Twenty-two subjects (34%) showed abnormal genetic test results, identifying the following six novel, pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in SCN5A: c.674G > A, c.2024-11T > A, c.2042A > C, c.4279G > T, c.5689C > T, c.429del. Twenty subjects (31%) in the cohort suffered from spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) and 18 (28%) had incident VT/VF over a median follow-up of 83 [Q1-Q3: 52-112] months. Univariate Cox regression demonstrated that syncope (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.27 [0.95-19.30]; P = 0.059), prior VT/VF (HR: 21.34 [5.74-79.31; P < 0.0001) and T-wave axis (HR: 0.970 [0.944-0.998]; P = 0.036) achieved P < 0.10 for predicting incident VT/VF. After multivariate adjustment, only prior VT/VF remained a significant predictor (HR: 12.39 [2.97-51.67], P = 0.001).\n\n    This study identified novel mutations in SCN5A in a Chinese cohort of BrS patients.",
        "Introduction": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an ion channelopathy with significant genetic heterogeneity. The most common mutations are loss-of-function variants in SCN5A, the gene responsible for the alpha-subunit of the Na+ channel. Since 2001, more than 80 mutations in the SCN5A gene have been associated with BrS. Mutations in other genes encoding for K+, Ca2+ and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels have also been described. This condition was believed to be a Mendelian disease with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and incomplete penetrance. However, recent evidence suggests that this may not be true. A study investigated co-segregation of SCN5A mutations amongst large genotyped families, demonstrating that some affected family members did not carry the familial mutation. Therefore, mutations in other genes may be responsible for BrS. Another possibility is incomplete penetrance despite the presence of the mutated gene or variable expressivity. Whilst the genetic epidemiology of BrS has been extensively studied in Western populations, data from Asian countries are less complete.\n\n    A large multicenter registry from Japan examined the genotype-phenotype correlation of SCN5A mutations in BrS, demonstrating that those with SCN5A mutations showed greater conduction abnormalities and arrhythmic risks. A study from a tertiary hospital in Thailand investigated the genetic makeup of 40 BrS patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implants, reporting that the SCN5A-R1193Q variant is associated with cardiac conduction disturbances. In a Korean study, 21 BrS patients or their family members underwent genetic testing, demonstrating SCN5A mutations in four patients. In Chinese cohorts, the data remain limited with few studies from Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, and Singapore. These were reported as case series or included only a subset of patients in a sudden death cohort. In this territory-wide study from Hong Kong, we analyzed the genetic makeup of BrS patients, who underwent genetic testing over a 21-year period.",
        "Methods": "    This retrospective study was approved by The Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Reference number: 2019.338). This study included consecutive patients suspected of BrS undergoing genetic testing between 1997 and 2019 identified from a territory-wide search of the electronic health records managed by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. The diagnosis of BrS was confirmed by review of patient case notes and documented ECGs by SL and GT using the 2017 diagnostic criteria proposed by the Expert Consensus Statement. The joint guidelines from Heart Rhythm, European and Asian Society guidelines were adopted for drug challenge test due to the use of older guidelines in past practice. Diagnosis was confirmed by an expert clinical electrophysiologist (NM) with more than 20 years of cardiac electrophysiology experience. Type 1 (coved pattern) is defined as ascending and high take-off of >=2 mm at the end of QRS duration, followed by coved or rectilinear down-sloping ST-segment, and negative symmetric T-wave in >=1 right precordial lead, V1 and V2. Type 2 (saddle-back pattern) is defined as high take-off r' of >=2 mm, followed by convex ST-elevation remaining at >=0.5 mm relative to isoelectric line, and positive T-wave in V2 (Tpeak > STminimum) or T-wave of variable morphology in V1.\n\n    Clinical data was extracted from the electronic health records. The following baseline clinical data were collected: (1) sex; (2) age of initial Brugada pattern presentation; (3) follow-up period; (4) type of Brugada pattern and presence of fever at initial presentation; (5) family history of BrS and ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sudden cardiac death (SCD); (5) manifestation of syncope and if present, the number of episodes; (6) manifestation of VT/VF and if present, the number of episodes; (7) performance of sodium channel blocker challenge test, electrophysiological study (EPS), BrS-related genetic screening, and their respective results and (8) implantation of ICD. Incident VT/VF events were those that occurred after initial presentation to the hospital. Spontaneous VT/VF included events that occurred both before and after presentation.\n\n    Automated measurements from baseline ECGs were extracted, including (1) heart rate; (2) P wave duration; (3) PR interval; (4) QRS duration; (5) QT and QTc interval; (6) P wave, QRS and T wave axis; (7) S-wave amplitude in lead V1 and R-wave amplitude in lead V5.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The coding exons and the flanking introns (10 bp) of each gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (primer sequences and protocol available upon request). Sanger sequencing was performed for SCN5A gene. The pathogenicity of novel missense variants was analyzed by Alamut Visual (Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) with Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2), Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT), MutationTaster, and Assessing Pathogenicity Probability in Arrhythmia by Integrating Statistical Evidence (APPRAISE)1 and that of novel splicing variants by Splice Site Finder-like, MaxEntScan, NNSPLIC, GeneSplicer, and Human Splicing Finder, wherever appropriate. Splicing variants were considered to be damaging if there was a >10% lower score when compared with the wild-type prediction. Allele frequencies among populations were referred to the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)2. Interpretation of genetic findings was made by an expert pathologist with a specialist interest in cardiovascular genetics (CM).\n\n    All statistical analysis was performed using Stata MP (Version 13.0). Categorical variables were expressed as total number (percentages). Continuous variables were expressed as mean +- standard deviation. Significant differences between groups were determined using the Fisher's Exact test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n    The primary outcome of this study was incident VT/VF. Follow-up duration was defined as the time difference (in months) between the initial date of Brugada pattern presentation and the first occurrence of VT/VF post-diagnosis. Univariate Cox regression was used to identify significant predictors of the primary outcome. Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with the corresponding P-values are reported. Variables with P < 0.10 were included in the multivariate model. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for the significant variable(s) in multivariate Cox regression and significant differences were determined by the log-rank test.",
        "Results": "    In this study, patients who were diagnosed with BrS (n = 545), and subsequently underwent genetic testing (n = 56; 88% male, median presenting age 42 [30-54] years old, 58% with a type 1 Brugada pattern) were included. The baseline clinical characteristics and electrocardiographic variables of the cohort is presented in Table 1. The yield of the genetic testing was 34%, with 22 subjects showing a genetic mutation. A total of 15 genetic mutations in SCN5A were identified (Table 2). Of these, six mutations were novel in terms of association with BrS outside this cohort from Hong Kong. These were c.674G > A, c.2024-11T > A, c.2042A > C, c. 4279G > T, c.5689C > T, c.429del. All except for c.87G > A were considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to the Practice Guidelines for the Evaluation of Pathogenicity and the Reporting of Sequence Variants in Clinical Molecular Genetics by the Association for Clinical Genetic Science. The detailed clinical characteristics of patients with these novel mutations are shown in Table 3.\n\n    Most patients who tested positive had a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Four patients had double SNP mutations (c.87G > A and c.3578G > A; c.677C > T and c.674G > A; c.2893C > T and c.3578G > A; c.3578G > A and c.5350G > A) and one had a triple mutation (c.1141-3C > A, c.1673A > G, and c.5457T > C). Most in the cohort had isolated BrS with two exceptions. One patient had an overlapping phenotype with long QT syndrome. The other patient had the c.5862_5873del mutation in the calcium channel pore-forming subunit, CACNA1C. This was a male patient who has a past medical history of recurrent syncope, with right bundle branch block but no Brugada pattern on the ECG, and sinus pauses with junctional escape rhythms during the daytime from 24-h Holter study. His son died from sudden nocturnal death syndrome.\n\n    Over a median follow-up of 83 [Q1-Q3: 52-112] months, 18 (28%) patients developed incident VT/VF. There was no significant difference in VT/VF occurrence between genetic positive and negative groups. Univariate Cox regression was used to identify significant predictors. Syncope (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.27 [0.95-19.30]; P = 0.059), prior VT/VF (HR: 21.34 [5.74-79.31; P < 0.0001) and T-wave axis (HR: 0.970 [0.944-0.998]; P = 0.036) achieved P < 0.10. After multivariate adjustment, only prior VT/VF remained a significant predictor (HR: 12.39 [2.97-51.67], P = 0.001). A Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrating freedom from spontaneous VT/VF during follow-up stratified by prior VT/VF status is shown in Figure 1. Those with prior VT/VF had a higher risk of incident VT/VF (P < 0.001, log-rank test).",
        "Conclusion": "    This study identified novel mutations in SCN5A in a Chinese cohort of BrS patients. Future studies are needed to determine their effects on sodium channel function, expression or trafficking, and to test for mutations in other disease-causing genes in BrS.",
        "Discussion": "    The main findings of this study are the identification of novel mutations in SCN5A and one novel mutation in CACNA1C in a Chinese cohort of BrS patients, and demonstration of abnormal T-wave axis as a predictor of incident VT/VF. Previously, altered T-wave axis was found to predict SCD in a middle-age adult population. The focus of this discussion are the novel mutations detected by genetic testing. Those that were previously described in other cohorts are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.\n\n    The voltage-gated Na+ channels are made of large alpha subunits associated with other proteins, such as beta subunits (SCN1B, SCN2B, and SCN3B). The SCN5A gene encodes for the alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel. Loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A have been associated with BrS, sick sinus syndrome (SSS), progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD, or Lenegre-Lev disease) and overlap disorders between these conditions. An international compendium of putative BrS-associated genetic mutations in SCN5A was published in 2010. This study identifies six novel mutations in SCN5A in BrS, which have not been reported in cohorts outside of our geographical region.\n\n    The c.674G > A mutation, which was previously described in a dilated cardiomyopathy cohort, leads to a reduction in the peak sodium current. This is expected to reduce conduction velocity of the propagating cardiac potentials, predisposing to the development of ventricular arrhythmias by reentry. However, our one patient harboring this mutation also carried the c.677C > T SNP. He had a family history of BrS. However, despite having a spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern, he had a negative EPS with no complaints. This mutation has been identified as causative for long QT syndrome type 3. Another variant at the same amino acid residue, p.(Arg225Pro), was associated with multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions and severe cardiac conduction disturbances.\n\n    The c.2024-11T > A mutation leads to abolition of the acceptor splice site and creates a cryptic site upstream in SCN5A, and was identified by our team in a 61-year old female presenting with dizziness and syncope. The c.2042A > C missense mutation leads to the amino acid change, H681P, between domains I and II. We have previously reported this case of a fever-induced type 1 Brugada pattern with positive flecainide test but negative EPS. No syncope or arrhythmic events were observed on follow-up. Nevertheless, functional characterization demonstrated that this mutation led to negative shifts in the steady-state activation and inactivation curves, but had no effect on the recovery from inactivation, which together reduced the sodium current. The c. 4279G > T mutation was previously reported by us for the first time in association with BrS with recurrent VF. This mutation was previously associated with malignant VT/VF after lidocaine use in acute myocardial infarction. The c. 5689C > T mutation in exon 28 leads to the R1897W amino acid change. It was previously linked to early onset lone atrial fibrillation but not a disease-causing mutation in long QT syndrome with minimal effects on the QT interval. This study extends its association to BrS for the first time. The c.429del mutation leads to the Asn144Thrfs*57 frameshift in SCN5A. This novel variant was previously reported by our team and is predicted to produce premature protein truncation. It was identified in a young male adult who presented with a witness convulsion and type 1 Brugada pattern that was precipitated by the treadmill test.\n\n    Finally, we also identified a novel mutation in CACNA1C in a patient with suspected BrS. The calcium current is mediated by L-type calcium channels (LTCC). Each LTCC consists of four protein subunits alpha1 (CACNA1C), beta2 (CACNB2), alpha2 (CACNA2D), and delta (CACNA2D). Similar to SCN5A mutations, Antzelevitch et al. suggested that loss-of-function mutations in these genes precipitate abnormal trafficking, reduced expression or function of LTCC, leading to reduced calcium influx current during phase 2 of the cardiac action potential. As a result, BrS secondary to the reduced functionality of LTCCs are associated with shorter QT intervals compared to classical SCN5A mutation BrS where QT interval remains unaltered. The c.5862_5873del mutation was previously classified as likely benign. However, in our case, the patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia, SSS and right bundle branch block without Brugada pattern. His son died from sudden nocturnal death.\n\n    Several limitations of this study should be noted. Firstly, this was a retrospective study without standardization of the genetic testing performed. These patients underwent SCN5A testing without next generation sequencing (NGS) of their entire genomes. Therefore, contributions from mutations in other genes such as SCN10A could not be identified. Indeed, a study from Japan of 40 Japanese probands who were clinically suspected with BrS and were negative for mutations in major BrS-related genes were found to have mutations in SCN10A. One patient in the cohort had CACNA1C and other genes tested only because the son had died suddenly from sudden nocturnal death. Future studies should re-examine these patients using NGS. Finally, given that this was a clinical study, it was not possible to study the effects of the respective genetic mutations on function, expression or membrane trafficking. Future studies should examine ion channel activation, inactivation and recovery properties in patch clamping studies.",

        "Title": "    Genetic basis of sudden death after COVID-19 vaccination in Thailand",
        "Abstract": "    Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination reduces morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); unfortunately, it is associated with serious adverse events, including sudden unexplained death (SUD).\n\n    We aimed to study the genetic basis of SUD after COVID-19 vaccination in Thailand.\n\n    From April to December 2021, cases with natural but unexplained death within 7 days of COVID-19 vaccination were enrolled for whole exome sequencing.\n\n    Thirteen were recruited, aged between 23 and 72 years; 10 (77%) were men, 12 were Thai; and 1 was Australian. Eight (61%) died after receiving the first dose of vaccine, and 7 (54%) died after receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; however, there were no significant correlations between SUD and either the number or the type of vaccine. Fever was self-reported in 3 cases. Ten (77%) and 11 (85%) died within 24 hours and 3 days of vaccination, respectively. Whole exome sequencing analysis revealed that 5 cases harbored SCN5A variants that had previously been identified in patients with Brugada syndrome, giving an SCN5A variant frequency of 38% (5 of 13). This is a significantly higher rate than that observed in Thai SUD cases occurring 8-30 days after COVID-19 vaccination during the same period (10% [1 of 10]), in a Thai SUD cohort studied before the COVID-19 pandemic (12% [3 of 25]), and in our in-house exome database (12% [386 of 3231]).\n\n    These findings suggest that SCN5A variants may be associated with SUD within 7 days of COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of vaccine type, number of vaccine dose, and presence of underlying diseases or postvaccine fever.",
        "Introduction": "    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a devastating infectious disease that has had resulted in health, social, and economic disasters worldwide. Vaccines are 1 intervention that is known to reduce the risk of severe disease and death. Unfortunately, serious adverse events after immunization with any type of COVID-19 vaccine have been demonstrated. These include fulminant myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmia, and sudden unexplained death (SUD). Although fatal cases with postmortem investigations have been reported, few studies have investigated the genetic basis of SUD after COVID-19 vaccination.",
        "Methods": "    From April to December 2021, all cases of unexplained death occurring within 7 days of COVID-19 vaccination were sent for medicolegal investigation by forensic pathologists of the National Forensic Network comprising 9 medical centers throughout Thailand. All cases tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. No consent from relatives was required because the autopsy was legally mandated. Those in whom the cause of death was found to be natural were sent for genetic studies. The research reported in this article adhered to Helsinki Declaration guidelines.\n\n    Genetic testing was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (institutional review board no. 264/62). Postmortem blood was obtained for genomic DNA extraction; then, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed as described previously. Briefly, the sequencing libraries were enriched using a SureSelect Human All Exon V7 kit (Agilent Technologies [Santa Clara, CA])\" here for SureSelect Human All Exon V7 kit and were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA])\" for Illumina HiSeq 4000 device. The only unequivocal, major genetic locus responsible for Brugada syndrome (BrS) is SCN5A-SCN10A,   and its common variants could have susceptible effects on the phenotype. We therefore used minor allele frequencies of <5% as a filtering criterion for this SCN5A-SCN10A locus. Minor allele frequencies of <1% were used for all other genes. In addition, to be considered pathogenic, variants had to be reported in the literature in patients with BrS, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, or SUD.",
        "Results": "    Thirteen cases comprising 10 men (77%) and 3 women (23%), aged between 23 and 72 years, were recruited (Table 1 ); 12 were Thai and 1 was Australian. Underlying diseases were reported in 5 patients, but none were arrhythmia. No cases had a history of SUD in family members. Eight (61%), 4 (31%), and 1 (8%) died after receiving the first, second, and third doses of vaccine, respectively. The total number of individuals receiving 1, 2, and 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in Thailand during the same period were 51,295,617 (49%), 46,145,566 (44%), and 7,002,986 (7%) doses, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the number of vaccine and SUD (Online Supplemental Table S1). SUD occurred after all types of vaccines used in Thailand, with 7 (54%), 2 (15%), 2 (15%), 1 (8%), and 1 (8%) deaths after receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), BBIBP-CorV (Vero Cells) (Sinopharm [Beijing]), CoronaVac (Sinovac), BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), respectively (Table 1). During the same period in Thailand, the number of administered doses of vaccines were 41,839,326 (41%), 14,091,514 (14%), 27,607,314 (27%), and 17,587,080 (18%) for AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Pfizer/BioNTech, respectively (no formal data for Moderna). There was no significant correlation between the type of vaccine and SUD (Online Supplemental Table S2). Fever after vaccination was noted in the self-reported web-based registry in 3 cases (23%). Ten (77%) and 11 (85%) deaths occurred within 24 hours and 3 days of vaccination, respectively. In 6 cases (46%), the autopsy identified no explainable causes of death. Another 6 were found to have cardiac causes including coronary atherosclerosis in 4 (31%), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 1 (8%), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 1 (8%). The remaining case had thalassemia, leading to hemochromatosis and liver cirrhosis.\n\n    Five cases harbored variants in SCN5A (Table 1); 4 were men, aged between 23 and 46 years, who died within 3 days of the last COVID-19 vaccination. Only 2 of our 5 SUD cases with SCN5A variants reported fever. Six other SUD cases in our cohort harbored variants in other genes, which were previously reported to be associated with cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, or SUD. Two had no variants, consistent with the filtering criteria.\n\n    The frequency of SCN5A variants in our cohort was 38% (5 of 13). For comparative purposes, we thereafter determined the frequency of SCN5A variants in Thai SUD cases occurring 8-30 days after COVID-19 vaccination during the same period. The rate in these SUD cases that occurred after 7 days was considerably lower (1 of 10 [10%]; Online Supplementary Table S3), as were the rates in a Thai cohort of SUD before the COVID-19 pandemic (3 of 25 [12%]), and in our in-house exome database enrolling patients and their parents with various rare diseases (186 of 3231 [12%]), after applying the same filtering criteria (Figure 1A). The odds ratios for SCN5A variants and SUD in these other groups and that of the present study are shown in Figure 1B. Evidence from our present study supports the hypothesis that SUD within 7 days of COVID-19 vaccination is associated with SCN5A variants.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our study suggests that SCN5A variants could be associated with SUD within 7 days of COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of vaccine type, number of vaccine dose, and presence of underlying diseases or postvaccine fever. Given the observational nature of our study, these findings should be further explored and confirmed in surveillance programs in other settings. Until then, it seems prudent to closely monitor individuals who harbor variants in SCN5A, and possibly in other genes that predispose to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiomyopathies, for 7 days after the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of preexisting underlying diseases and the presence of vaccination-associated fever.",
        "Discussion": "    This study aimed to identify associations between genetic variants and SUD that occurred within 7 days of COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 13 variants in 7 genes were identified by WES in 11 of 13 cases (85%), compared with approximately one-third to one-half of the diagnostic yield of WES for patients with previously undiagnosed diseases.   This suggests that SUD after COVID-19 vaccination may have a genetic susceptibility more commonly identified by WES, compared with other rare and undiagnosed diseases.\n\n    Four SCN5A variants were found in 5 cases. All have previously been identified in patients with BrS. Two variants:c.833A>G in case 3 and c.3068G>A in case 5:had low allele frequencies: 0 and 2 alleles, respectively, out of 6462 alleles in our in-house exome database. Case 3 also had DCM, which could possibly have resulted from SCN5A variants, suggesting that SCN5A c.833A>G (p.His278Arg) is a severe loss-of-function variant. The frequency of SCN5A c.3269C>T (p.Pro1090Leu) identified in case 1 is 0.013 (84 of 6462) in our database. In addition to carrying the SCN5A variant, case 1 harbored a c.1157T>G (p.Phe386Cys) variant in SCN10A, previously found in patients with BrS (Table 1). Variants in SCN5A and SCN10A are a major SUD risk locus. Although the SCN5A c.3578G>A (p.Arg1193Gln) variants found in cases 2 and 4 have an allele frequency of 0.049 (323 of 6462) in our database, these have previously been demonstrated to encode a protein with aberrant function contributing to various cardiac arrhythmias, including long QT syndrome and BrS. It was also previously identified in 2 of 25 (8%) Thai SUD cases. Moreover, case 2 had schizophrenia and was prescribed with clonazepam, diazepam, and fluoxetine. Psychotropic drugs are associated with sudden death of cardiac origin, especially diazepam, which causes a faster block and unblock of Na+ channels, and may therefore aggravate abnormalities caused by the aberrant SCN5A variant. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that all 4 SCN5A variants had a contributory role in the SUD of these 5 cases.\n\n    Six other SUD cases in our cohort harbored variants in 5 other genes. Three cases carried likely pathogenic variants in TTN, a huge gene encoding a 34,350 -amino acid protein in which mutations are known to cause cardiomyopathies. The heterozygous splice site c.20165-1G>A variant identified in case 9 was previously reported in the ClinVar database in an individual with DCM. Case 9 was also heterozygous for a nonsense variant, c.939G>A (p.Trp313Ter) in DNMT3A, mutations in which cause Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome, a syndrome with possible cardiac abnormalities, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Case 10 with underlying beta thalassemia was heterozygous for the c.6668A>T (p.His2223Leu) variant in TTN previously reported in a patient with cardiomyopathy. Case 11 was homozygous for the TTN c.18530T>G (p.Leu6177Arg) variant, which was recently identified heterozygously in a 25-year-old Thai male with SUD. Cases 6, 7, and 8 harbored variants in SCN3B, MYBPC3, and SLC22A5, which were previously associated with BrS, left ventricular hypertrabeculation, and autosomal recessive primary carnitine deficiency with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden death, respectively.\n\n    The association between SCN5A variants and SUD within 7 days of COVID-19 vaccination (Figure 1) might be due to COVID-19 vaccination unmasking fatal arrhythmia in individuals with SCN5A. Fever is a well-known trigger for arrhythmia in BrS. A possible mechanism might therefore include an indirect effect of the vaccine in which an individual with a susceptible pathogenic SCN5A variant had vaccine-induced fever and malaise serving as a precipitating factor leading to fatal arrhythmias. Nonetheless, since fever did not seem to play a major role in our study, the other possibility is a direct effect. The vaccine may cause myocarditis in the right ventricular outflow tract area, which in turn unmasks the preexisting aberrant conduction in individuals with SCN5A  and leads to death. It is important to note that the possible association of genetic variants and SUD after COVID-19 vaccination in our study while plausible is primarily hypothesis generating and must be independently confirmed by other studies.",

        "Title": "    Venetoclax combined with azacitidine in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm: a case report and comprehensive review on the current and future treatment",
        "Abstract": "    Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an extremely rare hematological malignancy with a highly aggressive behavior and median survival of <2 years. Especially, most BPDCN patients present with extensive and non-specific skin lesions, usually leading to misdiagnosis as a skin disease and delay therapy. As for treatment, most patients with BPDCN experience relapse shortly after treatment with the traditional regimens. The alleviation of skin symptoms reflects the effects of clinical treatments. Herein, we report a case of a 71-year-old man with intermittent and gradually expanding skin lesions over his chest, abdomen, and back for 1 year. On admission, physical examination revealed extensive skin lesions and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Laboratory examinations showed pancytopenia and numerous malignant cells in the peripheral blood smear (60%), bone marrow aspirate smear (73.5%). Immunophenotyping using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry presented large numbers of BPDCN cells in the bone marrow, cervical lymph nodes and dermal tissue. PET/CT revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly. Once the diagnosis was identified as BPDCN, the patient began treatment with the oral BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax and subcutaneously administered azacitidine. After the first course, skin lesions reduced markedly and complete remission was achieved in the bone marrow. Our study and current cumulative data according to reviewing systematically suggest that venetoclax combined with azacitidine is safe, effective, and applicable in the treatment of BPDCN, especially for elderly relapsed/refractory patients. This study, therefore, significantly contributes to the literature on the current and future treatment for BPDCN.",
        "Introduction": "    Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) originates from the malignant clonal expansion of precursor plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and is an extremely rare hematological malignancy with a highly aggressive behavior and poor prognosis with a median survival of <2 years. The incidence rate of BPDCN in the American population was only 0.09/100,000 in elderly people aged >60 years, whereas it was 0.02/100,000 in young adult aged 20-59 years. Its heterogeneous clinical manifestations include involvement of the skin, bone marrow (BM), blood, lymph nodes (LN), and central nervous system (CNS)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Surprisingly, approximately 85% of the patients with BPDCN present with non-specific skin lesions. Due to the heterogeneous manifestations, misdiagnosis often occurs and leads to delay in the treatment. Even though the patients were treated with conventional regimens (widely used for other hematological malignancies), most cases relapse and develop drug resistance within a short time. In 2018, a novel targeted CD123 antibody (tagraxofusp) was approved as the first-line treatment for patients with BPDCN; however, serious adverse events, such as liver injury and capillary leak syndrome, limit its clinical application. It is widely known that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve the survival outcomes of patients. Despite this, most elderly patients cannot undergo HSCT owing to their poor physical condition. To begin to formally address the state of the field, the North American BPDCN Consortium (NABC) was formed and gave a consensus treatment approach for the first time this year. However, a greater understanding of different regimens used in BPDCN is very important and remains an important goal for the worldwide consortium.\n\n    BCL2 (antiapoptotic protein B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2) inhibitors (venetoclax) and hypomethylating agents (HMAs), such as azacitidine, are used to treat hematological malignancies. Previous studies have demonstrated that venetoclax combined with azacitidine can increase the rate of complete remission (CR) and prolong the survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A recent study also reported that BCL2 is highly expressed in BPDCN cells, and its inhibitor is usually administered as a single regimen or in combination with a hyper-CVAD regimen/HMA. Importantly, when treated with a BCL2 inhibitor and HMA, patients with BPDCN showed a rapid clinical response and few side effects. Thus, this combination appears to have promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of BPDCN. Herein, we describe a case of BPDCN in a 71-year-old man with intermittent and gradually expanding skin lesions. After the combination treatment of venetoclax and azacitidine, the skin lesions gradually reduced in size and disappeared markedly. Besides that, the other main content is to comprehensively review the previous literatures before January 2023 and further give the analysis and summary on these studies. This systematically review will make a significant contribution to the current and future treatment on BPDCN.",

        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, we reported a patient with BPDCN and disseminated skin lesions who achieved a remarkably quick response to venetoclax and azacitidine treatment. Our study and current cumulative data suggest that venetoclax combined with azacitidine is safe, effective, and applicable in the treatment of elderly patients with R/R BPDCN. Importantly, closer attention should be paid to the physical condition of patients, and the best supportive care should be given in the event of severe myelosuppression. Although NABC provides a consensus, the final therapy decision is still dependent on multiple factors, such as the drugs toxicity profile, physician preference of the patient, and drug availability and affordability in the future clinical work. This study, therefore, significantly contributes to the literature on the current and future treatment for BPDCN. Formal cost analysis of different regimens used in BPDCN remains an important goal for the consortium in the world.",
        "Discussion": "    BPDCN is an extremely rare hematological malignancy. The first case of BPDCN was reported in 1994, it was classified as an independent hematological tumor by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. According to the 2022 WHO Classification, it was classified as a histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasm. BPDCN can affect multiple organs including the skin, bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Among the common symptoms of extramedullary infiltration, 83% of patients show skin lesions, possibly due to the binding between the highly expressed CLA/HECA-452 in tumor cells and E-selectin in dermal endothelial cells and cutaneous T cells. The other common manifestations were anemia (65%), thrombocytopenia (78%), and lymphadenopathy with or without splenomegaly (61%). Meanwhile, the tonsil, lung, and eyes have also been reported to be invaded by these malignant cells. Hence, the variety of these symptoms and physical signs makes it difficult to diagnose BPDCN and delays its treatment. In addition to the manifestations, a definitive diagnosis is made based on the immunophenotype of the tumor cells, according to the 2022 WHO Classification. To begin to formally address the state of the field, the North American BPDCN Consortium was formed and defines the current standard of care and identify the most important research questions and future directions in BPDCN.\n\n    In the present study, when skin lesions first appeared on his chest, abdomen, and back, the patient was misdiagnosed with skin disease at a local county hospital. Although the symptoms were temporarily relieved after treatment for skin diseases, the skin lesions had recurred twice in the past year. The patient presented with extensive skin lesions, extreme fatigue, and bilateral neck and inguinal lymph node enlargement. On admission, laboratory examinations revealed pancytopenia. A peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspirate smear, cervical lymph nodes, and skin dermal tissue showed the presence of multiple malignant cells. FCM data showed large numbers of BPDCN cells, and PET/CT further demonstrated that there were multiple lymph node enlargements above and below the diaphragm and splenomegaly. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with BPDCN.\n\n    Once confirmed, the patient was immediately administered venetoclax + azacitidine. Previously, most patients with BPDCN received regimens such as hyper-CVAD or FLAG; canonical regimens for AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or lymphoma; and targeted CD123 therapy (tagraxofusp). Although patients show good outcomes in the early stages after treatment, drug resistance and recurrence will soon occur. In addition, these regimens have many adverse reactions, especially tagraxofusp, which can lead to liver injury, thrombocytopenia, and severe capillary leakage syndrome. The most recent literature reported that patients with BPDCN treated with venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) and azacitidine (HMA) had confirmed clinical efficacy and safety. Importantly, in older patients with BPDCN who are unfit for chemotherapy, a combination of venetoclax + HMA may be a feasible alternative to CD123-targeted or cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n\n    BCL2, a key apoptotic gene, is widely expressed in various tumor cells and is closely associated with the carcinogenesis of many malignant diseases. Recently, it was reported that the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, a BCL2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetic, can induce apoptosis by lowering the apoptosis threshold of tumor cells. In 2017, Montero et al. demonstrated that BCL2 is highly expressed in BPDCN cells and that venetoclax reduced BPDCN patient-derived xenografts in mice. In clinical trials, after venetoclax treatment, enlarged lymph nodes significantly decreased, and the number of bone marrow tumor cells decreased from 85 to 44%. In 2019, Beziat et al. also reported that an elderly male patient with BPDCN, who still had repeated and severe skin lesions when treated with eight courses of the miniCHOP regimen, showed a tremendous therapeutic effect without tumor lysis syndrome or other adverse reactions when exchanged for venetoclax treatment. This suggests that venetoclax is safe, effective, and applicable in patients with BPDCN, especially in elderly patients with skin involvement.\n\n    In 2020, Piccini et al. reported a relapsed/refractory (R/R) BPDCN case with disseminated skin relapse that achieved a remarkably quick and durable response to venetoclax and HMA azacitidine treatment. Venetoclax alone or in combination could be used as a reference treatment for patients with BPDCN. Azacitidine, as a conventional drug in Myelodysplastic syndrome and AML, can inhibit DNA hypermethylation. In particular, 21% of the BPDCN patients were demonstrated to have a mutation in TET2, a methylation-related gene. In a CAL-1 cell line xenograft mouse model, azacitidine was shown to be effective in controlling BPDCN progression in vivo. Meanwhile, data from Laribi et al. and Khwaja et al. showed that two of five patients with BPDCN showed favorable effects for alleviating skin lesions after azacitidine monotherapy. In addition, azacitidine can overcome tagraxofusp resistance by reversing the high methylation state of diphthamide biosynthesis 1 promoter region in tagraxofusp-resistant AML/BPDCN cells.\n\n    Although early stages of venetoclax or azacitidine alone had a good effect, most patients with BPDCN tended to develop rapid progression, and few patients achieved CR or had a chance of long-term survival. However, after treatment with a combination of venetoclax and azacitidine, all 10 patients with BPDCN successfully achieved CR or PR, and more than half had received or would receive HSCT. Accordingly, this combination seems to be more effective than monotherapy and makes it possible for patients to avoid transfusion dependence. Especially several months ago, NABC formed a consensus treatment approach for the first time that older/unfit patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy should be considered for clinical trials featuring CD123-targeted therapies alone or in combinations including HMA and/or venetoclax, or off-protocol \"standard\" approaches of tagraxofusp monotherapy or HMA plus venetoclax. In this study, the man received venetoclax (100 mg on the first day and 200 mg for 27 consecutive days) and the subcutaneous administration of azacitidine. Clinical symptoms, such as skin lesions and enlarged lymph nodes, were rapidly alleviated. In particular, the number of tumor cells in the bone marrow significantly decreased, and bone marrow CR was achieved after the first course of both drugs administration. This patient did not experience serious adverse effects such as tumor lysis syndrome or capillary leakage syndrome.\n\n    Furthermore, we comprehensively reviewed the previous literatures until January 2023, including 16 patients with BPDCN treated with venetoclax and HMA (Table 3). Among these cases (Table 4), 10 were male and 6 were female, with 87.5% of patients aged >=60 years (age range, 22-87 years). There were 7 cases of newly diagnosed patients and 9 cases of R/R patients. Statistically, the overall response rate was 93.75% (15 of 16 patients). After the first course of treatment, the skin rash was significantly reduced in seven patients (43.75%). Meanwhile, 81.25% of patients reached CR or PR after one to five courses. Of note, in 8 cases treated with azacitidine and venetoclax combination, 6 cases (75%) showed good response to the treatment during or after the first cycle. Twelve patients experienced adverse events, including hypocytosis (six cases), renal injury (one case), gastrointestinal bleeding (two cases), and aspiration pneumonia (one case). After combination treatment, none of the patients showed severe side effects such as tumor lysis syndrome, whereas seven patients (43.75%) died due to progressive disease or uncontrollable severe infections. In this study, the elderly patient presented with CR in the bone marrow, markedly alleviated skin lesions, and reduced enlarged lymph nodes without serious adverse effects after the first course of treatment with both drugs. Based on this study and the previous data analysis, venetoclax combined with azacitidine is effective, and applicable in the treatment for BPDCN patients. Importantly, venetoclax is a small molecule that penetrates blood brain barrier, which is important for patients with BPDCN who have an increased risk of CNS involvement. But besides the treatment, side effects also need to be focused on. For example, the adverse effects of venetolax include neutropenia, gastrointestinal disorder and infections, some of which even cause life-threatening for patients. Hence, during the treatment, laboratory monitoring and supportive care should be thoughtfully scheduled.",

        "Title": "    The role of sodium channels in sudden unexpected death in pediatrics",
        "Abstract": "    Sudden Unexpected Death in Pediatrics (SUDP) is a tragic event, likely caused by the complex interaction of multiple factors. The presence of hippocampal abnormalities in many children with SUDP suggests that epilepsy-related mechanisms may contribute to death, similar to Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy. Because of known associations between the genes SCN1A and SCN5A and sudden death, and shared mechanisms and patterns of expression in genes encoding many voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), we hypothesized that individuals dying from SUDP have pathogenic variants across the entire family of cardiac arrhythmia- and epilepsy-associated VGSC genes.\n\n    To address this hypothesis, we evaluated whole-exome sequencing data from infants and children with SUDP for variants in VGSC genes, reviewed the literature for all SUDP-associated variants in VGSCs, applied a novel paralog analysis to all variants, and evaluated all variants according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.\n\n    In our cohort of 73 cases of SUDP, we assessed 11 variants as pathogenic in SCN1A, SCN1B, and SCN10A, genes with long-standing disease associations, and in SCN3A, SCN4A, and SCN9A, VGSC gene paralogs with more recent disease associations. From the literature, we identified 82 VGSC variants in SUDP cases. Pathogenic variants clustered at conserved amino acid sites intolerant to variation across the VGSC genes, which is unlikely to occur in the general population (p < .0001). For 54% of variants previously reported in literature, we identified conflicting evidence regarding pathogenicity when applying ACMG criteria and modern population data.\n\n    We report variants in several VGSC genes in cases with SUDP, involving both arrhythmia- and epilepsy-associated genes. Accurate variant assessment as well as future studies are essential for an improved understanding of the contribution of sodium channel-related variants to SUDP.\n\n    Sudden Unexpected Death in Pediatrics (SUDP) is a tragic event. We evaluated WES data from 73 cases and reviewed the literature for sodium channel variants in SUDP. We report variants in several sodium channel genes, involved in central nervous system and/or cardiac rhythm dysfunction.",
        "Introduction": "    Sudden Unexpected Death in Pediatrics (SUDP) encompasses a tragic set of conditions, including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood (SUDC), affecting children under and over 1 year of age, respectively (Goldstein, Nields, & Kinney, 2017). These conditions are hypothesized to involve heterogeneous and multifactorial etiologies, conceptualized as a 'triple-risk' model with a convergence of intrinsic, developmental, and environmental vulnerabilities contributing to death (Filiano & Kinney, 1994; Goldstein, Kinney, & Willinger, 2016).\n\n    Pathogenic variants in both arrhythmia- and epilepsy-related voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) have been identified in association with sudden death, including SIDS, SUDC, and the related phenomenon Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) (Arnestad et al., 2007; Baruteau, Tester, Kapplinger, Ackerman, & Behr, 2017; Brownstein et al., 2018; Glengarry et al., 2014; Halvorsen et al., 2016; Howell et al., 2015; Johannesen et al., 2018; Kapplinger et al., 2010; Kato et al., 2014; Millat et al., 2009; Otagiri et al., 2008; Plant et al., 2006; Priori, Napolitano, Giordano, Collisani, & Memmi, 2000; Tester & Ackerman, 2005; Turillazzi et al., 2008; Veeramah et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Wedekind et al., 2001; Winkel et al., 2015). We have reported a range of developmental hippocampal malformations in greater than 40% of children with SIDS and SUDC (Kinney et al., 2015, 2016), including hippocampal lesions such as dentate bilamination that have been classically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (Houser, 1990). These observations suggest that a subset of SIDS and SUDC is linked to epilepsy-related mechanisms. The association between epilepsy and sudden death, demonstrated most clearly in Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), may well extend to SUDP in cases with these hippocampal lesions in the absence of a history of overt epilepsy, conceptualized as 'epilepsy in situ' (Noebels, 2016) since infants and children with SIDS and SUDP by definition have not presented with a history of epilepsy. An example of a gene with many protean disease associations that has been associated with SIDS, SUDC, and SUDEP is SCN1A [MIM *182389], providing a specific contributing factor that links these entities (Bagnall et al., 2016; Bagnall, Crompton, & Semsarian, 2017; Brownstein et al., 2018; Halvorsen et al., 2016).\n\n    While the terminal mechanisms of SUDP, including SUDEP, remain speculative (Devinsky, Hesdorffer, Thurman, Lhatoo, & Richerson, 2016; Massey, Sowers, Dlouhy, & Richerson, 2014), there is active investigation into the role of genetic factors involving genes related to epilepsy (Brownstein et al., 2018; Goldman et al., 2009) as well as cardiac arrhythmia (Bagnall et al., 2016; Baruteau et al., 2017) that may contribute to these untimely deaths. Given the identification of pathogenic SCN1A variants in individuals with SIDS, SUDC, and SUDEP, and given the known robust association between SCN5A [MIM *600163] and sudden death (Brugada syndrome), we sought to identify additional variants across the entire VGSC family of genes that encode for several brain- and cardiac-expressed genes. The VGSCs are a highly conserved family of proteins - expressed in excitable tissue in the heart, central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and muscle - that are essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials. In humans, nine different pore-forming alpha-subunits have been identified (NaV1.1-1.9 encoding for SCN1A-SCN5A [MIM: SCN2A *182390; SCN3A *182391; SCN4A *603967] and SCN8A-SCN11A [MIM: SCN8A *600702; SCN9A *603415; SCN10A *604427]) (Catterall, 2014). NaV1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6 are the primary sodium channel subunits expressed in the central nervous system, NaV1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 in the peripheral nervous system, NaV1.4 in skeletal muscle, and NaV1.5 in the heart. The pore-forming alpha-subunit is composed of four homologous domains, each containing six transmembrane alpha-helical segments (S1-S6). In addition, there are five beta-subunits (beta1, beta1B, beta2, beta3, and beta4) encoded by SCN1B-SCN4B [MIM: SCN1B *600235; SCN2B *601327; SCN3B *608214; SCN4B *608256] (Brackenbury & Isom, 2011). The tissue-specific expression profiles of alpha-subunits and beta-subunits are shown in Table 1. Variants in the cardiac-expressed gene SCN5A (Arnestad et al., 2007; Baruteau et al., 2017; Glengarry et al., 2014; Kato et al., 2014; Millat et al., 2009; Otagiri et al., 2008; Plant et al., 2006; Priori et al., 2000; Tester & Ackerman, 2005; Turillazzi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014; Wedekind et al., 2001; Winkel et al., 2015) have been reported in association with SIDS and SUDC. Variants in other VGSCs are only rarely identified in cases with SIDS and SUDC: SCN1A (Brownstein et al., 2018; Halvorsen et al., 2016), SCN4A (Mannikko et al., 2018), SCN10A (Neubauer et al., 2017), SCN1B (Altshuler et al., 2012; Baruteau et al., 2017; Denti, n.d.; Hu et al., 2012; Neubauer et al., 2017), SCN3B (Tan et al., 2010; Winkel et al., 2015), and SCN4B (Tan et al., 2010). Variants in epilepsy-associated VGSC genes expressed in the central nervous system have also been associated with SUDEP: SCN1A (Cooper et al., 2016; Gal et al., 2010), SCN2A (Howell et al., 2015; Myers et al., 2018), and SCN8A (Johannesen et al., 2018; Myers et al., 2018; Veeramah et al., 2012).\n\n    Given that VGSC genes are highly conserved in linear protein sequence and share essential functional domains across cardiac and neurologic tissues, we hypothesized a role for the entire family of VGSC genes in SUDP. We evaluated for the presence of variants in all VGSC genes using WES data from a cohort of 73 cases with SUDP; we applied a structure-based assessment of all novel and reported variants in human VGSC in SUDP cases versus controls.",
        "Methods": "    This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Boston Children's Hospital (approval number P00011014), and informed written consent has been obtained from the parents of all cases included. Some cases were ascertained through the San Diego SIDS Registry, which included consent for research but did not allow recontact of families and did not obtain parental DNA.\n\n    DNA from 73 SUDP cases was obtained through the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), Boston, MA, and the Office of the Medical Examiner, San Diego, CA, using consent procedures in accordance with Massachusetts and California Law. These cases included 42 singletons, for whom parental samples were not available and for whom families could not be contacted, 28 trios consisting of probands and both parents, and 3 probands with one parent's sample available. All cases were sudden, unexpected deaths that remained unexplained after a complete autopsy and death scene investigation (Goldstein et al., 2017). DNA extracted from whole blood or saliva underwent capture for exome sequencing using either the Agilent SureSelect XTHuman All Exon v4 or Illumina Rapid Capture Exome enrichment kit (Broad Institute). Sequencing of 100 bp paired end reads was obtained using Illumina HiSeq (Illumina). Coverage was >90% or >80% meeting 20x coverage with the two methods, respectively. Our data analysis and variant calling methods have been described previously (Olson et al., 2017). We utilized the BCH (Boston Children`s Hospital) Connect Genomics Gateway integrated with the WuXi NextCODE analysis platform (Gudbjartsson et al., 2016) for variant interrogation and analysis.\n\n    For each case, we performed a targeted initial analysis to identify variants in genes encoding for the human VGSC subunits. Candidate pathogenic variants were evaluated according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria (Richards et al., 2015), including pathogenicity predictions from both Polyphen2 and SIFT and low population allele frequency (<0.001) according to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) representing control individuals; while not all individuals in this database are disease-free, they did not experience sudden death in infancy or childhood. Furthermore, given that the genes in question are known to have decreased penetrance, we did not require complete absence in gnomAD for pathogenicity. For cases with data from parental samples, we evaluated de novo versus inherited status of candidate variants of interest. For splicing variants, we used the splicing prediction score from Alamut Visual-2.10, which incorporates the splicing tools MaxEnt, NNSPLICE, and HSF. We evaluated trios for de novo or inherited heterozygous variants, homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in any disease-associated genes. We additionally evaluated all cases, including singletons, for potentially pathogenic variants in disease-associated genes related to sudden death or cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n    In order to identify additional cases for phenotypic comparison and to evaluate whether a given variant was novel or previously reported and whether there might be data supporting pathogenicity, we performed a literature search (PubMed, accessed June 2019, with search parameters \"Sudden Infant Death\" [Mesh] AND \"Sodium Channels\" [Mesh]) resulting in the identification of 49 studies. In addition, we searched the Human Gene Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/, accessed June 2019) for each of the VGSCs genes to identify any possible variants not found in the literature search, identifying 13 additional studies with cases of SIDS or SUDC and reported variants in sodium channel-related genes.\n\n    We used the human NaV1.7 (SCN9A) protein model described by Shen, Liu, Wu, Lei, and Yan (2019) and analyzed the position of the variants of our cohort along with additional variants identified through our literature search (Table S1). Three of our cases' variants have been previously reported in literature (Brownstein et al., 2018; Halvorsen et al., 2016). We focused on exonic variants since intronic, splicing, and truncating variants cannot be annotated onto the three-dimensional protein sequence. Illustrations were generated using PyMol.\n\n    Functional prediction scores were obtained from the dbNSFP database version 3.5 (August 2017, http://varianttools.sourceforge.net/). In total, we used six pathogenicity prediction scores (SIFT, Polyphen-2-HVAR, Polyphen-2-HDIV, Mutation Assessor, FATHMM, and LRT). We classified a variant as \"damaging\" when the majority of the tools predicted a functional effect for the variant (i.e., a minimum of 4 of 6 tools). Splicing variants are considered \"possibly damaging\" or \"damaging\" when they have a likelihood of 50% or more to affect splicing, using the splicing prediction score from Alamut Visual-2.10, calculated from the splicing tools MaxEnt, NNSPLICE, and HSF.\n\n    Based on the linear amino acid sequence of SCN9A (canonical transcript ENST00000409672, CCDS46441), we compared the position of 74 missense variants in all sodium channel alpha-gene paralogs against variants found in the general population using gnomAD. We evaluated the amino acid gene-family paralog conservation score using the Parazscore (Lal et al., 2017) (http://per.broadinstitute.org/), which leverages amino acid conservation across gene-family members, assuming that conserved sites are more likely to be important for protein function and thus more likely to be present in cases than in controls (Brunklaus et al., 2020). Statistical comparison between the variant counts of cases versus gnomAD was conducted using a two-tailed t test with nominal two-sided p-values < .05 considered significant.\n\n    In order to assess for correlation across gene-family paralogs, we compared the position of all missense variants in sodium channel alpha-gene paralogs from our own cohort and from the literature onto a three-dimensional NaV1.7 structure model. We used the human NaV1.7 structure model that is based on the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human NaV1.7-ss1-ss2 complex at overall resolutions of 3.2 angstroms (Shen et al., 2019).",
        "Results": "    In our cohort of 73 SUDP cases, we identified from exome data a total of 45 variants in VGSC genes, 11 of which (present in 10 cases) were predicted to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic (n = 6), or VUS (n = 5) applying ACMG criteria (Richards et al., 2015) (Table 2). No additional heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous variants were present that provided an explanation for sudden death in these individuals. Age of death across the 10 cases with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in VGSC genes ranged from 7 weeks to 8 years, with 9/10 (90%) individuals younger than 6 months at the time of death. Seven had hippocampal malformations as assessed by detailed neuropathological examination, and one had a normal hippocampus. For the other two, material was not available for detailed neuropathological analysis. Clinical and molecular data for all 10 cases are listed in Table 2. Neuropathological examination of an abnormal dentate gyrus is illustrated in Figure 1. Case 1 had two variants in SCN1A (p.Leu1296Met and p.Glu1308Asp) (reported previously) (Brownstein et al., 2018), Case 4 had a variant in SCN3A (p.Ala1804Val) and in SCN10A (c.4386+1G>C), and two siblings (Cases 9 and 10) carried the same variant in SCN1B (p.Trp179Ter) (unknown whether inherited from a parent with a germline or mosaic variant as parental DNA is unavailable). None of the cases in our cohort had a diagnosis of epilepsy. Case 3 had a history of atypical febrile seizures. Cases 5 and 6 each had an inherited variant in SCN4A (p.Lys724Arg and p.Phe103Val, respectively); neither variant-bearing parent had reported history of muscle disease or muscle twitching. None of the individuals in our cohort was reported to have had cardiac arrhythmia. We did not identify pathogenic variants in the cardiac-expressed SCN5A gene in our cohort or in the epilepsy-associated genes SCN2A and SCN8A.\n\n    We reviewed all variants in VGSC genes that have been reported in the literature in infants and children with SIDS and SUDC. We identified 82 variants in 103 individuals, with 6 harboring two variants and 12 variants recurring in 39 cases, affecting 81 different amino acid positions in the following genes: SCN1A (n = 3), SCN4A (n = 6), SCN5A (n = 62), SCN10A (n = 4), SCN1B (n = 3), SCN3B (n = 3), and SCN4B (n = 1). The two variants recurring most frequently were identified in SCN5A: c.3578G>A (R1193Q) and c.1700T>A (L567Q), occurring in 8 and 7 cases, respectively.\n\n    Collectively, we identified a total of 90 unique VGSC variants (Table S1), 11 from our cohort and 82 from the literature (3 overlapping) affecting 89 different amino acid positions in the following genes: SCN1A (n = 4), SCN3A (n = 1), SCN4A (n = 8), SCN5A (n = 62), SCN9A (n = 1), SCN10A (n = 6), SCN1B (n = 4), SCN3B (n = 3), and SCN4B (n = 1). Interestingly, variants in the epilepsy-associated genes SCN2A and SCN8A were not observed in our cohort or in the SUDP literature cases.\n\n    To assess whether some regions of the VGSCs tolerate variation, we evaluated for clustering of variants in analogous locations across the VGSCs using the Parazscore (Lal et al., 2017). As expected, Parazscores from patient (case) variants were significantly higher than those observed in gnomAD (unpaired t test, p < .0001). Variants that were determined to be (likely) pathogenic with the prediction tools were more likely to be located at paralog conserved amino acid positions (Fisher exact, p = .03) (i.e., greater Parazscores) (Figure 2a). On the other hand, variants that we determined to be conflicting or benign with the prediction scores were more likely present in less conserved regions (Fisher's exact test, p = .0001) (Figure 2b). Interestingly, 25 variants involved the 'alignment index position' of a VGSC variant reported in disease (Table S2), which is unlikely to occur in the general population (p < .0001). Overall, we observed significant clustering of variants at conserved amino acid sites, notably with the same amino acid affected between SCN1A/SCN5A and SCN5A/SCN9A (Table S2). The variants of two cases (Cases 6 and 8) in our cohort affected the same paralog position: SCN4A (p.Phe103Val) and SCN10A (p.Ser102Cys) (p < .0001). Both had died at 3 months of age and had pathology notable for hippocampal granule cell dispersion with dentate gyrus bilamination (Table 2); both variants were inherited from a parent who had no history of epilepsy, febrile seizures, or other major illness. Two other cases from our cohort (Cases 1 and 7) had variants affecting the same paralog position at SCN1A/SCN5A and SCN5A/SCN9A, respectively. Interestingly, neuropathological examination in both cases revealed dentate gyrus bilamination (Figure 1, Table 2 and Table S2).\n\n    Given our observation that several variants, particularly those from the literature, had conflicting or benign scores, we re-assessed the 82 variants from the literature using the same criteria applied to our cases; we classified 30 variants in 35 cases, with 5 variants occurring in multiple individuals, as pathogenic or likely pathogenic using ACMG criteria (Richards et al., 2015) (Table S1). Evaluation of variants in the literature with respect to allele frequency reported in the gnomAD database revealed 14/82 variants (17%) in 31/103 individuals (30%) with an allele frequency higher than or equal to 0.001, arguing against their pathogenicity. Thirteen variants in 30 cases were classified as benign or likely benign using ACMG criteria.\n\n    In addition, we also evaluated published functional studies and used six pathogenicity prediction scores to classify the variants. Of the 82 variants reported in literature, we determined that 34 variants (34/82 = 41%) in 55 individuals (55/103 = 53%) had conflicting evidence of pathogenicity, and 1 of 82 (1%) was determined to be benign based on the high frequency in controls, lack of predicted functional effect in silico, and/or in vivo absence of functional effects resulting from the variants (Table S1). Notably, the two most commonly recurring variants in SCN5A (c.3578G>A, R1193Q and c.1700T>A, L567Q) were assessed as benign using ACMG criteria and as conflicting according to pathogenicity prediction scores and functional studies. Overall, for 56/103 (54%) variants reported in literature in cases of sudden death, we identified conflicting evidence of pathogenicity.\n\n    Variants predicted to be pathogenic were more likely to be localized in the transmembrane regions of the protein than variants predicted to be conflicting or benign (p = .03). Variants localized in the transmembrane regions have been associated with severe channel dysfunction (Wallace et al., 2003) (Table S1, Figure S1).",
        "Conclusion": "    Our analysis of a SUDP cohort and the present literature on sodium channel variants in SUDP cases, using population- and protein structure-based predictive models, revealed variants across the VGSC subunit family of sodium channel genes. Importantly, in our cohort, these variants were identified in children without prior histories of epilepsy or unprovoked seizures, and only one with a history of seizures that were atypical febrile seizures, yet with hippocampal abnormalities and without history or family history of cardiac arrhythmia. In addition, using recent guidelines for variant interpretation, we observed that the majority of SUDP variants reported in the previous literature do not have enough evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Variant assessment using current ACMG guidelines will improve variant interpretation and prediction of pathogenicity.\n\n    Overall, similar to prior studies, variants predicted to be pathogenic were more likely to cluster at conserved amino acid sites intolerant to variation, in the individual genes and across the VGSC genes. Therefore, the position of a variant in a VGSC gene, with respect to paralogous proteins already implicated in SUDP, can provide clues toward underlying pathogenicity. These findings provide evidence that sodium channel abnormalities contribute to the complex phenotype in SUDP involving central nervous system and/or cardiac rhythm dysfunction. Future functional studies into the function of the sodium channels will elucidate the mechanisms through which variants in these genes underlie some cases of sudden death and may contribute to a framework in which early testing can be used to stratify infants and children at risk.",
        "Discussion": "    From our cohort of 73 cases with SUDP, we identified 11 variants predicted to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic (n = 6), or VUS (n = 5) in genes encoding for VGSC subunits expressed in the brain and/or in the heart, including two individuals who each had 2 variants. Among the 11 cases, 7 had hippocampal abnormalities but no history of epilepsy, 1 (Case 3) had a history of atypical febrile seizures. None had a history of cardiac arrhythmia or other cardiac presentation prior to death. While SCN1A (Brownstein et al., 2018; Halvorsen et al., 2016) and SCN1B (Altshuler et al., 2012; Baruteau et al., 2017; Denti, n.d.; Neubauer et al., 2017) have strong prior associations with epilepsy, arrhythmia, and sudden death, and SCN4A (Mannikko et al., 2018) a recent association with sudden death, we additionally observed variants in the SCN paralogs SCN3A, SCN9A, and SCN10A that have yet to be conclusively associated with sudden death. Surprisingly, we did not identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in SCN5A in our cohort; this contrasts with the 84/103 (82%) of SIDS cases reported in literature with variants in this gene, but we also observed that 47/84 (56%) of SCN5A variants reported in literature had conflicting evidence for pathogenicity when evaluated using modern data and criteria. On the other hand, 4/12 (33%) of our cohort's variants compared to 3/82 (4%) variants identified in cases from the literature carried a variant in SCN1A, three of them recently reported (Brownstein et al., 2018; Halvorsen et al., 2016). It is possible that these differences are due to differences in ascertainment as well as differences between past and current methods of variant assessment. Notably, we did not identify variants within SCN2A and SCN8A genes, two genes previously associated with epilepsy and SUDEP (Howell et al., 2015; Myers et al., 2018).\n\n    We identified in our literature review 82 variants in 103 cases with SIDS, SIDS-like presentations, or SUDC affecting 81 different amino acid positions in a VGSC-related gene. The majority of variants (62/82, 76%) were present in SCN5A, reflecting in some cases the fact that this gene was specifically targeted in some series (Ackerman et al., 2004; Glengarry et al., 2014; Kato et al., 2014; Millat et al., 2009; Otagiri et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014; Wedekind et al., 2001; Winkel et al., 2015). Since many of the VGSC variants reported in SIDS or SUDC were described before the current era of variant interpretation guidelines, we re-evaluated all the variants reported in literature with this in mind. Next-generation sequencing resulted in an exponential growth of identified variants, but clinical classification of variants is still in its early stages. In a surprisingly high number of reported variants (54%), conflicting evidence argued against pathogenicity using current ACMG criteria. While these results may challenge the conclusions of individual studies, correct classification and reclassification of variants based on evolving supportive evidence is important over time.\n\n    Analysis of the relatively modest number of variants in our cohort, coupled with a larger number from the literature, suggested that those variants we determined to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic by other metrics were most likely to be located in critical domains of the sodium channel protein - for example, transmembrane domains. Alternatively, variants in control populations were randomly distributed throughout the genes.\n\n    Variants considered pathogenic are enriched in conserved regions across gene family members. We had hypothesized that variants in VGSC genes at certain conserved positions might be associated with a risk for sudden death, independent of the tissue where the relevant gene is most highly expressed. This is illustrated by two cases in our cohort, each with a variant in SCN4A or SCN10A at the same paralog position (Cases 6 and 8) and 24 other variants from the literature that affect a paralog variant that is known to be disease associated (Table S2). When considering variant pathogenicity in a newly implicated VGSC gene, the position in the protein, with respect to paralogous proteins already implicated in sudden death, can provide additional evidence suggesting pathogenicity.\n\n    Ultimately, while all of these factors are taken into consideration when assessing pathogenicity, robustly conducted experimental evidence with adequate positive and negative control data should ultimately be sought when there is question regarding pathogenicity. While SCN5A (Arnestad et al., 2007; Baruteau et al., 2017; Glengarry et al., 2014; Kato et al., 2014; Millat et al., 2009; Otagiri et al., 2008; Plant et al., 2006; Priori et al., 2000; Tester & Ackerman, 2005; Turillazzi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014; Wedekind et al., 2001; Winkel et al., 2015), SCN1B (Altshuler et al., 2012; Baruteau et al., 2017; Denti, n.d.; Hu et al., 2012; Neubauer et al., 2017), and more recently SCN1A (Brownstein et al., 2018; Halvorsen et al., 2016) have been considered SUDP-associated genes, larger cohort studies will be required to more securely implicate the broader range of VGSC-related genes as part of the multirisk model leading to SUDP. In addition, future studies that can incorporate trio sequencing, in which parental DNA can be made available to determine whether variants are de novo and thus more likely to be pathogenic with respect to a severe phenotype like sudden death, will contribute to our understanding of the role of this family of genes to sudden death. Initial studies in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and mouse models of SCN1A, traditionally associated with epilepsy, suggested cardiac and/or respiratory mechanisms of death (Auerbach et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2018). Additional in vitro and in vivo studies of the sodium channel gene family will move us toward understanding the mechanisms through which variants in sodium channel-encoding genes contribute to sudden death.",

        "Title": "    Simultaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm and myelofibrosis: A case report",
        "Abstract": "    Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an extremely rare and aggressive tumor with an unknown pathogenesis. Myelofibrosis (MF) is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm. MF can be secondary to several hematological malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and hairy cell leukemia. In the present report, a rare case of BPDCN secondary to MF is described. A 70-year-old male patient developed a large purplish-red rash with recurrent symptoms. BPDCN was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of a biopsy specimen and flow cytometry of bone marrow cells. Bone marrow histopathology revealed MF. Next-generation sequencing of peripheral blood revealed mutations in the Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 and NRAS proto-oncogene GTPase genes. The patient underwent one cycle of chemoimmunotherapy, but the condition progressed, an infection developed and the patient eventually died. The present case suggests that BPDCN can occur in conjunction with MF and that the prognosis of such patients is poor. Pathological examination and genetic testing aided in the diagnosis and treatment. This case emphasizes the need to raise awareness of BPDCN among clinicians and to be alert to the potential for fatal infection in patients with BPDCN combined with MF following myelosuppression triggered during chemotherapy.",
        "Introduction": "    Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive hematological malignancy with a mostly poor prognosis. In the United States, approximately 0.04 cases of BPDCN per 100,000 individuals have been reported between 2008 and 2014, with a median overall survival (OS) of 8-20 months. The condition tends to occur in older adults with a median age of 60-70 years and most individuals diagnosed with the disease are male. BPDCN originates from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and its most common clinical manifestations are cutaneous lesions, bone marrow involvement and leukemic dissemination. CD4+ and CD56+ tumor cells are typical of BPDCN, and CD123, transcription factor 4 (TCF4), T cell leukemia/lymphoma protein 1 (TCL1), CD304 and CD303 (also referred to as blood dendritic cell antigen 2) are its main markers. BPDCN does not express typical markers of a lymphoid or myeloid lineage. There are no consensus treatment guidelines for BPDCN. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that regimens based on lymphoid leukemia are associated with improved remission rates compared with those based on myeloid leukemia or lymphoma. Regardless of the regimen, however, disease relapses are frequent and rapid. In addition, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is the only known potential cure for BPDCN. The 5-year OS, disease-free survival, recurrence and non-recurrence mortality rates for patients with BPDCN who receive alloSCT are 51.2, 44.4, 32.2 and 23.3%, respectively.\n\n    Myelofibrosis (MF) is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), which is clinically characterized by progressive anemia, splenomegaly and systemic symptoms (including fatigue, night sweats and fever). The pooled annual incidence rate of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in Europe, North America and Oceania between 1946 and 2012 was 0.47/100,000. The five independent risk factors in the International Prognostic Scoring System for PMF include age >65 years, hemoglobin <10 g/dl, white blood cell count >25x109/l, circulating blasts >=1% and presence of constitutional symptoms. Based on these variables, PMF is categorized into four groups: Low-risk, intermediate-risk-1, intermediate-risk-2 and high-risk, corresponding to a median OS of 11.3, 7.9, 4 and 2.3 years, respectively. Treatment of PMF requires individualized assessment based on the spleen size, symptom burden and risk stratification. Most current pharmacologic treatments for PMF are palliative in scope, such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors (ruxolitinib). The overall mortality rates before and after ruxolitinib approval were 79.8 and 47.3%, respectively, and the overall risk of death was reduced by 53% with ruxolitinib approval. MF can be secondary to several hematological malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and hairy cell leukemia.\n\n    The present study reports the case of an elderly male patient with BPDCN in combination with MF. Among previous studies, only one case report was found on the conversion of PMF to BPDCN; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant literature on MF secondary to BPDCN. The case is unique as the patient was CD4-, with combined MF and mutations in the Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) and NRAS proto-oncogene GTPase (NRAS) genes, which is rare. Future research is required to further elucidate the potential relationship between these two different diseases.",

        "Discussion": "    BPDCN is an aggressive hematopoietic neoplasm derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cells and was first reported in 1994. BPDCN mainly occurs in elderly patients aged 60-70 years with a high male proportion. BPDCN most commonly presents with skin lesions, and bone marrow involvement is also frequent. The clinical presentation varies widely, and there can be either single or multiple skin lesions. Skin lesions appear as brown or purplish-red rashes, plaques or nodules. This is often associated with involvement of peripheral blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes, which usually show diffuse proliferation or infiltration of abnormal matricellular-like cells. Tissue biopsies of the bone marrow, lymph nodes and skin of the patient in the present case report showed abnormal blastocyte-like cells. Only one case report has been reported that found conversion of PMF to BPDCN, but there is no relevant literature on MF secondary to BPDCN. Therefore, it is rare for BPDCN to occur simultaneously with MF. MF is a Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPN with increased deposition of collagen fibers in bone marrow hematopoietic tissue under certain conditions, causing abnormal hematopoiesis. The pathogenesis of MPN is unclear and is mainly associated with three clonal mutations, JAK2, CALR and MPL, and can lead to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Conversely, triple-negative PMF is not associated with mutations in the JAK2, CALR and MPL genes, but >50% of patients with MF have with mutations in the TET2, additional sex combs like 1-transcriptional regulator and DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3alpha genes. A case of follicular lymphoma with MF was previously diagnosed at Hebei General Hospital (Shijiazhuang, China). Several cytokines were detected, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, PDGF, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, which promoted the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with MF. Moreover, the results indicated that activation of the JAK/STAT pathway may be a common mechanism in the development of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and secondary MF.\n\n    The bone marrow biopsy pathology in the present case revealed that reticular fiber staining was grade 2, and next-generation sequencing of the peripheral blood demonstrated mutations in the PDGFRA, TET2 and NRAS genes, but no mutations in JAK2, STAT, CALR or MPL. According to the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune MF (AIMF), the presence of positive autoantibodies is required for AIMF, and the negative autoantibodies in the present case, combined with the absence of previous autoimmune disease (AIMF is usually associated with a well-defined autoimmune disease), ruled out AIMF. Cytokine assays of the peripheral blood showed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10. However, immunohistochemical examination of bone marrow and lymph nodes revealed the expression of only TET2 and NF-kappaB, with a negative result for the expression of PDGFRA, IL-6, IL-10, JAK2, STAT3 and TGF-beta1. These results indicate that the occurrence of MF in the present case may not have been caused by activation of the classical JAK/STAT pathway. Similar to these results, Beird et al reported that JAK/STAT signaling in BPDCN, and the levels of the upstream and downstream molecular serum proteins (colony stimulating factor 3 receptor, STAT3 and STAT5B) in this pathway were low, which may be related to the high level of IL-3Ralpha in BPDCN, which inhibits IL-3/STAT3 signal transduction.\n\n    MF may occur before and/or after the development of other hematological malignancies. Although the patient in the present case did not have mutations in JAK2, CALR or MPL, another clonal proliferative marker, TET2, was present. When MF and other hematological malignancies occur together, it is difficult to determine whether the disorder is triple-negative primary MF or secondary MF. In the present case, we hypothesize that secondary MF was more likely and that the primary BPDCN had invaded the bone marrow and caused secondary MF.\n\n    The mechanism of BPDCN combined with MF was further assessed. Somatic point mutations of TET2 and NRAS are often found in patients with BPDCN. TET2 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes 5-methyl cytosine oxidation to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. When TET2 is mutated, it leads to loss of function of this enzyme and DNA hypermethylation, which subsequently amplifies precancerous clones of bone marrow and abnormal hematopoiesis, driving MPN development. Ostrander et al reported that the TET2 deletion mutation increases dendritic cell production, increases hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and polarizes toward the myeloid lineage. NRAS is a member of the RAS family, and mutations in NRAS facilitate GTP binding of RAS, thereby promoting constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and causing abnormal proliferation of myeloid cells. This may be involved in the occurrence of MF. As specimens from the patient in the present case were limited, only the expression of NRAS and p-ERK was assessed, and it was found that both NRAS and p-ERK were expressed in the bone marrow and lymph nodes of the patient. This indicates that the mutations in TET2 and NRAS may be the bridge between BPDCN and MF, but whether RAS-related pathways are involved requires further experiments for verification.\n\n    Although mutations in TET2 and NRAS may be the potential pathological associating factors between BPDCN and MF, it may also be a unique coincidence in the patient in the present case. In addition to TET2 and NRAS, other mutated genes in the patient appeared to be indirectly associated with the development of BPDCN or MF. It has been reported that loss of function in DIS3 increases the RAS protein level in multiple myeloma cells, which promotes the development of cancer cells. CSMD1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and dysregulation of CSMD1 can drive the NF-kappaB pathway and promote tumor progression. B-cell lymphoma 6 corepressor (BCOR) mutations occur after mutations affecting splicing mechanisms or epigenetically regulated genes. Patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia with BCOR mutations are predicted to have a complete response to venetoclax plus hypomethylating agents, and BCOR has been reported to respond better to hypomethylating drugs when it is co-mutated with other genes that regulate epigenetic inheritance, such as TET2. PDGFRA mutations or rearrangements serve an important role in the development of hypereosinophilic syndrome and its mutation sites (H650Q, N659S, R748G and Y849S). Additionally, FIP1L1-PDGFRA has been reported to induce the activation of STAT5 and sensitivity to imatinib. Abdulbaki et al reported a case of BPDCN presenting with a PDGFRA mutation and suggested the possibility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of BPDCN, but further studies are lacking. Overall, all of these mutations may be indirectly associated with the development of BPDCN or MF, and thus more future cases are needed for further study.\n\n    Personalized treatment based on the immune phenotype and mutation profile of a patient is important. CD123 is a plasmacytoid dendritic cell-specific surface marker that is prevalent in BPDCN, and tagraxofusp targets CD123. Macrophage dendritic cell progenitors are common precursor cells of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes, whereas tumorigenic monocyte-derived fibroblasts contribute to myeloid cell fibrosis. A small number of circulating cells have been reported to express CD123 in patients with MF, which can be targeted to treat BPDCN in conjunction with MF. Clinical studies of tagraxofusp monotherapy for MF are currently underway (trial registration nos. NCT0226825 and NCT05233618). Additionally, clinicians can target therapy in accordance with other specific immunophenotypes of BPDCN, such as targeting CD303 (litifilimab), TCF4 (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors act by inhibiting TCF4) and BCL2 (venetoclax). BPDCN is closely related to DNA hypermethylation. In the present case, the patient presented with a TET2 mutation and was treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, azacytidine, in combination with venetoclax. Certain cases of BPDCN have been treated with azacitidine in combination with venetoclax and it was well tolerated. Moreover, azacitidine combined with tagraxofusp has been reported to be effective for BPDCN treatment, with azacitidine restoring sensitivity to tagraxofusp by restoring diphthamide biosynthesis protein 1 expression. In terms of the NRAS mutation in the patient in the present case, an RAF or an ERK inhibitor may have been appropriate for use.\n\n    Furthermore, several retrospective clinical studies have reported that achieving complete remission after first-line therapy is the primary condition for long-term survival of patients with BPDCN and that survival is prolonged by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation during the first complete remission. Patients with MF have reduced blood cell counts, and in the context of malignancy, patients with MF are more likely to have myelosuppression after chemotherapy. The patient in the present case had induced myelosuppression after chemotherapy with poor efficacy, along with a severe infection, which finally led to the poor outcome. Therefore, BPDCN combined with MF may represent a poor prognosis with a limited therapeutic effect. For such patients, physicians need to be particularly mindful of infections associated with myelosuppression during chemotherapy. While preventing or fighting infection, the selection of reasonable chemotherapeutic drugs and doses should be focused on.\n\n    In conclusion, patients with BPDCN and MF have a poor prognosis, and mutations in TET2 and NRAS may be the bridge between the two conditions. The findings of the present case indicate the need for increased awareness of BPDCN among clinicians in order to reduce misdiagnosis and improve the prognosis of patients with BPDCN, to ensure appropriate and individualized chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with BPDCN and MF, and to increase awareness of potentially fatal infections that may occur after myelosuppression during chemotherapy.",

        "Title": "    Somatic mutational landscape of hereditary hematopoietic malignancies caused by germline variants in RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41",
        "Abstract": "    Germline RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41 HHMs are associated with driver somatic variants during leukemogenesis which are unique for each syndrome.\n\n    Ongoing molecular monitoring of germline carriers without HM is needed to assess the risk profile and clinical actionability of somatic markers.\n\n    Individuals with germ line variants associated with hereditary hematopoietic malignancies (HHMs) have a highly variable risk for leukemogenesis. Gaps in our understanding of premalignant states in HHMs have hampered efforts to design effective clinical surveillance programs, provide personalized preemptive treatments, and inform appropriate counseling for patients. We used the largest known comparative international cohort of germline RUNX1, GATA2, or DDX41 variant carriers without and with hematopoietic malignancies (HMs) to identify patterns of genetic drivers that are unique to each HHM syndrome before and after leukemogenesis. These patterns included striking heterogeneity in rates of early-onset clonal hematopoiesis (CH), with a high prevalence of CH in RUNX1 and GATA2 variant carriers who did not have malignancies (carriers-without HM). We observed a paucity of CH in DDX41 carriers-without HM. In RUNX1 carriers-without HM with CH, we detected variants in TET2, PHF6, and, most frequently, BCOR. These genes were recurrently mutated in RUNX1-driven malignancies, suggesting CH is a direct precursor to malignancy in RUNX1-driven HHMs. Leukemogenesis in RUNX1 and DDX41 carriers was often driven by second hits in RUNX1 and DDX41, respectively. This study may inform the development of HHM-specific clinical trials and gene-specific approaches to clinical monitoring. For example, trials investigating the potential benefits of monitoring DDX41 carriers-without HM for low-frequency second hits in DDX41 may now be beneficial. Similarly, trials monitoring carriers-without HM with RUNX1 germ line variants for the acquisition of somatic variants in BCOR, PHF6, and TET2 and second hits in RUNX1 are warranted.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary hematopoietic malignancies (HHMs) are hematologic syndromes characterized by Mendelian inheritance patterns and an increased lifetime risk for hematopoietic malignancies (HMs). Individuals with HHM-associated germ line variants have a highly variable risk for leukemogenesis, and many HHM-variant carriers do not develop malignancies (carriers-without HM). Very little is understood about the premalignant states in carriers-without HM, the molecular and genetic factors that affect leukemogenic risk, or the environmental factors that drive leukemogenesis in HHMs. This knowledge gap has hampered efforts to refine the clinical surveillance of carriers-without HM, identify individuals with the highest risk for HMs, and develop interventions that delay or prevent leukemogenesis in high-risk carriers-without HM. Moreover, treatments used for malignancies in HHM-variant carriers (carriers-with HM) are not tailored to these syndromes aside from DDX41 and GATA2 carriers, for which there is a limited role for lenalidomide therapy or prophylactic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, respectively. Instead, carriers-with HM are treated with standard-of-care therapies for sporadic HMs, which may carry an uncharacterized gene mutation-specific risk of additional treatment effects, such as engraftment failure or secondary therapy-related neoplasms. Given the paucity of HHM families at individual institutions, a coordinated, multi-institutional effort is required to understand the natural history of HHMs, leukemogenic mechanisms, and the unique biologic factors that may be present in individual HHM syndromes.\n\n    HHMs have been recognized phenotypically for over 100 years. Autosomal dominant (AD) predisposition to myeloid malignancies is the most well characterized, with more than 15 AD HHM-related genes identified to date. Pathogenic germ line variants in RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41 collectively represent the most common causes of AD HHMs and are primarily associated with myeloid malignancies. These HHMs are more common than previously recognized and may have highly penetrant leukemogenic phenotypes. Germ line DDX41 carriers account for ~2% to 4% of all patients with seemingly sporadic HMs, and GATA2 carriers have a 90% lifetime risk of developing HMs. RUNX1-driven HHMs were the first known HHM syndrome and have a high penetrance for HM (~44%). Identifying these syndromes can be challenging because of limited syndromic features, and recognition is often made based on a high-risk family history, an early-onset HM, or the identification of an HHM-associated variant on tumor-based molecular profiling. Individuals harboring germ line variants in these genes often present with cytopenias: RUNX1 most commonly with thrombocytopenia; GATA2 with monocytopenia, dendritic cell, B, and natural killer cell (NK) lymphoid deficiency; and DDX41 with variable cytopenias that can include leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or erythroid dysplasia. The age of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) diagnosis also differs between HHMs, with GATA2 carriers developing MDS/AML at a mean age of 19 years, RUNX1 carriers at 29 years, and DDX41 carriers at 67 years.\n\n    The mechanisms driving leukemogenesis in these variant carriers are unclear. Most work to date has focused on germ line RUNX1 variant carriers. RUNX1 carriers have an increased risk for clonal hematopoiesis (CH) (67%-75% CH). However, because of the rarity of RUNX1 HHM, single-center studies have limited numbers of patients available (9 and 3). Recent studies looking at CH in germ line GATA2 carriers have shown an association between CH and a hypocellular marrow while also linking specific somatic events with the likelihood of leukemic transformation. Similarly assessment of CH patterns in comparative cohorts of HHM-variant carriers may identify specific leukemogenic patterns for different HHMs and ultimately inform clinical trials to define guidelines for clinical surveillance of unaffected HHM-variant carriers.\n\n    To address this knowledge gap, we collected retrospective next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from hematopoietic tissue samples from an international cohort of patients with HHM driven by germ line RUNX1, GATA2, or DDX41 variants. Our cohort is the largest comparative HHM-focused cross-sectional collection of its kind, with 240 patient samples evenly distributed between carriers-without HM (n = 120) and carriers-with HM (n = 120). We used a uniform variant calling and curation approach to identify driver somatic variants in each sample. This unique distribution of samples from carriers-without HM and carriers-with HM and across multiple HHMs, in conjunction with a uniform bioinformatic approach, enabled us to determine driver somatic variants that develop within hematopoietic tissue in RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41 variant carriers before and after diagnosis of a blood cancer in the HHM syndromes.",
        "Methods": "    Clinical and genomics data from germ line RUNX1, GATA2, or DDX41 variant carriers were collected from the RUNX1 database (https://runx1db.runx1-fpd.org/), the Centre for Cancer Biology (Australia), the University of Chicago (USA), and the National Institutes of Health (USA). In total, data from 195 patients who had undergone genomics profiling (whole-exome sequencing or panel-based sequencing) were retrospectively collated to form the RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41 cohorts. All procedures in this study involving human participants were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Studies were approved by institutional human research ethics committees and/or institutional research boards. All participants signed an informed consent form to share genomics and protected health information.\n\n    NGS data were collected and reanalyzed with the bioinformatics pipeline used for the RUNX1 database. Original FASTQ (textfile format for sequencing data) or Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files were obtained. Sequence reads were aligned to the GRCh37 (hs37d5) human reference genome with BWA-MEM (ver 0.7.12). Sambamba (ver 0.6.5) was used for marking polymerase chain reaction duplicates, and GATK (ver 3.8-1) was used to recalibrate base-quality scores. Freebayes (ver 1.2) was used to call single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels). Variant-, gene-, and protein-level annotations were performed using an in-house pipeline (https://github.com/SACGF/variantgrid). Somatic variant curation was performed as previously described (supplemental Methods). All data sets were independently curated by at least 3 variant curators.\n\n    SNVs and indels were identified with Seurat, Shimmer, Strelka, and SomaticSniper, using paired germ line samples (cultured skin fibroblasts or hair) from the same patient to remove germ line variants. Somatic variants identified in 3 or more callers were included with high confidence. Variant calling thresholds were set at alternate allelic depth >=3 and variant allele frequency (VAF) >= 5%. Somatic variants were filtered and annotated with the variant effect predictor package (hg19). The total number of somatic variants in the tumor exome was divided by the length of exome capture (38 Mb) to calculate the TMB.\n\n    GraphPad Prism 7.03 and RStudio Version 1.4.17 with tidyverse, ggplot2, ggrepel, caTools, and ROCR packages were used for statistical calculations and figures. ProteinPaint was used to create lollipop plots. Circos plots were created using ShinyCircos software. Unless otherwise stated, the P value was calculated using a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey multiple comparisons test using a single pooled variance. P value of sex differences were calculated using a two-sided Fisher exact test. The prop.test function/z-value was used as a 2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the relationship between age and CH. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to calculate the significance of the TMB between the RUNX1 and DDX41 cohorts.",
        "Results": "    Through international data sharing, we created cohorts of carriers-without HM (no HM) and carriers-with HM (diagnosed with an HM) with germ line RUNX1, GATA2, or DDX41 variants (Figure 1; supplemental Methods). NGS data included samples from germ line controls, complete remission patients, carriers-without HM, and carriers-with HM. Multiple samples were collected from individuals when available, including longitudinal. The RUNX1 cohort included 66 carriers-without HM and 52 carriers-with HM individuals (including 80 and 66 independent NGS samples, respectively). The GATA2 cohort included 9 carriers-without HM and 13 carriers-with HM individuals (9 and 13 NGS samples, respectively). The DDX41 cohort included 22 carriers-without HM and 29 carriers-without HM individuals (including 31 and 41 independent NGS samples, respectively). Each cohort is summarized in supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Figures 1A and 2. We used a standardized bioinformatics and variant curation approach to identify clinically relevant and potentially clinically relevant somatic variants (driver somatic variants, detailed in the supplemental Methods).\n\n    Age-related CH is frequently observed in healthy populations, with the prevalence of CH in HHMs an area of active investigation. We evaluated our cross-sectional cohorts of RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41 carriers-without HM for CH-related variants at the time of sample collection (Table 1; Figure 2A). We identified CH in 35% of RUNX1 carriers-without HM (23 of 66 individuals; Figure 2A,C) and 22% (2 of 9 individuals, Figure 2A; supplemental Figure 1B) of GATA2 carriers-without HM, respectively. The prevalence of CH was significantly lower (3%, 1 of 31 individuals, P = .002; Figure 2A; supplemental Figure 1C) in DDX41 carriers-without HM. The reduced prevalence of CH in the DDX41 cohort was independent of age, as the age distribution of samples was overlapping between HHM cohorts (supplemental Figure 1A). For germ line RUNX1, CH was identified in all age groups, and the prevalence of CH significantly increased with age (Figure 2C, P=.0267, logistic regression). In the RUNX1 cohort, 5 of 6 (83%) individuals 60 years of age and older had at least 1 CH variant (Figure 2C). The number of variants increased with age, as 92% of individuals under the age of 50 years with CH had only 1 CH variant, whereas 71% of patients over the age of 50 years had 2 or more CH variants (P = .001, Figure 2C,E). The median VAF of CH variants did not change significantly with age (Figure 2D). For all cohorts, no CH was identified in any individual younger than 16 years (n = 9).\n\n    We then compared the prevalence of CH in our cohort of RUNX1 carriers-without HM to population controls from Jaiswal et al and Genovese et al (n = 27 783). The prevalence of CH was higher in RUNX1 carriers-without HM in every age group (Figure 3A, Z test of proportions, P < .0001). The prevalence of CH was 0.2% in controls between the ages of 19 and 29 years but was 22.2% in RUNX1 carriers-without HM in the same age group. In individuals aged 60 years or older, CH was detectable in 7% of controls and 83% of RUNX1 carriers-without HM, demonstrating that RUNX1 carriers-without HM have an increased prevalence of CH at all ages compared with population controls. We investigated the frequency of variants in prototypical CH genes. Variants in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A (54%), TET2 (29%), and ASXL1 (8%) are the most frequent CH-related genes in the general population. Surprisingly, the most frequently mutated CH-related gene in RUNX1 carriers-without HM was BCOR (42%), which is mutated in only 0.6% of population controls with CH (Figure 3B, P < .0001). DNMT3A was mutated in 17% (P < .0001), TET2 in 14% (P = .2182), and ASXL1 was not mutated in RUNX1 carriers-without HM with CH (Figure 3B). These findings demonstrate that the mechanism of CH in RUNX1 carriers-without HM is distinct for this syndrome as compared with population controls.\n\n    Further examining the clonal composition of somatic variants in carriers, we postulated the order of mutation acquisition in samples with multiple variants by using relative VAFs (Figure 4A). We observed that BCOR, as well as being the most frequently mutated gene, was also present across the entire age spectrum, from carriers as young as 16 years to 76 years, found as a first hit (Figure 4A; Table 1). Consistent with the overall data, there was a general increase in BCOR VAF with age and additional mutations, which could be both additional BCOR mutations as well as mutations in other genes including TP53 and ATM, with 1 case where DNMT3A was antecedent to BCOR variants (Figure 4A; Table 1). Three RUNX1 carriers-without HM had longitudinal peripheral blood samples available, which allowed us to track the temporal evolution of CH (Figure 4B). Case 1: a male with thrombocytopenia and a germ line RUNX1 p.R169I variant had a somatic DNMT3A p.F751fs variant detected at a VAF of 3.1% at 43 years of age. The clone increased to a VAF of 5.0% over 5 years without any clinical-level changes, including leukemogenesis, or the development of additional clones. Case 2: a female with thrombocytopenia and a germ line RUNX1 p.R320* variant who developed a TET2 p.Y1598* somatic variant that persisted for more than 7 years, increasing from a VAF of <1% to 5%, without clinical changes. Case 3: a female with a germ line RUNX1 c.351+1G>A splicing variant and thrombocytopenia who developed AML 3 years later. We identified 3 somatic variants (DNMT3A, SRSF2, and TET2) in the patient's initial sample, collected at age 53 years. These variants persisted for 2 years with persistent thrombocytopenia but no leukemogenesis. The patient then developed AML with additional somatic RUNX1 and STAG2 variants at 56 years of age. The initial DNMT3A and SRSF2 CH-related variants remained stable, whereas the TET2 variant was outcompeted during leukemogenesis.\n\n    We next sought to define the landscape of driver somatic variants in our carriers-with HM cohorts who had developed malignancies. In the RUNX1 carriers-with HM cohort, at least 1 driver somatic variant was detected in 46 of 52 (88%) individuals diagnosed with an HM. No association between the number of driver somatic variants and the histologic subtype of malignancy was observed (supplemental Figure 2C). Driver somatic variants were identified in 64 unique genes, and 22 genes were mutated in more than 1 individual (Figure 5A; supplemental Figure 3A). Second hits in RUNX1 were the most frequent somatic mutations, with variants detected in 18 individuals (41% of patients with complete sequencing coverage of RUNX1 [supplemental Methods]). Three types of somatic RUNX1 variants were identified: small indels and SNVs (unique from the germ line variant, 72%), copy neutral loss of heterozygosity variants (17%), and trisomy 21 (somatic amplification of the germ line RUNX1 variant, 11%). Somatic second hits in RUNX1 included 12 missense variants in the exons coding for the RUNT domain as well as a splice-site variant (c.507_508+1dupAGG, Figure 6A-B). Cytogenetic analyses identified 2 individuals with +21 (VAF > 60%) and 3 individuals with a mutant VAF >80% (copy neutral loss of heterozygosity variants) (supplemental Figure 3A). We did not identify associations between individual germ line and driver somatic variant pairs. Most individuals (78%) with a somatic RUNX1 variant were female (P = .02, Figure 6C). Somatic RUNX1 variants were identified in all age groups, and no association was established between individual somatic RUNX1 variants and the age of HM diagnosis (Figure 6D). A female sex bias for HM was observed in all age groups (Figure 6D). Besides second hits in RUNX1, a series of established cancer genes were mutated in the HM cohort: PHF6 (21%), BCOR (20%), TET2 (13%), SH2B3 (11%), and SRSF2 (11%) (Figure 5A; supplemental Figure 3A). AML was the predominant malignancy in germ line RUNX1 variant carriers, with a sex bias for female AML diagnosis (23 of 29 females, 9 of 23 males, P = .004, supplemental Figure 4). Among individuals with somatic RUNX1 variants, 15 (83%) had AML, and 12 of 15 (80%) were females. These data from germ line RUNX1 variant carriers support a female sex bias for AML leukemogenesis driven by somatic RUNX1 variants.\n\n    No somatic second hits in GATA2 were detected in our cohort of 13 germ line GATA2 variant carriers (Figure 5B; supplemental Figure 3B). We detected at least 1 driver somatic variant in 69% (9 of 13) of germ line GATA2 variant carriers who had developed malignancies. Analysis of the GATA2 cohort was limited by low sample numbers (supplemental Figure 4A), but the lack of second hits in GATA2 suggests biallelic variants are not a common leukemogenic mechanism in germ line GATA2 variant carriers.\n\n    In the DDX41 carriers-with HM cohort, we identified at least 1 driver somatic variant in 10 unique genes in 18 individuals (62%, Figure 5C; supplemental Figure 3C). Only 3 genes were mutated in more than 1 individual (DDX41, ASXL1, and JAK2 p.Val617Phe). The most frequent somatic event was a second hit in DDX41, which was observed in 62% (n = 18) of individuals with HM. Apart from a single splice-site variant (c.1621+1G>A), all somatic DDX41 variants were missense variants in the DEAD-box domain (3 of 18) or the recurrent p.R525H variant in the helicase C domain (14 of 18 DDX41 somatic variants, 78%, Figure 7A-B). We observed a significant sex bias for DDX41 malignancies (3:1 male:female, P = .0002), which correlated with males presenting with a somatic DDX41 variant (14 of 18 males, Figure 7C-D). No association between specific somatic variants and germ line DDX41 variants, age of malignancy diagnosis, or histologic subtype of malignancy was observed.\n\n    To better understand the somatic mutational burden in each syndrome, we evaluated the VAF of all driver somatic variants. A large distribution of VAFs was observed in RUNX1 carriers-with HM (median VAF = 22.4%, mean = 27.0%, mode = 5.7, 34%) and GATA2 carriers-with HM (median = 21.0%, mean = 20.6%, mode = 8, 27.2%). VAFs among RUNX1 carriers-with HM showed the largest distribution (Figure 5D). The DDX41 cohort harbored low VAF driver somatic variants (median VAF = 8.9%, mean 13.4%, Figure 5D). No association between age at malignancy diagnosis and the VAF of driver somatic variants was observed in any cohort (supplemental Figure 5). TMB was calculated for DDX41 (n = 14) and RUNX1 (n = 4) carriers-with HM with matched germ line/tumor samples. DDX41 had a lower TMB (0.75 mutations/Mb) than RUNX1 malignancies (3.3 mutations/Mb; P = .01, Figure 5E).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The prevalence of HHMs is estimated to range from 7% to 14% in cohorts of patients with myeloid malignancies. Although the clinical recognition of these syndromes has improved since RUNX1-driven HHMs were first described, questions remain regarding the optimal approach to monitoring carriers-without HM and how malignancy-directed treatments may be individualized for affected patients. Currently it is challenging for clinicians to provide tailored risk-assessment to patients as the natural history of carriers-without HM is not well understood and there has been no approach to identify HHM individuals at highest risk for leukemogenesis. To address this gap, we have leveraged our HHM international collaborative network and assembled and characterized the most extensive cross-sectional comparative cohort of carriers-without HM and carriers-with HM germ line RUNX1, GATA2, or DDX41 variants (n = 191, 102 probands, Figure 1). We demonstrate RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41 germ line variant carriers experience highly variable risk for CH and unique somatic drivers during CH relative to population controls. Each HHM is remarkable for mutational profiles during frank leukemogenesis that are also unique to each HHM syndrome.\n\n    The most significant risk factor for CH in the general population is aging, with ~10% of individuals over the age of 70 years having detectable CH. Several studies investigating CH in the background of inherited bone marrow failure have shown an increased risk for CH. Interestingly, individuals without HM with HHM germ line variants have been shown to have variable risk for CH in a series of small studies (ANKRD26, ETV6, RUNX1). We have now performed the largest collective analysis of CH in RUNX1, GATA2, and DDX41 carriers without HM to date. This analysis extends studies of CH in the HHMs to novel phenotypes (DDX41) and suggests that HHM predisposition in GATA2, and RUNX1 carriers-without HM, may be driven by early-onset CH (22.2% in RUNX1 and 25% in GATA2). Recently, larger cohorts of patients with germ line GATA2 without HM, have also shown CH is common in patients without HM, with CH associated with a hypocellular marrow. Further investigation is required to determine if CH also correlates with cytopenias in germ line RUNX1 cohorts. In contrast, DDX41 carriers-without HM have a very low risk for CH at any age. RUNX1 patients (without HM) with CH also had unique somatic drivers relative to CH population controls, most notably a high prevalence of BCOR variants. This has similarity to aplastic anemia, where BCOR and BCORL1 are frequently mutated. BCOR variants alone did not appear sufficient to cause leukemogenesis in our cohort. This suggests additional co-operating variants are required for malignancy progression (including somatic RUNX1, TET2, DNMT3A, and BCORL1 variants [supplemental Figure 3A]). Some of these interactions are validated in in vivo models with conditional Bcor knockout mouse models combined with variants in Dnmt3a, Kras, or Tet2 sufficient to drive malignancy transformation. Notably, BCOR variants are frequent in the RUNX1 carriers-with HM cohort, supporting the notion that CH in this setting, is a risk factor for leukemic transformation. However further models are required to determine the functional effects of co-occurring BCOR and RUNX1 variants on hematopoetic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) fitness and leukemic transformation.\n\n    The most frequent leukemogenic event in our cohort of DDX41 and RUNX1 carriers-with HM was biallelic somatic variants in DDX41 and RUNX1, respectively (supplemental Figure 6). In contrast, second hits in GATA2 germ line variant carriers with malignancies were not detected. In case study #3, for example, a germ line RUNX1 carrier initially presented with thrombocytopenia before progressing to AML. In this patient, leukemogenesis was associated with the acquisition of a biallelic RUNX1 variant, but at a late stage after the acquisition of TET2, DNMT3A, and SRSF2 variants. Given that we never detected somatic RUNX1 variants in our RUNX1 carriers-without HM cohort, in stark contrast to the high frequency of second-hit RUNX1 variants in our HM cohort, we suggest that somatic RUNX1 variants likely represent a later step that may be key to leukemogenic transformation. Interestingly, for DDX41, the lack of CH gene mutations in carriers was mirrored by a lack of CH gene mutations in malignancy (Figure 5C). This indicates that the molecular natural history of this disorder is quite different from both RUNX1 and GATA2 HHMs. Further longitudinal, lineage tracing, and single-cell sequencing studies are required to determine if these are initiating events in malignancy development and the timeline to disease progression.\n\n    Interestingly, both germ line RUNX1 and DDX41 cohorts presented with a sex bias for HM development, but this did not correlate with differences in X-linked somatic variants. Sex bias was not observed in our GATA2 cohort, as we have also observed previously. RUNX1 genomic alterations have a high correlation with hormone-related cancers, especially cancers common in female patients, and with estrogen known to play a role in hematopoiesis, we hypothesize that disruption of specific estrogen signaling pathways in germ line RUNX1 carriers could predispose females to AML. In the germ line RUNX1 malignancy cohort, recurrent somatic gene variants are involved in epigenetic regulation and epigenetic dysregulation and can occur in leukemogenesis, with sex-specific differences in methylation observed in hematopoietic tissue. The innate immune response is also known to be increased in females relative to males. For DDX41, given its role as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that triggers the innate immune response, a dysregulated immune response could exaggerate existing differences in innate immunity between males and females, contributing to the observed sex bias in malignancy penetrance. Further investigation is warranted to understand the interplay of these mechanisms on tumorigenesis, which may ultimately inform the development of sex-specific therapies that optimize outcomes for patients with HHM.\n\n    Despite a lack of definitive guidelines, limitations, and ongoing debate, molecular monitoring in clinical practice is becoming more widespread. Findings from this study have implications for clinical surveillance and counseling for different patients with HHM. For example, in RUNX1 and GATA2 HHMs, regular targeted sequencing of CH genes, even in younger carriers-without HM, will provide a tool to monitor the evolution of the clonal burden associated with these variants. In contrast, given the low VAF and high frequency of somatic DDX41 variants in DDX41 HHMs, serial high-depth sequencing of DDX41 for the common R525H mutation may be a preferred approach in DDX41 carriers-without HM. Although in the aging population, CH is a risk factor for leukemic transformation, the presence of CH in inherited bone marrow failure is in some situations associated with somatic rescue or normalization of HSPC fitness. Therefore, it is important to discriminate CH events that are associated with risk for leukemic transformation from CH, which results in normalization of function. Given that CH variants feasibly confer a step toward HM, the high frequency of BCOR and TET2 variants in our cohort of RUNX1 HHM malignancies and their presence in RUNX1 carriers-without HM, at least in the research study setting, warrant monitoring of these genes as potential molecular biomarkers of leukemogenesis. Changes in CH trajectory may eventually inform clinical decision-making, such as the timing of repeat bone marrow biopsies. These decisions will be made in conjunction with more classic clinical tools, such as the monitoring of peripheral blood cell counts.\n\n    This study highlights the immense benefit of international collaboration and data sharing within the HHM and rare disease communities. We have established the framework for the continued accumulation of patient data, including longitudinal molecular monitoring, which is required to define the different risk states associated with leukemogenesis across these disorders. With continued progress, this work may lead to the establishment of a defined molecular risk stratification for leukemia progression in carriers and, with it, the ability to design and test in trials interventions to halt progression to full-blown HM in vulnerable HHM-variant carriers. For instance, with regular clinical surveillance, it may be possible to detect individuals who develop second hits in DDX41 or RUNX1 before a clinical diagnosis of HM. These individuals may benefit from intensive clinical surveillance or low-toxicity prophylactic therapies. In contrast, defining TET2, BCOR, or other epigenetic regulators as emerging vulnerabilities opens an avenue for the development of prophylactic treatments for HHM carriers via TET inhibitors, histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and combinatorial therapies that do not carry the morbidity and mortality of stem cell transplant. This study provides the most comprehensive investigation of leukemogenic molecular mechanisms in HHMs to date, informing the next generation of studies into the clinical management and surveillance of these disorders as well as potential insights into personalized and preemptive therapies for carriers.\n\n    Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no competing financial interests.\n\n    A complete list of the members of the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center Comparative Sequencing Program appears in \"Appendix.\"",

        "Title": "    Severe hypothyroidism as a trigger for Brugada-type ECG abnormalities: a case report and literature review",
        "Abstract": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited disorder that can cause ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death in individuals with otherwise structurally normal hearts. Several provoking factors are known to potentially unmask or exacerbate a typical Brugada ECG pattern in predisposed subjects. Hypothyroidism has been suggested as one of these triggers, but the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship remain poorly understood. Moreover, the severity of thyroid dysfunction beyond which a Brugada-type ECG alteration might be triggered is still unclear. We report the case of a 33-year-old male who displayed a Brugada type 1 ECG pattern and was diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism (TSH > 100 mU/L with undetectable levels of fT4 and fT3). Hormonal replacement therapy with levothyroxine was initiated at increasing doses; serial biochemical and ECG controls were performed, initially every 3 weeks up to 15 weeks and afterward every 3 months. The regression of typical Brugada ECG waveforms could be seen at an early stage, when the patient was still taking a low dose of levothyroxine (37.5 microg/day, i.e., one-fourth of his final requirements of 150 microg/day), and laboratory tests still showed a marked alteration of thyroid hormonal parameters. Hypothyroidism may act as a trigger for Brugada-type ECG abnormalities, but a very severe alteration of the hormonal parameters is necessary to prompt these alterations. In our case, the initiation of replacement therapy with levothyroxine rapidly reversed the ECG modifications, even at a low subtherapeutic dose.",
        "Introduction": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with variable penetrance that is characterized by abnormal ECG findings in conjunction with an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Its prevalence is estimated to be approximately 0.5 cases per 1000 people, but with remarkable differences between ethnicities. The highest prevalence is reported in people living in South-Eastern Asia, where BrS is nine times more common than that in Caucasians. Moreover, it is characterized by a male predominance, as it is 5-10 times more frequent in males than in females.\n\n    The ECG findings consist of a pseudo-right bundle branch block together with an ST segment elevation in leads V1-V2, which appear more prominent when placing the electrodes on the 2nd intercostal space. Two distinct patterns of ECG abnormalities are recognized:\n\n    Type 1 (\"coved type\"): high take-off >=2 mm with respect to the isoelectric line; concave/rectilinear descending ST segment; negative symmetric T wave.\n\n    Type 2 (\"saddle-back type\"): high take-off >=2 mm with respect to the isoelectric line; convex ST segment elevation with minimum ascent >=0.5 mm and saddle-back morphology; positive T wave in V2, while of variable morphology in V1.\n\n    Only the first alteration is diagnostic for BrS, while the second one is only suggestive for it. The 2013 HRS/EHRA/APHRS Expert Consensus Statement established that \"BrS is definitively diagnosed when a type 1 ST-segment elevation is observed either spontaneously or after intravenous administration of a sodium channel blocking agent (ajmaline, flecainide, pilsicainide, or procainamide) in at least one right precordial lead (V1-V2), placed in a standard or a superior position (up to the 2nd intercostal space)\".\n\n    Although considered a genetic disease, a causative mutation is found only in approximately 30% of BrS patients, with the majority of pathogenic variants being located in the SCN5A gene. Several provoking factors are known to potentially unmask or exacerbate a typical Brugada ECG pattern in predisposed subjects, such as imbalances in the autonomic tone, fever, and various types of drugs. In addition, other conditions have been reported that may transiently affect ion channel function, potentially leading to Brugada-like ECG findings even in the absence of congenital dysfunction. These conditions have been termed \"Brugada phenocopies\" and may be induced by various mechanisms, including ischemia, myocardial/pericardial diseases, extracardiac mechanical compression, and metabolic alterations.\n\n    Severe hypothyroidism has been suggested as a potential trigger for Brugada-type ECG abnormalities in some patients of Asian descent; however, no data are available about its possible role as a trigger in patients with a different genetic background. Moreover, the severity of thyroid dysfunction beyond which a Brugada-type ECG alteration might be triggered is still unclear.\n\n    The PubMed/Medline database was screened to identify relevant studies or reports about the association between Brugada pattern ECG abnormalities and hypothyroidism. The search algorithm used was based on the following search string: (\"hypothyroidism\") AND (\"Brugada\"). The search was updated through January 15th, 2023. The search identified 9 results, but only 3 of them were actually pertinent to the topic of interest.\n\n    All 3 relevant results were case reports described in male patients of Asian descent (two Japanese patients, one Chinese patient). The age at presentation was heterogeneous, ranging from 46 years old in the case described by Zhao and cols. to 77 years old in the case described by Kitahara and cols.. At physical examination, all patients showed clear signs of hypothyroidism, such as deep voice, myxedematous face and legs, and bradycardia. Thyroid function tests confirmed this clinical suspicion and demonstrated the presence of severe hypothyroidism, with TSH values > 100 mU/L and fT4 values below the lower limit of normality in all cases.\n\n    From a cardiological point of view, the ECG taken at rest showed a coved-type Brugada waveform in V1-V2 in two cases; in the third case, a coved-type waveform in V1 and a saddle-back waveform in V2 were present. None of the patients had a positive family history for sudden death, syncope, or palpitations; moreover, their pharmacological anamnesis was negative for drugs known to potentially induce Brugada-like ECG abnormalities. In all cases, the observed Brugada-type ECG alterations disappeared following the initiation of levothyroxine replacement therapy and the normalization of thyroid function tests. A genetic analysis for BrS was performed by Taira and cols.; this analysis demonstrated three common variants in the SCN5A gene (c.5963 T>G, c.1673 A>G, and c.3578 G>A), which are identified in more than 1% of normal subjects.\n\n    The most relevant characteristics of these three cases are presented in Table 1.",

        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We presented the case of a patient with a Brugada type 1 ECG pattern triggered by a condition of severe hypothyroidism. This peculiar association had been previously described in three other patients in the literature, and all of these patients were of Asian origin. Notably, this is the first case describing such a situation in a Caucasian patient. This is an interesting point that shows that hypothyroidism might act as a trigger of a Brugada-type ECG also in patients with a different genetic background.\n\n    Although BrS is considered a genetic disease, a causative mutation is found in only approximately 30% of BrS patients. Moreover, the exact pathways by which the predisposing mutations interact with other factors to determine the final phenotype remain largely unclear. For example, BrS shows age- and sex-related penetrance, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. The same applies to the triggers known to exacerbate this arrhythmia, whose specific action on myocardial cells is - in most of them - only partially elucidated. Within such a complex pathophysiological context, the demonstration that hypothyroidism might act as a trigger of a Brugada type 1 ECG pattern in a patient of non-Asian descent adds a further piece of evidence toward the understanding of this disease.\n\n    From a pathophysiological point of view, the interaction between thyroid function and myocardial ion channels remains unclear. Overall, the cause of Brugada-type ECG alterations is regarded to be a decrease in sodium inflow currents (INa), with a relative increase in the transient outward current (Ito). Although no clear data are available in humans, some physiological clues might be derived from animal studies. The evaluation of myocardial cells in rats suggested a positive relationship between thyroid hormone levels and the magnitude of INa. However, there is less concordance about the connection between thyroid function and Ito. The main regulators of this current are represented by the potassium channel subunits KV4.2, KV4.3 and KV1.4, and different studies conducted on myocardial cells of rats found that their expression and function could be either unaffected, positively correlated, or negatively correlated with thyroid hormone levels.\n\n    In our case, as in the others, the ECG alterations resolved after the initiation of replacement therapy with levothyroxine. An important strength of our report, however, is represented by the choice to follow-up the patient in a systematic and timely manner, with a biochemical assessment and ECG monitoring every 3 weeks up to the 15th week and every 3 months thereafter. Such a systematic approach distinguishes our report from the previous ones and allowed us to more precisely correlate the ECG alterations with biochemical data. In this regard, our findings suggest that - even if hypothyroidism represents a triggering condition that could promote the appearance of a Brugada type 1 pattern on ECG - this is likely to happen only in the most severe forms of thyroid dysfunction, with very high values of TSH and undetectable serum levels of free thyroid hormones. As previously noted, in fact, in our case, the ECG waveforms did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for a type 1 Brugada pattern at a very early stage, when the patient was still taking a low dose of levothyroxine (37.5 microg/day, i.e., one-fourth of the dose that was finally required) and was still displaying a marked alteration of the hormonal parameters (TSH > 100 mU/L, fT4 below the lower limit of detection).\n\n    In conclusion, our case shows that hypothyroidism may act as a trigger for Brugada-type ECG abnormalities. For the first time, this association was observed in a patient of non-Asian origin, demonstrating that it may also occur in patients with a different genetic background. Nevertheless, a very severe alteration of the hormonal parameters was necessary to prompt these alterations; the initiation of replacement therapy with levothyroxine rapidly reversed the ECG modifications, even at a low subtherapeutic dose.\n\n    Funding source: this research did not receive any specific grant.",

        "Title": "    Analysis of human papillomavirus type 16 E4, E5 and L2 gene variations among women with cervical infection in Xinjiang, China",
        "Abstract": "    There is a high incidence of cervical cancer in Xinjiang. Genetic variation in human papillomavirus may increase its ability to invade, spread, and escape host immune response.\n\n    HPV16 genome was sequenced for 90 positive samples of HPV16 infection. Sequences of the E4, E5 and L2 genes were analysed to reveal sequence variation of HPV16 in Xinjiang and the distribution of variation among the positive samples of HPV16 infection.\n\n    Eighty-one of the 90 samples of HPV16 infection showed variation in HPV16 E4 gene with 18 nucleotide variation sites, of which 8 sites were synonymous variations and 11 missense variations. 90 samples of HPV16 infection showed variation in HPV16 E5 and L2 genes with 16 nucleotide variation sites (6 synonymous, 11 missense variations) in the E5 gene and 100 nucleotide variation sites in L2 gene (37 synonymous, 67 missense variations). The frequency of HPV16 L2 gene missense variations G3377A, G3599A, G3703A, and G3757A was higher in the case groups than in the control groups.\n\n    Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that 87 samples were European strains, 3 cases were Asian strains, there were no other variations, and G4181A was related to Asian strains. HPV16 L2 gene missense variations G3377A, G3599A, G3703A, and G3757A were significantly more frequent in the case groups than in the control groups.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12920-024-01926-3.",
        "Introduction": "    Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth leading cause of death from malignancy among women, with 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide in 2020 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The occurrence and development of cervical cancer is related to the economic and health status of the region, and the incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer in Xinjiang, China, is still very high.\n\n    Cancer etiology research in the past 25 years has revealed persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) as a main cause of cervical cancer development and progression. The positive rate of HPV in Xinjiang is 14.02% with HPV52, HPV53, HPV16 and HPV18 being the most common types and HPV16 being the most pathogenic among all HPV types. HPV16 is the most dangerous and most preventable virus type. HPV16 is divided into four main variant lineages: A lineage contains EUR (A1-A3) and As (A4); B lineage contains AF-1, C lineage contains (AF-2) and D lineage contains NA (D1), AAII (D2) and AAI (D3). The HPV16 that infects women in Xinjiang, China, are mostly European strains in A lineage.\n\n    The complete HPV16 genome is approximately 7.9 kb, consisting of six early genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7), two late genes (L1 and L2), and one long control region (LCR). The HPV16 E4 gene encodes the E4 protein, which is the protein with the highest HPV16 expression. The main amino acids are derived from the E4 ORF, which is contained in the E2 gene. The E4 protein plays a role in viral transmission by enhancing viral replication and the excretion of virions. The HPV16 E5 gene encodes a transmembrane protein with 83 amino acids that serves as an innate immune evasion factor. The transmembrane protein is involved in immune surveillance and immune evasion, leading to persistent viral infection. The transmembrane protein also plays a central role in the regulation of the host immune system, and directly related to the initial stages of cervical cancer development. The HPV L2 gene encodes a minor capsid protein, which promotes retrograde transport of the viral genome, integrating the viral genome into the host gene during the intercellular phase, which may lead to irreversible changes in the cell.\n\n    Because the HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 genes affect a series of processes of virus invasion, immune escape and transmission, the distribution of the HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 genes in Xinjiang is not yet clear. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the variation in the HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 genes and their distribution in the case group and control group.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 90 patient samples were collected from Yili Friendship Hospital, Kashgar District People's Hospital and Shihezi University Affiliated Hospital with HPV16-positive cervical cell samples. All samples had been collected from 2016 to 2017 and patients of age were from 30 to 60 years old. The diagnosis of cervical cancer was confirmed by pathological examination according to \"Diagnosis and Treatment, Obstetrics and Gynaecology\" and the FIGO stage (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, 2009). The inclusion criteria for control groups were HPV16 positive and the absence of lesions or inflammation in the cervix. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patients had no history of long-term travel or residence, and samples were collected and stored in a -80 C low-temperature refrigerator. The pathological information of the samples is shown in Table S1 of the supplementary materials.\n\n    The HPV genotyping (23 types) was performed with PCR-reverse dot blot hybridization technology (Shenzhen Co., Ltd., China). All of the detection procedures were conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    A DNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biochemical Co., Ltd.) was used to extract DNA, which was stored in a -20  C freezer. Using 1% agarose electrophoresis examined the quality of DNA samples; DNA samples were diluted to a working concentration of 10-20 ng/microL. Samples without DNA bands were re-extracted. The mixed reaction solution (40 microL) consisted of 20 microL of 2xTaq enzyme PCR SuperMix, 1 microL of forward primer (10micromol/L), 1 microL of reverse primer (10micromol/L), 2 microL of DNA sample, and 16 microL of ddH2O. The PCR cycling conditions were 94  C for 5 min; 34 cycles of 94  C for 30 s, 52  C for 30 s, 72  C for 1 min; and 72  C for 5 min. Using 1% agarose electrophoresis examined the quality of PCR products, and samples with bright and regular bands at 650 bp were qualified for subsequent DNA sequencing. PCR products were stored in a -20  C freezer. Information on the primers is shown in Table 1.\n\n    Sequencing was performed by Shanghai Sangon, The Beijing Genomics Institute and other sequencing companies, and the PCR product was purified by SAP (Promega) and EXO I (Epicentre): 0.5 U SAP and 4 U Exo I were added to 8 microl PCR products. The mixture was incubated at 37  C for 60 min, followed by incubation at 75  C for 15 min. Finally, the BIG-DYE Terminator V3.1 cycle sequencing kit from ABI Co. was used for sample sequencing on a DNA analyzer (ABI3130XL) after purification with alcohol. The sequencing primers were: 16B1228E-6 F, 16B1228E-7 F, 16B1228E-8 F, 16B1228E-9 F, 16B1228E-10 F (Table 1).\n\n    The raw sequences were assembled by Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software and were aligned with the European prototype virus strain (GenBank: NC_001526.4) and the accession numbers of other HPV16 variants including European strains A1-A3: A1 (HQ644283.1, HQ644268.1, HQ644280.1, HQ644282.1), A2: (AF5.36179.1), A3: (HQ644236.1), Asian strains A4 (HQ644235.1, HQ644248.1, AF534061.1, HQ644251.1), African strains B (HQ644238.1, HQ644240.1, HQ644290.1, HQ644298.1) and C (AF472509.1, HQ644239.1, HQ644249.1, HQ644237.1), North American strains: D1 (HQ644257.1), Asian American strains: D2 (HQ644263.1, HQ644277.1, HQ644279.1, HQ644281.1), D3 (HQ644247.1, HQ644255.1, HQ644253.1, AF402678.1). Phylogenetic tree of HPV16 E4, E5, and L2 gene was constructed with MEGA, using the Maximum likelihood method, the Bootstrap method (1000 replication), the Tamura 3-parameter model, Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G + I) and showing only greater than 50% of the Bootstrap values, where the Bootstrap values were > 70% indicates good reliability.\n\n    The variation frequency of HPV16 E4, E5, and L2 gene variation was directly counted. SPSS 26.0 software was used to analyze the statistical results and the correlation between HPV16 E4, E5, and L2 single nucleotide variation and cervical cancer. P values < 0.05 is accepted as statistically significant in chi-square test.\n\n    No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\n\n    The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committees of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University (Approval Number: KJ2020-051-01, date: 2020.3.28). Informed consent was obtained from all patients for our research.\n\n    Not applicable.",
        "Results": "    HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 gene variation results: gene sequencing results of 90 DNA samples with polymorphic sites shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4.\n\n    Among the 90 HPV16-positive samples, 81 samples had HPV16 E4 gene sequence variations in 18 nucleotide sites with 8 synonymous and 11 missense. The common synonymous variations were nt2520 (T-C) (25/81, 30.86%), nt2546 (C-T/A) (76/81, 93.83%; 2/81, 2.47%), nt2585 (G-A) (23/81, 28.40%), and nt2660 (T-C) (19/81, 23.46%). The number of variation of missense variation sites did not exceed 1. The frequency of missense variation was much lower than that of synonymous variations, indicating that the E4 gene was relatively conserved and had a stabilizing effect on the spread of the virus.\n\n    All of the 90 HPV16-positive samples had HPV16 E5 sequence variations in 16 sites with 6 synonymous and 11 missense variations. As shown in Table 3, the sites with high synonymous variation in the E5 gene were nt3213 (A-T) (20/90, 22.22%); the sites with more than 1 missense variation were: C2995T, A3115C, T3122C, C3127A/G, and A3178G, leading to amino acid changes leucine to phenylalanine (L4F), isoleucine to leucine (I44L), valine to alanine (V46A), leucine to isoleucine/valine (L48I/V) and isoleucine to valine (I65V) respectively. The A3115C and A3178G variations had very high frequency, 75.56% and 100%, respectively, and the simultaneous occurance of these two variations may significantly change the structure of the E5 protein and indirectly change the ability of virus immune escape.\n\n    Among the 90 HPV16 positive samples, all samples had L2 gene sequence variation in 100 nucleotide sites with 37 synonymous and 67 missense variations. The sites with high synonymous variations were nt4074 (G-A) (90/90, 100%) and nt4602 (A-G) (15/90, 16.67%) (Table 4). The most common missense variations were G3622A, G3641A, G3658A, G3703A, G3757A, T4177C, A4362C/T and A4654C, which led the amino acid changes aspartic acid to asparagine (D84N), arginine to lysine (R90K), aspartic acid to asparagine (D96N), glutamic acid to lysine (E111K), aspartic acid to asparagine (D129N), serine to proline (S269P), leucine to phenylalanine (L330F), and isoleucine to leucine (I428L). Through the three gene variation sites of HPV16 E4, E5 and L2, it can be found that the frequency of missense variation of the E4 gene is lower than that of the E5 and L2 genes, indicating that the E4 gene is more conserved than these two genes.\n\n    The Maximum likelihood method phylogenetic tree constructed with HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 gene sequences showed that 87 of the 90 HPV16 positive samples were European strains and 3 samples were Asian strains. No African, American or Asian-American strains were found. The Asian strains were associated with the missense variant G4181A, and the phylogenetic tree was shown in Fig. 1.\n\n    The pathological information of the samples was statistical, including 47 cases in the control groups and 43 cases in the case groups. There were 6 synonymous variations and 1 missense variations in the control groups (non-cervical cancer group) (Table 5). In comparison, there were 7 synonymous variations and 10 missense variations in the case groups (cervical cancer group). The sequence variations did not differ significantly between the control groups and the case groups (P > 0.05) (Table 5). Most of the missense variations appeared in the case group, indicating the trend of E4 gene missense variations in the case group.\n\n    The control groups (non-cervical cancer group) had 3 synonymous variations and 8 missense variations. In comparison, the case groups (cervical cancer group) had 4 synonymous variations and 8 missense variations (Table 6). The statistical results showed that the synonymous variations A3213T was significantly higher than the control groups in the case groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.024). It is worth mentioning that the variation frequency of the missense variation A3115C in the case groups was 83.72%, which was higher than the frequency of variation in the control groups (68.09%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).\n\n    There were 24 synonymous variations and 44 missense variations in the control groups and 22 synonymous variations and 44 missense variations in the case groups (Table 7), among which the missense variations were G3377A (P = 0.036), G3599A (P = 0.004), G3703A (P = 0.038), and G3757A (P = 0.019). The frequency of variations in the case groups was significantly higher than that in the control groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The amino acid changes were arginine to glutamine (R2Q), alanine to glutamic acid (G76E), glutamate to lysine (E111K), and aspartate to asparagine (D129N).",
        "Conclusion": "    Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that 87 samples were European strains, 3 cases were Asian strains, there were no other variants, and G4181A was related to Asian strains. HPV16 L2 gene missense variants G3377A, G3599A, G3703A, and G3757A were significantly more frequent in the case groups than in the control groups.\n\n    Publisher's Note\n\n    Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\n    Haozheng Cheng, Yangliu Dong and Le Wang contributed equally to this work.",
        "Discussion": "    Most of the research on HPV gene variation has focused on the E6 and E7 genes, while there are fewer studies on E4, E5, and L2 gene variations, and the understanding of HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 gene variations in Xinjiang is even more insufficient. The HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 genes dominate virion propagation, immune surveillance and escape, and the integration of the viral genome into the chromosomes of the nucleus; Sequence variation in E4, E5 and L2 genes, thus, will directly affect the ability of HPV virus to invade, immune, and spread.\n\n    We found that 87 cases (87/90, 96.67%) of the 90 HPV16 positive samples in Xinjiang were European strains, and the other 3 cases (3/90, 3.33%) were Asian strains. We speculated that the Asian strain was directly related to the L2 gene missense variation G4181A through bioinformatics comparison. The literature reported that the amino acid variations of HPV16 E4 protein include T22A, P36T, A43K, Q53R, L62I and L62P, which of these amino acid variations are related to the severity of cervical malignancy. The E4 gene also encodes the E1^E4 protein, the first five amino acids of which are derived from E1 ORF, while the remaining amino acids are derived from E4 ORF. nine amino acid variations (A7V, A7P, L16I, D45E, L59I, L59T, Q66P, S72F, H75Q) were detected in the E1^E4 protein, and these were associated with the severity of cervical malignancy. In this study, it was found that the amino acid variation of E4 protein (E1^E4 protein) : C7W, A10S (A7S), Y13C (Y10C), K40T (K37T), R43I (R40I), Q51H (Q48H), Q53H (Q50H), E67D (E64D), L79V (L76V), H82Y (H79Y) and T83R (T80R), which of amino acid variations had low frequency. Therefore, since the amino acid variations the frequency of E4 protein were much lower than that of E5 and L2 proteins, indicating that E4 gene was more conserved than E5 and L2 genes. Moreover, the missense variations of the E4 gene that was new variations were concentrated in the case group (cervical cancer). The HPV16 E4 gene is located in the central position of the E2 gene, which encodes the hinge domain in the E2 protein. The most common synonymous variations in the E4 gene, T2520C (30.86%), C2546T (93.83%) and G2585A (28.40%), are also missense variations in the hinge region of the E2 gene, which cause amino acid changes in the E2 protein and affect the viral replication process. The reported that amino acid variations of E5 protein include F19I, V21A, C24S, L27P, P31L, I44L, L47S, L48A, V62A, I65V, I65L, and L73V. We found that the new amino acid variations of E5 protein include L4F, L16V, L28S, V46A, L48I, L48V, I65R, I65M and L81V, which L48I and L48V were the amino acid variations with high frequency. It was reported that a total of 17 amino acid variations with high frequency in L2 proteins, including D43E, S122P, V243I, T245A, L266F, L266V, S269P, L330F, D334N, T351P, T351S, T352P, T352A, S378VS378F, S384A, V385I, I420T, A424T, I428L and A443G. The amino acid variation I428L was present almost uniquely in Asia, and the frequency of S269P and L330F was higher than that of the reference amino acid, at position 330 phenylalanine of L2 protein was more common than the reference amino acid leucine in Europe, Asia, and North America. We also found high-frequency variations of S269P and L330F in the L2 protein, which were consistent with the previous reports. In addition, the other high frequency amino acid variations have also been found in L2 protein, including D84N, R90K, D96N, E111K and D129N (Table 4). We found that L2 missense variations G3377A (R2Q), G3599A (G76E), G3703A (E111K), and G3757A (D129N), were in significantly higher frequency in the case groups (cervical cancer) than in the control groups(non-cervical cancer) (P < 0.05). These variations may affect the integration of HPV16 viral genome into the cell chromosomes.\n\n    Xinjiang is a multiethnic region. We included a total of 52 Han ethnic group samples in the 90 samples we studied, including 31 samples in the control groups and 21 samples in the case groups, and recounted several loci with more variations (see Table 8 for details). We found that the missense variation A3115C of the E5 gene was in significantly higher frequency in the case groups than in the control groups (P = 0.02), and the difference was statistically significant. However, as seen in Table 6 above, A3115C did not differ between the case and control groups in the 90 samples, so the A3115C variation may have different effects on different ethnic groups, which needs further validation.\n\n    The current study revelaed for the first time sequence variations in HPV16 E4, E5 and L2 genes and in Xinjiang, and the distribution of these variations among different ethnic groups. The sample size of the current study is relatively small and should be increased in future studies, in particular to include samples from more ethnic groups. Based on findings from the current study, variations A3115C, G3377A, G3599A, G3703A and G3757A should be further investigated in cell experiments to determine whether they affect the viral immunity and the integration of viral genome in cell chromosomes.",

        "Title": "    Single-molecule transport kinetics of a glutamate transporter homolog shows static disorder",
        "Abstract": "    Single-molecule detection of transport turnovers shows a distribution of rates with fast transporters favored by mutations.\n\n    Kinetic properties of membrane transporters are typically poorly defined because high-resolution functional assays analogous to single-channel recordings are lacking. Here, we measure single-molecule transport kinetics of a glutamate transporter homolog from Pyrococcus horikoshii, GltPh, using fluorescently labeled periplasmic amino acid binding protein as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based sensor. We show that individual transporters can function at rates varying by at least two orders of magnitude that persist for multiple turnovers. A gain-of-function mutant shows increased population of the fast-acting transporters, leading to a 10-fold increase in the mean transport rate. These findings, which are broadly consistent with earlier single-molecule measurements of GltPh conformational dynamics, suggest that GltPh transport is defined by kinetically distinct populations that exhibit long-lasting \"molecular memory.\"",
        "Introduction": "    Secondary active transporters catalyze the uptake of solutes such as nutrients, neurotransmitters, and drugs across lipid bilayers. Their catalytic cycle begins with a transporter in a so-called outward-facing state, where it binds a substrate from the extracellular solution, followed by isomerization into an inward-facing state, the release of the substrate into the cytoplasm, and the return of the empty transporter into the outward-facing conformation. The rates of transport vary widely between transporters and are likely regulated by the rates of the conformational transitions. However, detailed kinetic studies of transporters have been limited due to the lack of high-resolution functional assays. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of transporters lags behind the ion channels, for which patch clamp and other single-channel electrophysiological recordings have provided a wealth of information over the last several decades. Here, we implement a single-transporter assay for a homolog of glutamate transporters, the sodium/aspartate symporter GltPh, and establish parallels between the timing of its conformational transitions and transport events.\n\n    GltPh is a well-studied model transporter, which operates by an \"elevator\" mechanism, in which distinct transport domains shuttle across the bilayer delivering the substrate l-aspartate (l-asp) and three coupled sodium (Na+) ions from the extracellular to the intracellular side (fig. S1A). GltPh is a homotrimer with three peripherally located transport domains housed by a central scaffold or trimerization domain (fig. S1B). Previous studies of the transport domain dynamics conducted with single-molecule resolution showed that the domains moved independently of each other as well as a surprising degree of dynamic complexity. Specifically, only a fraction of the transporters was dynamic at a given time, while others remained largely quiescent. Infrequent transitions between nondynamic and dynamic modes were also observed in the wild-type (WT) transporter. Moreover, the observed transitions to quiescent periods were greatly reduced in a gain-of-function transport mutant R276S/M395R (termed RSMR for brevity).\n\n    To detect individual transport events, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensor using aspartate/glutamate-binding periplasmic protein PEB1a. Periplasmic binding proteins have been used for FRET-based sensor design because they share a common \"clamshell\" architecture and binding mechanism where they transition from an open to a closed conformation upon ligand binding (Fig. 1A). We encapsulated fluorescently labeled PEB1a in proteoliposomes harboring single GltPh transporters and recorded time-dependent FRET efficiency changes reflecting transport activity using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy with single-molecule resolution (smFRET) similarly to a recently reported assay for a neutral amino acid transporter. From these recordings, we extracted the timing of the first transport event and the consecutive transport turnover rates. Notably, individual GltPh transporters showed transport rates ranging from a few to hundreds of seconds per cycle. The timing of the transport events was consistent with the timing of the transport domain dynamics in both WT GltPh and the RSMR mutant, in which the latter showed an increased fraction of the fast-working transporters. Both single-molecule conformational dynamics and transport assays suggest that the transporters sample multiple dynamic modes that persist for periods substantially longer than the catalytic turnover times. This so-called static rate disorder is reminiscent of phenomena previously observed in enzymes and channels.",
        "Methods": "    Peb1a gene with a C-terminal 6xHis tag was cloned into pet21a(+) vector (GenScript) between Nde I and Bam HI sites. The single cysteine residue in the periplasmic leader sequence, Cys18, was mutated to serine. Cysteine-free construct is termed WT for brevity. Cysteine mutations Asn73Cys and Lys149Cys were introduced for labeling with donor and acceptor fluorophores. The sites were selected on the basis of the comparison of the crystal structures of the aspartate-bound PEB1a (Protein Data Bank accession code 2V25) and of the ligand-free homolog GlnH [1WDN; ] (fig. S2A). While the apo structure of PEB1a is not known, PEB1a shares ~30% amino acid identity with GlnH, and we expect similar conformational changes upon ligand binding. Protein structures were superimposed over the larger domain (residues 1 to 100 and 196 to 233 in PEB1a), and suitable solvent-exposed residues were selected. The resulting PEB1a-N73C/K149C variant is termed ccPEB1a for brevity. Additional mutations to alter the affinity of PEB1a for l-asp were introduced using QuikChange (Agilent). The identities of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. E. coli T7 Express lysY cells (Macrogen) were transformed with plasmids encoding PEB1a variants, and proteins were expressed and purified as described previously. Briefly, cells were grown in LB media with ampicillin (100 mug/ml) to OD (optical density) of 1 and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 hours at 37 C followed by 16 hours at 18 C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 3326g at 4 C and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose, and lysozyme (100 mug/ml). After 30 min on ice, the suspension was diluted 1:3 with deionized water and centrifuged for 30 min at 3578g at 4 C to pellet the debris. Supernatants were mixed in batch with 5 ml of Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) resin (QIAGEN) in buffer containing 10 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). The resin was washed with the same buffer supplemented with 40 mM imidazole, and the PEB1a proteins were eluted with a 40-ml gradient from 40 to 250 mM imidazole. The eluted proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in buffer containing 10 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 200 mM NaCl using Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Purified ccPEB1a and affinity variants were labeled with maleimide-activated LD555p and LD655 dyes using 1:1:1 protein:LD555p:LD655 molar ratio for 1 hour at 25 C. Excess dye was removed by SEC in buffer containing 10 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 200 mM KCl. Labeled proteins were dialyzed against 4000- to 16,000-fold excess buffer to remove bound l-asp. Labeling efficiency was determined using NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using extinction coefficients of 18,910, 150,000, and 250,000 M-1 cm-1 for protein at 280 nm, LD555p at 550 nm, and LD655 at 650 nm. Typical labeling efficiency was 60% for LD555p and 100% for LD655. Proteins were concentrated to 3 muM using 10-kDa cutoff concentrators (EMD Millipore) and stored in liquid nitrogen until further use.\n\n    Labeling specificity was confirmed by incubating WT PEB1a and ccPEB1a with LD555p/LD655 dyes at 1:1:1 molar ratio for 5 to 80 min, after which the reaction was quenched using 0.7 M 2-mercaptoethanol (BME). Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized using ChemiDoc-MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). For LD555p, the fluorescence was excited at 520 to 545 nm, and emission was detected using a 500/50 band-pass filter. For LD655, the fluorescence was excited at 625 to 650 nm, and emission was detected using a 602/50 band-pass filter.\n\n    FRET efficiency changes of LD555p/LD655-labeled ccPEB1a variants in response to l-asp binding were measured using a bulk PTI QuantaMaster 400 fluorometer (Horiba). Protein was diluted to a final concentration of 20 nM in 1.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Hepes/tris, pH 7.4, and 200 mM KCl. Fluorescence was excited at 532 nm, and emission was recorded between 550 and 750 nm before and after the addition of l-asp aliquots. To obtain l-asp binding isotherms, LD555p was excited at 532 nm and LD655 emission at 672 nm was measured continuously with 0.2-Hz rate. Samples were incubated at 25 C with continuous stirring, l-asp aliquots were added, and changes of LD655 fluorescence were recorded after 60 s of equilibration. Raw fluorescence signal was corrected for dilution and normalized to yield percent change. To obtain Kd, the data were fitted in Prism (GraphPad) to the following equationwhere X = [l-asp] and parameters a and b account for a gradual decrease in the overall fluorescence observed over the duration of the experiment, which might be due to fluorophore photobleaching. For presentation purposes, the data were plotted as a fraction of the bound protein.\n\n    The Asn378Cys mutant of a cysteine-less variant of GltPh and the RSMR mutant with a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site and 8xHis tag were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously. Briefly, crude cell membranes were homogenized in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes/tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM l-asp, and 1 mM TCEP and solubilized by the addition of 40 mM N-dodecyl beta-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) for 1 hour at 4 C. Following centrifugation to remove insoluble material, the transporters were purified by immobilized Ni-NTA chromatography in the same buffer supplemented with 1 mM DDM and eluted in the presence of 250 mM imidazole. The His tag was cleaved by thrombin, and the protein was further purified by SEC in 50 mM Hepes/tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM l-asp, and 1 mM DDM. GltPh was labeled with maleimide-activated biotin-PEG11 (EZ-Link, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at a molar ratio of 1:2:4 (protein:biotin-PEG11:NEM) for 1 hour at 25 C. Excess reagents were removed by SEC. Protein samples were concentrated to 10 mg/ml using 100-kDa cutoff concentrators and reconstituted immediately.\n\n    To determine the stoichiometry of GltPh per liposome, protein was purified as described above and labeled with LD555p at a molar ratio of 1:6 (protein:LD555p) for 1 hour at 25 C. Excess dye was removed by SEC. Labeling efficiency was determined to be ~96% using NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using extinction coefficients of 57,400 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm and 150,000 M-1 cm-1 at 550 nm for protein and LD555p, respectively.\n\n    Labeled WT GltPh and the RSMR mutant were reconstituted into liposomes, as previously described. Briefly, liposomes were prepared from 3:1 (w/w) mixture of E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) and egg phosphatidylcholine in buffer A containing 50 mM Hepes/tris, pH7.4, and 200 mM KCl by extrusion through 100-nm filters (Whatman Nuclepore) using syringe extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.). Liposomes were destabilized by the addition of Triton X-100 at 1:2 (w/w) detergent-to-lipid ratio. GltPh was added to destabilized liposomes at 1:1000 (w/w) PLR or at other PLRs, as indicated in the text and figures and incubated at 25 C for 30 min. Detergent was removed by six rounds of incubation with Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) at 80 mg/ml. Liposomes were loaded with buffer A by three freeze/thaw cycles and concentrated to 25 mg/ml, ~100 mul. PEB1a variants were added to final concentrations of 0.6 muM and encapsulated by two freeze-thaw cycles. To remove excess PEB1a in the external solution, the liposomes were centrifuged for 1 hour at 49,192g at 4 C and the supernatants were discarded. Liposomes were suspended in 100 mul of buffer A and extruded through 100-nm filters 10 times.\n\n    All experiments were performed using a home-built prism-based TIRF microscope constructed around a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope body. The samples were illuminated with a 532-nm laser (Laser Quantum), and LD555p and LD655 fluorescence signals were separated using a T635lpxr dichroic filter (Chroma) mounted in a MultiCam apparatus (Cairn). Imaging data were acquired using home-written acquisition software and scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) cameras (Hamamatsu). Before the experiments, microfluidic imaging chambers were passivated with biotin-PEG and coated with streptavidin, as previously described. Briefly, after passivation, the microfluidic channel was incubated with buffer A supplemented with 0.8 muM streptavidin (Invitrogen) for 10 min and rinsed thoroughly.\n\n    To measure binding characteristics, LD555p/LD655-labeled PEB1a variants were immobilized by incubating the channel consecutively with biotin-tris-NTA-Ni2+ and 10 nM PEB1a with 6xHis tag for 5 min each. Unbound reagents were washed away with 1 ml of buffer A following each incubation. For transport assay measurements, proteoliposomes were immobilized by incubating 10 nM samples in buffer A in channels for 5 min followed by 1 ml of wash to remove unbound vesicles. All buffers were supplemented with oxygen-scavenging system composed of 2 mM protocatechuic acid (PCA) and 50 nM protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase (PCD), as described previously. Typically, the smFRET recordings were carried out with 5- to 400-ms integration time using 500- to 20-mW laser power. Fluorescence emission trajectories were extracted and selected for further analysis using Spartan software. Only those trajectories that lasted longer than 15 frames with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 8 were selected for further analysis. Fluorescence signals were corrected for spectral cross-talk. FRET efficiencies were calculated as EFRET = ILD655/(ILD555p + ILD655). Trajectories corresponding to multiple sensors as indicated by multiple LD555p and/or LD655 photobleaching events were discarded. We also discarded trajectories that showed initial values of FRET efficiency either below 0.4 or above 0.7, which correspond to sensors that are already bound to their substrate and sensors that are denatured.\n\n    To measure l-asp binding, LD555p/LD655-labeled ccPEB1A variants were imaged at 100-ms time resolution, 50-mW laser power in buffer A supplemented with 0 to 100 muM l-asp. The mean FRET efficiencies for all molecules were plotted as functions of l-asp concentrations and fitted to a single-site binding equation in Prism. For presentation purposes, binding isotherms were plotted as fractions of the bound protein. To determine l-asp binding and unbinding rate constants, kon and koff, respectively, smFRET trajectories were idealized in Spartan using segmental k-means algorithm. A three-state model was used with FRET efficiency states of 0.65, 0.87, and 0 corresponding to ligand-free, ligand-bound, and photobleached states, respectively. The mean values of the ligand-free and ligand-bound FRET efficiencies were based on the fits of population histograms obtained in the absence of l-asp and in the presence of saturating 1 muM l-asp, respectively. The unbinding koff rate was determined by fitting the survival plots of the ~0.87 FRET efficiency state at 1 nM l-asp to a single exponential decay function. The binding rate kon was calculated on the basis of the equation kon = koff/Kd and using estimated Kd of 79 nM.\n\n    We estimated the expected number of the transporters per proteoliposomes as a function of PLR assuming uniform 100-nm-size vesicles and Poisson distribution, as described previously. Briefly, the number of lipid molecules per vesicle L iswhere r is the radius of the liposomes, d is the bilayer thickness, and s is the surface area of the lipid headgroups. The number of lipid molecules in a given preparation, l, iswhere X is the amount of lipids used to form liposomes in milligram, NA is Avogadro's constant, and MW (lipid) is the mean molecular weight of the lipid mixture used for reconstitution. The number of proteins used in reconstitution, P, is\n\n    If all proteins were successfully reconstituted, the average number of proteins per liposome, mu, would be\n\n    Proteins were reconstituted into liposomes prepared from E. coli polar extract whose major components are PE (67%) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (23%). In our calculations, bilayer thickness, d, and surface area, s, are assumed to be 36 A and 60 A2, respectively, based on values obtained in molecular dynamics simulations for PE:PG bilayer. These values yield an estimate of ~100,000 lipids per vesicle with 100-nm diameter. Using 731.5 Da as an average molecular weight of lipids and 134,000 Da for the molecular weight of GltPh trimer, we estimate that for 0.5 trimers per vesicle, there are ~5.4 trimers per 106 lipids.\n\n    The probability of observing a given number of transporters, lambda per liposome is defined by Poisson distribution\n\n    The PLR of 1:1000 used during reconstitution of GltPh is expected to yield 61% empty liposomes. Of the 39% vesicles that contain transporters, 77% are expected to have one, 19% to have two, and 4% to have more than two transporters. To empirically determine the transporter number in liposomes, LD555p-labeled transporters were reconstituted into liposomes as usual, except that the liposomes were supplemented with 1% (w/w) biotin-PE (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.). Liposomes were then imaged by smFRET, and the number of the photobleaching events per liposome was quantified. To quantify the stoichiometry of PEB1a encapsulation, the number of photobleaching steps for LD555p and LD655 dyes in trajectories collected for transport assay were counted. We used a PLR of 1:100 and 1:10 for Km and TFB-TBOA inhibition measurements of WT GltPh, respectively. On the basis of the calculations above, at a PLR of 1:100, almost all of the vesicles are expected to have at least 1 transporter with ~74% of them containing more than 3 transporters, whereas at a PLR of 1:10, all of the vesicles contain at least 25 transporters.\n\n    In all transport experiments, we used the ccPEB1a-Y198F l-asp sensor unless otherwise stated. For each preparation of immobilized proteoliposomes, we first tested for vesicle leakage in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes/tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM KCl, and 1 muM l-asp. Approximately 4% of ccPEB1a molecules showed a FRET efficiency change, suggesting that either they were not properly encapsulated or the liposomes were leaky. Transport was initiated by replacing the buffer with 50 mM Hepes/tris, pH7.4, 200 mM NaCl, and 1 muM l-Asp, unless otherwise stated, approximately 3 s after the start of imaging using a rapid perfusion system. Data were collected with time resolutions of 400 and 200 ms for the WT GltPh and the RSMR mutant, respectively, using corresponding laser powers of 20 and 50 mW, measured immediately downstream of the laser head. Each individual trajectory that showed initial FRET efficiency between 0.4 and 0.7 and stable mean total fluorescence intensity was analyzed manually for the timing of the first transport event. Liposome size and transport turnover rates were extracted from each trace using a MATLAB script (see below). Histograms of tauHC and tauTO were fitted to exponential distribution, and the histograms of the liposome sizes were generated using Prism.\n\n    To measure Km values, WT GltPh and RSMR mutant were reconstituted at 1:100 and 1:1000 PLR, respectively, and the proteoliposomes were loaded with ccPEB1a-Y198F/A64F, which has 21 muM affinity for l-asp. The proteoliposomes were imaged as usual in the presence of variable l-asp concentrations. The mean FRET efficiency changes over the first 5 s after active transport initiation were fitted by linear regression to obtain initial uptake rates. Data were fitted to Michaelis-Menten equation with a Hill coefficient of one.\n\n    To measure inhibition using TFB-TBOA, WT GltPh proteoliposomes were reconstituted at 1:10 PLR with encapsulated ccPEB1a-Y198F/A64F and imaged at 200-ms time resolution. Active transport was initiated by perfusion of 200 mM NaCl, 100 nM l-asp with or without 30 s before incubation with 10 muM TFB-TBOA in 200 mM NaCl. The mean FRET efficiency changes over the first 5 s after active transport initiation were fitted by linear regression to obtain the initial rates.\n\n    To measure nonspecific binding, biotinylated WT GltPh was reconstituted at 1:1000 PLR and proteoliposomes were loaded with LD555p/LD655-labeled ccPEB1a-Y198F. Sample was immobilized on the surface of single molecule chambers with or without streptavidin coating, using similar concentrations and volumes. Trajectories from these datasets were selected using the same criteria. The number of molecules in the datasets acquired in the absence of streptavidin constituted ~26% of those that were acquired with streptavidin. Notably, of these trajectories, only 15% showed FRET efficiency changes suggestive of l-asp uptake.\n\n    Each trajectory was analyzed to extract tauHC and tauTO (see Static disorder of the uptake rates in the Results section). tauHC was determined manually from the delay between the addition of l-asp and NaCl and the first abrupt increase in FRET efficiency. Because the exact time at which the buffer replacement occurs within the imaging field is not known, we used the time of the earliest jump in FRET efficiency (minimum tauHC) observed for any trace in the dataset as an approximation. tauTO was determined from fitting the tail rise in each trace following the initial FRET efficiency jump to a time-dependent binding equation, where we considered l-asp flux into the liposomes with the rate determined by tauTO. To enable such fits, it is essential to determine the apparent concentration of l-asp as a function of the number of molecules entering the proteoliposome. For this, it is necessary to estimate the volume of each proteoliposome, which varies substantially in the population. Toward this end, we note that the magnitude of the FRET efficiency increase upon uptake of the first molecule of l-asp is dependent on the liposome size and the Kd of the encapsulated ccPEB1a sensor, which for ccPEB1a-Y198F was 5.6 +- 0.1 muM based on bulk fluorometer measurements. Normalized FRET efficiency increase, J1, is defined aswhere FRETjump is determined by averaging the first two frames following the jump (Fig. 3). The value of J1 reflects the fraction of the time, FB,t,1, that PEB1a spends bound to l-asp, which depends on PEB1a Kd for l-aspwhere [LT] is the total concentration of l-asp in the liposome and [ST] is the total concentration of ccPEB1a. When the first l-asp enters the liposomewhere r is the radius of the vesicle in meters. Equation (8) can be simplified\n\n    Solving for [LT]\n\n    Therefore, r in meters can be calculated from the value of J1\n\n    Once the liposome size is determined, the tail rise of FRET efficiency following the initial jump, J(t), corresponding to the fraction of time that ccPEB1a is bound to l-asp can be fitted to the equationwhere [LT](t) is the time-dependent concentration of l-asp determined by the transport rate, 1/tauTOwhere t is time since the uptake of the first l-asp molecule. Trajectories with fits that had R2 values below 0.2 indicating poor fits were excluded from further analysis. These included trajectories corresponding to liposomes with radii smaller than 25 nm where the sensor was saturated upon the uptake of the first l-asp, trajectories with high noise levels comparable to J1, and trajectories with tauPB shorter than 2xtauTO. For the WT GltPh trajectories with tauPB shorter than 2xtauTO, we used the length of tauPB - tauHC/number of steps as an estimate of the lower boundary of tauTO in distributions of turnover time.\n\n    Distribution histograms of tauHC and tauTO were fitted to an exponential probability distribution function (PDF) using the following equationwhere x = log10(t) and x0 is log10(tauHC) or log10(tauTO). Cumulative survival plots were fitted to the sums of exponentials.\n\n    To convert the mean FRET efficiency evolution <J(t)> obtained by averaging hundreds of individual smFRET traces to mean number of l-asp molecules transported into vesicles, we rearranged Eq. (13)\n\n    Assuming that all liposomes are uniformly sized with radius r = 50 nm, we obtain the mean number of molecules transported per vesicle, <eta(t)>, equivalent to the mean number of l-asp transported per GltPh trimer\n\n    Using Spartan, we simulated single-molecule FRET trajectories over a range of transport rates (1/tauHC and 1/tauTO) to determine whether our procedure of manually determining tauHC and fitting tail rise of the FRET trajectories to obtain tauTO yielded accurate transport rates. A six-state model was used with FRET efficiency states corresponding to the efficiencies of ccPEB1a-Y198F in the presence of zero to five molecules of l-asp in the vesicle. The efficiencies were calculated using Eq. 13 after converting the number of molecules to concentration using a liposome radius of 50 nm. Poisson shot noise was added and signal-to-background noise ratio was adjusted to best mimic the experimental data. Mean total photon count was set to 500 and integration time to 400 ms. The trajectories were truncated at the end of 2000 frames. Donor and acceptor fluorophores were set to photobleach exponentially with characteristic lifetimes, tauPB, of 300 and 200 s, respectively. Eleven datasets each comprising 100 trajectories were simulated with transport rates between 0.004 and 0.5 l-asp molecules per second (with identical values set for tauHC and tauTO). Datasets and the extracted values of tauHC and tauTO were analyzed exactly as for experimental data. Correlation plots of the input and output tauHC and tauTO values were generated in Prism.",
        "Results": "    We introduced two cysteine mutations, N73C and K149C, into a cysteine-less version of PEB1a at positions where we expected a substantial decrease in interresidue distance upon l-asp binding (fig. S2A). The double cysteine mutant of PEB1a (ccPEB1a for brevity) showed specific, high-efficiency labeling with LD555p and LD655 dyes, self-healing fluorophores based on Cy3 and Cy5, respectively (fig. S2B). After extensive dialysis to remove bound ligands, fluorescently labeled PEB1a was immobilized in passivated quartz microfluidics chambers and imaged using smFRET TIRF microscopy at a 10-s-1 frame rate. Individual molecules yielded smFRET trajectories with constant efficiency of 0.65 +- 0.05 in the absence of l-asp and 0.87 +- 0.03 when 1 muM l-asp was added (Fig. 1B). At intermediate l-asp concentrations, we observed transitions between discrete lower- and higher-FRET efficiency states corresponding to binding and unbinding events (Fig. 1C). Plotting mean FRET efficiency as a function of l-asp concentration yielded a binding isotherm consistent with 79 +- 20 nM dissociation constant, Kd (Fig. 1D). On the basis of the dwell times of the high-FRET state at 1 nM l-asp, we estimated the binding and unbinding rates to be ~0.13 x 108 s-1 M-1 and 1 s-1, respectively (Fig. 1C). We further generated ccPEB1a variants with reduced affinity for l-asp by mutating residues around the binding site (Fig. 1, D and E). ccPEB1a-Y198F variant yielded smFRET trajectories with constant efficiency of 0.63 +- 0.01 in the absence of l-asp and 0.86 +- 0.01 when 100 muM l-asp was added. Notably, the Kd's measured by bulk fluorimetry and by smFRET for ccPEB1a-Y198F mutant agreed well, yielding Kd's of 5.6 +- 1 and 3.6 +- 0.4 muM, respectively, which we attribute to an increased dissociation rate. Consistent with this idea, we did not detect discrete transitions between the low- and high-FRET efficiency states in smFRET trajectories of Y198F and other mutants obtained at l-asp concentrations near their Kd values. Instead, we observed intermediate FRET values suggesting that binding and unbinding events occurred at a time scale that was faster than the imaging rate (Fig. 1B and fig. S2D).\n\n    For transport assays, we used cysteine-less variants of GltPh and of the RSMR mutant harboring a single cysteine mutation N378C on the extracellular side of the transporter (termed WT and RSMR for brevity). Cys378 has been previously used to fluorescently label and to surface immobilize GltPh with high efficiency and specificity. GltPh variants were reconstituted into 100-nm liposomes at low protein-to-lipid ratio (PLR) of 1:1000 (w/w), corresponding to ~5.4 trimers per 106 lipids, aiming to enrich for vesicle populations with no more than one transporter trimer. To establish the reconstitution stoichiometry, we labeled WT GltPh with LD555p dye before reconstitution, immobilized the proteoliposomes in smFRET chambers via biotin-phosphatidylethanolamine (biotin-PE), and counted the number of photobleaching events per vesicle. We expect ~60% of liposomes to contain no transporters based on Poisson statistics. Of those that did contain a transporter, we found that ~70% had one trimer, while the remainder had two or more (fig. S3, A and B). For transport measurements, we reconstituted the WT and RSMR GltPh proteins derivatized with biotin-PEG11-maleimide at the same PLR of 1:1000 into liposomes containing no biotin-PE. We encapsulated LD555p/LD655-labeled ccPEB1a-Y198F mutant using freeze/thaw cycles followed by extrusion and surface-immobilized proteoliposomes via biotinylated transporters (Fig. 2A). Photobleaching experiments confirmed that nearly all vesicles containing sensors had only one (fig. S3, C and D). Notably, our immobilization strategy used for transport measurements selects for the liposomes containing the transporters with their extracellular side facing vesicle exterior. Empty liposomes or those containing the transporter in the opposite orientation are washed away, except for a small fraction of those that attach nonspecifically.\n\n    Among the smFRET trajectories recorded for the proteoliposomes, 62 +- 7% showed initial FRET efficiency between 0.4 and 0.7 with a mean value of 0.63 +- 0.01, as expected for the ligand-free LD555p/LD655-labeled ccPEB1a-Y198F. The remaining trajectories showed initial FRET efficiency values outside of the expected range, suggesting that the sensors either already bound their substrates during reconstitution or were denatured. Such traces were excluded from further analysis. When 1 muM l-asp was added to the vesicles in the absence of Na+ gradient, nearly all showed stable 0.63 FRET efficiency (Fig. 2B), indicating that the sensors were properly encapsulated, and the liposomes were not leaky. When active transport was initiated upon addition of 1 muM l-asp together with 200 mM NaCl, vesicles containing the WT GltPh or the RSMR mutant showed gradual increase in mean FRET efficiency, as l-asp was transported into the lumen and bound to ccPEB1a-Y198F (Fig. 2, B and C). As expected, proteoliposomes containing the RSMR variant exhibited a more rapid change, with a majority reaching the substrate-bound 0.85 +- 0.01 FRET efficiency state within 10 s. In contrast, only ~40% of the proteoliposomes containing WT GltPh reached or approached 0.85 FRET efficiency state before dye photobleaching that took place with a characteristic time constant tauPB of 212 +- 3 s. However, when the WT proteoliposomes were imaged 30 min after the onset of the active transport, we observed a substantial increase in the population of substrate-bound sensors exhibiting high FRET efficiency (fig. S4). These findings suggest that slow-responding WT GltPh transporters are indeed functional but on a time scale that is slow compared with our observation window. By averaging all trajectories over the first 5 s, we estimated the mean initial rate for the WT and the RSMR mutants to be 59 +- 2 and 4.5 +- 0.2 s per turnover per transporter protomer, respectively. The rate we measured for WT GltPh is two to three times faster than the rate measured in bulk experiments. In addition, the RSMR mutant shows a ~13-fold increase in the uptake rate compared with the fivefold increase measured in bulk. These discrepancies are not unexpected, as the suboptimal reconstitution efficiency, mixed transporter orientation, and other factors may contribute to the lower measured rates in bulk experiments.\n\n    The initial rates of the FRET efficiency increase were dependent on l-asp concentration (Fig. 2D). Consistent with previous bulk measurements, these data yielded Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) of 400 +- 170 and 520 +- 100 nM for the WT GltPh and the RSMR mutant, respectively. As expected, the initial rate decreased in the presence of a competitive transporter blocker, trifluoromethyl benzoyl amino phenyl methoxy-l-aspartic acid (TFB-TBOA) (Fig. 2E). Because of the slow uptake rates of WT GltPh, we used higher PLRs of 1:100 and 1:10 for Michaelis constant measurements and TFB-TBOA inhibition, respectively. Under these conditions, vesicles contain multiple transporters, and the obtained individual trajectories were not used for further analysis.\n\n    When we examined individual single-molecule trajectories obtained from vesicles with PLR of 1:1000 (i.e., containing mostly single transporters), we observed a common pattern: After the application of the substrate, FRET efficiency was stable for a period of time followed by an abrupt increase (fig. S5). Such a FRET efficiency jump is, indeed, expected upon the uptake of the first l-asp (Fig. 3, A to C). The time between application of the substrate and the FRET efficiency jump, tauHC, corresponds to the \"first half cycle,\" which involves binding of l-asp to the outward-facing transporter, translocation of the transport domain into the inward-facing state, release of l-asp, and its binding to the sensor (Fig. 3, A to C, and fig. S1A). Notably, the amplitude of the jump reflects the fraction of time that the sensor spends bound to l-asp and, therefore, on the volume of the vesicle and the sensor Kd (see below). In contrast, the half-cycle time, tauHC, is independent of the liposome size and is only determined by the rate of the transporter.\n\n    The GltPh trimer is composed of protomers that function stochastically and independently of each other; therefore, any one of the three can mediate the first uptake. We analyzed trajectories originating from hundreds of WT GltPh proteoliposomes and found that the uptake of the first l-asp occurred with vastly variable rates. Fitting the cumulative distribution of tauHC's required at least three exponentials, defining \"fast,\" \"intermediate,\" and \"slow\" transporters with corresponding tauHC's of ~3, 35, and 350 s (Fig. 3D and Fig. S6A). In addition, in about 60% of the vesicles, the sensors had photobleached before the entry of the first l-asp. A fraction of these are attached to the surface nonspecifically and carry no transporter, while others contain either slow or nonfunctional transporters. Notably, if a proteoliposome shows slow uptake, then that means that all three protomers of the GltPh trimer are slow. In contrast, one fast-working protomer per trimer is enough for a proteoliposome to show fast uptake. Taking into account that there are vesicles carrying multiple trimers, we estimate that less than 15% of the transporter protomers work with fast or intermediate rates, while the majority are slow. The RSMR mutant exhibited a much narrower distribution of the first half-cycle times dominated by fast transporters with tauHC of ~1 s and with a minor population of transporters with tauHC of ~30 s (Fig. 3D and fig. S6B). Collectively, the data suggest that the faster uptake rates of the RSMR mutant observed in the ensemble measurements are due to the elimination of slow transporters and a substantial increase in the population of the fast transporters.\n\n    The number of l-asp molecules that need to be transported to fully saturate the sensor depends on the size of the vesicle and on the sensor Kd. For example, ccPEB1a-Y198F is expected to be nearly saturated after ~6 molecules are transported into a vesicle with 50-nm radius (Fig. 3C). In some trajectories, however, the initial jump resulted in the maximal 0.85 FRET efficiency state, as would be expected for small liposomes with radius less than 25 nm, where one molecule of l-asp achieves apparent concentration >25 muM, sufficient to nearly saturate ccPEB1a-Y198F. Nonetheless, in the majority of proteoliposomes, the initial jump was smaller, and the trajectories exhibited further increases in FRET efficiency, as consecutive l-asp molecules were transported (Fig. 3, B and C and fig. S5). In such cases, we infer that experimental shot noise and instrument noise likely obscure individual transport events (fig. S5). On the basis of the amplitude of the initial FRET efficiency jump, we estimated the size of each individual vesicle. The apparent vesicle size distributions obtained were similar to those observed by negative-stain electron microscopy (fig. S7) and cryo-electron microscopy, except that the larger size vesicles were underrepresented. This is partly because negative staining method might distort liposomes and partly because in vesicles with a radius larger than 80 nm, the FRET efficiency increases less than 10% of the maximum change after the entry of the first l-asp. For such trajectories, accurate detection of the first FRET efficiency jump is difficult, and they were not analyzed. In addition, larger vesicles are more likely to contain multiple sensors and excluded during early stages of analysis.\n\n    For further analysis, we selected traces from vesicles with radii between 25 and 80 nm that showed a gradual FRET efficiency increase following initial jump and reached or approached 0.85 FRET efficiency state. We fitted these individual FRET efficiency time courses to a time-dependent mass action binding equation, in which l-asp concentration increased linearly with a rate determined by the mean turnover time, tauTO, of a given transporter (fig. S5). By analyzing simulated data generated with a range of input transport rates, we confirmed that our analysis procedure successfully recovered the tauHC and tauTO. Substantial deviations were observed only at very slow transport rates below 0.01 s-1, where dye lifetime was not long enough to observe transport events (fig. S8).\n\n    Overall, the distributions of the turnover times, tauTO's, covered the same range as the distributions of the tauHC's (Fig. 3D). Notably, the tauHC and tauTO values for each individual transporter showed a nearly one-to-one correlation (Fig. 3E). Similar tauHC and tauTO values are consistent with an earlier hypothesis that the outward-to-inward translocation of the substrate-bound WT transporter is rate limiting to the cycle and that the return of the empty transporter into the outward-facing state is comparatively fast (fig. S1). More notably, the close correspondence between tauHC and tauTO suggests that the transporters that start out fast (short tauHC) continue to transport rapidly (short tauTO), while those that start out slow continue to transport slowly. Particularly for the WT GltPh, distinct transport regimes that persisted throughout the observation window were evident (Fig. 3E).\n\n    The observed kinetic heterogeneity might be due to differences in posttranslational modifications between the transporters or to differences between lipid compositions of the individual vesicles. We think that neither of these possibilities is likely because proteins expressed in Escherichia coli are rarely subject to posttranslational modifications and the lipid mixture used to prepare the liposomes does not contain cholesterol and therefore is unlikely to show phase separation that could lead to intervesicle differences in lipid composition. In addition, the fractions of the slow and fast transporters differ for the WT and the RSMR mutant, suggesting that differences in liposome compositions are unlikely to be the reason for the observed heterogeneity. Instead, we think that the heterogeneity reflects long-lasting, distinct activity modes due to conformational changes in the transporters that determine the transport rate and which themselves are slow, persisting over multiple turnovers. If so, we expect the transporters to switch occasionally from one mode to another. Indeed, while a majority of traces with long tauHC show long tauTO, ~1% shows short tauTO, suggesting that these transporters have switched from a slow to a fast transport mode (fig. S9). Notably, the number of such traces is small, and the propensity to switch between modes remains ambiguous. The existence of the slow and fast transport modes is consistent with earlier smFRET studies of the conformational dynamics of the WT GltPh, which also revealed the existence of nondynamic and dynamic periods. Furthermore, the RSMR mutant showed both a reduced propensity to sample nondynamic states in smFRET dynamics experiments and reduced slow and intermediate transport modes in our single-molecule functional assays. It remains unknown what conformational differences underlie the existence of dynamic, fast-working and nondynamic, slow-working modes of the transporter. It is also not clear why the RSMR mutations affect their prevalence.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    By using TIRF microscopy and the FRET-based l-asp sensor to establish a single-vesicle/single-transporter functional assay, we tracked single and multiple turnovers in hundreds of individual GltPh transporters simultaneously. We deconvoluted the timing of the transport half cycles and full cycles for WT GltPh and the gain-of-function RSMR mutant and observed broad distributions of transport rates normally masked in bulk activity measurements. In WT GltPh, we identified at least three kinetically distinct populations with rates varying by orders of magnitude. The predominant turnover time for WT GltPh was in the hundreds of seconds. Thus, in bulk measurements, the observed substrate uptake is mostly due to a small fraction of the fast transporters, and the apparent rates measured do not necessarily correspond to any transporters present in the population. The increased transport rate in the RSMR mutant is mostly due to the shift in the populations in favor of the fast transporters.\n\n    The distributions of the transport times for the WT GltPh and the RSMR mutant parallel the dwell time distributions in the outward-facing state of the substrate-bound transporters obtained previously in smFRET-based conformational dynamics studies, suggesting that distinct transport rates are a consequence of distinct conformational dynamics in individual transporter protomers during the observation windows. The kinetic distinction between fast, intermediate, and slow transporters appears to persist over multiple transport cycles with infrequent switching observed both in the transport assay and in dynamics. Such mode-switching, sometimes termed \"molecular memory\" or static disorder of the reaction rates, has been previously observed in enzymes, ion channels, protein folding reactions, and other systems where single-molecule detection methods had been implemented. Typically, the structural basis of the rate disorder is not known. However, in one case, distinct protein folding rates, persisting over multiple folding/unfolding events, were attributed to a slow proline isomerization. While the structural underpinnings of the functional modes of GltPh are not known, it is notable that the protein originates from a hyperthermophilic archaeon and natively functions at ca. 100 C. It seems possible that distinct low-enthalpy structural states are \"frozen out\" at ambient temperatures and undergo very slow interconversions.\n\n    The combination of a single-molecule approach probing conformational transitions and a single-molecule functional assay provides a powerful, and potentially generalizable, approach for accessing to the relationship between dynamics and function of transporters. Applying these approaches to a broader range of systems, and particularly to human glutamate transporters that play critical roles in the glutamatergic neurotransmission, will likely bring unknown insights into the dynamic basis of their activity and perhaps suggest previously unidentified means of their pharmacological regulation.",

        "Title": "    Utilizing Multiple in Silico Analyses to Identify Putative Causal SCN5A Variants in Brugada Syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inheritable sudden cardiac death disease mainly caused by SCN5A mutations. Traditional approaches can be costly and time-consuming if all candidate variants need to be validated through in vitro studies. Therefore, we developed a new approach by combining multiple in silico analyses to predict functional and structural changes of candidate SCN5A variants in BrS before conducting in vitro studies. Five SCN5A non-synonymous variants (1651G>A, 1776C>G, 1673A>G, 3269C>T and 3578G>A) were identified in 14 BrS patients using direct DNA sequencing. Several bioinformatics algorithms were applied and predicted that 1651G>A (A551T) and 1776C>G (N592K) were high-risk SCN5A variants (odds ratio 59.59 and 23.93). The results were validated by Mass spectrometry and in vitro electrophysiological assays. We concluded that integrating sequence-based information and secondary protein structures elements may help select highly potential variants in BrS before conducting time-consuming electrophysiological studies and two novel SCN5A mutations were validated.",
        "Introduction": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare inheritable cardiac disorder associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), mostly affecting young men. The prevalence of BrS is estimated to be 5 per 10,000 in western countries and 12 per 10,000 in Southeast Asia. In our previous study, the prevalence of Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern in Taiwan was reported to be 0.13%. In 1998, SCN5A was found as the first putative causal gene that encodes the cardiac sodium channel hNav1.5.\n\n    In the past two decades, SCN5A mutations were identified through traditional sequencing technology. However, a bunch of candidate genetic variants are being identified using high-throughput genomic technologies such as microarrays or next-generation sequencing. Validation of all of them through electrophysiological functional studies can be costly and time-consuming. One possible strategy to overcome this challenge is to evaluate each candidate mutated locus using a bioinformatics approach. Different prediction algorithms and statistical models have been developed to explore the association between genetic variants and diseases by considering protein stability, sequence conservation and physical and chemical property. Among them, a growing number of reports have demonstrated that such functional prediction algorithms have been utilized and applied in several diseases, including X-linked mental retardation syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prostate cancer. In addition, a genetic variant may affect the normal function of one protein by changing the hydrogen bond network, pH dependence, and conformational dynamics. Several studies have taken protein structural variations and free energy changes into consideration when assessing the deregulatory effects, which have shown the effectiveness of predicting the possible influences of amino acid changes. To sum up, it is well known that sequence mutation is a primary contributor to protein structural variations, which may interfere with correct folding and/or docking. Therefore, combining the bioinformatics results of genetic variants with both protein structure and function analyses may improve the predictions and facilitate the characterization of the pathogenesis of BrS.\n\n    In this study, we hypothesized that utilizing online sequence-based predictors and protein structure predictors concurrently could help predict the protein functional and structural changes of SCN5A variants in BrS. To validate the predicted results, two assays including both mass spectrometry and in vitro electrophysiological experiments were performed.",
        "Methods": "    We identified 14 BrS patients with SCN5A variants in Han Chinese population in Taiwan from 2000 to 2010 (COBRA_ChiP registry, Cohort Of Brugada syndrome in an Asian Chinese Population). This cohort is the largest cohort with symptomatic BrS in Han Chinese population. Symptomatic BrS was diagnosed according to the current consensus shown in supplementary data. Five hundred fifty-one healthy individuals with no cardiac arrhythmia and normal ECG were genotyped as a control group. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Taiwan University Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All investigations and experiments followed the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    DNAs were extracted from peripheral blood by standard procedure (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR and direct sequencing were performed according to a previous study. We screened variants on 27 translated exons and exon-intron boundaries of SCN5A. Amplicons were purified and sequenced on a PE Biosystems 373A/3100 sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\n    To evaluate the potential functional impact of the identified amino acid alterations, we utilized three widely used algorithms to perform in silico analyses: Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), Polymorphism phenotyping-2 (PolyPhen-2), and Align Grantham Variation Grantham Deviation (Align-GVGD). Generally, these three algorithms all have high prediction accuracy rates, with reports showing their values of 0.69, 0.76, and 0.88, respectively. The detailed analysis procedures were described in supplementary data. Briefly, SIFT predicts amino acid substitution effects using sequence homology; that is, whether a non-synonymous substitution occurring in a conserved locus among the homologous sequences might be deleterious. Normalized SIFT scores of the non-synonymous alterations were reported, and a score of less than 0.05 was regarded as a deleterious change (i.e., intolerant). PolyPhen-2 integrates sequence-based and structure-based features to predict amino acid substitution effects using a naive Bayes classifier. An amino acid change was classified as \"probably damaging\" if its probability score was greater than 0.85 or as \"possibly damaging\" if the score was between 0.85 and 0.15. Lastly, we used Align-GVGD to evaluate the potential physical and chemical changes caused by these variants. Align-GVGD performs multiple sequence alignment to model 3D coordinates of an amino acid by considering its composition, polarity, and volume, and one variant is classified as neutral 1, neutral 2, deleterious 1, deleterious 2, and unclassified based on the computed GV and GD scores. A variant classified into the \"neutral 2\" category suggests that the Align-GVGD algorithm has lower confidence in predicting it as a tolerant change than that classified into the \"neutral 1\" category. Similar definition can be applied to the \"deleterious 1\" and \"deleterious 2\" categories.\n\n    To explore the effects of potentially disordered regions on protein structural characteristics, Regional Order Neural Network (RONN) algorithm was utilized. RONN is a structural bioinformatics program based on a pattern recognition algorithm, which collects entries from the Molecular Structure Database to create prediction models. We also performed protein structure predictions of Nav1.5 in the Phyre server, which predicted their secondary structures using three independent algorithms.\n\n    To examine whether the five variants of SCN5A were specific to BrS patients, we performed a genetic screening in 551 healthy individuals (mean age = 41 +- 12, range 9-80 years, Male/Female = 470/30) enrolled from Han Chinese population using mass spectrometric methodology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). All of their ancestors moved to Taiwan from southeastern China about 400 years ago, and no major population immigration or admixture has subsequently occurred. They were not Taiwanese aborigines. Since BrS affects more frequently in males, the male-female ratio for the control group was consistent with the ratio in our 14 BrS patients (M/F = 13:1). All experimental procedures were described in supplementary data, which followed the standard protocols provided by the manufacturer and were similar to a previous study. Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to assess the statistical significances, and odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using the additive model. We also calculated estimated prediction values (EPVs) for each variant. EPV was applied in another rare inheritable arrhythmic disease, Long-QT syndrome. The formula for calculating EPV was (case frequency - control frequency)/(case frequency) and for the confidence interval (CI) of EPV was CI = 1 - 1/(e{ln(RR) +- z*[SE(log RR)]}). RR is the relative ratio (case frequency/control frequency) and SE[log(RR)] was the standard error around the log of RR.\n\n    The details about cloning of SCN5A and cell culture were shown in supplementary data. HEK293T cells were transfected with wide-type or mutant SCN5A constructs, respectively. The eletrophysiological study was performed 48 h after transfection. A droplet of the HEK293T cell suspension was placed in a chamber (1 mL) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon, Ti1, Japan). Cells were incubated in 1.8 mmol L-1 Ca2+-containing HEPES buffer (NaCl 137.0, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 1.22, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 10, NaH2PO4 0.33, glucose 5.5, pH 7.4) in the voltage clamp experiments. Membrane currents were recorded at room temperature by using a patch clamp amplifier (WPC-100, E.S.F. Electronic, Gottingen, Germany) via a digital-to-analog converter (Digidata 1322, Axon Instruments) controlled by pClamp software. Patch electrodes were made from borosilicate glass (WPI, Sarasota, Fla., USA). Cell capacitance was assessed by pClamp software immediately after forming whole cell configuration via charging the membrane with a 10 mV square wave for 3 ms to calculate the divided value of current decaying time constant versus the access resistance. The data were filtered by a low pass bessel filter at 10 kHz and were digitized at sampling rate of 100 k Hz. For recording of hNav1.5, the pipette was filled with the internal solution containing (mmol L-1): CsCl 130, NaCl 10, Mg-ATP 5, MgCl2 2, EGTA 11, CaCl2 1, TEA.Cl 15, and HEPES 10; pH was adjusted to 7.2 using CsOH. For constructing the current and voltage relation curves, sodium currents were elicited by a family of depolarizing pulses from holding potential (-80 mV) stepped by 10 mV to the indicated depolarization potentials every step once per 5 s. The general access resistance (Ra) was about 2-5 MOmega in most of our experimental conditions. The series resistance was electronically compensated by 60-80% to reduce the voltage-clamp error. The pipette tip potential was adjusted to zero for each experiment. The details of measuring the steady-state activation and inactivation were in supplementary data.",
        "Results": "    Fourteen BrS patients (13 men) had nucleotide alterations of SCN5A compared to the reference sequences from NCBI website (CCDS46799.1), and clinical data of these patients were summarized in Table S1. The average age at the time of syncope, seizure or cardiac arrest was 42 +- 12 years. Four patients experienced sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 6 presented with seizure or syncope. All of them had normal physical examinations, and none had significant biochemical abnormalities correlated with the electrical events. Cardiac catheterization and echocardiography of these patients did not reveal any coronary artery disease or obvious structural heart disease.\n\n    Five variants of SCN5A were identified, and resulted in distinct amino acid changes. The association between clinical presentations and SCN5A variants of each patient with BrS is shown in Table 1. We found that none of the BrS patients carrying the H558R variant presented with SCD whereas more than half of those carrying other 4 variants presented with SCD or seizure. This suggested that the 4 variants were associated with more severe clinical presentations of BrS than the H558R variant. Furthermore, the BrS patients carrying homozygous A551T or N592K variants experienced SCD clinically and had longer PR interval or QRS duration of ECG, respectively, when being compared with the other BrS patients carrying other SCN5A variants. The two homozygous variants caused delay depolarization of action potential resulting in prolonged electrical conduction velocity.\n\n    Three variants (1651G>A (A551T), 1776C>G (N592K) and 1673A>G (H558R)) were located in DUF3451 domain and exon 12 of Nav1.5 whereas the other two variants (3269C>T (P1090L) and 3578G>A (R1193Q)) were located in Na_trans_assoc domain and exons 18 and 20, respectively (Figure 1). To assess the substitution deficits of the 5 variants, we retrieved the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) scores from the UCSC genome browser. As shown in Table 2, the GERP scores of the two variants (A551T and N592K) were high (3.35 and 4.12, respectively) which indicated that they have a low chance of substituting nucleotides (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the other 3 variants showed relatively lower GERP scores, especially the score of P1090L was negative. The negative GERP score of the P1090L variant indicated that the corresponding mutation in this locus may not have significant impact on protein function. Therefore, the results of GERP scores suggested that A551T and N592K may have higher probabilities of causing malfunction of Nav1.5 than the other 3 variants.\n\n    To explore the functional impact of the five variants in Nav1.5, we utilized three bioinformatics algorithms and the results are shown in Table 2. No significant changes were predicted in the H558R variant, which concurred with previous reports indicating it as a neutral variant without harmful effects. In contrast, all three algorithms indicated N592K as a potentially pathogenic variant with high probability scores. One algorithm indicated A551T and P1090L as tolerant substitutions but two algorithms predicted them as possibly damaging variants. However, the probability scores of predictions were much lower than those for the H558R variant (A551T (P = 0.44) vs. H558R (P = 1) and P1090L (GD = 63.55) vs. H558R (GD = 0)). This suggested the bioinformatics algorithms had lower confidence in reporting these two variants as neutral changes. For R1193Q variant, only PolyPhen-2 predicted it as a benign substitution. Since all three algorithms indicated the probability of H558R being a causal variant for BrS was very low, we excluded H558R variant for further studies.\n\n    To explore potential regions of structural disruption in Nav1.5, we performed the RONN algorithm in assessing the wild type of Nav1.5 (2016 amino acids). As shown in Figure 2A, the two regions with the highest probabilities of disorder were the DUF3451 and Na_trans_assoc domains, which contained all of the five variants. This result suggested that one nucleotide alternation in these two domains of Nav1.5 would have higher chance of causing structural changes of Nav1.5 than mutations in other regions do. To further evaluate the secondary structure of each variant, except the H558R variant, we compared the wild-type sequences with each altered amino acid sequence using the Phyre server. The Phyre server indicated that the two variants, A551T and R1193Q, were more likely to cause structural changes of Nav1.5 but the N592K and P1090L variants may not result in secondary structural changes (Figure 2B-E). The most altered structure occurred in the R1193Q variant, for which the association with BrS has been reported previously, especially in the Han Chinese population (Figure 2E). Next, consecutive secondary structural disruptions were shown in the A551T variant from amino acid position 560 to 563 (Figure 2B), indicating a beta sheet conformation was adopted in the neighborhood of the mutated locus. Since such structural variations of A551T and R1193Q variants may affect the transportation efficiency of sodium ions, we decided to further evaluate the biological impacts of them. In addition, N592K and P1090L variants were also included due to their high probabilities in functional disruptions of Nav1.5.\n\n    To evaluate whether these four SCN5A variants were associated with BrS, a large-scale screening was performed in 551 healthy individuals using mass spectrum technology. The results are summarized in Table 3, and revealed that the allele frequencies of one non-synonymous variant, 3578G>A (R1193Q), did not reach a significant level (Trend test: P-values   0.8). In contrast, the trend test indicated the other three variants, 1651G>A (A551T), 1776C>G (N592K) and 3269C>T (P1090L), were significantly enriched in BrS patients (P-value < 0.001). To evaluate the 4 variants, we calculated estimated prediction values (EPVs) and obtained their allele frequencies by using the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) from National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. As shown in Table 3, 1651G>A (A551T) and 1776C>G (N592K) showed high EPVs and no corresponding variants were identified in the ESP, suggesting they had higher prevalence in BrS patients than the normal controls. On the other hand, 3269C>T (P1090L) and 3578G>A (R1193Q) showed relatively lower EPVs and were reported in the ESP, suggesting these two variants were not specific to BrS patients. In addition to EPVs, ORs were utilized to measure the quantitative effect of each variant. Similarly, the results demonstrated that 1651G>A (A551T) and 1776C>G (N592K) were extremely high-risk in BrS patients (OR: 59.59 and 23.93, respectively) whereas 3269C>T (P1090L) was relatively low-risk (OR: 3.35). To sum up, the results of EPVs and ORs indicated that BrS patients are more likely to have the A551T and the N592K variants. Furthermore, 3269C>T (P1090L) and 3578G>A (R1193Q) were annotated as SNPs in the dbSNP database among Caucasians, suggesting they might have a minor impact on the functions of SCN5A.\n\n    To sum up the above results, we proposed that 1651G>A (A551T) and 1776C>G (N592K) were possible pathogenic variants with high confidence; 3269C>T (P1090L) and 3578G>A (R1193Q) might cause minor functional changes due to their equivocal data.\n\n    Previous functional studies have demonstrated that R1193Q accelerated fast inactivation of the sodium channel and resulted in reduced sodium current (\"loss of function\") in Xenopus oocytes and is an intolerant genetic variant in BrS whereas H558R is not. Thus, electrophysiological experiments were performed to evaluate the functional impact caused by the remaining three variants (A551T (1651G>A), N592K (1776C>G) and P1090L (3269C>T)).\n\n    The activation of cloned sodium channels was characterized by a whole-cell voltage clamp technique, and a range of sodium currents was elicited by the voltage protocol (Figure 3A). The sodium current amplitudes of both A551T and N592K variants were significantly lower than that of wild-type, whereas no obvious difference was observed in the P1090L variant.\n\n    The current densities of the SCN5A constructs were calculated by dividing the current amplitude by the cell capacitance. The relationship of current density to the corresponding activation potential was plotted in Figure 3B. Compared with wild-type protein, the current densities of A551T and N592K were significantly decreased, whereas no significant alteration was found in P1090L. The half-activation potential (V0.5,act) was calculated via the Boltzmann equation, and the results are listed in Table 4 and illustrated in Figure 3C. The steady-state activation of N592K was significantly shifted to the positive potential rightward by +3 mV as compared with wild-type (-33.1 +- 0.3 versus -36.3 +- 0.2, P < 0.01), and the steady-state activation of A551T was significantly shifted to the negative potential leftward by -2 mV (-38.1 +- 0.3 versus -36.3 +- 0.2, P < 0.01). However, no significant shifts were observed in P1090L (-36.8 +- 0.3 versus -36.3 +- 0.2, P = 0.238). In addition, the slope of activation of A551T was significantly smaller than that of wild-type (3.2 +- 0.2 versus 4.1 +- 0.2, P < 0.05).\n\n    The voltage-dependent steady-state inactivations of all three SCN5A variants were analyzed by the voltage protocol (Figure 4A), and the maximum sodium currents of N592K and A551T elicited at -140 mV were significantly lower than that of either wild-type or P1090L. However, no significant differences in the half-inactivation potentials and the slopes of the inactivation curves were observed among these SCN5A variants.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we demonstrated that utilizing online sequence-based predictors and protein structure predictors concurrently may facilitate identifying SCN5A variants with possible functional impact in BrS before performing in vitro studies. In silico analyses of their structural and functional effects predicted which variants would differ from the wild-type protein in functional assays. The electrophysiological study validated the predicted functional defects of the A551T and N592K variants, which caused a decrease in sodium current density without altering the voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation. This could lead to defects in cardiac cellular membrane excitability, resulting in the occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias. In addition, these two variants were identified in BrS patients resuscitated successfully from ventricular fibrillation with sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n    The functional prediction results suggested that H558R caused no harmful effects on the function of Nav1.5. Poelzing et al. showed that co-expressing the R282H-SCN5A mutant with the H558R variant produced significantly greater current than coexpressing the mutant with the wild-type gene, demonstrating the H558R variant restores trafficking of a BrS mutation. Therefore, our prediction results were compatible with those previous functional studies.\n\n    Our in silico results predicted that the P1090L variant may have a functional impact on Nav1.5, but may not result in secondary structural changes. Furthermore, our electrophysiological data showed that the P1090L variant did not affect the function of Nav1.5. However, Tan et al. reported that the P1090L variant showed a significant negative shift of the activation midpoint in patients with the Q1077del mutant (-5 mV), but interestingly, no such shifting was observed in patients without the Q1077 deletion. This suggested that the functional effect of the P1090L variant depends on an interaction with Q1077 splice variants.\n\n    In a recent publication, Takahata et al. identified the R1193Q variant in one of six BrS patients. In electrophysiological experiments, the R1193Q variant has been shown to inactivate more rapidly, and the onset of inactivation was three times faster. These functional changes are able to decrease the extent of sodium conductance, which may also be associated with BrS. In our data, although only one bioinformatics algorithm predicted the severe functional impact of the R1193Q variant, the structural prediction demonstrated it had the most altered secondary structure (Figure 2E). These data implied that performing bioinformatics analyses on both protein function and structure is able to compensate for the insufficiency of examining either function or structure alone. Furthermore, two BrS patients with this variant suffered from sudden cardiac death in our study. Thus, these results suggest that the R1193Q variant may affect the secondary structure of Nav1.5 and increase susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmia in BrS.\n\n    To further evaluate the performances of combining multiple prediction algorithms in predicting SCN5A variants in BrS, we performed a literature search based on the variants reported by Kapplinger et al. Among those mutations, 12 of them were validated by in vitro studies (Table S2). For each variant, we used the three prediction algorithms (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and Align-GVGD) to predict the potential functional effect. As shown in Table S2, the prediction results generally matched the results of electrophysiological studies. Ten of the 12 mutations were predicted correctly. The accuracy of combining the three prediction algorithms was 83.33%, which suggested that combining multiple prediction algorithms is an effective approach in screening and prioritizing SCN5A variants in BrS before conducting time-consuming in vitro studies.\n\n    Regarding the structure of Nav1.5, the two domains (DUF3451 and Na_trans_assoc) were shown to have the highest probability of disorder (Figure 2A). DUF3451 (pfam11933) is a presumed protein domain with uncharacterized function in eukaryotes. This domain has been found to contain the two members, PF06512 and PF00520. PF06512 is a member of the eukaryotic sodium transporter associated family, whereas PF00520 is a member of the transmembrane ion channel family. In the 3D structure of sodium channel proteins, such as Nav1.5, the loop flanked by two C-terminal transmembrane helices may determine the ion selectivity of the channel pores, which suggests that DUF3451 may be associated with the selectivity of the sodium channel. Moreover, the second domain (Na_trans_assoc) we identified is the sodium ion transport-associated domain, PF06512, itself, which contains a region found exclusively in eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channels. Eight BrS patients had one of two different amino acid changes in this domain, and mutations in this domain may interfere with the transportation by affecting the stability or structure of the sodium channel.\n\n    Although genetic testing is not involved in the diagnosis of BrS, the identification of a causative mutation may help confirm a clinically uncertain diagnosis. For genetic counseling, knowledge of a patient's BrS-causal gene defect can help physicians identify activities and behaviors that should be avoided and may be useful in determining your risk of experiencing a life-threatening cardiac event. For family screening (all first-degree relatives (children, siblings, parents)), genetic testing in families with an underlying causal gene defect may play a decisive role in who should take precautions in appropriate conditions (ex. avoid fever and drugs that decrease sodium channel availability/functionality) and who should be followed. In most of clinical molecular genetic testing laboratories, however, it is not feasible to perform in vitro functional studies for all identified genetic variants. To compensate this limitation, the prediction results of genetic variants using these algorithms may provide a quick and low-cost reference to physicians.\n\n    Even though integrated bioinformatics approaches did have merits, there are some limitations of them. First, most of them require established or well-defined data to develop prediction models, which may overlook the importance of some proteins that have not been investigated in previous studies. For instance, DUF3451, a domain of unknown function, lacks a 3D crystal structure in SWISS-MODEL and further investigations are needed to characterize its biological roles. Second, contradictory results are sometimes obtained across different algorithms, which may be attributed to their use of statistical models that consider different aspects of biological and chemical properties. To reduce the complexity, one of the possible solutions is to perform in silico analyses with multiple prediction algorithms and select the most consistent results among them. For example, the N592K variant was regarded as a harmful allele based on three prediction algorithms; its severe functional changes were then validated by the electrophysiological assay. Lastly, regarding the secondary structure predictions, only sequentially proximal regions were evaluated; that is, the potential long-range effects of these variants on protein structure were not considered. However, these amino acid changes may be physically close to sequentially distant protein domains after folding. Therefore, incorporating 3D structural data into the analysis is essential for improving the prediction results in the future.\n\n    In conclusion, with the advancement in high-throughput experiments, processing large numbers of genetic variants is very challenging, even in a rare disease. We demonstrated that concurrently utilizing online sequence-based predictors and protein structure predictors concurrently helps select candidate variants. Two functional pathogenic loci of SCN5A in BrS were identified through this strategy, and thus performing computational approaches facilitates selecting highly potential disease-causative genetic variants for future studies before performing costly and time-consuming electrophysiological studies.",

        "Title": "    Genetic Analysis of SCN5A in Korean Patients Associated with Atrioventricular Conduction Block",
        "Abstract": "    Recent several studies have shown that the genetic variation of SCN5A is related with atrioventricular conduction block (AVB); no study has yet been published in Koreans. Therefore, to determine the AVB-associated genetic variation in Korean patients, we investigated the genetic variation of SCN5A in Korean patients with AVB and compared with normal control subjects. We enrolled 113 patients with AVB and 80 normal controls with no cardiac symptoms. DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood, and all exons (exon 2-exon 28) except the untranslated region and exon-intron boundaries of the SCN5A gene were amplified by multiplex PCR and directly sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. When a variation was discovered in genomic DNA from AVB patients, we confirmed whether the same variation existed in the control genomic DNA. In the present study, a total of 7 genetic variations were detected in 113 AVB patients. Of the 7 variations, 5 (G87A-A29A, intervening sequence 9-3C>A, A1673G-H558R, G3578A-R1193Q, and T5457C-D1819D) have been reported in previous studies, and 2 (C48G-F16L and G3048A-T1016T) were novel variations that have not been reported. The 2 newly discovered variations were not found in the 80 normal controls. In addition, G298S, G514C, P1008S, G1406R, and D1595N, identified in other ethnic populations, were not detected in this study. We found 2 novel genetic variations in the SCN5A gene in Korean patients with AVB. However, further functional study might be needed.",
        "Introduction": "    The SCN5A gene, encoding a voltage-gated Na+ channel, is predominately expressed in the heart, where it has a key role in the generation and propagation of the cardiac impulse.\n\n    Voltage-gated Na+ channels are transmembrane proteins that produce the fast inward Na+ current responsible for the depolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Inherited variations in SCN5A, the gene encoding the pore-forming alpha-subunit of the cardiac-type Na+ channel (Nav1.5), result in a spectrum of disease entities, termed Na+ channelopathies.\n\n    In many previous studies, lots of variations of the SCN5A gene have been observed in various cardiac diseases, such as long-QT syndrome (LQT), Brugada syndrome (Brs), progressive cardiac conduction defect, atrial fibrillation (AF), dilated cardiomyopathy, and overlapping syndromes.\n\n    Recently, cardiac conduction system disease, manifesting as slower intramyocardial conduction and, in some cases, atrioventricular conduction block (AVB), has been related to SCN5A mutation. Familial AVB, characterized by progressive \"degree of block\" in association with variable apparent \"site of block,\" may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Two genetically distinct forms of AVB have been identified. Brink et al. established a genetic link between AVB and a genetic locus at chromosome 19q13, and Schott et al. mapped AVB to chromosome 3p21.\n\n    Such genetic variations in AVB patients have been widely studied in Caucasians, Han Chinese, and Japanese, but no study has yet been published in Koreans as far we know. Therefore, we carried out a complete sequencing of coding regions of the SCN5A gene, except the untranslated region, in Korean AVB patients to investigate the SCN5A variations associated with AVB and compared them with normal control subjects. This is the first study of SCN5A genetic variations that examined all coding regions in Korean patients with AVB.",
        "Methods": "    We enrolled 113 Korean AVB patients who were diagnosed with electrocardiograms and who had inserted permanent pacemakers and 80 normal controls with no cardiac symptoms. All patients and control subjects were recruited from four medical centers - Keimyung University, Yeungnam University, Catholic University, and Fatima Hospital (Daegu, Korea) - from August 2009 to September 2011.\n\n    This study was approved by the ethical committee at each hospital; consent was obtained from all individuals before enrollment into the study.\n\n    In this study, peripheral blood was collected into ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid-containing tubes, and genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from whole blood samples using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). DNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and purity of the DNA was assessed based on the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio.\n\n    The SCN5A gene is located on human chromosome 3p21, and the gene consists of 28 exons (Fig. 1) and encodes a protein of 2,016 amino acids with a molecular mass of 227 kDa. Entire coding regions, including exon-intron boundaries of the SCN5A gene, were amplified by multiplex PCR-based direct sequencing. The primers for PCR amplification were designed based on the GenBank reference sequence; primers are shown in Table 1. PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95C for 15 min; and denaturation at 94C for 30 s, annealing at 68-70C for 30-60 s, and extension at 72C for 60-90 s, repeated for 30 cycles (Table 1). After multiplex PCR, the reaction mixture was electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide (Fig. 2). Then, amplified PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator ver 3.1 cycle sequencing kit on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\n    Sequencing results were compared with the reference sequences (SCN5A/NM_198056.2/ENSG00000183873/ENST00000333535) using the alignment program BLAST 2.0 of NCBI, and we determined the portion of variation that occurred. When a variation was discovered in genomic DNA from patients, we confirmed whether the same variation existed in the control genomic DNA.\n\n    p-values and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for each genotype and allele were evaluated by chi2 analysis. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between AVB patients and normal controls of the study.",
        "Results": "    In the present study, we sequenced all translated exons and exon-intron boundaries of the SCN5A gene from 113 Korean AVB patients. As a result, we identified 7 genetic variations (of these, 5 were known variations and 2 were novel variations), consisting of 3 synonymous (G87A-A29A, G3048A-T1016T, and T5457C-D1819D), 3 non-synonymous (C48G-F16L, A1673G-H558R, and G3578A-R1193Q), and 1 splicing donor site of the intron 9-exon 10 boundary (intervening sequence [IVS] 9-3C > A) (Table 2). The examples of the sequencing result are shown in Fig. 3. Among the 7 genetic variations, 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported by American and Japanese researchers: non-synonymous SNP in exon 12 (rs1805124, A1673G-H558R) and synonymous SNP in exon 28 (rs1805126, C5457T-D1819D). A1673G-H558R was identified in 18% of the American populations (n = 71) and 8% of the Japanese populations (n = 100), and C5457T-D1819D was observed in 12.3% of the American populations (n = 130) and 46% of the Japanese populations (n = 100). We also discovered a synonymous SNP (rs6599230: G87A-A29A, in exon 2) and non-synonymous SNP (rs41261344, G3578A-R1193Q, in exon 20) that are very common polymorphisms in the Han Chinese population. In addition, we identified 2 novel variations that have not been previously reported. One of these variations was heterozygous synonymous (G3048A-T1016T), and the other was heterozygous non-synonymous (C48G-F16L). The genotype and allele frequencies of the identified genetic variations are summarized in Table 2. There were significant differences in the allele frequencies of A1673G-H558R and G3048A (T1016T) between the two groups (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in allele frequencies of the other genetic variations between the two groups (all p > 0.05).\n\n    However, G298S, G514C, P1008S, G1406R, and D1595N, identified in other ethnic populations, were not detected, and A3075T-E1025D and T4847A-F1616Y, discovered in 105 Korean sick sinus syndrome patients in our previous study, were also not detected in this study.\n\n    Next, to compare with normal controls, we analyzed normal samples by the same methods whether the same variations existed in their genes. Just as in the patient group, 4 SNPs (rs6599230, G87A-A29A; rs41312434, IVS9-3C > A; rs1805124, A1673G-H558R; rs1805126, C5457T-D1819D) were detected in the normal control group, but 1 non-synonymous SNP (rs41261344, G3578A-R1193Q) and 2 novel variations (C48G-F16L and G3048A-T1016T) were not detected in the normal control group.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This is the first case report with genetic variations of SCN5A in Korean patients with AVB. To date, a number of SCN5A variations associated with various cardiac diseases, such as LQT, Brs, progressive cardiac conduction defect, AF, and overlapping syndromes, have been reported. Although SCN5A genetic variations associated with AVB have been well studied in Caucasians, Han Chinese, and Japanese, no study has yet been published in Koreans as far we know. In previous studies, it has been shown that in some cases, progressive AVB has been linked to SCN5A gene variations. Furthermore, in our prior study, 2 novel variations were detected in Korean sick sinus syndrome (SSS) patients, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in any ethnic group.\n\n    The variations could be significantly associated with functional effects of the SCN5A gene. Based on these results, we searched for SCN5A genetic variations in Korean AVB and compared them with those of control subjects. The SCN5A gene consists of 28 exons and encodes a protein of 2016 amino acids with a molecular mass of 227 kDa. In our patients with AVB, there were 7 sites of nucleotide change from exon 2 to exon 28 of the SCN5A gene. Among of them, 2 sites (G87A-A29A, IVS9-3C > A) were reported as genetic variations in a Western study, and T5457C-D1819D has already been reported as a variation or polymorphism without functional effects on the channel in Asian studies. A1673G-H558R is located in the Na+ channel I, II interdomain linker, and previous functional studies have shown that the H558R-encoding minor allele can alter the phenotype of true disease-causing SCN5A mutations. It has been suggested that it modulates Na+ channel functional changes caused by other variations and plays a role in intragenic complementation. Previously, the H558R G allele has been associated with occurrence of early-onset AF and LQT interval in healthy populations. The H558R G allele frequency has been reported to be 20.4-32% in the white population, 29% in the black population, and 10.4% in the Chinese population. In our study, the G allele frequency of SCN5A mutation carriers was 8% and 13.1% in the normal control group.\n\n    G3578A-R1193Q, which can cause a gain of the sodium ion channel function and cause LQT3 and Brs, was also found. It has been reported that G3578A-R1193Q confers a risk of LQT3 or Brs in the general population, although it seems to be a common polymorphism in the Han Chinese population. Electrophysiological studies showed that R1193Q destabilizes inactivation gating and generates a persistent, non-inactivating current, which results in a gain of the sodium channel function, as in LQT3 syndrome.\n\n    In addition to previously reported variations, we identified 2 novel variations that were not reported in the case of Japanese and Chinese populations. One of these variations was heterozygous non-synonymous (C48G-F16L), and the other was heterozygous synonymous (G3048A-T1016T). Since a non-synonymous nucleotide change in the SCN5A gene is likely to induce a functional change in the sodium channel, a non-synonymous substitution was considered a candidate for the variation associated with this disorder. In this study, a non-synonymous variation, C48G-F16L, was not found in the normal control group but was detected only in the patient group, suggesting that it may effect AVB. However, G298S, G514C, P1008S, G1406R, and D1595N, identified in other ethnic populations, were not detected, thought to be due to very low frequency or no variation in the Korean population.\n\n    In summary, our data may provide useful information for the identification of novel variations related to AVB, and the novel variants may provide useful bio-markers to study Korean cardiac disease.\n\n    In a future study, we will conduct a functional analysis of the novel variation (C48G-F16L) and propose a mechanism for its contribution to the AVB phenotype in patients. Also, we will try to find out genetic variation sites in other genes that might be responsible for AVB.",

        "Title": "    Genetic Mutation in Korean Patients of Sudden Cardiac Arrest as a Surrogating Marker of Idiopathic Ventricular Arrhythmia",
        "Abstract": "    Mutation or common intronic variants in cardiac ion channel genes have been suggested to be associated with sudden cardiac death caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia. This study aimed to find mutations in cardiac ion channel genes of Korean sudden cardiac arrest patients with structurally normal heart and to verify association between common genetic variation in cardiac ion channel and sudden cardiac arrest by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Koreans. Study participants were Korean survivors of sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. All coding exons of the SCN5A, KCNQ1, and KCNH2 genes were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Fifteen survivors of sudden cardiac arrest were included. Three male patients had mutations in SCN5A gene and none in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 genes. Intronic variant (rs2283222) in KCNQ1 gene showed significant association with sudden cardiac arrest (OR 4.05). Four male sudden cardiac arrest survivors had intronic variant (rs11720524) in SCN5A gene. None of female survivors of sudden cardiac arrest had SCN5A gene mutations despite similar frequencies of intronic variants between males and females in 55 normal controls. Common intronic variant in KCNQ1 gene is associated with sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Koreans.",
        "Introduction": "    Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is predominant cause of sudden cardiac arrest. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been demonstrated to occur even in structurally normal heart. In this idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia, its association with mutations in cardiac ion channels or associated proteins has been suggested, but it remains to be clarified. Cardiac ion channels are important in normal cardiac electrophysiology, and their mutations can lead to sudden cardiac arrest by generating ventricular arrhythmia. Mutations in genes encoding cardiac sodium channel such as SCN5A and potassium channel such as KCNQ1 and KCNH2 have been suggested to be associated with sudden cardiac death. It has been reported that common intronic variants (rs2283222 located in intron 11 in KCNQ1 and rs11720524 located in intron 1 in SCN5A) were significantly associated with sudden cardiac death. However, genetic studies in the Asian patients with sudden cardiac death are rare. Therefore, it is needed to demonstrate association between sudden cardiac arrest and mutations in cardiac ion channel in the Asian patients with idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n\n    This study aims to find mutations in cardiac ion channel genes of Korean sudden cardiac arrest patients with structurally normal heart and to demonstrate association of common variants in cardiac ion channel genes with sudden cardiac arrest in Koreans.",
        "Methods": "    Study populations were Korean subjects who survived sudden cardiac arrest caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmia in one institute. Exclusion criteria were as follows; any evidence of structural heart disease in transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), existence of abnormal findings in coronary angiography (CAG) or spasm provocation test with ergonovine if performed, inability to confirm the presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia by routine electrocardiography (ECG) performed or electrophysiologic study, presence of typical ECG pattern suggestive of other disease which can cause ventricular tachyarrhythmia such as Brugada syndrome or long QT syndrome, and history of heart diseases such as coronary artery disease or other cardiomyopathy. Of these patients, we collected blood samples of the subjects who understood and agreed to our study.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). All coding exons and their flanking introns of the KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A gene were amplified using primer sets designed by the authors (Supplemental Tables 1~3). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with a thermal cycler (model 9700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as follows: 32 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 sec, annealing at 60C for 30 sec, and extension at 72C for 30 sec. After treatment of the amplicon (5 microL) with 10 U shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 2 U exonuclease I (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA), direct sequencing was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI Prism 3100xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). To describe sequence variations, we followed the guidelines by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee (HGVS) that 'A' of the ATG translation start site was numbered +1 for DNA sequence and the first methionine was numbered +1 for protein sequence.\n\n    We analyzed rs2283222 located at intron 11 in KCNQ1 and rs11720524 located at intron 1 in SCN5A to identify the presence of common variants reported to be associated with sudden cardiac death. We performed this analysis on the basis of the method described in the previous study. To inspect associations of these common variants with sudden cardiac arrest, we collected normal controls who have not experienced sudden cardiac arrest. These control subjects were collected randomly from gene bank of our institute. We could not get these patients' detailed information following guidelines of our institutional review board for genetic study. We also got blood samples of these control subjects and analyzed these intronic variants.\n\n    We also collected the data of patient's demographics, clinical presentation, and treatment from history taking and review of medical records. Echocardiographic images, CAG, and ECG were reviewed by experienced specialists.\n\n    Continuous variables were described as mean +- SD. Categorical variables were expressed as a number and as a percentage (%). Fisher's exact test was used to compare the frequency of aforementioned intronic variants in cardiac ion channel genes between case and control groups. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of these intronic variants in KCNQ1 and SCN5A genes for sudden cardiac arrest was calculated using logistic regression analysis. A P value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0 for Windows.\n\n    Written informed consents were obtained from all the study subjects. Our institutional review board approved this study (Samsung Medical Center 2010-07-014).",
        "Results": "    Twenty-one Korean patients who survived sudden cardiac arrest caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmia and had no history of heart diseases were collected. Three patients were excluded because of abnormal findings on TTE. Two patients were excluded because their ECG showed typical pattern of Brugada syndrome. One patient showed positive finding in spasm provocation test during CAG and was excluded. Fifteen subjects remained eligible for analysis. These study population consisted of 11 males and 4 females, with a mean age of 39.7 +- 12.3 yr (range, 18 to 66 yr). Thirteen subjects of these took CAG and had normal findings. Two subjects who did not take CAG showed no regional wall motion abnormality on TTE and did not have any other abnormal findings on laboratory examination and history takings suggestive of the presence of ischemic heart disease. Eleven patients undertook spasm provocation test with ergonovine and showed negative findings. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia was confirmed with ECG performed when sudden cardiac arrest happened. Five patients had ventricular tachycardia, and seven patients had ventricular fibrillation. Three patients showed both ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation on their ECGs. Only one patient had family history of sudden cardiac death. All of 15 subjects received implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. Corrected QT interval was 0.448 +- 0.040 sec in female survivors and 0.421 +- 0.040 sec in male survivors, and its difference between genders was statistically insignificant (P value obtained by Mann-Whitney U test was 0.19). Clinical characteristics of these 15 subjects are presented in Table 1.\n\n    In the analysis of exons of SCN5A gene, mutations were found in three patients. Direct sequencing in genes encoding cardiac sodium channel of SCN5A revealed G-to-A mutation at position 3578 in exon 20 of SCN5A, which causes the substitution of arginine (R), a positively charged amino acid, for a glutamine (Q), a neutral amino acid, at position 1193 (Fig. 1). Also G-to-A mutation at position 5812 in exon 28 of SCN5A, which causes the substitution of lysine for glutamate at position 1938 was noted (Fig. 2). There was no mutation in the analysis of KCNQ1 and KCNH2 gene. Interestingly, all the three patients who had SCN5A gene mutation were male.\n\n    Blood samples from 14 of 15 patients were analyzed for common intronic variation in cardiac ion channel genes except one whose blood sample for this analysis was missing. Four patients of 14 patients had C-allele at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene (C-allele frequency was 0.143 [4/28]) (Fig. 3). Notably, all these four patients were male. All 14 subjects had T-allele at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene (T-allele frequency was 0.893 [25/28]) (Fig. 4). We collected 55 normal control subjects (21 males, 34 females) who have not experienced sudden cardiac arrest for analysis of intronic variants in KCNQ1 and SCN5A genes. Forty-eight subjects (18 males, 30 females) had T-allele at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene (T-allele frequency was 0.673 [74/110]). Eight subjects (3 males, 5 females) had C-allele at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene (C-allele frequency was 0.073 [8/110]). Frequencies of these variants in all the case and control subjects were 0.717 (99/138) at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene and 0.087 (12/138) at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene. Frequency of T-allele at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene was similar, and that of C-allele at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene was lower than those reported from previous studies. Associations between sudden cardiac arrest and these intronic variants in KCNQ1 and SCN5A genes in our study were compared with those reported previously in Table 2. The frequency of T-allele at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene showed statistically significant differences between case and control groups (P value obtained by Fisher's exact test was 0.02). In this analysis, we numbered all the appearances of T-alleles at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene by counting two alleles per one subject. In additional recessive model, the presence of T-allele (TT) was also significantly different between two groups (P value obtained by Fisher's exact test was 0.04). In dominant model, the presence of T-allele (TT/TC) did not show significant differences between two groups (P value obtained by Fisher's exact test was 0.33). This discrepancy between two models probably results from higher percentage of TT homozygote in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (11/14, 79%) compared with that in normal controls (26/55, 47%) (Table 3). In accordance with previous study, the presence of this intronic variant appeared to be associated with sudden cardiac arrest (OR [95% CI]) for sudden cardiac arrest was 4.05 [1.15-14.32]). The frequency of C-allele at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene did not show statistically significant difference between case and control groups (P value obtained by Fisher's exact test was 0.26), and its presence seemed to be associated with sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia, but did not show statistical significance (OR [95% CI] for sudden cardiac arrest was 2.13 [0.59-7.64]). We analyzed associations between sudden cardiac arrest and these intronic variants in KCNQ1 and SCN5A genes stratified by sex. The presence of T-allele at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene still had positive association with sudden cardiac arrest, but it did not show statistical significance in male patients (OR [95% CI] for sudden cardiac arrest in males = 2.27 [0.56-9.17], P = 0.25; T-allele frequency was 0.850 [17/20] and 0.714 [30/42] in male case and control groups, respectively). This association seemed to be slightly stronger in females although OR could not be calculated because T-allele frequency was 1.000 in female survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (T-allele frequency was 1.000 [8/8] and 0.647 [44/68] in female case and control groups, respectively). Association between sudden cardiac arrest and C-allele at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene became stronger in male patients, but did not reach statistical significance, either (OR [95% CI] for sudden cardiac arrest in males = 3.25 [0.65-16.20], P = 0.15).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we found mutations of exons of SCN5A gene in Korean survivors of sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia. We have investigated common intronic variants in SCN5A and KCNQ1 genes reported to be associated with sudden cardiac death in our study population and control groups and found its association with sudden cardiac arrest. As we know, this is the first report of mutation and common variants in cardiac ion channel genes for survivors of sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Koreans.\n\n    In our study, survivors of sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia showed male predominance (11/15, 73%), in accordance with previous studies that reported higher incidence of sudden cardiac death in males. Spontaneous or induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia was more frequently noted in male patients who survived sudden cardiac death than females. Gender difference in risk of sudden cardiac death can result from different incidences of other heart diseases such as coronary artery disease between males and females. Previous study reported that coronary artery diseases were more frequently observed in male survivors than female survivors of sudden cardiac death. However, our 15 study participants showed male predominance despite less likelihood of concomitant coronary artery disease considering the results of CAG and other diagnostic tests previously mentioned. Some studies have suggested sex differences in other properties such as ventricular repolarization or hormonal status may be other possible explanation for male predominance of sudden cardiac death, but it remains to be clarified. It is noted that Ito-mediated action potential dome is a prerequisite for the development of phase 2 reentry dependent tachyarrhythmia and Brugada syndrome are predominantly seen in males whose Ito is significantly greater than that seen in females.\n\n    Mutations were noted at exons of SCN5A gene in three patients, but none in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 genes. Our study population showed significant association between sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia and T-allele at rs2283222 in KCNQ1 gene. The mechanism underlying possible strengthening of this association in females is unclear. A previous study has reported higher KCNQ1 mRNA level in female patients than male patients with long QT syndrome. Female gender has been suggested to be a risk factor for drug-induced long QT and cardiac arrhythmias in animal study. Gender difference in association between sudden cardiac arrest and genetic variants in KCNQ1 gene needs to be confirmed by further studies for idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia patients. C-allele at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene seemed to be associated with sudden cardiac arrest in Koreans despite statistical insignificance. All the seven survivors of sudden cardiac arrest who had mutation at exons or intronic variant in SCN5A gene were male. None of female survivors had these mutation and intronic variants in SCN5A gene even though intronic variants in SCN5A gene showed similar frequencies between males and females in our normal control group. When stratified by sex, the presence of C-allele at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene had stronger association with sudden cardiac arrest in males, but statistically insignificant (OR [95% CI] for sudden cardiac arrest was 3.25 [0.65-16.20]). Although the mechanism underlying this result is uncertain, we can speculate that some factors in males may strengthen association between sudden cardiac arrest and this intronic variant at rs11720524 in SCN5A gene. Some authors have reported that difference in hormonal effects between males and females may be the answer to gender differences in many arrhythmias. Male gonadal hormones have been reported to influence the susceptibility to reperfusion-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia in recent animal study. The explanation of the sex-related difference in sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia remains unknown.\n\n    Our study has several limitations. First, two patients (one female patient aged 46 yr, one male patient aged 18 yr) of fifteen survivors of sudden cardiac arrest did not undertake CAG. Nevertheless, they showed low probability of ischemic heart disease considering other diagnostic tests. Two patients did not take spasm provocation test during CAG, but had no symptoms suggestive of variant angina. Comparison of common intronic variants was conducted with case-control design. Bias caused by nature of case-control study such as selection bias could be introduced. Second, we could not get detailed information about control subjects' clinical characteristics. Therefore, programmed selection and matching was unfeasible, and this is our study's limitation. Third, data on potential confounding factors influencing association between sudden cardiac arrest and genetic variants in cardiac ion channel were unavailable. An additional limitation of the study is that the number of survivors of sudden cardiac arrest was relatively small. Therefore further studies are needed to verify this association.\n\n    In conclusion, mutations in genes encoding cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) were noted in Korean male survivors of sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Intronic variant in KCNQ1 gene was associated with sudden cardiac arrest in Koreans. Intronic variant in SCN5A gene seemed to be associated with sudden cardiac arrest especially in males. We suggest that sex should be considered when assessing associations between genetic variants and sudden cardiac arrest caused by idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and further studies are needed to confirm these associations and their changes by sex.\n\n    This work was supported in part by the grant from the Korean Society of Cardiology (2012) and the Grant of Center for Genome Research, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute (#GRC D-B1-005-1).\n\n    The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",

        "Title": "    Early repolarization syndrome: A case report focusing on dynamic electrocardiographic changes before ventricular arrhythmias and genetic analysis",
        "Abstract": "",
        "Introduction": "    Early repolarization pattern is characterized by the presence of J-point elevation >=1 mm in >=2 contiguous inferior and/or lateral leads of a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Early repolarization syndrome (ERS) is diagnosed in a patient resuscitated from otherwise unexplained ventricular fibrillation (VF) or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT) in the presence of these same ECG criteria. We describe an interesting case of a young patient with multiple episodes of recurrent VF in the context of ERS. We focus on the dynamic nature of both the surface ECG and intracardiac electrogram findings just before onset of the patient's observed ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, we review potentially novel genetic findings associated with this case.",
        "Methods": "",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    ERS is a rare clinical entity and is difficult to diagnose in view of the highly variable, intermittent ECG features and lack of other specific diagnostic tests. Moreover, early repolarization pattern is most often an incidental finding and has a relatively high prevalence in the general population without associated ventricular arrhythmias. This pattern is estimated to occur in 1% to 13% of the general population. Inscription of a J wave (between the junction of QRS complex and ST segment on ECG) is considered to be due to transmural dispersion of repolarization in the early phases of the action potential (phases 1 and 2). The ventricular epicardium often displays action potentials with a prominent Ito-mediated notch. Alternatively, a \"spike and dome\" action potential pattern may be observed. These findings are believed to be the direct result of a transmural voltage gradient during early repolarization between the endocardium and epicardium that ultimately manifests as a J wave on ECG.\n\n    Observational studies have shown that the amplitude of the J-wave may be absent during periods of relative physical activity but becomes progressively augmented immediately before VF events in the setting of increased vagal tone with the resultant associated bradycardia. This is likely due to inherent Ito kinetics whereby the channel is slow to recover from inactivation. Ito activity is reduced after an increase in heart rate. This results in a decrease in the magnitude of the J-wave. In addition, as observed in our patient, there may be clear evidence of J-point elevation that exhibits beat-to-beat variation during atrial fibrillation. especially during long R-R intervals (Figure 2).\n\n    Upon review of the intracardiac electrograms (Figure 3), inverted J waves occurred in sinus beats with a long cycle length. This is in contrast to the absence of J waves during relatively shorter cycle length sinus beats (Figure 3). We postulate that the beat-to-beat variance in J-wave shape and vector of the intracardiac electrogram is consistent with heterogeneity of transmural gradients during repolarization recorded in vitro. In the present patient, beat-to-beat changes in the vector of the J wave during sinus rhythm frequently preceded episodes of VF. Additionally, because the ICD right ventricular lead is situated in an endocardial position, the vector of transmural dispersion during repolarization is away from the lead (ie, from endocardial to epicardial). Thus, an inverted J wave is inscribed (Figure 3). This finding is in contrast to the observed J-wave \"upright\" elevation on surface ECG (Figure 1A).\n\n    PVCs that triggered PMVT showed short-long-short sequences with relatively short coupling intervals likely via a phase 2 reentrant mechanism. Phase 2 reentry occurs when the epicardial action potential \"dome\" propagates from sites where it is present to regions where it has been lost. This gives rise to closely coupled extrasystoles that trigger PMVT.\n\n    Rosso et al reported that the combination of J waves with ST segment elevation during sinus rhythm improves the ability to distinguish patients with benign (upsloping ST segment) from malignant (horizontal/descending ST segment) early repolarization patterns. In our patient, the ST segment was upsloping (after the J-wave in sinus rhythm) in lead II, V5, and V6, whereas leads III and aVF showed horizontal ST-segment elevation. Overall, we classified this patient's early repolarization pattern to be predominantly of the horizontal ST-segment type. This variant carries a stronger association with malignant arrhythmias. The inverted J-wave on the local intracardiac electrogram corroborates with the upright J-wave on the surface ECG. These findings together with the clinical presentation further establish the diagnosis of ERS in this patient.\n\n    Genetic analysis of 30 genes identified a variant in AKAP9 (Yotiao) that encodes variant 9 of the AKAPs. Such a variant has been associated with long QT syndrome type 1. However, Yotiao mutations are not a well-established cause of inherited arrhythmia. There has only been 1 published report of a missense mutation in association with a long QT phenotype in 2 sisters. In this report, it has been hypothesized that mutations in AKAP9 may lead to arrhythmia by disrupting the interaction between AKAP9 and KCNQ1-encoded potassium channels. To explain this mechanism, 2 binding regions for KCNQ1, encoded by exons 2, 9-11, and 16-19 of AKAP9, may be of particular relevance. Our patient carries a nonsense variant. Interestingly, the p.Gln2480stop variant was not found in any variant databases for the control population (dbSNP and the NHLBI exome sequencing project). However, other nonsense variants have been detected in the normal population, suggesting that nonsense variants in AKAP9 might be tolerated and are not associated with a cardiac arrhythmia phenotype. Another missense variant was found in SCN5A (c.3578G>A; p.Arg1193Gln), also named as an R1193Q variant with a minor allele frequency ranging between 0.12% (exome variant server) and 1.2% (dbSNP). This variant is prevalent in up to 12% of the Chinese population. Furthermore, this mutation has been shown to be associated with Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome, and in vitro data suggest a contribution of this variant to cardiac electrical abnormalities. For example, expression of R1193Q in cultured cells followed by patch clamping shows that the sodium current has a residual noninactivating component and hence could account for prolongation of repolarization. In addition, a shift in steady-state inactivation toward more hyperpolarized voltage could account for a Brugada phenotype. However, even though our patient is of Asian ethnicity, it is unlikely that this variant explains her phenotype, and we expect that the fundamental genetic causes remain unknown.\n\n    Overall, the genetic findings in this case are inconclusive. Even so, it is interesting to speculate that the AKAP9 and/or SCN5A variants might contribute to her phenotype as genetic modifiers. The therapeutic response to both isoproterenol and quinidine in this case suggests, but does not prove, a similar arrhythmogenic substrate to that observed in Brugada syndrome.\n\n    This case illustrates that in a patient with ERS, dynamic ECG and intracardiac electrogram changes may be observed before the onset of PMVT or VF. These observed changes are consistent with the proposed mechanism of ion channel dysfunction of Ito that is associated with ERS. Although genetic testing in this individual was inconclusive, some genetic variants were identified that could potentially contribute to the patient's phenotype in a modifier role.",

        "Title": "    Long QT molecular autopsy in sudden unexplained death in the young (1-40 years old): Lessons learnt from an eight year experience in New Zealand",
        "Abstract": "    To review long QT syndrome molecular autopsy results in sudden unexplained death in young (SUDY) between 2006 and 2013 in New Zealand.\n\n    Audit of the LQTS molecular autopsy results, cardiac investigations and family screening data from gene-positive families.\n\n    During the study period, 365 SUDY cases were referred for molecular autopsy. 128 cases (35%) underwent LQTS genetic testing. 31 likely pathogenic variants were identified in 27 cases (21%); SCN5A (14/31, 45%), KCNH2 (7/31, 22%), KCNQ1 (4/31, 13%), KCNE2 (3/31, 10%), KCNE1 (2/31, 7%), KCNJ2 (1/31, 3%). Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history (mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p = 0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1-12 years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally inherited (p = 0.007). Further family investigations and research now support pathogenicity of the variant in 13/27 (48%) of gene-positive cases.\n\n    In New Zealand, variants in SCN5A and KCNH2, with maternal inheritance, predominate. A rare variant in LQTS genes is more likely in whites rather than Maori, females, children 1-12 years and those with a positive personal and family history of seizures, syncope or SUDY. Family screening supported the diagnosis in a third of the cases. The changing classification of variants creates a significant challenge.",
        "Introduction": "    Sudden unexplained death in the young (SUDY) has devastating psychological and social effects in the community and in the surviving family members. Standard forensic examination fails to identify a cause in up to half of the cases, which can sometimes be attributed to an underlying inherited arrhythmia.\n\n    Cardiac ion channelopathies such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic tachycardia (CPVT) and Brugada syndrome can have their first presentation as SUDY. Death can be prevented; the challenge is to identify pre-symptomatic individuals in the community. Since these conditions are usually familial, their detection amongst the deceased potentially allows family members to be identified and protected. The hallmark studies of Behr et al and Tan et al demonstrated that cardiac investigation of family members can lead to a diagnosis in the deceased in up to 40% of cases. Another approach is the use of genetic testing from the decedent's DNA, the so called \"molecular autopsy\".\n\n    In New Zealand, a combined approach of these two methods was adopted in 2006. Sequencing of LQTS genes 1, 2, 3 (SCN5A, also associated with Brugada syndrome), 5, 6, and 7 was offered free of charge to the National Forensic Service in SUDY cases (age 1-40 years). Results of the first 26 months of analysis showed that molecular autopsy identified mutations and rare variants in LQTS/Brugada genes in 15% of the individuals in whom no diagnosis had been made using standard assessment. Our group was pleased to be part of the largest study yet of sudden death in the young, from Australia and New Zealand, showing that with a widened molecular autopsy, up to 27% of unexplained deaths are associated with \"clinically actionable\" genetic variants, in a large number of genes. It will take some years before we know for sure whether these have wide family significance, or are truly pathogenic by co-segregation. With continuation of the clinical service in New Zealand for a total of 8 years, and a further two years follow up, we aim with this study to focus on the long QT molecular autopsy and assess its diagnostic yield and the impact on family screening both in terms of the value to the families, and its effect on the final interpretation of the genetic variants we identified.",
        "Methods": "    New Zealand has an established inherited heart disease and sudden death registry with ethical approval from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (HDEC reference AKX/02/00/107/AM03). This is a signed consent-based registry where patients or legal guardians of patients under 18 and/or their next of kin gave approval for research into their cardiac condition and consented to the publication of anonymised clinical and genetic data. Since this is an audit from that registry HDEC waived the requirement for ethical approval for the present study. The report has also been approved by the chief coroner for New Zealand. A coordinated network of clinicians and scientists known as the Cardiac Inherited Disease Group (CIDG) provides clinical and diagnostic genetic services throughout New Zealand for families with inherited heart disease. We reviewed all cases of autopsy-negative SUDY who have undergone genetic testing for LQTS/Brugada since the beginning of the work in 2006 until December 2013. Funding for testing prior to 2008 was from charitable support, and after that was government funded via the Ministry of Justice. Previously reported cases are included in our analysis.  SUDY was defined as an unexpected fatal event in an apparently healthy subject or whose disease was not expected to be the cause of death, having occurred between the ages of 1 and 40 years-old.\n\n    Genetic testing of the LQTS genes linked to types 1, 2, 3 (SCN5A, also associated with Brugada syndrome), 5, 6 and 7 was performed as previously described by our group and by collaborating clinical service laboratories.  Since 2007, screening for rarer deletions and duplications by using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification initially and later by array comparative hybridization was included in the analysis and performed in cases where no mutations have been detected by initial sequencing. Genetic variants in the LQTS/Brugada genes were assessed for potential pathogenicity by using a multifaceted approach involving evidence from the literature and mutation databases, in silico analysis with predictive bioinformatics programs PolyPhen 2  and SIFT, in vitro functional analyses when possible and familial cascade screening. Cases that were found to have an established or potentially pathogenic rare variant using the tools described above were selected. During the timeframe of the study, some of the genetic variants were initially described as potentially pathogenic by our group based on the information available at the time, but with ongoing investigations locally and overseas, and family screening pathogenicity of some variants came into question and were down-graded. All cases were reviewed by CIDG and the conclusion as whether the SUDY case was a consequence of LQTS/Brugada syndrome was described as follows:\n\n    Highly probable and probable: there was enough evidence based on clear pathogenicity of the genetic variant, circumstances of death, previous medical history and family history, including screening and co-segregation analysis to support the channelopathy as the cause of death.\n\n    Possible: pathogenicity of the rare variant was detected by one or more methods described above and circumstances of death were compatible, but there was not enough evidence from previous medical history, family history and family screening.\n\n    Uncertain: pathogenicity of the novel genetic variant has not been demonstrated with the methods described above and family screening was uninformative or is still ongoing.\n\n    Unlikely: there was no clear evidence of pathogenicity using the methods described above or the variant was later found to be a common polymorphism.\n\n    Family screening was defined as supportive, partially supportive or not supportive of the diagnosis of a putative channelopathy depending on the results of co-segregation analysis.",
        "Results": "    From September 2006 until December 2013, 365 SUDY cases were referred for autopsy. Amongst them, 128 (76 males, 59%) were autopsy-negative and therefore referred for molecular autopsy. A total of 31 genetic variants was found in 27 cases (21%), with 9/76 (12%) males and 19/52 (36%) females having a positive genetic test (p = 0.001). Four males had two genetic variants each. In 13/27 (48%) of the gene-positive cases the genetic variants were deemed pathogenic (i.e.: 13/128 (10%) of all SUDY cases) and the consequent channelopathy highly probably or probably the responsible for the subject's demise-we classified these cases as \"final gene-positives\" for distinction. In the other 14 cases, current investigations have not yet been able to ascertain whether the variant and consequent channel dysfunction was the cause of death. In addition, some of the variants initially classified by CIDG as likely pathogenic were later down-graded to variants of uncertain significance or polymorphisms and therefore were unlikely to be responsible, on their own, for the SUDY cases (Fig 1). Tables 1 and 2 compare the characteristics of all gene-positive and final gene-positive with gene-negative cases.\n\n    New Zealand Europeans (Caucasians) were the majority in both groups; however the proportion of New Zealand Europeans in the gene-positive group was significantly higher (78% vs 42%, p = 0.001). Interestingly, Maori was the second most common ethnicity amongst gene-negative patients but none of the patients in the gene-positive group were Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Other ethnicities did not differ between groups.\n\n    The mean age of death did not differ between gene-positive and gene-negative cases. Males in the gene-positive group were younger but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The majority of gene-positive cases were in the older age group between 25-40 years when including all cases, but the likelihood of being gene-positive was higher between 1-12 years (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02), which increased for the \"final gene-positive\" group (54% vs 14%, p = 0.004, Fig 2). The opposite was seen for the age group between 13-24 years with a higher proportion being gene-negative (8% vs 46%, p = 0.007). No difference was seen for the older age group (25-40 years).\n\n    Circumstances of death did not differ between gene-positive and gene-negative cases. The majority of events happened during sleep (unwitnessed nocturnal deaths) in both groups, followed by daytime events. There were two deaths related to competitive sports in the gene-positive cohort (both during the activity) and four in the gene-negative cohort (two deaths during the activity and two immediately after).\n\n    Relevant past medical history was more prevalent amongst gene-positive cases (63% vs 36%, p = 0.01). History of seizures/epilepsy was the most prevalent past medical history reported in both groups, with no difference between gene-positive and gene-negative.\n\n    Relevant family history was more common amongst gene-positive cases but only significant when comparing the \"final gene-positive\" group with gene-negative (54% vs 26%, p = 0.04). History of seizures/epilepsy in family members, as well as SUDY and/or sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) did not differ between groups.\n\n    Table 3 outlines the demographic characteristics, circumstances of death, previous medical history and family history of all gene-positive cases. Table 4 outlines each genetic variant, evidence of pathogenicity and likelihood of having caused SUDY. \"Final gene-positive\" subjects were highlighted in bold characters.\n\n    Variants in the SCN5A gene were the most common (14/31, 45%), followed by KCNH2 (7/31, 22%) and KCNQ1 (4/31, 13%). Variants were less common in KCNE2 (3/31, 10%), KCNE1 (2/31, 7%) and KCNJ2 (1/31, 3%). One case, a 12 year old boy with diabetes presented in detail elsewhere was tested for GPD1-L and was positive, but we have not included his case in our current analysis.\n\n    SCN5A variants were the most common amongst both females (6/18, 33%) and males (4/9, 44%). Three males had two variants each in the SCN5A gene. Four out of the 13 \"final gene-positive\" cases had an SCN5A variant (31%). Two SCN5A variants were associated with a LQTS type 3 phenotype (cases 2 and 15) and 1 with a Brugada phenotype (case 6) according to previous reports, circumstances of death and family screening. One of the variants (case 23) was found in addition to a pathogenic KCNH2 variant and was deemed benign as described below. The cases described below highlight particular issues our service has faced with defining pathogenicity.\n\n    Cases 1 and 20 had a variant (R1193Q) which has proven in vitro effect on channel function and has been linked to Brugada syndrome but is now recognised as a common polymorphism in Han Chinese. Family screening was declined by one family of Chinese descent; in the other no phenotypic features of LQTS/Brugada were identified with cascade screening.\n\n    Case 4 had two novel variants (D546G and Y1950H), the former assessed as probably damaging/not tolerated on in silico analysis. Family screening did not contribute to establish or refute pathogenicity as one relative who was gene-positive for both variants had negative cardiac investigations including Ajmaline test. However, the deceased died during sleep and had a history of multiple febrile seizures, so a functional defect in the SCN5A gene cannot be ruled out as the cause of death.\n\n    Cases 6 and 16 had a variant (F2004L) linked to Brugada syndrome, SUDI, sudden death in women and as a common polymorphism. Case 6 had abnormal ante-mortem ECGs with features of Brugada syndrome and had documented VT/VF cardiac arrest. One of the parents declined genetic test but had a positive Ajmaline test, which in our view corroborates the pathogenicity of this variant in this family. Case 16 also carried the H558R polymorphism, which has been speculated to influence the functional phenotype of the F2004L variant. The decedent had a previous history of epilepsy and atrial fibrillation. The H558R polymorphism has also been reported in association with lone atrial fibrillation. Because of these characteristics we did not believe we could exclude a sodium channelopathy as the cause of death despite the fact that family screening did not contribute to elucidate pathogenicity of the variant in this family.\n\n    Case 13 had an intronic variant (c.612-2A>G) previously described in association with Brugada syndrome. However, family screening identified two relatives with the same variant and negative cardiac investigations, including Ajmaline test, so we believe the genetic variant was not pathogenic in this family.\n\n    Case 23 had a novel intronic variant (c.2436+12G>A) which was not predicted to affect splicing and was deemed non-damaging/tolerated on in silico analysis. The other variant found in KCNH2 has been described as likely pathogenic by previous reports. Family screening revealed 10 gene-negative relatives, all with normal cardiac investigations. The decedent's mother died of a cardiac arrest in the post-partum period, which is strongly suggestive of LQTS type 2.\n\n    Variants in KCNH2 were found in 5/18 females (28%) and 2/9 males (22%). The results are shown in Table 4. Our main challenges here were related to small family size, but in some there was reasonably strong support by phenotype/genotype co-segregation. An example is case 12 who had a deletion resulting in a frameshift mutation (G749Afs*8). Six family members were found to have the same mutation with four having definite abnormal cardiac investigations.\n\n    KCNQ1 variants were more common in males (3/9, 33%), with only 1 female affected.\n\n    Case 5 had a variant (E146K) previously described as linked to LQTS. Family screening revealed four gene-positive cases with normal cardiac investigations, all adults. One other child who died suddenly during infancy was found to have the same variant. We hypothesise that this might be a developmental variant associated with death during infancy/childhood which loses its pathogenicity in adulthood.  Cases 7, 8 and 9 all had variants previously described as pathogenic and family cascade screening was supportive of the diagnosis of LQTS.\n\n    Two KCNE1 variants were found in 2/18 females (11%) and no males.\n\n    Case 11 had a variant (R67H) previously reported as cause of LQTS, but family screening did not support or refute the likelihood of pathogenicity. Case 26 had a variant (R98W) reported as pathogenic and family screening revealed other gene-positive relatives with abnormal cardiac investigations.\n\n    KCNE2 variants were found in 1/9 male (11%) and 2/18 females (11%). After our investigations we are not confident of pathogenicity in any of these cases, though we remain suspicious regarding two of them.\n\n    Case 10 was found to have a rare variant (T8A) previously reported as cause of drug-induced arrhythmia. In addition, he had two previously reported common polymorphisms in KCNH2 and KCNE1 genes. At the time of death he was not taking any medications, but he died whilst swimming. It was unclear whether the combination of LQTS gene variants found in this male could have contributed to his death. Family screening revealed one gene-positive relative with borderline cardiac investigations as well one gene-negative with normal cardiac investigations.\n\n    Case 18 had the same variant as case 10. Cardiac investigations were suggestive of LQTS in two relatives, but the family declined genetic testing.\n\n    Case 27 was found to have a deletion in 17q24.3, which encompasses the KCNJ2 gene. Defects in KCNJ2 have been linked to Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS) and novel mutations have been described in two families with LQTS without the ATS phenotype. This female had a previous history of epilepsy and an abnormal ECG in life with a prolonged corrected QT on review of medical records. Her mother was found to carry the same deletion and has abnormal cardiac investigations. This case was reported previously our group.\n\n    Screening was performed in 24 families (2 families were living overseas and 1 declined). A total of 148 family members were screened with either standard cardiac investigations alone (64/148, 44%) or in combination with genetic test (84/148, 56%). Amongst the ones that had genetic test, 42/84 (50%) were gene-positive. Definite LQTS or Brugada syndrome was diagnosed in 18/148 family members (12%), 13/18 (72%) females and 5/18 (28%) males. Seventeen families had genetic tests performed in both parents of the decedent. The genetic variant was maternally inherited in 13/17 families (76%) and paternally inherited in 4/17 (24%). Family cascade screening helped establish pathogenicity of the variant in 10/24 (41%) families. Therefore 10/27 variants (37%) were upgraded to \"final gene positives\" supported by family cascade screening.",
        "Conclusion": "    The LQTS molecular autopsy contributed to a likely diagnosis in one fifth of SUDY cases, although this was only confirmed in half of the cases by family screening and further literature support. SCN5A and KCNH2 variants predominated. Whites, adult females and children aged 1-12 had the highest yield of a positive genetic test in our cohort. There was also evidence that mutations inherited maternally are over represented. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, past medical history of syncope, seizures and/or epilepsy was common as well as family history of sudden death. Family screening proved valuable in detecting a significant number of affected family members and in providing additional supportive evidence of pathogenicity of some of the rare variants encountered.",
        "Discussion": "    New Zealand was the first country in the world to routinely provide molecular autopsy as part of a clinical cardiac genetic investigative service for SUDY. The first 26 months of this work demonstrated that the LQTS molecular diagnostic hit rate of 15% was somewhat lower in this population-based cohort than in a previous selected cohort. Since that time, other centres around the world have incorporated genetic testing on the deceased into their investigations, although it remains far from routine. Countries such as the Netherlands and parts of the UK have pioneered cardiac investigation of the family, supported by genetic testing in living family members, as a means to achieve diagnosis in the deceased.\n\n    In 2008 members of the Trans-Tasman Response AGAinst sudden Death in the Young (TRAGADY) put forward guidelines to ensure standardization of autopsy practice in cases of SUDY. This was endorsed locally by the Heart Foundation of New Zealand, Human Genetic Society of Australasia and the Royal Australasian College of Pathologists. The key features of this document were the performance of a thorough autopsy by an appropriately experienced pathologist, the early involvement of the family in the investigations, storage of tissue suitable for extraction of high quality DNA and referral to a cardiac genetic service. The essence of these guidelines has subsequently been adopted by the Heart Rhythm Society and the European Heart Rhythm Association.  This document formed a basis from which a recent bi-national study of young sudden death could progress.\n\n    There remains however much to learn about in whom genetic testing is most valuable, whether it leads helpfully to a diagnosis in other family members and the relative benefits of the investigation of the family versus testing of the deceased. All of this occurs in the background of rapidly evolving and expanding genetic testing possibilities.\n\n    Of 365 sudden death cases referred to our multidisciplinary review panel, only 128, about one third, were finally put forward for molecular autopsy and family cardiac evaluation of first degree relatives. Cases were rejected for cardiac genetic evaluation on a number of grounds, with each case being different. Common examples include a positive toxicology result, evidence of significant co-morbidity, such as coronary artery disease or morbid obesity and hypertensive vascular changes, or florid myocarditis on histology. The constant scrutiny of autopsy reports, with ready access to second opinion, has led to an undoubted improvement in the quality of the reports, which at the start of the experience were often poor or incomplete.  Families of patients with another inherited heart disease at autopsy were also investigated, and genetic testing has often been done on the decedent, aimed at the disease concerned.\n\n    Of the 128 tested we found that one fifth of autopsy-negative SUDY cases carried a mutation or variant in the LQTS genes. From the start it has been a real challenge to define confidence in pathogenicity. Since 2006 much research has been done internationally, and many variants have been redefined from one level to another. There were no whole exome control populations at the start of this work. We decided to present our case series including those where a variant has been redefined because this is the real-life scenario that every service will have to come to terms with as such services develop. It is worthy of note that some variants may be benign or malignant depending on one's ancestry. Rare variants in SCN5A are particularly challenging. In some cases such as the two year-old with nocturnal death and two variants (case 4), one is left with a sense that the channelopathy will have played a part, yet we cannot prove it. Perhaps they had a role like functional SNPs are postulated to do in SUDI, possibly with down-regulation of vulnerable channels by environmental factors and other polymorphisms. Overall, considering the 13 genetic variants ultimately classified as highly probably pathogenic, the minimum yield of molecular autopsy for this panel of genes was 10%. It is essential for the cardiac genetic service to have an open and frank, ongoing dialogue with the affected families and the forensic or coronial services. Most if not all families, once engaged with the service, appreciate the effort and attention that is given to them, and are able to accept a level of uncertainty when counseled appropriately.\n\n    We aimed to see if we could learn which cases are most likely to give a positive yield. Comparing variant-positive with negative cases, the proportion of females was significantly higher in the positive group. Caucasians were the majority in both groups, likely reflecting the population distribution in New Zealand. However, the proportion of Caucasians in the positive group was significantly higher and interestingly none of the cases in the positive cohort were of Maori ethnicity. According to a previous publication from our service, the percentage of self-declared Maori amongst the population with LQTS in the Northern region of New Zealand was 22%, compared to 66% Caucasians. Considering that the Maori ethnic group accounts for approximately 15% of the total New Zealand population, it appears that Maori are proportionally represented amongst the living population with LQTS, but under-represented amongst the SUDY cohort. Further research is needed to establish the genetic profile and unique characteristics of the Maori population.\n\n    The majority of all variant-positive cases were in the older age group (25-40 years). However, if we only include the cases where we remain confident of pathogenicity, the proportion of final gene-positive cases in the youngest group (1-12 years) was significantly higher.\n\n    Death during sleep did not differ between variant-positive and negative cases. Two thirds of the variant positive cases died during sleep. The LQTS screen includes the SCN5A gene, linked to Brugada syndrome as well as LQTS type 3. These conditions classically cause sudden death in young adult males. Despite the majority of autopsy-negative SUDY cases being males, genetic testing in our cohort had a threefold higher yield of rare variants in females, particularly over 25. Interestingly, most cases were maternally inherited. Given these are autosomal dominant conditions; it is as yet unclear how this maternal inheritance might somehow confer increased malignancy of the channelopathy. This finding is, however, in keeping with previous studies and one potential explanation could be that epigenetic factors such as imprinting could be responsible for transmission distortion of LQTS genes.\n\n    Positive past medical history was significantly more prevalent in the variant-positive group. In a third of the cases sudden death was the first presentation of their condition. This is a recognised phenomenon, particularly with Brugada syndrome and LQTS type 3. A positive medical history was found in the remainder two thirds, implying that an opportunity to diagnose and prevent the death has been overlooked. Epilepsy and/or seizures, rather than standard cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations were the most common medical history. Cerebral hypoxia as a consequence of low cardiac output causes seizures. As previously reported in the literature, including by our group, incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy is common in patients with LQTS. This present report suggests that awareness of this fact still needs to be raised in order to avoid these tragic outcomes.\n\n    Mutations and rare variants in SCN5A and KCNH2 were the most frequent, which is in keeping with a higher risk of sudden death at younger ages for LQTS types 2 and 3. All but one case of SCN5A gene positive died during sleep, as expected.\n\n    Tester et al reported a high incidence of RyR2 mutations (linked to CPVT) in their SUDY cohort, and subsequently the standard molecular autopsy recommended including RyR2 in the panel. This test was not available to us consistently over the reported time period. If we had we would have expected more deaths during exercise or activity to be present in our gene-positive cohort.\n\n    Relevant family history was found in about half of the cases in which family history could be obtained. There was a high prevalence of SUDY and/or SUDI and syncope was the second most common diagnosis. None of the families had a previous diagnosis of LQTS or had been investigated for an inherited cardiac disease at any time prior to the demise of their relative. A high prevalence of positive family history of SUDY without prior diagnosis has been described previously and unfortunately this is still a reality. It confirms that awareness of the possibility of an inherited cardiac disease following SUDY is still lacking for the majority of medical professionals who deal with these families.\n\n    Family screening identified 18 individuals with LQTS and Brugada syndrome who are now being appropriately managed. It also helped support the diagnosis of LQTS/Brugada through co-segregation in just over a third of cases.\n\n    The high frequency of novel variants found by molecular autopsy means that evaluation of family members is often required to confirm pathogenicity. We consider engagement of the family to be an essential part of this autopsy investigative process, as originally recommended by the TRAGADY document. As in our previous experience with the investigation of SIDS we do not recommend molecular autopsy being performed as a stand-alone test.  Furthermore, the value of the test is of course greatly enhanced by its potential use in family cascade screening.\n\n    The next phase of development of the molecular autopsy will be multiple gene panels or whole exome/genome sequencing. Recent population studies using such technology have led to a number of previously described likely pathogenic mutations being reclassified as common polymorphisms. This new information led to a reduction in the number of cases in our initial cohort with a highly probable or probable diagnosis of LQTS or Brugada syndrome, as some of the variants initially found were later reclassified. These findings enhance the importance of family engagement, genetic counseling, and subsequent co-segregation studies to evaluate novel variants within families.\n\n    The aim of our work is to prevent sudden deaths through identification of those at risk in the community. We have shown previously that aggressive family cascade screening of all probands, dead or alive, can lead to effective identification of LQTS in the community. Half of the anticipated 1 in 2000 cases of LQTS have already been identified in parts of New Zealand. The approach described here is part of that initiative.\n\n    The molecular autopsy was limited to assessment of variants in the LQTS genes and only SCN5A for Brugada. This is a practical and fiscal issue, faced by many countries across the world. We do not have routine access to in-vitro assessment of genetic variants, and a limitation of this study and the majority of studies that deal with genetic mutations is the difficulty is attributing pathogenicity to a rare variant. This will only become harder as wider genetic panels reveal more variants of uncertain significance. We tried to use as many indicators of pathogenicity as possible, but a definite correlation between a genetic variant and SUDY is not always straightforward and new information can change a genetic variant from likely pathogenic to a common polymorphism with definite implications for the families involved. This is why family co-segregation is so important and is still ongoing for some of the families in our cohort.",

        "Title": "    High prevalence of genetic variants previously associated with LQT syndrome in new exome data",
        "Abstract": "    To date, hundreds of variants in 13 genes have been associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS). The prevalence of LQTS is estimated to be between 1:2000 and 1:5000. The knowledge of genetic variation in the general population has until recently been limited, but newly published data from NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) has provided important knowledge on this topic. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants in ESP (5400 individuals), in order to identify possible false-positive LQTS variants. With this aim, we performed a search for previously published LQTS-associated variants in ESP. In addition, a PolyPhen-2 prediction was conducted, and the four most prevalent LQTS-associated variants with significant functional effects present in ESP were genotyped in a second control population. We identified 33 missense variants previously associated with LQTS in ESP. These 33 variants affected 173 alleles and this corresponded to a LQTS prevalence of 1:31 in the ESP population. PolyPhen-2 predicted 30% of the 33 variants present in ESP to be benign compared with 13% among LQTS-associated variants not present in ESP (P=0.019). Genotyping of the four variants KCNH2 P347S; SCN5A: S216L, V1951L; and CAV3 T78M in the control population (n=704) revealed prevalences comparable to those of ESP. Thus, we identified a much higher prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants than expected in exome data from population studies. Great caution regarding the possible disease causation of some of these variants has to be taken, especially when used for risk stratification in family members.",
        "Introduction": "    Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited cardiac disorder characterised by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram and sudden cardiac death secondary to cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n    The prevalence of LQTS in the general population has been estimated to be between 1:2000 and 1:5000. In most cases, LQTS is considered a monogenic disorder, and to date hundreds of variants in 13 genes have been associated with this syndrome. However, variants previously reported to be causative in LQTS have subsequently been shown to be rare variants with only a modest disease-modifying effect or even non-pathogenic.\n\n    Until recently, there has only been limited knowledge regarding the genetic variation in the general population, especially with regards to low-frequency variants. This was changed in June 2011, when whole exome data from the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) was published. In order to identify possible false-positive LQTS variants reported in the literature, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants in new ESP exome data and compare the prevalence of these variants with the expected prevalence of LQTS in the same population.",
        "Methods": "    In ESP, next-generation sequencing of all protein-coding regions in 5400 persons from different population studies were carried out. No clinical data were available on the ESP population, nor at request. By literature search, we found inclusion- and exclusion criteria of 9 out of 12 populations used in ESP. None of these have specifically included persons with channelopathies or other heart diseases and at least two cohorts have excluded such patients.\n\n    ESP exome data were systematically searched for previously published missense and nonsense LQTS-associated variants reported in a recent comprehensive review by Hedley et al and in data from the The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). In addition, we have included the recently published KCNJ5 variant reported by Yang et al, in order to include all 13 genes so far associated with LQTS. Due to the lack of data regarding variants positioned in introns and UTR regions in ESP, these could not be included.\n\n    The literature was searched for functional data and family co-segregation of all the previously identified LQTS-associated variants also identified in the ESP population. Co-segregation was defined as at least two family members both having the phenotype and the genotype. In addition, we conducted a PolyPhen-2 prediction on all previously reported LQTS-associated missense variants and compared protein damage predictions between LQTS-associated variants identified in ESP with those variants not identified in ESP. Nonsense variants were assumed probably damaging. Differences in proportions of PolyPhen-2 predictions between groups were assessed using a Fisher's exact test.\n\n    Furthermore, we genotyped (Sanger sequencing, as described previously) variants with (1) convincing LQTS association in terms of significant functional effects on channel function and (2) a prevalence in ESP European American population high enough (>=7:5295) to have a reasonable chance to be detected in our own two independent healthy control populations (n=704) of Northern European origin with no history of arrhythmias or other cardiac diseases, and with available ECGs.",
        "Results": "    In all, 33 out of 631 missense and nonsense variants previously associated with LQTS (5.2%) were found in the ESP population. All 33 variants were missense variants and affected 173 alleles. Thirteen of the variants were identified in three or more alleles. No nonsense variants were found. The previously LQTS-associated variants identified in the ESP population are listed in Table 1. On an average, the genes investigated in this study have been screened in 5298 individuals. If we assume that no individuals in the ESP population harbour more than one of the LQTS-associated variants and that all are heterozygote carriers, it corresponds to a LQTS genotype prevalence of 1:31 (173:5298). Thirteen variants were present in three or more alleles corresponding to a LQTS genotype prevalence of 1:37 (145:5298). Six variants associated with acquired/drug-induced LQTS were also identified in ESP; these variants were not included in the present analysis. Literature search regarding functional data and family co-segregation revealed that 19 of the 33 identified LQTS-associated variants have been investigated functionally and 16 of these did have functional effects, but there was a striking lack of data regarding family co-segregation (Table 1 and Supplementary Table).\n\n    PolyPhen-2 analysis of the 33 LQTS variants predicted 19 (58%) to be probably damaging, 4 (12%) to be possibly damaging, and 10 (30%) were predicted to be benign (Table 1). Of the remaining 558 missense and 40 nonsense LQTS-associated variants, not present in ESP, 451 (75%) were predicted probably damaging, 69 (12%) possibly damaging, and 78 (13%) benign. This difference in the distribution of the three PolyPhen-2 categories among the two groups was statistically significant both for the overall comparison (P=0.027) and when comparing the categories benign (P=0.016) and probably damaging (P=0.038) independently. As no nonsense variants were found in ESP, a more conservative approach is to compare only the missense variants in the two groups; 558 missense LQTS-associated variants were not present in ESP and of these 411 (74%) were predicted probably damaging, 69 (12%) possibly damaging, and 78 (14%) benign. In this case, only a borderline significant difference was found (P=0.051) for the overall comparison.\n\n    Four variants (KCNH2 P347S; SCN5A S216L, V1951L, and CAV3 T78M) were, based on our criteria, genotyped in our control populations (n=704), and this revealed variant prevalences comparable to those found in ESP (Table 2). One of the variant carriers harbouring CAV3 T78M had a QTc interval of 462 ms, but all other variant carriers had normal QTc intervals (QTc<=440 ms) including four other carriers of CAV3 T78M (Table 2).",
        "Conclusion": "    In recently released exome data, we identified a much higher prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants than expected based on the prevalence of LQTS in the general population. Our findings suggest that some of the previously associated LQTS variants are false-positive findings and that great caution must be taken regarding the possible disease causation of these variants, especially when used for risk stratification in family members.\n\n    Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on European Journal of Human Genetics website (http://www.nature.com/ejhg)\n\n    The authors declare no conflict of interest.",
        "Discussion": "    We identified 33 missense variants out of 631 (5.2%) variants previously associated with LQTS in the ESP data.\n\n    These 33 variants correspond to a LQTS genotype prevalence of 1:31 in the ESP. If the prevalence of LQTS is set at 1:2000 (a high estimate), then we would expect only three persons in the ESP population to have LQTS. Thus, we found a very large overrepresentation of previously LQTS-associated variants in the ESP, indicating a very dubious LQTS association for these variants as a group. Of cause, we cannot exclude the possibility that there might be an overrepresentation of LQTS patients in the ESP population, although this seems unlikely, due to the size of the overrepresentation and the fact that ESP is based on population studies mainly representing the general population. Even if we had clinical data on all individuals, we could not make a significantly different conclusion due to the possibility of reduced penetrance of the variants.\n\n    To test the possible overrepresentation of LQTS-associated variants in ESP we genotyped the four most prevalent LQTS-associated variants with significant functional effects present in ESP in two cohorts of healthy individuals with available ECGs. The four variants were present in our control population with prevalences consistent with those of ESP (Table 2). Thus, the present results indicate that overrepresentation of LQTS-associated variants does not seem to be a problem in ESP, but more importantly the results confirm that at least these four LQTS-associated variants with high prevalence in ESP and significant functional effects are not monogenic causes of LQTS.\n\n    In addition, we did a PolyPhen-2 prediction both for the variants found in ESP and the ones we did not find. Of the 33 variants found in ESP, 30% were predicted to be benign compared with 13% among the variants not found in ESP (P=0.016). This further strengthens the argument that these variants are not disease causing.\n\n    The majority of the variants have been shown to have functional effects in electrophysiological experiments performed in heterologous cell models. This suggests that they may have some pathological influence, but only a very small fraction of studies showed family co-segregation. Thirteen of the variants were present in three or more alleles in ESP, and thus it seems reasonable to assume that these variants are not monogenic causes of LQTS, as 1:37 are carriers of one of these variants.\n\n    The remaining 20 variants are present in just one or two alleles in ESP and an interpretation of the pathogenicity of these variants are therefore much less straightforward.\n\n    Taken together, the present results indicate that a large proportion of the 33 variants previously associated with LQTS but now identified in ESP are very unlikely to be monogenic causes of LQTS and are maybe just innocent bystanders. Others are likely to be variants with reduced penetrance, or in some cases disease modifiers. Thus, great caution must be taken regarding the possible disease causation of these variants when found in LQTS (Table 1).\n\n    It is noteworthy, that 94.8% of the previously LQTS-associated variants were not present in ESP and thus the pathogenicity of the majority of these variants seems to be corroborated.\n\n    Genetic screening has become an important tool in at least family examinations of LQTS. It is for this reason important that variants being associated with LQTS are truly disease causing. A patient with genuine LQTS but a false-positive variant result might have another true disease-causing variant that is not found and this could lead to misdiagnosis of family members with consequences for treatment, clinical advice, and follow-up.",

        "Title": "    A mutation in the CACNA1C gene leads to early repolarization syndrome with incomplete penetrance: A Chinese family study",
        "Abstract": "    Early repolarization syndrome (ERS) may be a near-Mendelian or an oligogenic disease; however, no direct evidence has been provided to support this theory.\n\n    We described a large Chinese family with nocturnal sudden cardiac death induced by ERS in most of the young male adults. One missense mutation (p.Q1916R) was found in the major subunit of the L-type calcium channel gene CACNA1C by the direct sequencing of candidate genes. A concomitant gain-of-function variant in the sodium channel gene SCN5A (p.R1193Q) was found to rescue the phenotype of the female CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation carriers, which led to the incomplete penetrance. The functional studies, via the exogenous expression approach, revealed that the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation led to a decreasing L-type calcium current and the protein expression defect. The decreased calcium current produced by the mutant channel was improved by isoproterenol but exacerbated by testosterone. The effects of CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation and testosterone on cellular electrophysiology were further confirmed by the human ventricular action potential simulation.\n\n    Our results demonstrated that the loss-of-function CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation contributed to ERS-related sudden cardiac death, and the phenotypic incomplete penetrance was modified by the SCN5A-R1193Q variant and sex. These findings suggest that phenotypes of ERS are modified by multiple genetic factors, which supports the theory that ERS may be an oligogenic disease.",
        "Introduction": "    An early repolarization (ER) pattern on electrocardiography (ECG) is characterized by ST-segment elevation and a terminal QRS slur or notch with J-point elevation >=1 mm in 2 or more contiguous inferior and/or lateral leads. The ER has been reported to be associated with a risk of arrhythmic death. Accordingly, this clinic entity of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (SCD) with ER pattern is called ER syndrome (ERS). Although the underlying arrhythmic substrates of ERS are not completely understood, the gene mutations are now considered a major pathogenic factor for developing ERS.\n\n    In several recent studies, ERS has been described as a kind of heritable disease. However, only a few ERS-related genes have been identified, including the cardiac inward rectifier potassium channel gene KCNJ8; the cardiac L-type calcium channel (LTCC) subunit genes CACNA1C (encoding the alpha subunit of LTCC, Cav1.2alpha1C), CACNB2b and CACNA2D1; the sodium channel alpha-subunit gene SCN5A; and the ATP-sensitive potassium channels subunit gene ABCC9. Previously, most of the ERS-causing gene mutations were detected in the sporadic cases. A typical ERS family with Mendelian inheritance is extremely rare, and the identified mutations hardly account for the clinical traits regarding male predominance and incomplete penetrance. Therefore, the current understanding of the genetic basis of ERS remains limited, and it has recently been proposed that ERS may be a near-Mendelian or oligogenic inheritance disease. Here we studied a large ERS-related SCD family via the genetic analysis and the functional analysis. The results suggested that the incomplete penetrance of ERS could be modified by the interaction of digenic variations and sex.",
        "Methods": "    This study conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was prospectively reviewed and approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants whose blood samples were collected for genetic tests. All studied subjects underwent clinical assessments and examinations, including 12-lead ECG, 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, treadmill exercise test, ultrasound echocardiography, and laboratory blood tests were performed in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. The diagnosis of ERS was based on the ECG parameters measured by two independent cardiologists. The peak of a terminal QRS notch or onset of a terminal QRS slur served as the J-point.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using the RelaxGene Blood DNA System (TIANGEN Biotech , Beijing, China). All exons and exon-intron boundaries of candidate genes, including SCN5A, SCN1B, SCN3B, KCNJ8, ABCC9, KCNJ11, ABCC8, KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCND3, KCNE1, KCNE2, CACNA1C, CACNB2b and CACNA2D1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct sequencing. The genomic DNA of 800 chromosomes from 400 healthy ethnically matched individuals were used as controls.\n\n    The full-length human WT CACNA1C cDNA containing exon 8a (GenBank accession no. AJ224873) cloned in pcDNA3.1 was a kind gift from Dr. Ganxin Yan's Laboratory (Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). The mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA) and the plasmids were transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T cells using Lipofectamine  2000 reagent (Invitrogen , Carlsbad, CA, USA). Detailed methods are given in the supporting information, S1 File.\n\n    The HEK293T cells were purchased from the Shanghai Cell Bank of the Type Culture Collection Committee of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China) and authenticated using short tandem repeat profiling by the Cell Bank. L-type calcium current (ICa-L) through wild-type (WT) or mutant LTCC in HEK293T cells was measured by the whole-cell patch clamp recording at room temperature with an EPC10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) as the protocol previously described. Furthermore, testosterone (10 muM) and isoproterenol (10 muM) were used to determine the biological effects on the mutated ICa-L, respectively.\n\n    These experiments were performed as previously described. Briefly, 24 hours after transfection, the protein samples (separate membrane and cytosolic samples) were extracted from cells using the temperature-induced phase separation method. A total of 100 mug lysates or subcellular fractions were separated using 6 to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfonate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and probed with specific antibodies. The following antibodies were used: CaV1.2alpha1C (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), ATP1A2 (Proteintech) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Proteintech). Signals of blots were collected through a Bio-RAD ChemiDox XRS detection system and analyzed by Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\n    The immunofluorescence staining images were obtained as previously described. The transfected HEK293T cells was probed by CaV1.2alpha1C antibody (Alomone Labs), and imaged with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). The detailed methods for immunofluorescence staining are given in the supplementary information S1 File.\n\n    The action potentials (AP) of endocardium and epicardium simulations were performed based on a human ventricular cell model developed by Tusscher and Panfilov. The model was accessed from https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/tentusscher_panfilov_2006 (Jul 25, 2016). In this cell model, a stimulus frequency of 1 Hz, an amplitude of -52 pA/pF, and a duration of 1 millisecond (ms) was chosen to generate an AP of cardiac myocyte. The effects of mutant calcium channel were simulated by reducing the maximal conductance of ICa-L (GCa) from 0.9 mS/muF to 0.63 mS/muF (by 30%) in a heterozygous pattern. The effects of testosterone (10 muM) treatment were modified by adjusting the electrophysiological experiment data. Consequently, testosterone reduced WT GCa from 0.9 mS/muF to 0.74 mS/muF (by 26%) and reduced mutant GCa from 0.63 mS/muF to 0.554 mS/muF (by 35%).\n\n    Numerical data are presented as the means +- standard error of the mean (SEM) and were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 19.0 (SPSS19.0). Statistical differences were determined with t-tests for single comparison, and one-way analysis of variance ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used for multiple comparisons. P values <0.05 were considered significant.",
        "Results": "    The pedigree of 4 generations of the Chinese family is presented (Fig 1A). Five seemingly healthy males (I-1, II-2, II-4, III-1 and III-5) died during sleep at a mean age of 34 +- 8.4 years old. The proband (III-5) suffered from nocturnal sudden death at age 34, and his autopsy report (provided by the Department of Forensic Medicine the Medical College of Nanchang University) revealed no pathogenic abnormality of the major organs. His previous medical records indicated that he had suffered from occasional dizziness and palpitations, but no chest pain or episodes of syncope had been observed. On his 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, terminal QRS notches with J point >= 1.5 mm in leads II and aVF under the condition of bradycardia were documented (Fig 1B).\n\n    Of those affected adult males in this family, the proband's 33-year-old younger brother (III-7), implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, was the only survivor. As shown in Fig 1C, the ER ECG pattern with terminal QRS notches in leads II, III, aVF, and V3-V5 (maximum J-point elevation 3 mm) was observed. Besides, the Holter tests of the other 2 surviving family members (IV-3, IV-4) manifested bradycardia-dependent J-point elevation with or without ST-segment elevation. In the Holter of the proband's 7-year-old son (IV-3), concave ST-segment elevation (1 mm) in leads II, III, aVF, and V4-V6 and terminal QRS notches in leads III and aVF (J-point elevation: 1 mm) were observed (Fig 1D). The ST-segment elevation with terminal QRS slurs in leads II, III, aVF, and V4, and terminal QRS notches in lead V3 (maximum J-point elevation 1.5 mm) were also registered on the Holter of the 5-year-old daughter (IV-4) of III-7 (Fig 1E). The ECGs of other individuals (II-3, II-6, III-4 and IV-1) did not show any ER patterns (S1 Fig). The major ECG parameters of affected members are shown in Table 1.\n\n    A rare heterozygous mutation (c.A5747G, p.Q1916R) in CACNA1C located in the intracellular C terminus of CaV1.2alpha1C with high evolutionary conservation was identified in the proband (Fig 2A-2C, Table 2). Five other common polymorphisms in CACNA1C with benign clinical significance were also detected (Table 2). The allele frequency of this variant was 0.000149 according to the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org) and 0.000799 (G) according to 1000 Genomes (http://www.internationalgenome.org/1000-genomes-browsers). Furthermore, this CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation was absent in 800 chromosomes from 400 healthy controls. A concomitant variant (p.R1193Q, rs41261344) with an allele frequency of 0.006215 (data form ExAC) in SCN5A was also found in the proband (Fig 2D, Table 2). This SCN5A-R1193Q variant, located in a highly conserved spot in the linker region between domains II and III (Fig 2E and 2F), has been reported to be \"gain-of-function\" and associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS).\n\n    The result of sequencing screening revealed that all genotyped members with ancestry originating from I-1 and I-2 carried the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation. Unfortunately, the genetic tests were not performed for the deceased II-4 and III-1, and therefore their genetic states were not defined. Given their offspring was mutation carriers, we might infer that II-4 and III-1 also harbored the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation. Notably, not all CACNA1C-Q1916R carriers (II-3, II-6, III-4, III-5, III-7, IV-1, IV-3, IV-4 and obligate carriers II-4 and III-1) manifested the positive phenotypes (ER pattern in ECG or nocturnal SCD). This phenotypic incomplete penetrance might be modified by SCN5A-R1193Q variant and sex. As shown in Table 3, all male individuals carrying the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation with (II-4, III-1, III-5 and IV-3) or without (III-7) concomitant SCN5A-R1193Q showed the ERS phenotypes. The female CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation carriers with SCN5A-R1193Q variant (II-3, II-6, III-4 and IV-1) were not affected, while the female member only carrying the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation (IV-4) showed the ER ECG pattern. Other family members without the two variations had no ERS phenotypes.\n\n    To determine the molecular consequences of the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation, we transfected CACNA1C with the other 2 subunits (CACNB2b and CACNA2D1) forming the LTCC into HEK293T cells and performed whole cell patch-clamp experiments. The Q1916R mutation reduced the amplitude of the current produced by LTCC when compared with the WT sequence (Fig 3A). The current density of the mutant LTCC over the voltage range of -10 mV to 20 mV was also reduced by 60% at 0 mV (-23.3+-1.1 pA/pF for WT LTCC versus -9.4+-1.6 pA/pF for mutant LTCC, n = 17-28, *P<0.05, **P<0.01; Fig 3B). However, the voltage-dependence of steady state activation (SSA) and steady state inactivation (SSI) were unchanged (Fig 3C and 3D). The results suggested that the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation showed a \"loss-of-function\" in LTCC.\n\n    To explore the underlying pathogenic role of sex and the possible therapy for the ERS with CACNA1C-Q1916R, HEK293T cells exogenously expressing the LTCC were treated with the principal male sex hormone, testosterone, or the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol. As reported by Scragg JL et al., testosterone can directly interact with Cav1.2alpha1C protein and blockade the ICa-L in a concentration-dependent manner in the HEK293T cells. The inhibitory effects of 10 muM testosterone were clearly independent of the activation voltage range, thus we chose 10 muM as a working concentration. In the WT group, treatment with testosterone significantly reduced the current densities by 51.5% at 0 mV (-43.1+-4.0 pA/pF for WT-vehicle group versus -20.9+-0.04 pA/pF for the WT-testosterone group, n = 6, *P<0.05; Fig 4A and 4B). In the CACNA1C-Q1916R group, treatment with testosterone reduced the current densities by 69% at 30 mV (-11.4+-1.7 pA/pF for the Q1916R-vehicle group versus -3.5+-1.2 pA/pF for the Q1916R-testosterone group, n = 8, #P<0.05; Fig 4A and 4B). Treatment with isoproterenol (10 muM) enhanced the current density of WT channels by 68.5% at -20 mV (-39.1+-4.8 pA/pF for the WT-isoproterenol group versus -23.2+-4.2 pA/pF for the WT-vehicle group, n = 12, *P<0.05) and mildly increased the current density of CACNA1C-Q1916R channels (-11.8+-3.8 pA/pF for the Q1916R-isoproterenol group versus -9.5+-3.5 pA/pF for the Q1916R-vehicle group, n = 10, P>0.05; Fig 4E and 4F). The voltage-dependent SSA displayed a left-shift in the Q1916R-isoproterenol group compared with that in the Q1916R-vehicle group, and the half-activation voltage (V1/2) shifted from -6.1 mV to -17.0 mV (P<0.01; Fig 4G). These results suggested an exacerbated role of testosterone but an improved effect of isoproterenol in the mutant LTCC.\n\n    To further study the mechanism of the decrease in Q1916R ICa-L, protein expression and subcellular localization were detected in the exogenously expressing HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig 5A and 5B, the expression of mutant CaV1.2alpha1C was reduced by 54% in the entire cellular lysate, 51% in the membrane fraction and 48% in the cytoplasm fraction, respectively, when compared with the expression of WT CaV1.2alpha1C. In the similar manner, a decrease in the fluorescent intensity but normal localization was observed via immunofluorescence in HEK293T cells (Fig 5C).\n\n    To evaluate the effects of CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation on the AP shape and the potential electrophysiological mechanisms of ER pattern formation, a human ventricular cell model was used to simulate APs with the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation in the heterozygous status. In this model, CACNA1C-Q1916R was represented by a 30% reduction in the conductance of total ICa-L. The APs of WT cardiac M (midmyocardial) cell and mutant M cell are shown in Fig 6A, in which a deeper notch of ER was observed in the mutant condition. Additionally, the APD90 (AP duration at the level of 90% of repolarization) was reduced by 14.29% in the mutant M cell. J waves are associated with the prominent voltage gradients between the endocardium and epicardium in the ER period. Accordingly, we compared the AP shape between the endocardial cell and the epicardial cell in WT or CACNA1C-Q1916R mutant condition, respectively (Fig 6B and 6C). Then, the transmural voltage gradient from the endocardial cell to the epicardial cell within the ER interval (from 12 ms to 55 ms of AP duration) was analyzed in the WT and the mutant conditions (Fig 6D). In the ER period, overall, the value of voltage gradient between endocardial cell and epicardial cell in the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutant condition was greater than that in the WT condition (16.1 mv for the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation versus 14.44 mv for the WT at 18 ms).\n\n    We also modeled the effects of testosterone on the APs in these 3 cell types of cardiac tissue, according to the previous data of patch clamp experiment. The repolarization was earlier and the AP duration was shorter in the testosterone treated cell than that in non-treated cell, due to the more pronounced reduction of ICa-L (Fig 6E-6G). Testosterone enhanced the transmural voltage gradient (15.47 mv for testosterone treatment versus 9.93 mv for non-treatment at 23 ms) in the mutant cell (Fig 6H). These results highlighted that the ventricular transmural heterogeneity of electrical activity in the ER stage might be responsible for the generation of the ER pattern on ECG, and testosterone might aggravate the voltage gradient between different myocardium layers.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Here, we presented a rare large Chinese family with ER-associated SCD, in which the disease phenotypes were mainly caused by a CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation and modulated by the SCN5A-R1193Q variant and sex (Fig 7).\n\n    From the clinical perspective, ERS and Brugada syndrome (BrS) share some similar clinical traits, such as male predominance, mean age of first arrhythmic onsets, and circumstances of arrhythmic episodes. In genetics, loss-of-function mutations in CACNA1C, CACNB2, CACNA2D, SCN5A, and SCN10A, and gain-of-function mutations in KCNJ8 have been shown to lead to both ERS and BrS. Hence, the two entities are referred to as J-wave syndrome by some investigators, but the concept is still controversial. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of SCD do not include the J-wave syndrome. Furthermore, the differential response to sodium-channel blocker suggests that ERS and BrS are caused by the different basic pathophysiological mechanisms. Indeed, the ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads in BrS can be explained by abnormalities of both repolarization and depolarization in right ventricular outflow. The affected family members were diagnosed based on the scientific statement referring to ERS, and no BrS was found during the familial clinical screening. Therefore, the mechanisms we studied here were specifically responsible for ERS rather than J-wave syndrome.\n\n    The ERS in this pedigree was inherited in an incomplete penetrance manner, with a penetrance of only 60%. The ERS caused by an SCN5A mutation G4297C also showed the inherited pattern of incomplete penetrance; however, the contributory factor for this phenomenon was not elucidated. In another study of some small pedigrees with BrS caused by mutations in CACNA1C, male mutation carriers were more inclined to be symptomatic, which suggests that non-segregation of genotypes and phenotypes may be associated with sex. BrS and ERS share a similar genetic complexity, and not all familial cases provide evidence for Mendelian inheritance. There are always multiple genetic and environmental factors that cause or modulate the phenotype; therefore, a more complex genetic inheritance known as the oligogenic model has recently been hypothesized to explain the particular clinical presentation of inherited cardiac disorders. In this family, the evidence-based on the genetic and functional findings indicated that the loss-of-function mutation CACNA1C-Q1916R was the detrimental variation, and that the gain-of-function variant SCN5A-R1193Q modulated the phenotype. The candidate genes of ERS included CACNA1C and SCN5A, which suggests that the interaction of variations in these 2 genes may potentially modify the penetrance of ERS phenotypes.\n\n    As previously reported, SCN5A-R1193Q channels showed inactivation gating and generated a persistent, non-inactivating inward sodium current (INa), which was associated with LQTS. The QT interval on the ECG represents the depolarization and the repolarization phases of the cardiac AP. Decreases in repolarizing outward potassium currents or increases in depolarizing inward INa or ICa-L can result in the prolonged QT interval. Type 3 LQTS is caused by the gain-of-function variation in the SCN5A (e.g., R1193Q), which evokes a sustained inward INa during the repolarization phase, leading to the deceleration of the repolarization and the prolongation of AP. In contrast, a decrease in INa or ICa-L or an increase in outward potassium currents may generate a prominent epicardial notch, which results in a greater transmural voltage gradient in the initiation of the repolarization phase. This voltage gradient registering as a J-point elevation on ECG may be clinically associated with lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The loss-of-function variation in SCN5A or CACNA1C (e.g., CACNA1C-Q1916R), which produces inadequate inward hybrid currents, is responsible for the pathopoiesis of ERS. Thus, from the mechanistic point of view, INa and ICa-L show a synergistic effect on the repolarization as two ingredients of the inward currents. In this study, we speculated that, during the repolarization phase, the inadequate inward current caused by the detrimental CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation might be partly compensated by the persistent inward tail INa produced by the SCN5A-R1193Q channel. That may be how SCN5A-R1193Q plays a protective role against the detrimental phenotype induced by the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation. Unfortunately, additional experiment of an interaction between the rare mutation and the common variant was not feasible based on the in vitro experimental system that we used, the further in vivo study may be needed to confirm this assumption.\n\n    In the oligogenic model of ERS, sex is another high-impact contributor to the phenotypic differences. The male sex predominance has been observed in both the patients with ERS and healthy individuals with an ER pattern, and testosterone levels are significantly increased in men exhibiting an ER pattern than those without the ER pattern. The ER pattern was demonstrated to be the result of a transmural voltage gradient between the epicardium and endocardium, caused either by an increased outward ATP-sensitive potassium current (IK-ATP) or transient outward current (Ito), or by a decreased INa or ICa-L. Testosterone has been reported to have a directly inhibitory effect on the ICa-L. Our findings also suggest that male sex facilitates the formation of ER pattern under certain circumstances, and it is an independent risk factor of ERS in the family.\n\n    The CACNA1C-Q1916R variant was not considered to be \"pathogenic\", although it has been found in two small Japanese cohorts with inherited arrhythmias associated with sudden death. The ethnic formation of Eastern Asian subjects in the ExAC data set is not explicit, hence we cannot know the accurate incidence of CACNA1C-Q1916R in Chinese Han population based on ExAC. According to the data from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3, only 1 allele count is observed in Chinese Han population, and the allele frequency of CACNA1C-Q1916R in the Chinese population (including Chinese Dai in XiShuangbanna, Han Chinese in Beijing and Southern Han Chinese) is 0.0017 (1/601). Furthermore, in our study, the mutation was absent in 800 chromosomes from 400 healthy controls, which together indicates that CACNA1C-Q1916R might be considered a rare variant in the Chinese population, with a frequency lower than 0.001. We also found that the allele frequency of CACNA1C-Q1916R in the Japanese population was higher than that in other ethnic populations (Japanese: 3/208, Chinese: 1/601, African: 0, American: 0, European: 0, South Asian: 0) according to the 1000 Genomes data, which suggested that there might be a spatial diversity in the distribution of the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation. In our study, the CACNA1C-Q1916R mutation was identified in a pedigree and was absent from the 800 control alleles. Additionally, in vitro experiments revealed that the Q1916R mutation impaired the electrophysiological function of the LTCC, which supported the known pathogenic mechanisms of ERS. Based on Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology, we consider CACNA1C-Q1916R a pathogenic variation.\n\n    The mechanism of ER-related ventricular arrhythmias involves the development of phase 2 re-entry derived from heterogeneous loss of the epicardial AP dome, which is accentuated by the elevated vagal tone due to the elevated Ito that is caused by the slow heart rate. This explains why the arrhythmic events occur during sleep in ERS patients. Isoproterenol is widely used to suppress ERS-related VF, and the augmentation effect of ICa-L by isoproterenol may be one of its pharmacological actions. We observed that isoproterenol could enhance the activity of LTCC in the HEK293T cells, which may be associated with the evocation of cAMP/protein kinase A pathways by the activation of the endogenous beta2 adrenoreceptors.\n\n    In summary, we investigated an extremely rare large ERS family with a high incidence of nocturnal SCD, in which we found a pathogenic mutation in CACNA1C (p.Q1916R) with loss-of-function. The penetrance was also incomplete, which was modified by a gain-of-functional SCN5A-R1193Q variant and sex. The result strengthens the evidence that males are typically at higher risk of SCD, and the inheritance of ERS may be an oligogenic pattern rather than a monogenic model. The targeted mutation screening will effectively guide disease prevention and offspring fertility in the family. Isoproterenol, in theory, may be a putative pharmacologic option to improve the function of CACNA1C-Q1916R mutant channel. However, further translational studies are needed to explore the therapeutic feasibility to human. One limitation of our study is that the sodium channel blocker challenging test used for excluding BrS was refused by the family members. Another limitation is the lack of the induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myocytes from affected individuals and further in vivo study, which is preferable for interpreting the cumulative effects of complex genetic variants.",

        "Title": "    SCN5A Genetic Polymorphisms Associated With Increased Defibrillator Shocks in Brugada Syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited primary arrhythmia disorder leading to sudden cardiac arrest. SCN5A, encoding the alpha-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel (Nav1.5), is the most common pathogenic gene of BrS. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the standard treatment for secondary prevention. This study aimed to evaluate association of the SCN5A variant with this cardiac conduction disturbance and appropriate ICD shock therapy in Thai symptomatic BrS patients with ICD implants.\n\n    Symptomatic BrS patients diagnosed at university hospital were enrolled from 2008 to 2011. The primary outcome of the study was an appropriate ICD shock defined as having non-pacing-associated ICD shock after the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Associations between SCN5A polymorphisms, cardiac conduction disturbance, and potential confounding factors associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy were analyzed. All 40 symptomatic BrS patients (median age, 43 years) with ICD implantations were followed for 24 months. There were 16 patients (40%) who had the appropriate ICD shock therapy after ICD treatment. An independent factor associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy was SCN5A-R1193Q with an adjusted hazard ratio of 10.550 (95% CI, 1.631-68.232).\n\n    SCN5A-R1193Q is associated with cardiac conduction disturbances. It may be a genetic marker associated with ventricular arrhythmia leading to appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients with ICD treatment. Because of the small sample size of study population and the appropriate ICD shock outcome, further large studies are needed to confirm the results of this study.",
        "Introduction": "    Brugada syndrome (BrS) is diagnosed in patients with an ST-segment elevation with type 1 morphology of more than 2 mm in more than 1 lead among the right precordial leads V1 and/or V2 positioned in the second, third, or fourth intercostal spaces occurring either spontaneously or after provocative drug testing with intravenous administration of sodium-channel blockers.1, 2 In Thailand, there were survivors from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) who were found to have an ECG profile and symptoms characteristic of BrS, and some of whom had a documented family history of SCA.3, 4 Most patients were young, born and raised in the northeastern part of Thailand without any previous medical history. It is believed that BrS is an inherited disease attributed to genetic penetrance in family members. Currently, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the standard treatment for secondary prevention post-SCA or syncope of unknown origin.5, 6 The ICD is an effective treatment to prevent cardiac arrest from recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in BrS patients.\n\n    The SCN5A gene mutations were found in 20% to 25% of BrS patients and 0% to 0.08% in general population.1 There are 4 known common polymorphisms of the SCN5A gene related to BrS, including R34C, H558R, S1103Y, and R1193Q.7, 8 These SCN5A polymorphisms could decrease expression of sodium-channel proteins and alter gating properties resulting in prolongation of the QRS duration and slow conduction in the heart.7, 9 The SCN5A mutations may be associated with early and frequent VF recurrence or SCA in BrS patients, which may be related to fibrosis in the right ventricular outflow tract epicardial surface.10, 11 Most studies on SCN5A mutations included both asymptomatic and symptomatic BrS patients.8, 9, 10, 11 This study was aimed to investigate the association of SCN5A mutations and appropriate ICD shock therapy in only symptomatic BrS patients.",
        "Methods": "    All patients diagnosed with BrS in Queen Sirikit Heart Center of The Northeast and Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, between 2008 and 2011 were enrolled. The diagnosis of BrS was made clinically in patients presenting with SCA or unexplained syncope with 1 of the following criteria: evidence of documented ventricular tachycardia or VF; a family history of sudden cardiac death at <45 years of age; a similar type ECG in family members; history of nocturnal agonal respiration with spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG; or showing type 1 Brugada ECG after provocation by using high intercostal ECG lead detection or after administration of flecainide. Type 1 ECG was defined as a prominent coved ST segment elevation >2 mm followed by a negative T wave.2\n\n    All patients received cardiac workups, including echocardiograms and coronary angiograms, to exclude structural heart diseases. All workups of structural heart disease were required to be normal. The study protocol was approved by an institutional review committee, Khon Kaen University, and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided informed consent before study enrollment.\n\n    The following clinical data were captured and documented: age at diagnosis; sex; birthplace; family history of SCA; type of Brugada ECG at diagnosis; results of pharmacological testing or high intercostal lead detection for unmasking the coved type ECG pattern; circumstances of diagnosis (survival of SCA, syncope); indication for ICD implantation; genetic study with SCN5A genotyping; and ICD follow-up data. High intercostal ECGs were obtained by placing the precordial V1 to V2 leads in the fourth intercostal space, V3 to V4 in the third intercostal space, and V5 to V6 in the second intercostal space. V1, V3, and V5 were placed on the right side, with V2, V4, and V6 on the left side. The diagnosis of BrS was made by evidence of coved-type ECG in at least 1 of the high intercostal leads.12\n\n    Ten milliliters of peripheral venous blood were obtained from patients using standard blood sampling techniques. Genomic DNA of each patient was isolated from peripheral leukocytes. All 28 exons of SCN5A were determined by amplifying using specific primers.13 The polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and run on the automated ABI Prism Model 3100 Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\n    All patients were followed at the cardiac device clinic every 3 to 6 months. ICD data of each patient were collected and interpreted at each follow-up. All patients were categorized as BrS with or without recurrent appropriate ICD shock. Appropriate ICD shock is defined as having non-pacing-associated ICD shock after the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia or VF.14 Those patients who had inappropriate ICD shocks, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or lead fractures, were excluded.\n\n    The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparison of medians of continuous variables between BrS patients with or without appropriate shock. Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables between the 2 groups.\n\n    Univariate Cox regression analysis was applied to calculate the crude hazard ratios of individual variables for having appropriate ICD shocks over times. All variables with P<0.20 in univariate analysis or that were clinically significant were included in subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis. Clinically significant factors were previously reported potential confounding factors associated with appropriate ICD shock, such as family history of SCA. The final model was composed of potential confounding factors associated with appropriate ICD shock as follows: family history of cardiac arrest; PR interval; QRS duration; and SCN5A-R1193Q. Analytical results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs. The significant factors were plotted for the ICD shock-free times and time to the first ICD shock by Kaplan-Meier analysis.",
        "Results": "    During the study period, 40 patients met the study inclusion criteria and received single-chamber ICD treatment programed for a VF zone of >188 beats/min. The median (range) age of all patients was 43 years (22-66). The median (range) follow-up time was 24 months (13-52). There were 29 patients (72.5%) who had spontaneous Brugada ECG type 1; others (11 patients; 27.5%) were unmasked by high intercostal lead placement.\n\n    Of 28 exons of SCN5A genotyping, only H558R (Exon-12, c. 1673 A>G, rs1805124) and R1193Q (Exon 20, c.3578G>A, rs41261344) were identified in 9 (22.5%) and 6 (15.0%) patients, with allele frequencies of 0.113 and 0.075. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested to check whether the included individuals were in equilibrium for the frequencies of genotype. The genotypes of these 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of SCN5A (H558R and R1193Q) followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which implies that the included individuals are likely to represent the population.\n\n    Among them, there were 16 patients (40%) who had the appropriate ICD shock therapy after ICD treatment; 10 of these patients with a history of SCA. The average time to first ICD shock was 8.50+-4.43 months. Almost all patients were male (97.5%), and SCA was the most common indication for ICD treatment (72.5%). A significantly higher percentage of patients with SCN5A-R1193Q was observed in the group with appropriate ICD shock (31.25% versus 4.35%; P=0.029). However, the frequency of patients who carried SCN5A-H558R was not significantly different between these 2 groups as shown in Table 1.\n\n    Of 40 eligible symptomatic BrS patients, 9 (22.5%) had SCN5A-H558R and/or R1193Q. Two (5%) BrS patients had both SCN5A-H558R and R1193Q, whereas 7 (18%) and 4 (10%) BrS patients had only SCN5A-H558R and R1193Q (Table 1). The association between the SCN5A polymorphisms and electrocardiographic findings are shown in Tables 2, 3 through 4. SCN5A-R1193Q was associated with a longer PR interval (201 [196-212] versus 168 [162-176] ms; P=0.002) and a widening of the QRS duration (145 [140-155] versus 133 [128-142] ms; P=0.023) as shown in Table 3 and Figure 1.\n\n    Four potential confounding factors were included in the Cox proportional model to identify factors associated with appropriate ICD therapy, including family history of cardiac arrest, PR interval, QRS duration, and SCN5A-R1193Q as shown in Table 5. Unadjusted hazard ratio of SCN5A-R1193Q was highest at 10.629 (Table 5). For the multivariate model, only SCN5A-R1193Q was significantly associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients who received ICD treatment as secondary prevention with an adjusted hazard ratio of 10.550 (95% CI, 1.631-68.232). Those patients with a positive SCN5A-R1193Q had shorter times to the ICD shock-free time compared with those patients with a negative SCN5A-R1193Q (Figure 2).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    SCN5A-R1193Q is a genetic marker associated with cardiac conduction defects and ventricular fibrillation in symptomatic BrS patients.\n\n    Cardiologists should be aware that BrS patients with the SCN5A-R1193Q polymorphism may require more careful monitoring of medications or electrolyte abnormalities to prevent ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n    Only 2 known SCN5A polymorphisms were identified in these 40 symptomatic BrS patients:H558R and R1193Q in 9 (22.5%) and 6 (15.0%) patients, with allele frequencies of 0.113 and 0.075. As in a previous report, the global frequency of R1193Q (OMIM: 600163.0023) is 0.0124. R1193Q is mostly found in Asian, such as Chinese (0.05-0.08), Vietnamese (0.08), and Japanese (0.02), whereas it is defined as a mutation in other populations, such as white (0.00) and black (0.00). The frequency of R1193Q in this study is higher than that in the Thai general population (0.075 versus 0.0395), because only symptomatic BrS cases (majority with history of SCA) are included in the present study.15\n\n    Moreover, the R1193Q in the present study is associated with cardiac conduction delay with evidence of a longer PR, a wider QRS duration, and a significantly higher frequency of R1193Q was observed in the BrS patients receiving appropriate ICD shock therapy more than those who did not receive the ICD shock therapy (31.25% versus 4.35%; P=0.029), as shown in Table 1. Ohkubo et al also reported prolonged QRS duration of more than 120 ms, as measured on a standard ECG, that is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in BrS.9 These findings occur because of abnormal slow and fragmented epicardial electrograms from reduction in gap junction expression at right ventricular outflow tract evidenced by autopsies.11 These abnormal electrograms caused by cardiac conduction delay may lead to generate reentry of ventricular arrhythmia, as shown in this study, by appropriate ICD therapy in BrS patients (Table 1). This study also confirms the importance of QRS duration as a risk of ventricular arrhythmia.\n\n    Previous reports also showed that R1193Q polymorphism could accelerate the inactivation of the sodium-channel current, leading to a cardiac conduction defect and endocardial and epicardial repolarization abnormalities resulting in arrhythmogenesis.16, 17, 18 The PR prolongation could differentiate between SCN5A and non-SCN5A BrS patients.19, 20 The study herein also showed longer PR intervals in BrS patients with either R1193Q or H558R SCN5A polymorphisms (Tables 2, 3 through 4).\n\n    This study shows that the rate of appropriate ICD therapy was 34.5% in the aborted SCA group. These rates were comparable with a previous study, which reported discharge rates for appropriate ICD therapy of 44% in the aborted SCA group during a 7-year follow-up period.21 Forty symptomatic BrS patients receiving ICD treatment were examined in this study. R1193Q was the only factor that may be associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy after ICD treatment by both univariate and multivariate Cox regression for survival analysis (Table 5). This finding may be explained by the genetic heterogeneous character of BrS in different ethnicities. R1193Q was associated with cardiac conduction delays that may modulate arrhythmogenic substrates, leading to ventricular arrhythmia and recurrent appropriate ICD therapy.22\n\n    R1193Q, a G to A mutation at position 3578, which causes the substitution of arginine for glutamine at position 1193, appeared to be a genetic factor associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients with the ICD treatment. Therefore, cardiologists should carefully follow up with an awareness of recurrent ventricular tachycardia and VF in symptomatic BrS patients who have this polymorphism by avoiding modulating factors, such as psychotropic drugs, fever, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, and electrolyte abnormalities.23\n\n    H558R, an A to G mutation at position 1673, which causes the substitution of histidine for arginine at position 558, may be associated with sodium-channel inactivation, but not as strong as R1193Q.24 The results of this study supported this hypothesis, evidenced by the prolongation of PR interval, but not significant QRS widening, in BrS patients with the presence of H558R (Table 4). And, H558R was not associated with appropriate ICD shocks in symptomatic BrS patients (Table 1).\n\n    The family history of SCA has been proposed as 1 risk predictor in the past.4 Recent evidence, however, has clearly demonstrated that family history has not been a reliable marker for high risk in patients affected by BrS.2 Moreover, the value of a family history of sudden death in BrS patients has been extensively investigated, and results in that family history of SCA are not predictive for future arrhythmic events.25, 26 Consistent with these studies, present results have also shown that family history of SCA was not associated with recurrent ICD shocks in Thai symptomatic BrS.\n\n    BrS is an uncommon genetic disease resulting in a small sample size. Presence of R1193Q polymorphism are categorical data. Because of small study populations and categorical data, the CI of R1193Q polymorphism is large. This study is in a relatively isolated population because most of the patients were originally from northeastern Thailand, and the findings may not be inferred for other populations. Another limitation of this study is that only 2 polymorphisms of SCN5A were identified in this study. If the BrS patients have other mutations in addition to R1193Q, risks for ventricular arrhythmias may be higher. Further large studies are needed to confirm the results of this study. But, the strength and uniqueness of this study is that patients enrolled in the study were all symptomatic BrS patients and mostly with documented SCA. In this study, the diagnosis of BrS was made clinically. We retrospectively traced back all patients in this study with the 2016 diagnostic criteria for BrS.27 All patients met with the definite criteria for BrS by the median Shanghai score of 6.5 (range, 4.0-7.5).\n\n    In conclusion, SCN5A-R1193Q polymorphism is associated with a cardiac conduction disturbance and may be a genetic factor associated with ventricular arrhythmia, leading to appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients with ICD treatment. This study is needed to be confirmed in other ethnicities and with a larger sample size in the future.",

        "Title": "    Derivation of Breast Cancer Cell Lines Under Physiological (5%) Oxygen Concentrations",
        "Abstract": "    Background: Most human breast cancer cell lines currently in use were developed and are cultured under ambient (21%) oxygen conditions. While this is convenient in practical terms, higher ambient oxygen could increase oxygen radical production, potentially modulating signaling pathways. We have derived and grown a series of four human breast cancer cell lines under 5% oxygen, and have compared their properties to those of established breast cancer lines growing under ambient oxygen.\n\n    Methods: Cell lines were characterized in terms of appearance, cellular DNA content, mutation spectrum, hormone receptor status, pathway utilization and drug sensitivity.\n\n    Results: Three of the four lines (NZBR1, NZBR2, and NZBR4) were triple negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-), with NZBR1 also over-expressing EGFR. NZBR3 was HER2+ and ER+ and also over-expressed EGFR. Cell lines grown in 5% oxygen showed increased expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) target gene carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and decreased levels of ROS. As determined by protein phosphorylation, NZBR1 showed low AKT pathway utilization while NZBR2 and NZBR4 showed low p70S6K and rpS6 pathway utilization. The lines were characterized for sensitivity to 7-hydroxytamoxifen, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, the PI3K inhibitor BEZ235 and the HER inhibitors lapatinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and ARRY-380. In some cases they were compared to established breast cancer lines. Of particular note was the high sensitivity of NZBR3 to HER inhibitors. The spectrum of mutations in the NZBR lines was generally similar to that found in commonly used breast cancer cell lines but TP53 mutations were absent and mutations in EVI2B, LRP1B, and PMS2, which have not been reported in other breast cancer lines, were detected. The results suggest that the properties of cell lines developed under low oxygen conditions (5% O2) are similar to those of commonly used breast cancer cell lines. Although reduced ROS production and increased HIF-1 activity under 5% oxygen can potentially influence experimental outcomes, no difference in sensitivity to estrogen or doxorubicin was observed between cell lines cultured in 5 vs. 21% oxygen.",
        "Introduction": "    The humidified atmosphere used in most human tumor cell culture systems includes carbon dioxide and ambient oxygen (21%). This is considerably higher than that in vivo, which is thought to average 5% (range 1-8%) as a consequence of oxygen transport, consumption in tissues and diffusion from the blood supply to the tissues. The difference raises the question of whether the oxygen concentration in air, for instance by generating increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), might modulate signaling pathways in \"regular\" cell culture conditions and thus alter responses to therapeutic agents. In our previous studies, human melanoma specimens were cultured in an atmosphere of 5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2 to minimize oxygen-mediated damage and in subsequent studies, these conditions were used in the development of more than 100 melanoma lines and more than 50 carcinoma lines. In this report, we describe four human breast cancer cell lines that were developed under these conditions, to ascertain whether their properties, including receptor status, signaling pathway utilization, mutations and drug responses, were comparable to those of established cell lines.",
        "Methods": "    Culture conditions have been described for MCF-7, SKBr3, MDA-MB-231, BT474, and ZR75.1 cells [purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)]. Cell lines were grown in alpha-modified minimal essential medium (alphaMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 mug/mL insulin, 5 mug/mL transferrin and 5 ng/mL sodium selenite (ITS; Roche Applied Sciences), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mug/mL streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NZBR1, NZBR2, NZBR3 and NZBR4 cell lines were grown under low oxygen conditions (5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2) to mimic physiologically oxygen levels in tumors. The cell lines of ATCC provenance were cultured in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 C.\n\n    For estrogen response, MCF-7 and NZBR3 cell lines were cultured in estrogen deprived media (phenol red-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum from ICPbio International Ltd., Auckland, NZ and Invitrogen, Auckland, NZ), and penicillin/streptomycin (10 U/ml and 10 mug/ml, respectively) for the 2 days before 17beta-estradiol treatment. Estrogen-deprived medium was used for all assays related to estrogen stimulation.\n\n    As described previously, tumor tissue taken from four patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer was sent to the histopathologist immediately after surgery, where a portion was placed into growth medium without serum for laboratory studies. Formal consent was obtained from all patients, using guidelines approved by the Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee.\n\n    Solid tumor specimens were disaggregated either immediately or after overnight storage at 4 C. Normal, adipose, or grossly necrotic material was removed and the tumor tissue was minced finely using crossed scalpels. Tissue was reduced to small clumps by passage through a 0.65-mm stainless steel sieve. The size of the aggregates varied greatly (aggregates of 5-100 cells). Material containing larger aggregates was pipetted into tubes, collected by low-speed centrifugation to remove blood cells, necrotic material, and debris (30 x g, 2 min), and then washed twice (30 x g, 2 min) in growth medium. Preparations were monitored by phase contrast microscopy, and cytospins of cell suspensions were stained by hematoxylin/eosin and examined by a pathologist to ensure that they contained tumor cells. Cultures were set up in growth medium supplemented with 5% FBS under an atmosphere of 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 in a Tri-Gas Forma incubator. Tissue culture plates or flasks had previously been coated with a thin layer of agarose to prevent the growth of fibroblasts.\n\n    Early passage cell lines (< passage 33) used in this study were developed in this laboratory. All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.\n\n    Everolimus, afatinib, dacomitinib, lapatinib and ARRY-380 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, USA). 17beta-estradiol, tamoxifen, paclitaxel and doxorubicin were purchased from Sigma (Auckland, NZ). NVP-BEZ235 was synthesized according to published protocols.\n\n    The NZBR cell lines were typed by short tandem repeat profiling by DNA Diagnostics (Auckland, New Zealand) (Table S1). The combination of markers selected was consistent with the National Institute of Standards and Technology database recommendations for identity testing.\n\n    As described previously, proliferation was measured using a thymidine incorporation assay. Cells were seeded (3,000 per well) in 96 well plates in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitors for 3 days. 3H-thymidine (0.04 muCi per well) was added to each well and cultures were incubated for 6 h; cells were harvested on glass fiber filters using an automated TomTec harvester. Filters were incubated with Betaplate Scint and thymidine incorporation measured in a Trilux/Betaplate counter. Effects of inhibitors on the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA were determined relative to the control (non-drug-treated) cells.\n\n    For the growth response to 17beta-estradiol in 5 and 21% oxygen culture conditions, cells were seeded at 2,500 per well in 96 well plates in the presence or absence of 50 nM 17beta-estradiol for 3 days. For the growth response to doxorubicin in 5 and 21% oxygen culture conditions, cells were seeded at 1,000 per well in 96 well plates in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitors for 5 days.\n\n    Intracellular ROS were detected with the cell-permeable fluorescent probe 2',7'- dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (ABCAM) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells (1 x 105) were harvested, incubated with 20 muM DCFDA in medium for 60 min in the dark at 37 C. Cells were analyzed in a BD Accuri  Flow Cytometer.\n\n    As described in detail, oligo-dT and random primers were used to reverse transcribe RNA with qScript Flex cDNA kit (Quantabio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To investigate whether estrogen exposure can lead to increased expression of estrogen response genes and whether cell lines grown in 5% oxygen conditions can induce carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), which is the most well established target of HIF, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using gene-specific primers (Table S2) and Sybr Green Master Mix (Life Technologies), and expression values were normalized relative to HPRT1 RNA expression. The 2 (-delta delta CT) method was used to analyze the relative changes in gene expression.\n\n    As described, breast cancer cell lines were grown to log-phase, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in SDS lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Protein concentration was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma). Cell lysates containing 25 mug of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against phospho-AKT (S473), total AKT, phospho-p70S6K (T389), total p70S6K, phospho-rpS6 (S235/ 236), total rpS6, phospho-ERK (T202/Y204), total ERK (all from Cell Signaling Technology), tubulin (Sigma), and actin (Millipore). Bound antibody was visualized using SuperSignal West Pico (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) or ECL plus (GE Healthcare, Auckland, NZ) and the chemiluminescence detection system by Fujifilm Las-3000.\n\n    For whole exome sequencing (WES), 250 ng of genomic DNA from each cell line was sheared using the EpiShear  Multi-Sample Sonicator (Active Motif). The quantity and fragment size of the sheared DNA were assessed on a Tapestation 2200 (Agilent) with the high sensitivity D1000 tape. Sheared DNA (100 ng) was used for the preparation of the whole exome libraries (WELs). WELs were prepared using the SureSelect XT2 (SSXT2) reagent kit and the SureSelect Clinical Research Exome V2 exome enrichment kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies). The WELs were sequenced on a NextSeq500 (NCS v2.0, Illumina Inc.) to obtain around 40 to 44 million paired end reads (2 x 150 bp, 12 to 13 Gbp) per exome.\n\n    The quality of the sequences was assessed using Fastqc (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) with BWA (bwa 0.7.12). The resulting sam files were converted to bam and then the bam files were sorted using the samtools (Samtools-1.3.1). Mpileup files were generated (Samtools-1.3.1) with the following parameters: maximum depth (-d) 500, minimum base quality (-Q) 15 and minimum mapping quality (-q) 10. Varscan v2.3.9 was used to call variants and to generate VCF (variant call format) files. The variants in the vcf files were annotated with information from various SNP databases (dbSNP138 etc) using ANNOVAR followed by the annotation for the variants' effect with SnpEffect. Variants present in the 1000genome_Oct2014 database were excluded. Variants predicted to have a \"High\" (e.g., nonsense) or \"Moderate\" (missense) impact in genes in the two breast cancer gene lists (see Results Section) were selected using SnpSift.\n\n    T-tests or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Tests was used for comparison of groups. Correlation analysis was performed with Spearman Rank Order correlation coefficient (R) and statistical significance (P) using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc.). Values of P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    The cell lines were characterized by cellular DNA content, hormone receptor expression and tamoxifen sensitivity. The lines were all aneuploid and three of the four lines (NZBR1, NZBR2, and NZBR4) were triple-negative with no expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (Table 1; Figure 1A). The ER+ NZBR3 cell line was sensitive to tamoxifen with an IC50 value of 60 nM (Figure 1B). The triple-negative cell lines were relatively resistant to tamoxifen with IC50 values of >1000, 390, and >1000 nM, respectively.\n\n    A [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay was used to assess the effect of estrogen on cell proliferation when the cells were cultured under 5 and 21% oxygen conditions. Both MCF-7 and NZBR3 cell lines displayed significant growth stimulation by estrogen and MCF-7 cells showed increased response to estrogen as compared to NZBR3. However, the two oxygen concentrations did not have distinguishable effects on the growth response to estrogen (Figure 2A).\n\n    We next examined the expression of three estrogen-responsive genes in these two cell lines; namely Growth Regulation By Estrogen In Breast Cancer 1 (GREB1), Cyclin D1 (CCND1) and Trefoil Factor 1 (TTF1). Both GREB1 and TFF1 showed significant upregulation with estrogen stimulation (Figure 2B).\n\n    As ROS production can be affected by the oxygen concentration during culture, we measured intracellular ROS levels by using the hydrogen peroxide-sensitive dye 2',7' -dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) in cells cultured under 5 and 21% oxygen concentrations. A significant increase in ROS concentrations was observed in cells cultured in 21% oxygen (pairwise T- test, p < 0.05) (Figure 3A).\n\n    Oxygen concentration can affect the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-regulated genes, including carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9). Cell lines were cultured at oxygen concentrations of 5 and 21% for over 2 weeks before testing for the expression of CA9. Apart from NZBR1, which had no measurable transcript by RT-qPCR, all cell lines showed decreased CA9 expression in 21% compared with 5% oxygen (Figure 3B).\n\n    The phosphorylation status of AKT, p70S6K, rpS6, and ERK in the NZBR lines was examined (Figure 4A). NZBR1 showed the lowest degree of phosphorylated AKT expression, yet both NZBR1 and NBZR3 had comparable levels of phosphorylated p70S6K (mTOR pathway effector). On the other hand, both NZBR2 and NZBR4 contained low levels of phosphorylated p70S6K, indicating that they had low mTOR pathway utilization. NZBR2 and NZBR4 showed a low degree of phosphorylated rpS6, whereas NZBR1 had low levels of phosphorylated ERK.\n\n    We have shown that estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines generally are more sensitive to everolimus than are receptor negative lines. However, ER expression is not a requirement for an everolimus response since some ER negative breast cancer cell lines are sensitive to growth inhibition by everolimus, as exemplified here by the TN NZBR2 cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to everolimus (Figure 4B). The degree of signaling via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway did not correlate with growth inhibitory responses to everolimus or BEZ235 treatment (Figures 4B,C).\n\n    Two out of the three triple-negative NZBR cell lines were resistant to everolimus, with IC50 values of over 500 nM (Figure 4B) in a 3-day 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. The ER+ HER2+ NZBR3 cells showed high sensitivity to everolimus (IC50 11.5 nM), yet the triple-negative NZBR2 with low mTOR pathway utilization also showed increased everolimus sensitivity (IC50 1.1 nM) (Figure 4B). Significant differences (p < 0.05) between NZBR2 and the other three cell lines in BEZ235 sensitivity were also observed.\n\n    The sensitivities of the NZBR cell lines, and the ER+ MCF-7, HER2+ SKBR3 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cell lines to the therapeutic agents doxorubicin (a topoisomerase II poison) and paclitaxel (a microtubule poison) were tested (Figure 5). The ER+ HER2+ NZBR3 cell line was least sensitive of all the cell lines to both paclitaxel and doxorubicin.\n\n    Since doxorubicin-induced release of free radicals may cause oxidative stress, we compared the sensitivity to doxorubicin when the cell lines were cultured under 5 vs. 21% oxygen conditions. No significant difference (pairwise T-test, p > 0.05) in sensitivity to doxorubicin was observed when the cell lines were cultured in 5% vs. 21% oxygen (Figure S1).\n\n    We compared the sensitivity of the NZBR cell lines and other breast cancer cell lines with or without ER or HER2 to the HER2 inhibitors lapatinib, afatinib, dacomitinib and ARRY-380 (ONT-380; irbinitinib; tuncatinib). As expected, drug resistance was observed in the HER2- cell lines; however, the HER2+ cell line ZR75.1 also showed similar resistance (Figure 6). HER2+ NZBR3 cells showed high sensitivity to all HER2 inhibitors tested. These data indicate that HER2 expression is necessary but not sufficient for augmented sensitivity to HER2 inhibitors. HER2 inhibitor sensitivity was not dependent on co-expression of ER.\n\n    The effects of ARRY-380 on HER2, AKT, and ERK activation were examined in four HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, which showed a range of sensitivities to ARRY-380. After overnight exposure to 100 nM or 1000 nM of ARRY-380, we observed no effect on total HER2, AKT and ERK expression in the cell lines. ARRY-380 inhibited HER2 phosphorylation in all lines, and ERK phosphorylation in cell lines with detectable phosphorylation (Figure 7). Of interest, the HER2 inhibitor-resistant ZR75.1 cell line showed minimal suppression of AKT phosphorylation by ARRY-380 as compared to the other three HER2 inhibitor sensitive lines (Figures 6, 7). Even though ZR75.1 cells showed loss of HER2 phosphorylation in response to ARRY-380, this was not accompanied by any diminution of the phosphorylation of ERK.\n\n    To examine the mutation status of these cell lines, the following genes (AKT1, ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM, FAM175A, FANCC, MEN1, MRE11A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, ALB2, PIK3CA, PMS1, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, TP53, and XRCCC2) were selected from the hereditary breast cancer panel of AmbryGenetics, GeneDx, and University of Washington. The somatic mutations gene list (GATA3, ESR1, TBX3, RUNX1, NCOR1, KMT2C, SPEN, ARID1A, NOTCH2, MAP2K4, RB1, MTOR, MED12, and LRP1B) was selected from somatic mutations in the cancer (COSMIC) database. Several sequence variants that result in missense or nonsense mutations were detected in genes associated with breast cancer (Table 2). Since germline DNA samples for these cell lines were not available, it is not known whether these mutations were of somatic or germline origin. We detected mutations in BRCA2, AKT1, NF1, EVI2B, MRE11A, ATM, BRCA2, MLH1, PMS2, and LRP1B (Table 2).\n\n    Most mutated genes found in the NZBR cell lines had also been found to be mutated in other breast cancer cell lines (Table 3). The mutation frequencies detected in comparison to those of previously characterized breast cancer cell lines and breast carcinomas are listed in Table S3. The spectrum of mutations was generally similar to that found in commonly used breast cancer cell lines, although EVI2B, LRP1B, and PMS2 mutations were not found in other breast cancer cell lines. (Table 3). Since the EVI2B (Ectopic viral integration site 2B protein homolog) gene lies within an intron of the NF1 (Neurofibromatosis type 1) gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction to the NF1 gene, we compared NF1 and EVI2B RNA expression levels in relation to those of the estrogen receptor gene ESR1 in the genome-wide RNA transcript profile from TCGA (breast invasive carcinoma gene expression) using the RNAseq data set (TCGA_BRCA_exp_HiSeqV2-2017-09-08; in 1,218 tumor tissue samples). A weak but significant positive correlation was observed in the expression of ESR1 and NF1 (Spearman's order coefficient r = 0.313, p = 0.0000002) while EVI2B and ESR1 expression were negatively correlated (r = -0.178, p = 4.4 x 10-10). No significant correlation of NF1 and EVI2B was observed (r = -0.002, p = 0.927).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Our findings show that the behavior of the four breast cancer cell lines developed under low oxygen conditions (5% O2) is generally similar to that of commercially available breast cancer cell lines. It is of interest that the hormone receptor status of the new lines covers the main classes of breast cancer, with three of the four having triple negative receptor status. Proliferation of the ER+ NZBR3 cell line was sensitive to estrogen stimulation, and expression of the estrogen responsive genes GREB1 and TFF1 was increased after 24 h of estrogen exposure (Figure 2). As the cyclin D1 response decreased to background levels by 24 h, the lack of upregulation of CCDN1 in our study is consistent with reports by others.\n\n    Apart from NZBR1, the remaining three NZBR cell lines, MCF-7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-231 showed higher expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-regulated gene CA9 when cultured under 5% oxygen conditions. Significantly increased ROS levels were also found in cell lines cultured under 21% oxygen conditions (Figure 3A). It has been suggested that abundant ROS and associated oxidative stress in cells cultured at high oxygen levels could affect the physiology of cells in culture, which could potentially influence cell phenotypes and experimental outcomes.\n\n    The genomic mutation frequency in the breast cancer cell lines is significantly higher than that in breast carcinoma in vivo (T test; p < 0.002) (Table S3), but the study size is too small to make conclusions about the relative mutation frequencies of the low oxygen-derived lines and ambient oxygen-derived lines. The spectrum of mutations in the NZBR lines is similar to that found in commonly used breast cancer cell lines, except that the EVI2B, LRP1B and PMS2 mutations have not been reported in breast cancer lines (Table 3). The availability of sequence data for these cell lines allows investigation of relationships to drug sensitivity. A surprising finding was that no TP53 mutations were identified. TP53 mutations were identified in 18/32 lines (56%) of a cell line cohort and in 23% of the breast cancer samples. However, the number of cell lines generated in this study is too small to conclude that the frequency of TP53 mutations is lower in cell lines derived under low oxygen conditions.\n\n    The triple negative line NZBR1 is of interest because of the relative absence of gene mutations in the genome sequence. One possible explanation is that this cell line possesses a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) that contributes to its neoplastic properties. NZBR1 expresses EGFR, but it may not depend on the EGFR pathway for survival since it is insensitive to all the HER2 inhibitors tested and these inhibitors also inhibit the EGFR. NZBR1 is generally resistant to targeted agents but is moderately sensitive to the cytotoxic drugs doxorubicin and paclitaxel.\n\n    The triple negative line NZBR2 carries a BRCA2 mutation as well as an AKT1 mutation. The latter differs from the hot spot mutation AKT1E12K that confers sensitivity to the dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitor BEZ235; and NZBR2 shows only moderate sensitivity to BEZ235. NZBR2 shows high sensitivity to everolimus, which is approved for treating advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. NZBR2 is sensitive to everolimus despite its low level of p70S6K phosphorylation. This result extends our previous study indicating that everolimus sensitivity does not require ER signaling.\n\n    The ER+ NZBR3 cell line expresses HER2 and is highly sensitive to tamoxifen, but is relatively resistant to the cytotoxic drugs paclitaxel and doxorubicin. It shows high phospho-AKT expression, suggesting sensitivity to AKT inhibitors. NZBR3 is also highly responsive to the HER2 inhibitors lapatinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and ARRY-380. Mutations for EVI2B, LRP1B, and NF1 have also been identified (Table 2). EVI2B is a transmembrane protein while NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene. NF1 loss is associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors. The EVI2B gene lies within an intron of the NF1 gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction to the NF1 gene, but their expression is not correlated, suggesting that they are independently regulated. NF1 mutations are associated with increased ERK phosphorylation, RAF-MEK-ERK signaling and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway utilization. Patients whose cancers, including breast cancers, possess NF1 mutations have worse survival. This may be consistent with the relative resistance of NZBR3 cells to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (Figure 5). However, these cells are sensitive to HER2 inhibitors, suggesting that they depend more on AKT signaling (which is sensitive to HER2 inhibitors) than on RAS/NF1-ERK signaling (which is less sensitive; Figure 7). LRP1B is a putative tumor suppressor and a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family; gene mutation has been reported in several cancer types but not previously in breast cancer.\n\n    The triple negative NZBR4 line is interesting in that it has a number of gene mutations associated with DNA repair including BRCA2, the double strand break repair nuclease homolog A (MRE11A), mismatch repair system component homolog 2 (PMS2), MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) and Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated serine/threonine kinase (ATM). BRCA2, a tumor suppressor that is essential for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination, is associated with risk of developing breast cancer. MRE11A is part of the DNA double-strand break repair MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex that is required for non-homologous joining of DNA ends which associates with breast cancer risk. Heterozygous germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes including MLH1 and PMS2 can cause Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome conferring a high risk of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers in adulthood. Mutations of MLH1 and PMS2 contribute to microsatellite instability and increased mutation rates in cancer cells. The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that activates the response to double strand DNA breaks. Pathological variants of this gene showed a significantly increased risk of breast cancer with a penetrance that appears similar to that conferred by germline mutations in BRCA2. It is possible that mutations of genes associated with the DNA repair pathways may render NZBR4 cells responsive to PARP inhibitors.\n\n    The drug sensitivity profiles reported here include comparative data for a series of HER2 inhibitors. Lapatinib is an EGFR and HER2 inhibitor with IC50s of 10.8 and 9.2 nM in cell-free assays. Afatinib is an inhibitor of EGFR (wt), EGFR (L858R), EGFR (L858R/T790M) and HER2 with IC50s of 0.5, 0.4, 10, and 14 nM respectively in cell-free assays. Dacomitinib is a potent, irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor, mostly of EGFR with an IC50 value of 6 nM in a cell-free assay. ARRY-380 is a potent and selective HER2 inhibitor with IC50 of 8 nM, equipotent against truncated p95-HER2, 500-fold more selective for HER2 over EGFR (Selleckchem.com; all enzyme inhibition data). ARRY-380 is under clinical investigation for treating HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients. Since ARRY-380 is HER2 specific, it has the potential to block HER2 signaling without causing the toxicities of EGFR inhibition. In comparing the responses of the NZBR cell lines to HER2 inhibitors, we have included data for four established lines, MCF-7, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, and ZR75.1. ARRY-380, the most effective of the HER inhibitors tested, is not active against the HER2+ cell line ZR75.1, which is also resistant to other HER2-directed inhibitors (Figure 6). However, ZR75.1 cells have high levels of phosphorylated AKT and low levels of phosphorylated HER2, and ARRY-380 exposure (up to 1 muM) failed to suppress the relative abundance of phosphorylated AKT. Since the HER2 pathway is weakly active, the results suggest that an alternative signaling pathway can contribute to growth and survival. ZR75.1 cells are also highly sensitive to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and it is possible that combination of everolimus with a HER2 inhibitor could reduce the rate of acquired drug resistance. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to HER2 inhibitor resistance, including identification of predictive biomarkers such as HER2 phosphorylation status, is important for progress in the use of this type of therapy.\n\n    In summary, our results suggest that the behavior of cell lines developed under low oxygen conditions (5% O2) is generally similar to that of commonly used breast cancer cell lines developed under 21% oxygen conditions. Although no difference in sensitivity to estrogen or doxorubicin was observed between cell lines cultured in 5% vs. 21% oxygen, reduced ROS and upregulation of the hypoxia response, as indicated by CA9 expression, were observed in cells cultured under 5% oxygen conditions. Therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that culture of cells under 5 vs. 21% oxygen conditions could have consequences for the effectiveness of drug treatment in cell lines as predictors of therapy responses in patients.\n\n    Ethics approval and consent to participate: This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee guidelines-ref AKL/2000/184/AM06, New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee.

        "Title": "    Sherloc: a comprehensive refinement of the ACMG-AMP variant classification criteria",
        "Abstract": "    The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines were a major step toward establishing a common framework for variant classification. In practice, however, several aspects of the guidelines lack specificity, are subject to varied interpretations, or fail to capture relevant aspects of clinical molecular genetics. A simple implementation of the guidelines in their current form is insufficient for consistent and comprehensive variant classification.\n\n    We undertook an iterative process of refining the ACMG-AMP guidelines. We used the guidelines to classify more than 40,000 clinically observed variants, assessed the outcome, and refined the classification criteria to capture exceptions and edge cases. During this process, the criteria evolved through eight major and minor revisions.\n\n    Our implementation: (i) separated ambiguous ACMG-AMP criteria into a set of discrete but related rules with refined weights; (ii) grouped certain criteria to protect against the overcounting of conceptually related evidence; and (iii) replaced the \"clinical criteria\" style of the guidelines with additive, semiquantitative criteria.\n\n    Sherloc builds on the strong framework of 33 rules established by the ACMG-AMP guidelines and introduces 108 detailed refinements, which support a more consistent and transparent approach to variant classification.",
        "Introduction": "    Variant classification is the cornerstone of clinical molecular genetic testing. The validity and utility of genetic testing require that variant classifications be evidence-based, objective, and systematic. Clinical and medical geneticists must be able to distinguish between established facts and reasonable hypotheses and must understand the evidence and logic underlying variant classifications. Pathogenicity evaluations must be reproducible and protected from the personal and professional biases that can be present in research laboratories, the investigative settings of diagnostic laboratories, and clinicians' urgent desire to make a diagnosis.\n\n    Certain ACMG-AMP rules conflate concepts that should be considered separately. Sherloc expands overly encumbered criteria into a set of discrete but related rules and weights these rules separately.\n\n    Certain pairings of ACMG-AMP rules capture types of evidence that contribute to the same basic argument, which creates a \"double counting\" effect in which an argument is overvalued by invoking the same basic observation more than once. Sherloc groups evidence types into broader lines of argument to prevent this inadvertent error.\n\n    The \"clinical criteria\" style of the ACMG-AMP guidelines introduces difficulty in intuitively understanding the cumulative strength of the evidence, and in appreciating how much additional evidence is required to move to a confident conclusion. Sherloc substitutes a categorical framework and numerically weighted criteria to support a more intuitive understanding of variant classification. Consistent with the ACMG-AMP guidelines, Sherloc is a system for the evaluation of constitutional variants within a Mendelian disease framework.\n\n    The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants were a major step toward establishing a shared framework for variant classification. However, during the process of applying the ACMG-AMP guidelines to the classification of thousands of variants, we and other groups identified several areas in which the guidelines lacked specificity or were subject to ambiguous or contradictory interpretations. To address this, we developed and validated Sherloc (semiquantitative, hierarchical evidence-based rules for locus interpretation), a variant classification framework that is an effective refinement of the ACMG-AMP criteria. Sherloc addresses several key issues.",
        "Methods": "    Sherloc was developed through an iterative process using the ACMG-AMP guidelines as a starting point. The ACMG-AMP draft guidelines were released for member comment in August 2013 and adopted for internal use at Invitae. A working group was formed comprising American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics-certified laboratory directors, doctoral-level scientists, and American Board of Genetic Counseling-certified genetic counselors with experience in many clinical areas of diagnostic genetic testing, including hereditary cancer, cardiology, neurology, and pediatric genetics.\n\n    The working group interpreted variants observed during diagnostic testing by using the implemented framework, and identified variants for which (i) strict adherence to the framework led to classifications at odds with the established understanding of clinical significance, or (ii) uncertainty or disagreement arose about the correct application of the rule set. The working group met weekly to discuss these cases, identify the underlying genetic issues, and refine the rules and their valuations. This iterative process continued for more than two years and through more than 40,000 unique variants identified during clinical laboratory testing across more than 500 genes and conditions. The framework has developed through many major and minor iterations. The rule set described herein is Sherloc version 4.2. All interpreted variants are routinely deposited into ClinVar.",
        "Results": "    Our experience using the ACMG-AMP criteria was mixed. The guidelines presented a logical framework for categorizing and valuing evidence that generally matched the perspective of our clinical staff, many of whom had participated in ACMG-AMP surveys and discussions during guideline development. However, the criteria left many aspects of clinical molecular genetics undescribed and subject to personal interpretation. We routinely encountered variants that caused uncertainty about the appropriate rule usage, which led to classification inconsistencies and debate. Generally, discrepancies were due either to uncertainty about how to categorize evidence that did not fit neatly into the available rules, or subjectivity about when to count evidence as strong or moderate.\n\n    To address these questions, we set out to describe every use-case with explicit evidence criteria. When ambiguity arose, we developed more granular rules to capture the necessary complexity. For example, the ACMG-AMP guidelines contain one caveat-laden rule (PVS1) capturing premature termination codon (PTC) variants and no alternative criteria for PTC variants that fail to fulfill all of the requirements, even though a PTC that does not meet every usage note criteria can have a predictably disruptive effect on a gene product. To address this shortcoming, we established a set of variably weighted criteria for PTCs (see \"Variant type and the expected consequence for gene products\" below), in which the value is modulated based on the location of the stop codon relative to the pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) structure (5' truncations that lead to nonsense-mediated decay versus 3' PTCs that yield translated, truncated proteins) and the molecular mechanism of disease for the gene (confirmed versus unconfirmed loss-of-function (LOF) mechanism).\n\n    We recognized that the full complexity of clinical genetics was unlikely to be captured prospectively, and expected that regular iterations to Sherloc would be necessary. We therefore designed Sherloc to support refinements that could maintain backward compatibility. Over time, this approach expanded the original set of 33 ACMG-AMP criteria to the 108 criteria contained within Sherloc version 4.2. The iterative process continues and is an essential part of laboratory process quality improvement.\n\n    The ACMG-AMP framework assigns a strength level to each evidence criterion and requires various combinations of strong, moderate, and supporting evidence for a confident classification. However, we regularly identified variants that could be formally classified as likely pathogenic but seemed insufficiently supported or, conversely, variants that could formally be classified as variants of uncertain significance despite persuasive evidence that was not handled well by the ACMG-AMP framework.\n\n    For example, CDH1 c.1118C>T (p.Pro373Leu) is a variant in a gene associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. It is absent from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database and is supported by strong functional studies: in vitro functional characterization shows that p.Pro373Leu impairs cell-cell adhesion and leads to increased cellular motility and activation of EGFR, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Src kinase. Computational predictors recapitulate this conclusion. Clinical observations, however, are inconclusive: the variant has been found in affected and unaffected individuals in the same family. A strict application of the ACMG-AMP rules should yield a likely pathogenic classification: PS3 (well-established functional studies) +PP3 (predicted deleterious) +PM2 (absent from population). However, without supporting clinical observations, this conclusion seems premature, particularly because PS3 and PP3 redundantly describe the functional argument that the protein is disrupted.\n\n    Conversely, TTC8 c.459G>A (p.Thr153=) is a very rare silent change (0.02% in ExAC) in a gene that can cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Although not in the consensus +1/+2 splice site, it is located at the last nucleotide of the exon and is predicted to disrupt normal splicing. It has been observed in the homozygous state in three affected siblings in a single family. A strict application of the ACMG-AMP rules yields a variant of uncertain significance classification of PP1 (cosegregation with disease) +PP3 (computational evidence). In our assessment, however, the rules fail to capture relevant sequence context and undervalue the clinical observations. This variant has been observed in our laboratory in the homozygous state in an unrelated affected individual and is now classified as pathogenic.\n\n    Such examples suggested that the ACMG-AMP criteria were not capturing certain qualitative considerations. Therefore, we first posed a normative question: \"What kind of evidence, and how much, should be required for a pathogenic classification?\" We first recognized that there are two general types of evidence: clinical and functional. Clinical evidence describes the correlation of the variant with disease (or absence of disease) in human populations, and includes observations in affected and unaffected individuals and families. Functional evidence describes the molecular consequence of a variant on various gene products and includes the results of molecular and cellular experiments, and predictions about functional effects based on variant type or complex computational algorithms. Clearly, clinical and functional evidence are both important: a variant is pathogenic if it disrupts a gene product in a way that leads to human disease, and is benign if it has an effect that does not lead to disease in humans. Although both clinical and functional evidence are relevant, they have a hierarchical relationship. Clinical data describe human disease directly, whereas functional data are relevant to disease only to the extent to which the measured property correlates with disease physiology. Therefore, when a discrepancy or conflict arises between clinical and functional observations, the clinical observations should be considered more persuasive. Broadly speaking, a variant should not be considered pathogenic if it is present in a large percentage of healthy individuals (clinical data), even if a measurable effect on protein function has been observed in an experimental assay (functional data). Conversely, a variant should be considered pathogenic if it is present in many affected individuals and has not been observed in healthy individuals (clinical data), even if it is predicted to be nondeleterious and has been demonstrated to have no effect on a measured protein property (functional data).\n\n    Examples of these kinds of conflicts include CDKN2A c.9_32dup24 (p.Ala4_Pro11dup) and SCN5A c.3578G4A (p.Arg1193Gln). CDKN2A c.9_32dup24 is an in-frame duplication predicted to have no effect on protein function and demonstrated not to affect CDK4 or CDK6 binding. However, the variant has been identified in several individuals affected with melanoma and has been shown to segregate with disease (incomplete penetrance) in several melanoma families. The abundance of positive clinical evidence trumps the negative functional evidence. It is possible that the effect on binding was mismeasured or that CDK4/6 binding efficiency is not the relevant molecular consequence of this variant. Conversely, SCN5A c.3578G>A (p.Arg1193Gln) is a missense change in the voltage-gated cardiac sodium channel. Pathogenicity seems to be supported by functional evidence: the variant was demonstrated to destabilize inactivation gating and to lead to a persistent current in vitro. However, a glycine is present at the equivalent position in the horse ortholog, and the variant is present in more than 7% of the East Asian population, with 17 homozygotes reported in ExAC. The abundance of negative clinical evidence outweighs the positive functional evidence.\n\n    This principle of the primacy of clinical evidence establishes a framework for evidentiary thresholds: a rare variant supported by nothing but functional evidence should be classified as a variant of uncertain significance in the absence of supporting clinical data linking the molecular dysfunction to a clinical phenotype.\n\n    In the ACMG-AMP system, the overall strength of the total evidence set is evaluated in a manner analogous to the familiar style of diagnostic clinical criteria. Evidence types are roughly binned into one of four levels, and different combinations of evidence from the bins suffice for a confident classification. In practice, however, we have found that this style of assessing an argument introduced obstacles to the accuracy and flexibility of an evolving system. In many cases, we needed to introduce more subtle gradations to the evidence valuation than the four levels could support. We also found that the combinatorial logic of the ACMG-AMP criteria made it very difficult to predict the consequence of introducing new criteria or changing the valuation of criteria. Because there are different paths to a threshold, it was difficult to understand intuitively how much more evidence might be required for a confident classification.\n\n    We knew Sherloc would evolve, so we needed a weighting system that provided more precision and flexibility. We therefore established a semiquantitative system in which each criterion is awarded a preset number of points on orthogonal benign or pathogenic scales (i.e., 1B-5B or 1P-5P), which reflect the value of the data type toward the overall classification argument (Figure 1). Accumulated benign and pathogenic evidence types are summed separately and compared against preset thresholds. When substantial evidence supports both pathogenic and benign conclusions, that dichotomy may indicate low-penetrance variants, genetic or environmental modifiers, or other ambiguity within the Mendelian framework. For most variants supported by evidence toward both poles, however, the clinical/functional hierarchical framework described previously and the practical approach described in Figure 5 provide guidance for evaluating these apparent contradictions. Point thresholds for likely benign and likely pathogenic classifications are asymmetric (3B versus 4P), and reflect the fact that neutral genetic variation is abundant and pathogenic variants are rare. The burden of proof to reach a benign classification is therefore lower.\n\n    The original translation of the ACMG-AMP guidelines into a point system aimed simply to recapitulate conclusions reached via the ACMG-AMP combinatorial scoring method. The value of criteria has changed over time as the rule set was expanded and refined. The current rules and weights are described throughout this paper and in Supplementary Table S1 online. Although the criteria in Sherloc version 1 had a 1:1 mapping to the ACMG-AMP criteria, subsequent versions diverged from that strict correlation. The derivation history or closest mapping of Sherloc evidence criteria (EVs) to ACMG-AMP criteria is presented in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n    This approach (exhaustive criteria set, fixed point values, and a consistent evaluation protocol) promotes consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency among users. The same steps are performed, the same weight is granted to each element of an argument, and users are guided toward the correct application of evidence types.\n\n    Clinical data include population frequency information and observations of variants in well-characterized affected and unaffected individuals and families. Sherloc contains sets of evidence types to capture these data. Detailed knowledge about the symptoms and phenotypes associated with each condition, the penetrance and age at onset of features, and the percentage of clinical cases accounted for by pathogenic variants in known genes are essential prerequisites for using these data effectively. The sections that follow describe the original ACMG-AMP criteria, the derived Sherloc criteria, and the evaluation process for each clinical data type.\n\n    Variant frequencies from large population data sets can provide strong evidence that a variant is benign, or can reveal that one is sufficiently rare to be considered a candidate for pathogenicity. Most variants encountered during testing have previously been observed at a frequency inconsistent with the incidence of monogenic disease. With appropriate safeguards, beginning variant evaluation with population data maximizes accuracy and efficiency. The full set of frequency criteria are shown in Figure 2.\n\n    The ACMG-AMP guidelines contain two benign rules and two pathogenic rules to capture the impact of population frequency on variant classification: BA1 (allele frequency >5%), BS1 (allele frequency > expected), PM2 (absent from controls), and PS4 (higher prevalence in affected individuals versus controls). We encountered a number of limitations to this approach related to the effective placement of frequency thresholds, the known presence of pathogenic variants in population data sets, and the quality and abundance of population data.\n\n    While it is clear that a variant present in 5% of the population cannot be a cause of a rare, monogenic disease, this is also true for variants at much lower frequencies. The ACMG-AMP framework suggests that frequency thresholds be set based on a synthesis of disease prevalence, penetrance, and percent attribution. This guidance is impractical, primarily because accurate prevalence, penetrance, and gene attribution numbers have not been established for most disorders and can vary two- to tenfold even for well-studied disorders, depending on the subpopulation and the total number of unique pathogenic variants. Moreover, frequency data are inherently quantitative. All other things being equal, the likelihood that a variant is benign increases as its observed frequency increases. A single threshold does not adequately capture this variable likelihood of pathogenicity.\n\n    Absent in ExAC (1P)\n\n    \"Within pathogenic range\" (0.5P): low frequency, but consistent with previously well-characterized pathogenic variants\n\n    \"Somewhat high\" (1B): low frequency and inconsistent with previously well-characterized pathogenic variants\n\n    \"High\" (3B): sufficiently common for a likely benign classification without additional corroborating evidence\n\n    \"Very high\" (5B): sufficiently common for a benign classification without additional corroborating evidence\n\n    To address these issues, Sherloc captures five frequency levels:\n\n    To define the bottom four tiers quantitatively, we developed an empirical approach to establish the frequency spectrum of pathogenic variants in the ExAC database. ExAC contains pathogenic variants, and their frequencies can be characterized. Such analysis revealed that in a set of 79 disease genes (39 dominant, 40 recessive, 1508 total variants), 97.3% of pathogenic variants had an allele frequency of less than 0.01%, and 94% were present at eight alleles or fewer.\n\n    These observations are used cautiously to support frequency thresholds that, although much more aggressive than the ACMG-AMP recommended 5%, are still safely conservative. For dominant genes, Sherloc incorporates thresholds of 0.5%, 0.1%, and >8 alleles for the \"very high\", \"high\" and \"somewhat high\" levels, respectively. For recessive genes, it incorporates thresholds of 1%, 0.3%, and >8 alleles, respectively. These cutoffs support the use of ethnic subpopulation allele frequencies, which can be less precise due to smaller sample sizes but are critical for identifying ethnicity-enriched polymorphisms. When a gene is associated with more than one inheritance pattern, an a priori gene-level decision is made to use either the higher or the lower frequency thresholds based on the severity and age at onset of the monoallelic phenotype.\n\n    Variant frequencies can be elevated for founder mutations and within mutational hotspots. As such, high-frequency variants should not be classified as likely benign or benign without a literature review. (For literature review, our laboratory uses custom software, which combines direct searches using Google and SETH/PubTator with indirect reference reviews from the Human Gene Mutation Database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, and ClinVar. Manual search protocols could provide similar security.) The frequency thresholds used for these criteria may change as public data sets grow in size, but the concept and weighting will probably remain the same.\n\n    There are technical considerations for using aggregate population data. For example, KCNQ1 c.1795-11803A>C is absent from the ExAC exome data, which has weak coverage of intronic regions, but is present at 32.3% in 1000 Genomes. As this example illustrates, the absence of a variant from ExAC does not always indicate that it is rare. At some loci, smaller data sets, such as 1000 Genomes, may have more relevant information, although the frequency may be less reliable. Sherloc includes a second set of frequency criteria for observations supported by fewer alleles. Certain loci in ExAC are also troubled by data quality issues. An example is ATM c.566G>A. This variant is present in ExAC at a frequency sufficient to justify a likely benign classification; however, the data are flagged as not passing the variant quality score recalibration filter. Incidentally, the Exome Sequencing Project and 1000 Genomes data do not report a variant at this position. Frequency information at quality-flagged loci should be used cautiously, if at all; Sherloc contains criteria to formally capture these cases. Likewise, ExAC contains loci with high-quality data but low total allele count. Low-frequency observations may be unreliable at these loci due to small sample sizes.\n\n    For all variants, a single \"population\" rule is selected based on a simple decision tree that reflects these considerations (Figure 2a).\n\n    Finally, we considered the zygosity of ExAC observations. For example, RAD50 c.280A>C (p.Ile94Leu) has been observed at a frequency of 0.7% in the south Asian population in ExAC, a cohort that includes two homozygous observations. For genes such as RAD50, in which biallelic pathogenic variants are expected to be lethal or severe (Nijmegen breakage syndrome), observations of homozygous variants are strong evidence that the variant is benign. Therefore, Sherloc contains three rules of varying strength relating to observations of homozygotes in databases (Figure 2b).\n\n    Individuals who are well characterized both phenotypically and genotypically can support inferences that are more powerful than those that can be drawn from discrete entries in general databases. The ACMG-AMP criteria contain five rules for capturing observations in well-characterized individuals: BS4 (nonsegregation with disease), BP2 (cis'trans with a pathogenic variant), BP5 (case with an alternative cause), PP1 (cosegregation with disease), and PP4 (individual's phenotype or family history is highly specific). Other ACMG-AMP criteria, such as PM2 and PS6 (de novo criteria) and many of the variant type criteria, depend implicitly on an observation in an individual with a relevant phenotype.\n\n    We identified three distinct classes of clinical observations that should be considered separately: (i) variants in unaffected individuals (suggests benign), (ii) variants in affected individuals with an alternate cause of disease (also suggests benign), and (iii) variants in affected individuals without an alternate cause of disease (suggests pathogenic). Case report criteria for each are described below. In general, these criteria are additive: each unrelated observation is considered an independent data point that further contributes to the argument. The three classes of observations are depicted in the case report root decision tree (Figure 3).\n\n    Using case report data accurately requires rigor regarding the appreciation of variant frequency, the distinctiveness of the phenotype, the relevance of the phenotype to the gene in question, and the diagnostic yield of the genetic test in patients with the observed phenotype (Supplementary Figure S1).\n\n    Variant frequency is a primary concern in evaluations of the relevance of positive case reports, and must be a preliminary evaluation. Individual case reports should be considered as possible evidence only if the variant is rare (absent from ExAC or present within the \"pathogenic range\"). If the variant is not rare, spurious case reports should be expected; segregation or case-control data are required to confirm the relevance of any single observation.\n\n    Using the clinical phenotype of affected individuals consistently and accurately proved challenging with the ACMG-AMP criteria. The genes BRCA1, JAG1, and MYH7 demonstrate how observations of a rare variant in an affected individual might contribute to an argument of variant causality to different extents.\n\n    Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 strongly predispose to breast cancer. However, isolated breast cancer is common, and approximately 90% of cases have nongenetic etiologies. Most observations of BRCA1 variants in affected individuals, therefore, must be coincidental, not causal, so the observation of a variant in an isolated affected individual is not strong evidence that the variant is pathogenic unless it is first established that the individual's disease is hereditary. Contrast BRCA1 with JAG1, which causes Alagille syndrome, a rare and clinically distinctive condition without known nongenetic etiologies. For classically affected individuals who meet clinical diagnostic criteria, the diagnostic yield for the molecular test is greater than 95%. It is therefore substantially more likely that a novel JAG1 variant in a clinically distinct individual is causal. JAG1/Alagille syndrome observations are therefore stronger evidence than BRCA1/breast cancer observations. Between these two extremes lies MYH7 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Pathogenic variants in MYH7 can lead to hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, phenotypes that can have genetic origins but can also have substantial nongenetic etiologies (up to 70%). Case reports of rare MYH7 variants in individuals with HCM are cautiously considered evidence of pathogenicity, as a substantial likelihood remains that the combination is coincidental. A cohort of affected individuals with the same rare variant, however, becomes persuasive.\n\n    These examples demonstrate that the value of a clinical observation should vary based on both the specificity of the clinical phenotype and the diagnostic yield of the molecular test for that phenotype. The higher the pretest probability that a proband with a particular phenotype will have a particular gene disruption, the greater the likelihood that an observed variant in that gene or set of genes is the explanation for disease. Conversely, the lower the yield of a test, the greater the likelihood that the true etiology lies elsewhere and the higher the likelihood that observed variants are coincidental.\n\n    To develop a consistent approach to determining the value of clinical observations, we divided genes based on their yield for particular phenotypes. If the diagnostic yield is high (>75%), isolated case reports may be considered very significant, and finding a rare variant in a relatively small number of classically affected probands will be sufficient for a pathogenic classification. However, if the test accounts for less than 75% of cases, case reports are relevant only to the extent that the disease is first established to be hereditary based on the nature of the phenotype or a pedigree analysis. Furthermore, at least two unrelated case reports are required to begin counting the observations as relevant data to protect against circular reasoning in diagnostic testing. A cohort of similarly affected individuals is generally required for a pathogenic classification.\n\n    If the index proband is not a confirmed hereditary case, an isolated case is not used as evidence, and segregation data are required. Sherloc has three levels of segregation data to capture the fact that additional families and higher LOD scores quantitatively substantiate a classification argument (see Supplementary Information, Supplement 4: \"Quantifying segregation\"). When asserting a correlation between a positive genotype and a positive phenotype, the genomic linkage of the observed variant to the causative variant is a concern. Therefore, the value of a single family, no matter how large, is capped to protect against this possibility; other types of supporting evidence (functional data or observations in unrelated, affected individuals or families) are required for a confident classification.\n\n    It is important to predefine the distinct clinical features required to count an observation as a relevant case. Accepted clinical criteria, if they exist, should be used. Summary or simplified condition information, such as that often deposited in ClinVar or included on test requisition forms, may be insufficient for case-based conclusions, and additional communication may be required to capture necessary detail. Sherloc contains a 0-point criterion, \"Observed in patient with nonspecific phenotype or insufficient genotype\" (EV0107), to acknowledge reports of poorly characterized individuals or well-characterized individuals with nonspecific phenotypes.\n\n    Finally, the full genotype and variant inheritance can provide additional support to a pathogenicity argument. Two rare variants in trans in a recessive gene, or a hemizygous variant in an affected male, can provide an additional level of certainty that the case report is valuable. The observation that a variant has arisen de novo in a relevant and established disease gene is counted as strong evidence. Sherloc contains a less heavily weighted criteria for capturing de novo variants in candidate genes, an important consideration for exome analysis, in which multiple de novo events are common.\n\n    Most Mendelian conditions are rare and explained by a single genetic etiology. Therefore, when an affected individual has an identified genetic etiology, additional variants in the same or a different gene are less likely to be pathogenic. In certain cases, co-occurrence observations of this sort can be used as evidence that the additional variants are benign. Sherloc contains four evidence types capturing these scenarios (Supplementary Figure S2). Within the same gene, co-occurrence applies only to variants in trans with pathogenic variants; once an allele is disrupted, there is no selective pressure preventing that allele from acquiring additional variants that would be pathogenic in isolation. It also applies only to variants causing dominantly inherited disease (or in X-linked genes in male probands). Recessive carrier status is no more or less likely in affected individuals.\n\n    Finally, this logic does not apply to relatively common conditions with locus heterogeneity:that is, when there are known case reports of affected individuals who inherit pathogenic variants in related genes from both parents. For example, up to 5% of individuals with a pathogenic HCM variant also have a second pathogenic HCM variant in a different gene. The second variant cannot be presumed to be benign, and co-occurrence evidence types are not applied for HCM cases.\n\n    The observation of a variant in an unaffected individual, which in a genetic context should lead to disease if it were pathogenic, suggests that the variant may be benign (Supplementary Figure S3). For example, CHARGE syndrome is a dominant, highly penetrant, congenital disease caused by pathogenic variants in CHD7. A CHD7 variant in an unaffected adult is therefore strong evidence that the variant is benign. Likewise, biallelic pathogenic variants in BRCA2 cause Fanconi anemia, and there is no difference in the mutation spectrums of pathogenic variants that lead to BRCA2-mediated Fanconi anemia versus hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. A variant in trans with a pathogenic BRCA2 variant in an individual without Fanconi anemia must therefore be benign.\n\n    The strength of these assertions depends on the penetrance and expressivity of a condition. Pathogenic variants in JAG1, as described previously, cause Alagille syndrome, which has highly variable expressivity and severity; some individuals reach childbearing age without recognizing that they are affected. The observation of a JAG1 variant in an \"unaffected\" individual is evidence only to the extent that the individual has been phenotyped thoroughly and found to be devoid of subtle features.\n\n    To address examples like these, Sherloc modulates \"unaffected case report\" rules on inheritance, zygosity, and the penetrance and age at onset of associated diseases. For genes that lead to highly penetrant, early-onset diseases, even a single observation in a well-characterized unaffected individual can be strong evidence that a variant is benign; however, for genes in which we might expect to see unaffected, genotype-positive individuals, additional observations are required.\n\n    The use of these evidence types must be based on the confirmed absence of a particular phenotype. The fact that a phenotype has not been mentioned in a test requisition form or publication is insufficient evidence that it is absent. Furthermore, the term \"unaffected\" is relative; these rules also apply when the individual is affected by a disease but is not affected by the disease associated with the gene in question.\n\n    The ACMG-AMP criterion BS4 (lack of segregation) is challenging to parse, as nonsegregation can refer two separate phenomena that should be considered separately, and remain challenging to quantify. Within the context of a family with multiple individuals affected by a hereditary condition, the variant is (i) present in an unaffected individual (genotype-positive/phenotype-negative), or (ii) absent in an affected individual (genotype-negative/phenotype-positive). Observations of genotype-positive/phenotype-negative individuals, even in the context of a complex pedigree, are treated simply as independent data points using the criteria described in Supplementary Figure S3. Linkage to a causative variant is not a concern in the negative correlation, although the concerns about penetrance and expressivity described above are relevant. On the other hand, the absence of a variant in an affected individual (genotype-negative/phenotype-positive) is currently awarded 1 to 2 \"miscellaneous benign points\" based on the specificity and rarity of the condition. EV criteria do not yet exist and will be addressed more formally in future versions; a method for objectively establishing symptom specificity and phenocopy rates, and weighing this evidence against other data is still being developed.\n\n    A variant is more likely to be pathogenic if it has a consequence for a gene product (a transcript or protein, or both) that is consistent with the disease mechanism of the gene. The ACMG-AMP guidelines contain six rules related to variant type: BP1 (missense variant in a gene with an LOF mechanism), BP3 (in-frame indels in a repetitive region), BP7 (silent change with no predicted impact on splicing), PVS1 (null variant in an LOF gene), PM4 (in-frame indel in a nonrepetitive region), and PP2 (missense variant in a gene in which missense changes are rare). Sherloc expands these rules to 27 criteria that address a more comprehensive set of variant types, specify differences based on variant location in the mRNA exonic structure, and incorporate assertions about molecular mechanism (Supplementary Figure S5, Supplementary Information: Supplement 1, \"Variant type\"). A single variant type rule is applied to each variant. In some cases (truncations, indels, and missense variants), additional dependent rules incorporate information about other nearby pathogenic variants. Missense changes and in-frame deletions/insertions are given a weight of 0 points. Variants that do not reliably affect protein sequence or abundance (such as silent or some intronic variants) are presumed more likely to be tolerated, and variants that exert a more dramatic effect on protein sequence or abundance (such as premature stops and splice junctions) are presumed more likely to be deleterious.\n\n    The relevance of a null variant depends on the disease mechanism of the gene, and ACMG-AMP and Sherloc both give special weight to null mutations in LOF genes. An objective approach to determining whether a disease mechanism has been established as LOF is described in the Supplementary Information (Supplement 2, \"Establishing loss of function as a mechanism\"), and a cohort of three unrelated affected individuals with null variants is typically required to support this conclusion. Variant effect rules are grouped and nonadditive.\n\n    Experimental data can demonstrate an effect on certain aspects of protein or RNA function, localization and abundance but speak only indirectly to the question of pathogenicity. Experimental data are persuasive to the extent that the measured property is recapitulated in vivo and is relevant to the disease mechanism of the gene. The ACMG-AMP guidelines contain two rules capturing functional studies: BS3 (well-established assay, no deleterious effect) and PS3 (well-established assay, deleterious effect). However, we found it challenging to address the evidence provided by less-well-established functional assays, and found that the value awarded to even well-established functional assays was excessive, as we routinely encountered examples in which experimental evidence was later overturned by contradictory experimental evidence or by new population data. For example, ACTN2 c.26A>G (p.Gln9Arg) is an actinin variant observed in a number of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or HCM, or both. p.Gln9Arg expression in a skeletal muscle cell line was significantly different from the equivalent expression of a wild-type construct and failed to support normal cellular morphological changes and protein localization. However, the frequency of this variant in ExAC is greater than 0.1%, which is inconsistent with pathogenicity and high enough to cast substantial doubt on the relevance of case reports.\n\n    Likewise, MLH1 c.794G>A (p.Arg265His) is a rare variant observed in many individuals and families affected with Lynch syndrome. At least two experimental studies have reported cellular or molecular phenotypes attributed to this variant: a mutator phenotype in S288c and SK1 cells, and altered splicing in an ex vivo splicing assay. However, subsequent functional studies demonstrated repeatedly that this variant was mismatch-repair competent when transfected into HEK-293 cells, did not alter beta-galactosidase activities in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and did not lead to a yeast mutator phenotype. Furthermore, the variant has been observed to co-occur with pathogenic MLH1 variants in multiple families. The evidence justifies a likely benign classification in both of these cases, despite initial functional evidence demonstrating a deleterious effect.\n\n    Disagreement about the value of functional data is a major source of classification discrepancies among genetics professionals. Clearly, the value of functional data depends on the relevance of the measured property to the disease biology, the quality of the experiment, the reproducibility of the result, and the amount of measured change, although a consistent evaluation of these considerations is challenging. To address this complexity, Sherloc contains rules capturing varying degrees of confidence, distinguishing splicing and protein effect experiments, and capturing and discounting poorly performed or inconclusive studies (Figure 4). Detailed guidelines for distinguishing between strong and weak categorizations are included in the Supplementary Information (Supplement 3, \"Experimental evidence\"). Functional evidence types are grouped and nonadditive. When multiple criteria are appropriate, only the strongest is counted.\n\n    A well-established, clinically validated assay that measures enzyme activity or analyte abundance in a patient-derived sample is a special data type that straddles the boundary between clinical phenotype and functional data. It is captured here as functional data in recognition of the essential quantitative objectivity of the data. These evidence types augment the value of a case report when appropriate. Newborn screen data are captured but not valued in recognition of the high false-positive rate.\n\n    Many computational tools exist to predict the effect of missense changes on gene products. Although these tools are useful in prioritizing variant lists in gene discovery exercises, their clinical validity as predictors of disease is not well established. Sherloc contains a series of weakly weighted criteria to capture these observations (Supplementary Figure S5). Splicing predictors, although also weakly weighted, are used to indicate which silent or intronic variants should be considered further.\n\n    The presence of an equivalent missense change in a mammalian species is granted a special weight reflecting the assumption that variation within a mammalian clade speaks more directly to questions of mammalian physiology and is therefore more relevant to human disease. Computational predictor evidence types are nonadditive. They are also grouped with, and superseded by, functional evidence criteria. When multiple evidence types from this large group are used, only the strongest is counted.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Sherloc is an implementation and refinement of the ACMG-AMP variant classification guidelines and a robust method for the consistent valuation of classification-related evidence. Sherloc is a collection of specific, interdependent, and consistently weighted evidence types supported by a set of hierarchical decision trees.\n\n    Variant classification should be reproducible and auditable. When confronted with the same evidence, different people should come to the same conclusions. Conclusions should be derived directly from the consistent use of evidence.\n\n    Evidence classification should be specific. A single evidence type should capture a single, well-defined use-case, and every use-case should be captured by an available evidence criterion. Ambiguities should be addressed by iterative refinements to the system.\n\n    Evidence should not be counted twice. Certain types of evidence contribute to the same basic argument. The rule set should contain dependencies to correct for double counting.\n\n    Some observations are additive. Certain arguments become more persuasive when supported by additional observations. Some evidence types can be invoked more than once and are additive when invoked multiple times.\n\n    Data types can be interrelated. Certain data types meaningfully affect the significance of other data types. The frequency of a variant, for example, changes our expectations for and use of case reports and segregation data.\n\n    Clinical genetics can be more complicated than Mendelian inheritance. Contradictory evidence may exist, and the evidence supporting a variant classification of benign or pathogenic should be considered separately. When substantial evidence supports both conclusions, that dichotomy may reflect complex, non-Mendelian mechanisms, exceptionally low-penetrance variants, or genetic modifiers or environmental effects, or may otherwise be ambiguous within the Mendelian framework.\n\n    Sherloc is built on a number of basic principles:\n\n    Molecular genetics is complicated, and that complexity is reflected in the Sherloc rule set. In practice, however, a simple hierarchical approach to evidence types yields accurate and thorough results quickly.\n\n    Evaluate population data. This step identifies variants that are too common to be causes of Mendelian disease and provides the lens through which clinical case reports must be evaluated.\n\n    Evaluate the expected effect of the variant on the gene product(s) (variant type). This step identifies variants strongly suspected to be pathogenic or benign and contextualizes the functional data.\n\n    Evaluate clinical case reports for substantial positive or negative evidence of enrichment in clinically affected individuals.\n\n    Evaluate functional experiments and predictive data. In most cases, functional data are consulted to confirm or refute the argument that has been established by the other data types.\n\n    The most efficient process for variant classification moves from the most powerful and simplest information to the least powerful and most complex information. In practice, we adopt a four-step process, which usually leads to the invocation of three to five evidence types per variant. At each step, we usually choose the single most appropriate evidence type from a related collection of choices. The hierarchical steps are as follows (see Figure 5):\n\n    Once substantial evidence exists for a confident classification, the remaining steps can take the form of a scan for potentially contradictory evidence. Software can support the systematic efficiency of the evaluation process by providing a user interface that supports accurate rule usage and the automatic application of the discrete evidence types that depend on digitally available data. Population data and variant effect data are amenable to automatic classification, but the evaluation of case reports and functional studies are not. Novel variants unsupported by publications are highly amenable to automatic precategorization. Any system has limitations, however, and a purely software-generated classification cannot be considered a substitute for professional evaluation.\n\n    Sherloc presents a general framework for the evaluation of evidence:an epistemological argument that simply addresses the questions, \"When can we say we know the effect of a variant?,\" \"When do we merely suspect?,\" and \"How can we tell the difference?\" The accurate use of this framework depends on specific knowledge of the molecular and clinical aspects of particular genes. A well-supported understanding of the disease mechanism associated with a gene should make rules that depend on the molecular mechanism applicable or inapplicable for variants in that gene. However, the weight granted to the general argument (that the variant is pathogenic because its mode of action is consistent with the mode of action associated with pathogenic variants in that gene) should be the same in all cases.\n\n    Specific knowledge about protein structure and function can lead to conclusions that a particular amino acid residue may be critical. This knowledge may be based on conservation, an understanding of protein domains, or knowledge about pairs of residues that bond to maintain a three-dimensional protein structure. However, the weight granted to the general argument:that a novel variant is pathogenic because it disrupts an amino acid residue suspected to be critical to the protein structure of a structural protein or the protein function of a channel or enzyme:should be the same in all cases.\n\n    Likewise, detailed knowledge about the phenotypes associated with pathogenic variants in a gene should make rules that depend on counting case reports relevant or irrelevant when considering observations of individuals with variants in that gene. However, the weight granted to the general argument:that a variant is more likely to be pathogenic when observed in an individual with a highly specific phenotype:should be the same in all cases.\n\n    The 2015 ACMG-AMP guidelines for variant classification were a major step toward establishing the basic outlines of a shared framework for variant classifications. The conclusion of this paper is that the details of that framework can be further refined, and such refinements will improve the reproducibility and objectivity of variant classification across individuals and laboratories. However, the core value of the framework cannot be overstated: these guidelines help drive consensus by providing a shared framework for documenting the evidence considered in an evaluation, beginning the process of valuing certain evidence types, and turning professional disagreements about variant classifications into meaningful discussions about clinical and scientific data. A complex and nascent field, such as clinical genetics, will uncover cases about which reasonable professionals come to different conclusions. A shared language is the first requirement for achieving a common goal.\n\n    Supplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at http://www.nature.com/gim\n\n    ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE INVITAE CLINICAL GENOMICS GROUP\n\n    Sienna Aguilar, MS, Swaroop Aradhya, PhD, FACMG, Daniel Beltran, PhD, Brandon Bunker, PhD, Amy Daly, MS, Anne Deucher, MD, Tali Ekstein, MS, Ali Entezam, PhD, Karl Erhard, PhD, Ed Esplin MD, PhD, FACMG, FACP, Jennifer Fulbright, MS, Amy Fuller, MS, Kristen McDonald Gibson, PhD, FACMG, Tina Hambuch, PhD, FACMG, Rachel Harte, PhD, Christy Hartshorne, MS, Eden Haverfield, PhD, FACMG, Nastaran Heidari, PhD, Michelle Hogue, MS, Daniela Iacoboni, MS, Britt Johnson, PhD, FACMG, Hio Chung Kang, PhD, Rachel Lewis, PhD, Shiloh Martin, PhD, Sarah McCalmon, PhD, Scott Michalski, MS, Cindy Morgan, MS, Laura Murillo, PhD, Piper Nicolosi, PhD, Karen Ouyang, PhD, FACMG, Carolina Pardo, PhD, Rita Quintana, PhD, Marina Rabideau, MS, Darlene Riethmaier, MS, Amanda Stafford, PhD, Jackie Tahiliani, MS, Chris Tan, MS, S Paige Taylor, PhD, Shu-Huei Wang, PhD, Hannah White, MS, Ian Wilson, PhD, FACMG, Tom Winder, PhD, FACMG, and Michelle K Zeman, PhD.\n\n    All of the authors are employees and shareholders of Invitae, a commercial laboratory performing diagnostic genetic testing.",

        "Title": "    \"Pill-in-the-Pocket\" Treatment of Propafenone Unmasks ECG Brugada Pattern in an Atrial Fibrillation Patient With a Common SCN5A R1193Q Polymorphism",
        "Abstract": "    Background: \"Pill-in-the-pocket\" (PIP) treatment with type IC drugs for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) has been recommended in guidelines. Major adverse effects have been often reported, and the underlying mechanisms are proposed to be associated with the genetic backgrounds.\n\n    Methods and Results: A male patient was treated with PIP approach (propafenone 600 mg.po) for the conversion of new onset AF. His symptoms got worse and referred to emergency room; ECG showed a typical Brugada syndrome (BrS) type I ECG pattern with sinus rhythm. Genetic screening identified a common SCN5A polymorphism R1193Q. Propafenone blockade of INa was studied in HEK293 cells expressed SCN5A R1193Q channel and WT channel using patch clamp techniques. There was no significant difference in peak current and steady-state gating parameters between R1193Q and WT at baseline. At clinically relevant concentration of 2 mumol/L propafenone, use-dependent block (UDB) of INa was more pronounced in R1193Q versus WT (44.2 +- 7.2 versus 24.8 +- 5.7% at the frequency of 2 Hz, P < 0.05); IC50 of UDB was 2.9 +- 0.7 mumol/L for R1193Q and 8.1 +- 1.8 mumol/L for WT, respectively. Propafenone produced more left shift of steady-state inactivation and slower recovery from inactivation in R1193Q compared with WT.\n\n    Conclusion: A common SCN5A polymorphism R1193Q enhances UDB by propafenone and predisposes the patients to drug-induced BrS with PIP treatment. Our data suggest that R1193Q polymorphism is likely to be a genetic marker for the major adverse effects associated with propafenone PIP approach for AF patients' management. Ajmaline challenge to rule out the presence of BrS should be considered prior to propafenone PIP therapy in AF patients who are identified to have R1193Q polymorphism.",
        "Introduction": "    Single oral loading dose of propafenone or flecanide as \"pill-in-the-pocket\" (PIP) treatment for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) has been recommended in the guideline for management of patients with AF. This approach resolves the symptoms within 2-3 h and significantly decreases the visits to the emergency room and hospitalizations, while major adverse effects have been reported, including significant QRS wave widening, atrial flutter at a rapid ventricular rate, Brugada syndrome (BrS) ECG pattern, and sinus arrest. It has been proposed that underlying heart diseases, pharmacodynamics associated with drug metabolism and drug-drug interaction are responsible for these adverse effects. Consequently, PIP is required to prescribe only if the administration of propafenone and flecainide has been proved safe in hospital as indicated in the guideline. While recently it was reported that intravenous administration of flecainide or propafenone in patients with recent-onset AF in hospital does not predict adverse effects during PIP treatment, suggesting that it should be used with caution patient management for the use of PIP approach in the cardioversion of AF.\n\n    There is emerging data that genetic predisposing factors underlie sodium channel blockers associated adverse effects given the fact that SCN5A mutations were identified in the AF patients who were unmasked BrS by administration of type IC drugs for cardioversion. Previously, we demonstrated that the biophysical diversity of SCN5A mutations is a major determinant of response to sodium channel blockers in patients with SCN5A mutations. Here we reported a case with a common R1193Q SCN5A polymorphism, who presented type I BrS ECG after PIP treatment with propafenone. In vitro study found that this SCN5A polymorphism increases the sensitivity to propafenone block. Therefore, the present study showed that a common SCN5A polymorphism is likely responsible for the adverse events observed in AF patients treated with PIP approach.",
        "Methods": "    This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the program of \"Effects of SCN5A polymorphism R1193Q on the parameters of electrocardiogram in Chinese Han and the investigation of underlying mechanisms.\" The protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital.\n\n    Genetic analysis was performed by screening of the open reading frame of the SCN5A, GPD1L, CACNA1C, CACNB2, SCN1B, SCN3B, SCN10A, KCNE3, and KCNH2 genes as we previously reported.\n\n    The SCN5A mutations were engineered into wild-type (WT) cDNA cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequence analysis. HEK 293 cells were transfected with equal amount of Na+ channel alpha-subunit and hbeta1 by a lipofection procedure as previously described.\n\n    Membrane currents were measured using whole-cell patch clamp procedures with Axopatch 700B amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, United States). All signals were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz (Digidata 1440A, Axon Instruments). Internal pipette solution contained (mmol/L) aspartic acid 50, CsCl 60, Na2-ATP 5, EGTA 11, HEPES 10, CaCl2 1, and MgCl2 1, with pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH. External solutions consisted of (mmol/L) NaCl 130, CaCl2 2, CsCl 5, MgCl2 1.2, HEPES 10, and glucose 5 with pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH. In experiments designed to measure the voltage dependence of activation, external Na+ was reduced to 30 mmol/L with N-methyl-glucamine used as a Na+ substitute. Stock solution (10 mM) of propafenone hydrochloride was prepared by dissolving the powdered drug in DMSO. Appropriate amounts of the stock solution were added to the extracellular solution to reach various drug concentrations. Recordings were made at room temperature. The detailed procedures of patch clamp were described previously.\n\n    Pclamp9.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, United States) and Origin8.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, United States) were used for data acquisition and analysis. Data are presented as means +- SE. An unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare means; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    A 62-year-old man, who had a new onset of AF and no family history of syncope or cardiac death, was treated by intravenous propafenone (70 mg) for conversion of AF in emergency room. Sinus rhythm was resumed, and ECG showed incomplete right bundle branch block without ST-segment elevation in precordial leads (Figure 1A). He was discharged and given propafenone for PIP approach of recurrent AF management. Two weeks later, AF reoccurred, and he was self-treated with 600 mg propafenone orally. However, palpitation could not be resolved and he came into the emergency room. ECG revealed sinus rhythm with PR interval prolongation and significant ST-segment elevation in V1-V3, the type 1 BrS ECG pattern, as shown in Figure 1B. Six hours later, the ST-segment elevation in V1-V3 was completely resumed. BrS was suspected. Genetic screening was performed, and a heterozygous single-nucleotide transition (3578G > A) in SCN5A was identified, leading to a single amino acid replacement at position 1193 (R1193Q), this variant was identified in 50 references alleles from 374 ethnically matched controls.\n\n    As shown in Figure 2A, INa was activated by a voltage step from a holding potential of -100 mV to various test potentials. There was not substantially difference between WT and R1193Q in the current-voltage curves over a range from -80 to 40 mV; the peak current densities, measured at -10 mV, were comparable between WT and R1193Q (-58.24 +- 4.38 pA/pF versus -54.40 +- 5.36 pA/pF at -15 mV, P > 0.05, n = 10 cells for each group). Sustained sodium current (% of peak current) is not considerably increased in R1193Q compared with WT (0.44 +- 0.09% versus 0.34 +- 0.07%, P > 0.05, n = 10 cells for each group). No significant alterations were observed in SSA, SSI, and RFI between WT and R1193Q (Figure 2B-D and Table 1).\n\n    Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs may reveal the hidden BrS. Therefore, we characterized tonic block (TB) and use-dependent block (UDB) by propafenone in WT and R1193Q. TB can be measured by using infrequent pulse to assay sodium current in order to avoid extra UDB. Figure 3A shows INa recordings elicited by a 20-ms pulse before and after exposure to 10 mumol/L propafenone, TB of INa was compatible between in R1193Q versus WT (14.0 +- 4.2 versus 10.9 +- 3.7%, n = 8-9 cells for each group, P > 0.05). As shown in Figure 3B, IC50 values of TB were 70.3 +- 9.3 mumol/L for WT and 54.9 +- 10.1 mumol/L for R1193Q, respectively.\n\n    Intriguingly, when tested the UDB by a protocol that mimicked the clinical condition by 400 ms depolarization from holding potential -100 mV, R1193Q presented more sensitive to propafenone blocking than WT despite without significant difference in UDB in the absence of propafenone (Figure 4A-C). In the presence of 2 mumol/L propafenone (clinically relevant concentration), there were more pronounced UDB in R1193Q versus WT (44.2 +- 7.2 versus 24.8 +- 5.7% at 2 Hz pacing, P < 0.01). At the frequency of 1 Hz, IC50 value for WT was 2.1 times higher than that for R1193Q (Figure 4D); at the frequency of 2 Hz, IC50 value for WT was 2.8 times higher than that for R1193Q (Figure 4E). Our data indicated that R1193Q significantly increased the channel response to propafenone at faster heart rate.\n\n    According to the modulated receptor hypothesis, sodium channel blockers prefer to binding to the inactivated channel and tighter binding of a drug to the inactivated state must be accompanied by a shift in equilibrium from resting toward inactivated states once channels have bound drug. Thus, we compared the shift of SSI curves of WT and R1193Q in the presence of 2 mumol/L propafenone. As shown in Figure 5A,B, V1/2 of WT was shifted by -1.85 mV; while V1/2 of R1193Q was shifted by -6.96 mV. The augmented shift of V1/2 of SSI indicated that R1193Q induced stronger binding with propafenone than WT.\n\n    Use-dependent block is profoundly affected by the recovery from a drug block, and delayed recovery from sodium channel blockers has been implicated in the augmented drug sensitivity. Therefore, the recovery time course from propafenone block was evaluated. Cells were superfused with 2 mumol/L propafenone and depolarized to -10 for 400 ms from a holding potential of -100 mV, followed by a variable recovery time and a test pulse of -10 mV. As shown in Figure 5C, R1193Q recovered more slowly than WT in the presence of propafenone; the slower recovery led to fewer available channels and caused a decreased current when the R1193Q channels were repetitively activated by a train of depolarizing pulses.",
        "Conclusion": "    We identified a common SCN5A R1193Q polymorphism in an AF patient in whom BrS ECG pattern was unmasked after PIP treatment of propafenone. In vitro studies elucidated enhanced sensitivity of R1193Q to propafenone as the underlying mechanism. These data suggest that caution should be used when AF patients with R1193Q variant receive propafenone PIP administration as this polymorphism is likely to be a genetic marker for the major adverse effects. In order to avoid potentially life-threatening arrhythmic event associated with propafenone PIP therapy, it is crucial to perform ajmaline challenge to rule out concealed BrS in AF patients carrying with R1193Q polymorphism.",
        "Discussion": "    Pill-in-the-pocket treatment with propafenone is recommended by the guideline for cardioversion of recent-onset AF. In this study, we identified a SCN5A polymorphism R1193Q in a patient who presented type I BrS ECG after PIP treatment with propafenone. Patch clamp study revealed that R1193Q was sensitive to propafenone blocking and produced more significant UDB that was likely underlying the mechanism for the propefenone induced BrS.\n\n    R1193Q was originally described by in a pair of affected Japanese dizygotic twins; one twin died unexpectedly during sleep at 4 months of age; the other twin had frequent VF episodes with typical BrS ECG; this variant was absent in 100 healthy control. Subsequently, R1193Q was reported on a series of SCN5A-associated channelopathies, such as long QT (LQT) syndrome, progressive cardiac conduction disease, overlap syndrome, and sudden infant death syndrome. Several studies have characterized R1193Q gating properties in vitro. reported that it had a persistent sodium current and a shift of SSI toward more hyperpolarized voltages, thus accounting for the QTc prolongation and BrS phenotype, respectively; similar data were also obtained through the study of. In the present study, R1193Q showed the tendency of an enhanced persistent sodium current and a left shift of SSI (0.6 mV), while there was no significant difference between R1193Q and WT. Our data were consistent with the study of in which R1193Q presented a tiny difference from WT. More recently, investigated the impact of various body temperature (25-38 C) on SCN5A WT channel and R1193Q channel; they found that R1193Q did not modulate NaV1.5 channel at various body temperature. Taken together, those studies demonstrated there was no significant abnormality of R1193Q channel that questions the pro-arrhythmic role of R1193Q channel.\n\n    A variety of drugs can unmask or induce phenotypes and arrhythmic manifestations of BrS, especially class IC drugs. Therefore, provocation test with sodium channel blockers has been recommended to the patients suspected of BrS but without a spontaneous type-1 Brugada ECG. The essential mechanism is mainly associated with BrS patients carried with \"loss of function\" mutation in SCN5A; sodium channel blockers would augment the gating defects of mutant SCN5A channel and predispose the patients to the phenotypes of BrS. Previously, we demonstrated that SCN5A mutation with a negative shift of SSI is more sensitive to sodium channel blocker; subsequently, reported that negative shift of SSI represented common biophysical mechanisms underlying the phenotypic overlap of LQT3 and BrS. In the present study, R1193Q channel exhibited comparable SSI with WT, suggesting that other mechanisms are plausible. While in the presence of clinical concentration of 2 mumol/L propafenone, it produced pronounced UDB, especially at high pacing frequency; and slower recovery from SSI, we speculate that R1193Q channel likely increases the affinity for propafenone despite it locates at the intracellular loop between DII and DIII far away from traditional binding site for sodium channel blocker. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that propafenone also caused a more negative shift of SSI and a slower recovery from inactivation in R1193Q versus WT. This scenario as well occurred in a compound SCN5A mutation V232I+L1308F which identified in a patient with BrS phenotype induced by lidocaine; UDB by lidocaine was more pronounced in V232I+L1308F versus WT despite similar gating properties at baseline, the authors proposed that the compound SCN5A mutation increased the affinity of the cardiac sodium channel for lidocaine. For mimicking the action potential duration of human cardiac myocytes, the protocol of depolarize to -10 mV for 400 ms was undertaken in the present study, which was different from other studies. Propafenone has been recognized as open and inactivated state sodium channel blocker, prolongation of depolarization would increase the binding of propafenone to the sodium channel. Although R1193Q presented tiny abnormalities of gating properties difference from WT in the baseline, our protocol augmented these abnormalities in the present of propafenone, especially at fast pacing frequency. In a word, the pro-arrhythmic effect of R1193Q channel may be conditional, strong environmental stressors are required for unmasking arrhythmic phenotypes of individuals with a common SCN5A variant R1193Q.\n\n    Several studies found that R1193Q can be identified in healthy control with diverse prevalence among ethnic groups. For example, reported that the allele frequency of R1193Q was 8% in Asians, 0.3% in white, and no R1193Q was found in black and Hispanic healthy individuals. More recently, investigated more than 4000 DNA samples and found that R1193Q was detected in most Asian populations, but was sporadically observed or absent in European and African populations. In the present study, the allele frequency of R1193Q was 6.7%. Overall, those studies support that R1193Q is a relatively common polymorphism in Asian populations, but rare in other ethnic populations. Given the intrinsic elevated affinity for sodium channel blocks in R1193Q, the individual harboring SCN5A R1193Q variant would be high risk of pro-arrhythmic after exposure to sodium channel blocks.\n\n    Pill-in-the-pocket administration of propafenone has been recommended for self-treatment of PAF patients. Although the patients had a tolerance of intravenous administration of flecainide or propafenone, 6% patients had major adverse events during PIP treatment in 11 months follow-up, including A-V block and sinus arrest, most of them occurred in the first oral treatment, suggesting that some patients were more sensitive to sodium channel blockers. The proposed underlying mechanism is associated with the pharmacokinetic properties of propafenone which maybe interact with other drugs. The present study provided compelling evidence that the individual harboring a R1193Q variant would be at pro-arrhythmic risk when PIP treatment. The high prevalence of AF is observed among the patients with BrS. It is well known that the patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic BrS should avoid the exposure to sodium channel blockers since the patients with BrS usually harbor a rare SCN5A mutation with \"loss of function.\" Here, our study brings this concept to the next level by showing enhanced sodium channel block in a common polymorphism R1193Q, thus raising a warning flag to use PIP treatment in patients with SCN5A R1193Q.\n\n    It has been recognized that a common polymorphism of SCN5A S1103Y is a risk factor for arrhythmia, which has 10% allelic frequency in African Americans. Functional studies revealed that it had tiny channel dysfunctions and impaired cardiac repolarization reserve. In general, it requires other environmental factor or \"double hit\" to cause arrhythmias. found that S1103Y cardiac sodium channel variant was associated with ICD events in blacks with heart failure (hazard ratio:4.33). Based on the functional characterization of SCN5A R1193Q in the present study, we propose that SCN5A R1193Q is a risk factor for arrhythmia in Asian populations despite without evidence of epidemiological study. More recently, reported that SCN5A R1193Q polymorphism was associated with appropriate ICD shock therapy in symptomatic BrS patients with ICD treatment (hazard ratio:10.56) that is consistent with our hypothesis.\n\n    The present study reported a single case and did not evaluate the prevalence of BrS in a large cohort of AF patients harboring SCN5A after PIP treatment, while our results provided an evidence of R1193Q enhanced the sensitivity to propafenone, further clinical and epidemiological studies are warranted.",

        "Title": "    Catheter ablation for ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients with channelopathies",
        "Abstract": "    Drug treatment and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation are the most widely accepted first-line therapies for channelopathic patients who have recurrent syncope, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or documented ventricular fibrillation (VF), or are survivors of cardiac arrest. In recent years, there have been significant advances in mapping techniques and ablation technology, coupled with better understanding of the mechanisms of ventricular tachyarrhythmia in channelopathies. Catheter ablation has provided important insights into the role of the Purkinje network and the right ventricular outflow tract in the initiation and perpetuation of VT/VF, and has evolved as a promising treatment modality for ventricular tachyarrhythmia even in channelopathies. When patients are exposed to a high risk of sudden cardiac death or deterioration of their quality of life due to episodes of tachycardia and frequent ICD discharges, catheter ablation may be an effective treatment option to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death and decrease the frequency of cardiac events. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of catheter ablation for VT/VF in patients with channelopathies including Brugada syndrome, idiopathic VF, long QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT.",
        "Introduction": "    A channelopathy (also termed a primary electrical disorder) is defined as an inherited syndrome caused by mutations in genes encoding for ion channels, their subunits, or their associated proteins. Drug therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation are generally used as first-line therapies for the treatment and prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in channelopathy patients. However, recent advances in mapping techniques and ablation technology allow us to perform ablation therapy more safely and effectively for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), even in channelopathies. A recent consensus report recommended that catheter ablation of VT or a triggering focus of VF should be considered as a class IIa indication in patients with VT/VF storm when adequate operator experience is available, although, presumably, this recommendation also includes VT/VF in patients with structural heart disease. According to the European Heart Rhythm Association Survey, catheter ablation for tachyarrhythmia is currently undertaken in 5-10% of recurrent cases with channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome (BrS) and long QT syndrome (LQTS). However, the long-term effectiveness of catheter ablation for VT/VF remains to be precisely elucidated as no randomized data on the effect of catheter ablation on arrhythmic events has been collected. In this article, we summarize the clinical reports on catheter ablation for the treatment of VT/VF in channelopathic patients in Table 1 and describe the current understanding of this field.\n\n    BrS is characterized by coved-type or saddleback-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads of the standard electrocardiogram (ECG) or high intercostal ECG. It is associated with an increased risk of SCD due to VF. Approximately 15-30% of BrS cases are attributed to mutations in SCN5A, and a further 10-20% of BrS cases are attributed to mutations in other genes. ICD implantation is recommended in patients with a diagnosis of BrS who are survivors of a cardiac arrest and/or have documented VF or spontaneous sustained VT with or without syncope. Isoproterenol and quinidine are also useful for the treatment of electrical storm in BrS patients. Experimental studies have shown that heterogeneous loss of the action potential dome occurs at the right ventricular (RV) epicardial sites, resulting in a marked dispersion of repolarization which underlies the development of local re-excitation via a mechanism termed phase 2 reentry in BrS. Phase 2 reentrant ventricular extrasystole can trigger polymorphic VT/VF. Therefore, the elimination of trigger ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) might suppress VT/VF.\n\n    Haissaguerre et al. reported the electrophysiological properties and effects of catheter ablation in three symptomatic patients with BrS, with one patient exhibiting a familial SCN5A deletion mutation (2850delT). Monomorphic VPCs originating from the RV outflow tract (RVOT) were observed in all patients, with monomorphic VPCs with left bundle-branch block (LBBB) and superior axis in one patient. RVOT triggers were eliminated by radiofrequency (RF) energy applications at the earliest site (25 and 40 ms before QRS onset), and VF inducibility was modified after ablation in two patients. In the third patient, RF energy application could ablate the VPCs originating from the anterior RV Purkinje network, thus rendered the VF non-inducible. During a mean follow-up period of 7+-6 months, there was no evidence of recurrence of syncope, VF, or SCD in any of the patients.\n\n    Nademanee et al. reported nine symptomatic patients with BrS who experienced VF and underwent electrophysiological study and catheter ablation. The patients exhibited abnormal epicardial electrograms characterized by fragmented electrograms with a relatively low voltage (<1 mV), prolonged duration, and fractionated late potentials exclusively localized over the anterior aspect of the RVOT epicardium. Catheter ablation over these abnormal areas at the epicardial sites of the anterior aspect of the RVOT rendered the VT/VF non-inducible in seven of nine patients (78%) and normalized the Brugada ECG pattern in eight patients (89%). After a mean follow-up of 20+-6 months, eight of nine patients (89%) had no recurrence of VF episodes, and there were no shocks from the ICD. Amiodarone was resumed at 100 mg daily in only one patient with VF recurrence after ablation, and there were no VT/VF recurrences up to 33 months after the ablation. Thus, RVOT was suggested to be an important target for catheter ablation, as an originating site of trigger VPCs and as an arrhythmogenic substrate of VF in BrS.\n\n    Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) is generally diagnosed by exclusion of apparent structural heart disease, identifiable genetic syndromes, and any other potential causes of VF. Thus, IVF may not strictly be categorized as a channelopathy. The gold standard treatment for either primary or secondary prevention of SCD is the insertion of an ICD. Recent progress in understanding the mechanism of IVF strongly suggests that the Purkinje network and the RVOT play a pivotal role in both the initiation and perpetuation of VF.\n\n    PVCs originating from the RVOT occasionally trigger VF although these are generally considered to be benign. Noda et al reported on 16 patients who showed spontaneous VF and/or polymorphic VTs initiated by VPCs arising from the RVOT. The optimal ablation site was determined by the earliest local activation site during the spontaneous target VPC and/or by pace mapping. Eventually, catheter ablation with a mean of 9+-4 RF energy applications was successful in 13 of 16 patients and partially successful in three patients. During programmed ventricular stimulation after ablation, nonsustained polymorphic VT was induced in two patients and VF in one patient who underwent ICD implantation. During a mean-follow-up period of 54+-39 months, there were no episodes of syncope, VF, or SCD (four patients received a beta-blocker).\n\n    The short-coupled variant of torsades de pointes (TdP) is defined as a syndrome in which VF is exhibited secondary to a short-coupled VPC (with coupling interval <300 ms) without obvious heart disease or QT prolongation. The VPCs triggering VF may arise from the Purkinje network rather than RVOT or the working myocardium. Haissaguerre et al summarized a cohort of 27 patients diagnosed as having IVF (without structural heart disease, QT prolongation, or a Brugada-like ECG) who underwent catheter ablation. In this study, VPCs originated from the Purkinje networks in 23 patients (LV septum in 10, anterior RV in nine, both in four), and from the RVOT in four patients, and the former had a shorter coupling interval initiating VF or polymorphic VT than the latter (280+-26 vs 355+-30 ms). The interval from the Purkinje potential to the following myocardial activation varied from 10 to 150 ms during premature beat but was 11+-5 ms during sinus rhythm. After ablation for VPCs, 24 patients (89%) without drug therapy had no VF recurrence during a 24+-28 months follow-up period.\n\n    The long-term prognosis of patients with IVF after catheter ablation was reported in a multicenter study. VPCs originated from the right (n=16), the left (n=14), or both (n=3) Purkinje systems, and from the myocardium (n=5) (including the RVOT [n=4]). After ablation, seven (18%) of the 38 patients (21 men, age 42+-13 years) experienced VF recurrence during a median post-procedural follow-up period of 63 months. Five of these seven patients underwent repeat ablation and had no subsequent recurrence of VF or documented VPCs for 28 months. The number of significant events (confirmed VF or aborted SCD) was reduced from 4 (interquartile range 3-9) before ablation to 0 (interquartile range 0-4) after ablation (p<0.01). Taken together, short-coupled VPCs triggering VF originate predominantly from the Purkinje system and the RVOT, and catheter ablation for the triggers is feasible and is associated with long-term freedom from VF recurrence in patients with IVF.\n\n    Early repolarization (ER) is characterized by elevation of the QRS-ST junction (J point) and QRS notching or slurring (J wave) in multiple leads, especially the inferior and/or left precordial leads. Although this finding has been considered to be a benign ECG manifestation, Haissaguerre et al reported that the ER pattern was found in 31% (64/206) of IVF patients compared to 5% (21/412) of matched control subjects. An ER pattern in the inferior or inferolateral leads has been reported to be associated with an increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias, termed ER syndrome. ER has also been reported to coexist with other arrhythmogenic disorders such as BrS, short QT syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; therefore, ER may be viewed as one of many arrhythmogenic factors that is rarely solely responsible for clinical events. Aizawa et al. first reported a patient with ER-like QRS notching and VF without any apparent cause, which were suppressed by catheter ablation for the VPCs triggering the VF. Recently, a case was reported of a patient with recurrent VF storm and inferoposterior ER in whom catheter ablation guided by pace mapping of the triggering VPCs successfully abolished the clinical event and caused the ER to disappear.\n\n    LQTS is characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization and susceptibility to syncope and SCD through VT (TdP), which can deteriorate into VF. A clinical diagnosis is made from a combination of clinical history, family history, and 12-lead ECG, which typically reveals a heart rate-corrected QT interval (QT interval divided by the square root of the RR interval in seconds=QTc) of greater than 0.46 s in women and 0.45 s in men.\n\n    LQTS is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and has been associated with mutations in 15 genes. Among these, more than 75% of the mutations in congenital LQTS were of the KCNQ1 (LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2), or SCN5A (LQT3) genes. beta-blocker therapy is associated with a 50% reduction in risk of cardiac events, and mexiletine is effective in LQT3 patients. ICD implantation is recommended for patients with resuscitated cardiac arrest/VF or recurrent syncope who are on beta-blockers.\n\n    Several studies have suggested that early afterdepolarizations arising from the Purkinje network and/or myocardial fibers are the primary triggering beats in TdP. For example, Haissaguerre et al. reported four symptomatic LQTS patients diagnosed on the basis of a corrected QT interval of > 460 ms who underwent catheter ablation. In one patient, VPCs originating from the RVOT were ablated by RF energy applications. In three patients, VPCs originated from the left Purkinje system and were eliminated by ablation at multiple sites. During a mean follow-up period of 24+-20 months, there was no recurrence of syncope, VF, or SCD in any patient, although one patient with LQTS was maintained on a beta-blocker, and another had a late recurrence of VPCs. The authors concluded that the triggers from the Purkinje network or the RVOT play a crucial role in initiating TdP or VF in LQTS, and these can be eliminated by focal ablation. Other groups also reported that VPCs originating from the RV free wall and RV inferoseptal wall could trigger VT/VF and could be eliminated by focal ablation.\n\n    Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by polymorphic VT induced by physical or emotional stress with no detectable morphological abnormalities in the heart. To date, five genes, cardiac ryanodine type 2 receptor (RYR2), calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), KCNJ2 (which encodes Kir2.1), calmodulin 1 (CALM1), and triadin (TRDN), have been identified as being involved in CPVT. Typical arrhythmias include bidirectional VT and polymorphic VT that can degenerate into VF and thus SCD. beta-blockers and additional administration of flecainide or verapamil have been reported to be effective for the prevention of VT/VF. An ICD is considered the definitive therapy for the prevention of SCD, although failure of the ICD to prevent SCD has been reported in several cases because the ICD shock delivery might lead to catecholamine release, resulting in an electric storm.\n\n    Cerrone et al. reported that the mechanism of CPVT was due to delayed afterdepolarization-induced triggered activity in a focal Purkinje network in a knock-in (RyR2) mouse. In addition, chemical ablation of the RV endocardial cavity with Lugol s solution, which selectively destroys the Purkinje network, could convert bidirectional VT into monomorphic VT in a CPVT model of anesthetized mice. Therefore, the Purkinje network is considered to be a critical contributor to arrhythmogenic triggers in CPVT and may be a promising therapeutic target for catheter ablation.\n\n    Our group presented the first case report of the successful catheter ablation of bidirectional VPCs triggering VF in patients with CPVT. This case was of a 38-year-old woman who had often experienced syncope since childhood. The patient s daughter also had similar episodes of syncope and developed VF during treadmill exercise testing, which was successfully defibrillated with an electric shock. Witnessing this situation, the patient also lost consciousness, with documented VF which was converted to sinus rhythm by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. There were no significant abnormalities in her resting 12-lead ECG, echocardiography, or coronary angiography. Genetic analysis revealed that she and her daughter had same missense mutation (c.1259 G>A, p.R420Q) in RyR2, and both were diagnosed as having CPVT.\n\n    During the patient s epinephrine stress test (Fig. 1), multifocal VPCs (VPC #1, RBBB, and superior axis; VPC #2, RBBB, and inferior axis, the same VPC configuration as that induced during the treadmill exercise testing; and VPC #3, LBBB, and inferior axis) appeared, and VPC #1 following VPC #2 subsequently induced VF. We performed catheter ablation targeting the catecholamine-induced VPCs (Fig. 2). VPC #1 was recorded at the left ventricular inferoseptal area near the posteromedial papillary muscle, where a presystolic Purkinje potential preceded VPC #1 by 18 ms. RF energy application to this site accelerated the VPCs, and additional applications around the target site subsequently eliminated VPC #1. After the procedure, VPC #2 continued to occur, and a local bipolar electrogram recorded on the left coronary cusp showed a discrete prepotential that preceded the onset of VPC #2 by 65 ms. RF energy application to the left coronary cusp abolished VPC #2. After ablation at both sites, neither the VPCs nor VF was inducible, even with an infusion of epinephrine at up to 1.2 g/kg per min. The patient underwent ICD implantation and was discharged from the hospital on bisoprolol. During a 16-month follow-up after ablation, no episodes of syncope or ICD therapy occurred. Thus, catheter ablation of the bidirectional VPCs triggering VF may become an adjunctive therapeutic option for CPVT.\n\n    In addition to ventricular tachyarrhythmia, patients with CPVT are likely to be complicated with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Typically, the onset of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia is observed at lower heart rates than ventricular arrhythmia in patients with CPVT. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia may be a precursor to VT and may be a cause of frequent and inappropriate shocks from an ICD associated with SVT with a rapid ventricular response. Therefore, catheter ablation targeting SVT may be effective in reducing the number of cardiac events in patients with CPVT.",

        "Conclusion": "    VT/VF in patients with channelopathies can be suppressed by elimination of the triggered VPCs originating from the Purkinje network and/or around the RVOT, and/or by substrate modification of possible re-entry circuits. Further studies are required to evaluate the precise mechanisms and long-term prognosis of channelopathies.",

        "Abstract": "    To describe experience of long QT (LQT) molecular autopsy in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\n    Descriptive audit from two distinct periods: (1) A prospective, population-based series between 2006 and 2008 ('unselected').

Rare genetic variants were commoner within the selected than unselected populations (5 of 31 infants (16%) vs 3 of 71 infants (4%) p < 0.05). In the selected population two infants had variants of definite or probable pathogenicity (KCNQ1, E146K; KCNH2, R1047L), two had novel variants of possible pathogenicity in SCN5A (I795F, F1522Y) and one had R1193Q in SCN5A, of doubtful pathogenicity. R1193Q was also the only variant in the three cases from the unselected population and occurred as a second variant with R1047L. Engaging families proved challenging. Only 3 of 8 (38%) variant-positive cases and 18 of 94 (19%) of variant-negative families participated in cardiac/genetic screening.\n\n    LQT molecular autopsy has a very low diagnostic yield among unselected SIDS cases where risk factors are common.

Engagement of the family prior to genetic testing is essential to counsel for the possible uncertainty of the results and to permit family genotype-phenotype cosegregation studies.",
        "Introduction": "    Some cases of SIDS are due to long QT syndrome and other cardiac ion channelopathies, and the genes most commonly implicated are SCN5A and KCNH2. However, genetic variants in both, particularly SCN5A, are common in the normal population\n\n    SIDS affects disproportionate numbers of those with adverse social circumstances\n\n    In a prospective, unselected, population based cohort of SIDS from mainly adverse social circumstances and high incidence of co-sleeping, genetic testing added no diagnostic value\n\n    Case selection can lead to an increased diagnostic yield of over 10%\n\n    Since genetic variants are frequently novel, engagement with the family prior to testing is essential to counsel them for this uncertainty and to permit family phenotype/genotype cosegregation studies\n\n    Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) accounts for 8% of postneonatal deaths and 0.5 deaths per 1000 live births in the USA and 13% and 0.7 per 1000, respectively, in New Zealand.\n\n    Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a group of inherited cardiac ion channelopathies, with 13 known genotypes, which predispose to sudden death due to ventricular tachycardia. Molecular genetic testing has now demonstrated variants in genes associated with LQTS in over 10% of SIDS cases. LQTS type 3 (linked to the SCN5A gene) predominates but types 1, 2, 6, 9 and 12 have also been described.\n\n    Testing for LQTS genes for SIDS is not yet part of standard practise, and it is not known if genetic testing should for example be restricted to 'pure' (type 1A) SIDS  or whether it may have a role in infants exposed to a potential arrhythmic trigger. For example, fatal arrhythmias can be caused by adrenergic stress in LQTS and fever in Brugada syndrome, a condition also linked to SCN5A. Co-sleeping (indicating type II SIDS) might cause stress and overheating. The role of racial origin is to be evaluated, and it is also not known if adding family cardiac screening will increase diagnostic yield, such as it does with sudden death investigation in the 1-40 age group.\n\n    New Zealand (population 4.43 million) has an established national young sudden death registry and investigative programme, with national ethics committee approval.  We wished to examine the value of the long QT molecular autopsy in our population, with the addition of family cardiac investigation, and to see how these results compared with those from sudden unexplained deaths in 1 to 40-year-olds.",
        "Methods": "    Data are presented from two distinct periods. The first period (the prospective study or 'unselected' period), 1 September 2006-31 August 2008, was a 2-year prospective population-based series where testing incurred no cost and referrals were not filtered.\n\n    The second period was from before and after the prospective study period when Cardiac Inherited Disease Group (New Zealand) (CIDG) investigated some SIDS cases on an ad hoc basis, with referrals from a variety of sources. The police report and full autopsy report was reviewed by the cardiac genetic team and accepted for testing if there was felt to be an increased likelihood of arrhythmic death.\n\n    Cases were subdivided into three categories according to Krous et al SIDS IA, IB and II, on consensus review of autopsy and police reports by the first author and two senior forensic pathologists (PLM, SRS). IA comprises infants between 21 days and 9 months old with a normal clinical history, term delivery, normal growth and development, no similar previous deaths in the family, a negative scene examination, safe sleep environment and exclusion of an accidental or intentional death. Lethal pathological findings should be absent and there must be a comprehensive post-mortem examination including ancillary studies such as toxicology, microbiology, radiology, vitreous biochemistry and metabolic studies. The SIDS IB category differs from IA by the lack of one of these investigations. The SIDS category II includes deaths outside the SIDS I age range (21 days-9 months) and cases where accidental asphyxia could not be excluded.\n\n    This work began in 2000. Before September 2006, blood or tissue for DNA extraction was taken at the discretion of the pathologist. Archived blood on a neonatal screening card was used as a source of DNA when no other sample was available, including cases where death occurred before CIDG existed.\n\n    After September 2006, a suitable sample was obtained at the autopsy. Cardiac genetic investigation commenced once ancillary tests were completed and were negative.\n\n    After September 2006, contact was made with the next of kin by a standard letter, followed by a phone call from either the coordinator or a designated clinician. If contact was successful and the family wished to engage in the process, the family was invited to a local cardiology clinic, full clinical and family history obtained and ECGs taken from parents and siblings. All results were reviewed by a central expert committee.\n\n    Sequencing of the LQTS genes 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 was performed in all and 7 in some, dependent on the laboratory. Three clinically accredited laboratories were involved at various times (LabPlus Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand; Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Norway; and Statens Serum Institut, Denmark). DNA was amplified using exon-specific primers and the subsequent amplicons were subjected to bidirectional capillary-based di-deoxy sequencing as previously described. Variants were categorised into one of three types regarding level of certainty of pathogenicity using combined evidence from previous reports, in vitro evidence and in silico evaluations into: 1:definite or probable, 2:possible or 3:high level of uncertainty.",
        "Results": "    DNA was initially stored on 248 cases of sudden unexpected death in infancy. Year of death ranged from 1983 to 2012. The cause of death was SIDS in 146, 103 of which were referred for LQTS gene screening and family investigation. In one of these, DNA quality was too poor to test, leaving 102 cases.\n\n    Maori 49 (47%), Pacific island 24 (23%), 24 New Zealand European (23%), 5 Asian infants (5%) and 3 others. In the general population, New Zealand Europeans represent 68%, Maori 15% and Pacific islanders 7%, respectively.\n\n    SIDS IA category criteria were met in only 10% of cases, SIDS IB in 55% and SIDS II in 35%. Bed sharing was reported in 49% and major adverse social factors in 13%.\n\n    Age was from 4 days to 1 year (median 3 months); 80% of deaths occurred between 21 days and 9 months; 49% were male; 88% of infants died during sleep and six (6%) died while awake. In six cases activity at death was not stated.\n\n    Five rare missense variants in LQTS genes were found in 8 of the 102 infants (8%), 3 of 71 (4%) from the prospective study period 2006-2008 (unselected cases) and 5 of 31 (16%) from outside the prospective study period (selected cases) (p<0.05) (see tables 1 and 2).\n\n    Rare variants were identified in the SCN5A (LQT3) gene in seven infants and in the KCNQ1 (LQT1) and KCNH2 (LQT2) genes in one infant each. One infant had two variants. In silico analyses of each are presented in table 3.\n\n    No variants of likely pathogenicity were found. Three cases had R1193Q in SCN5A, of doubtful significance (discussed below). None of these families could be screened because they declined or repeatedly did not attend scheduled appointments.\n\n    A missense variant E146K in KCNQ1 was found in Case 7. E146K is described as pathogenic and associated with the LQTS. This infant was not the proband. A sibling died at 2 years of age after a history of seizures and blackouts, 6 years after Case 7 died. The sibling was found to carry E146K and subsequent point mutation analysis on case 7s neonatal screening card was positive. E146K is present in a parent and three siblings although none have definitive QT interval prolongation.\n\n    Case 5 exhibited seizures before becoming unresponsive carried two variants, R1047L in KCNH2 and R1193Q in SCN5A (see below). R1047L was initially described as a polymorphism, but is present more often in subjects with Torsades-de-Pointes than in controls during metabolic stress. The family could not be contacted.\n\n    Case 2, of Pacific island ancestry, was found deceased, in a co-sleeping environment. Genetic testing revealed the previously unreported I759F in the SCN5A gene. Efforts failed to contact the family. Case 8 was <1 month New Zealand European who suffered a cardiac arrest on day one of life while feeding, resulting in severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy and death. An ECG showed a prolonged QTc interval (0.49 msec) but it was taken early postarrest with encephalopathy which might explain the finding. The previously unreported F1522Y was found in the SCN5A gene.\n\n    A previously documented single nucleotide polymorphism, H558R in exon 12 of the SCN5A gene was also found, in case 8. This variant may modify the functional phenotype of mutations elsewhere in the gene.  The family engaged with screening, all were asymptomatic. One parent carried the F1522Y variant and the other carried the H558R variant. All siblings carried both variants. All ECGs demonstrated normal QT intervals and an Ajmaline test (for Brugada syndrome) performed on the parent with the F1522Y variant was negative.\n\n    Cases 1 and 5 carried the R1193Q variant in SCN5A. It has been reported in association with LQTS and Brugada syndrome  and is present in 0.3% of the Caucasian population. However, it is also a documented polymorphism that is common (8-10%) in the Asian/Han Chinese population. Case 1 had Asian ancestry but the others, including those from the prospective study period, were Pacific Island, Asian and Maori (two cases). ECG screening was only possible in the family of Case 1 and was normal.\n\n    Despite extensive efforts, only three families of the eight variant-positive cases (38% described above) and 18 families of the 94 variant-negative SIDS cases (19%) could be screened, with only one family with QT prolongation. The reasons for failed screening were multiple but included 32 cases where the family did not wish to engage or did not reply to messages or attend appointments.\n\n    One family with uninformative genetic testing had family members with LQTS by clinical criteria (outside the prospective study period). A Maori infant died suddenly during feeding. A subsequent 'near-miss' SIDS episode occurred in another sibling who was noted to have a prolonged QT interval, as did a brother and parent. Affected individuals are treated with beta-blockers.",
        "Conclusion": "    While we have adopted the molecular autopsy in sudden unexplained death in the 1-40- year age group, we now use it sparingly in infants. A prerequisite for testing now is that the family can be contacted and is willing to participate in full cardiac and genetic evaluation. The family must accept the potential implications and uncertainties of genetic testing. Factors which make us more inclined to offer testing are (1) A family history of previous sudden deaths, syncope, seizures or proven cardiac arrhythmias. (2) Absence of known risk factors, particularly bed sharing with possible overlaying. (3) Sudden collapse while awake. (4) The autopsy and report excluding a recognisable cause of death is extensive and of high quality.\n\n    Contributors: JMG wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

        "Discussion": "    Some authors recommend routine screening of LQTS genes in SIDS, whereas some advocate a more cautionary approach.  Recent expert guidelines from an international consortium of heart rhythm groups state that an arrhythmia focused molecular autopsy can be useful in all victims of sudden unexplained death in infancy. Our experience, a diagnostic rate of effectively zero in the prospective (unselected) series, and poor engagement by families, means in the New Zealand setting there is no logic in routine screening. The two cases with diagnostic/protective value for family members had a positive family history and one of these was diagnosed with family ECGs alone. The results are in dramatic contrast to our experience of the investigation of sudden death in 1 to 40-year-olds, where the family engagement was over 70%, and an inherited cardiac diagnosis was achieved in 30%.\n\n    A previous large population-based study of SIDS from Norway had a higher rate of LQTS genetic variants than here (12.9% with 9.5% defined as pathogenic), mostly long QT 2 (KCNH2) and 3 (SCN5A). The Norwegian study presented in vitro evidence to support pathogenicity of the variants (but no familial evaluation). Rare variants in SCN5A occur in 3.7% of the normal Caucasian population, 5.6% of Black Americans and 2.7% of Hispanics and in vitro evidence does not amount to in vivo proof; many common polymorphisms have abnormal in vitro electrophysiology.\n\n    The lower rate detected here may relate to racial, social and environmental influences, but it may come down primarily to the type of SIDS. We only encountered 10% with type IA SIDS; The Norwegian study stated that only 30% were 'borderline' cases. Thus 70% may be broadly equivalent to type IA/1B described here.\n\n    Significantly more variants were found in the present series when the population tested was selected by the cardiac genetic group (16% vs 4%). It is noteworthy that a case with a clear history collapse while awake was one of two with a relatively unequivocal mutation.\n\n    The interpretation of the identified genetic changes proved difficult in the majority of cases. The use of in silico analysis to ascertain pathogenicity was non-contributory, with bioinformatic packages contradicting each other, as experienced by others. The finding of the variant R1193Q in five infants caused particular confusion. At the start of this series, this was believed to be a pathogenic mutation, but over time other studies had shown it to be a common polymorphism in Asians. As noted by Tester and Ackerman, researching prevalence of polymorphisms among different populations is essential to permit meaningful interpretation of genetic results.\n\n    The interpretation of novel variants is helped by correlating the genotype with the phenotype. Absence of a rare variant in both parents would suggest a malignant de novo mutation occurred in the infant, and if present in family members, correlation with ECG findings is valuable. However, many families were difficult to engage, demonstrating a reluctance to attend appointments or a mistrust of the system. It will be interesting to observe whether other countries with high prevalence of social deprivation (unlike Norway) have the same experience. This is the population at most risk of SIDS.\n\n    The risk of infant death increases with co-sleeping.  Consensus recommendations now promote a broader definition of a safe-sleep environment than just avoiding prone sleeping. This message still appears to require active dissemination, particularly to ethnic groups in which adult-infant bed sharing is the norm, such as Pacific peoples.\n\n    Our discovery of a kindred with LQTS based on prolongation of the QT interval, but lacking a demonstrable variant, reinforces the point that gene sequencing should not be a stand-alone test in those with a suggestive clinical history. Sequencing detects variants in only 70%-75% of individuals with definite LQTS.\n\n    This study applied a sequence-based analysis of LQTS genes for types 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. It did not include gene dosage testing, nor screening other LQTS genes (eg, Ankyrin B, CACNA1C, CAV3, SCN4B, AKAP9 and SNTA1) and other cardiac channelopathies linked to sudden infant deaths (eg, RYR2, NOS1AP and GPD1-L). Further, we acknowledge that some of the variants found (such as R1193Q) might exert influence alongside variants from other genes not tested for.\n\n    CIDG has a single part-time co-ordinator who covers the whole of New Zealand. A better-resourced service might have led to higher rates of engagement by families, particularly those with poor social circumstances and those with cultural mistrust of health services, among whom Maori and Pacific Islanders tend to be over-represented.\n\n    In a clinical service, we have reported that the quality of post-mortem investigation is variable. We cannot tell if New Zealand is better or worse than other countries in this respect, since no other similar reports are available. Improvements are needed in process, reporting and more consistency in following the recommended best practise guidelines.\n\n    Maori and Polynesians are over-represented in the SIDS cohort. This may limit the degree to which the findings here may be extrapolated to some other countries.",

        "Title": "    Bacteria: A novel source for potent mosquito feeding-deterrents",
        "Abstract": "    This study provides evidence that insect-killing bacteria produce fabclavines that can be used to deter mosquito feeding.\n\n    Antibiotic and insecticidal bioactivities of the extracellular secondary metabolites produced by entomopathogenic bacteria belonging to genus Xenorhabdus have been identified; however, their novel applications such as mosquito feeding-deterrence have not been reported. Here, we show that a mixture of compounds isolated from Xenorhabdus budapestensis in vitro cultures exhibits potent feeding-deterrent activity against three deadly mosquito vectors: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex pipiens. We demonstrate that the deterrent active fraction isolated from replicate bacterial cultures is highly enriched in two compounds consistent with the previously described fabclavines, strongly suggesting that these are the molecular species responsible for feeding-deterrence. The mosquito feeding-deterrent activity in the putative fabclavine-rich fraction is comparable to or better than that of N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (also known as DEET) or picaridin in side-by-side assays. These findings lay the groundwork for research into biologically derived, peptide-based, low-molecular weight compounds isolated from bacteria for exploitation as mosquito repellents and feeding-deterrents.",
        "Introduction": "    Secondary or specialized metabolites are a chemically diverse group of organic compounds produced by some microbes, plants, and animals. Generally considered nonessential for growth and development, secondary metabolites play other roles such as conferring protection against varied environmental risks. Many secondary metabolites of microbial or plant origin have been exploited for myriad applications in the pharmaceutical industry, including antibiotics, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunosuppressants, and other medicines. Secondary metabolites produced by Xenorhabdus, a group of bacteria that symbiotically associate with entomopathogenic nematodes, exhibit a range of antibiotic, antifungal, and insecticidal activities.\n\n    Genome studies suggest that there is an enormous range of chemical diversity and bioactivity that still remains to be explored and may lead to the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. In Xenorhabdus, genome mining has uncovered gene clusters predicted to participate in the synthesis of several compounds of unknown biological functions. The products encoded by these gene clusters exhibit diverse and structurally complex chemistries. One example produced by Xenorhabdus budapestensis (Xbu) is a unique class of hybrid compounds called fabclavines. These compounds were shown to exhibit a broad range of bioactivities, including antibiotic and insecticidal activities. Uniquely, culture supernatants of two insect-killing bacteria, Xenorhabdus nematophila and Photorhabdus luminescens, also deterred feeding of ants, crickets, and wasps. However, the bioactive compounds responsible for feeding-deterrence in those studies were not identified. Together, these studies suggested that secondary metabolites produced by Xenorhabdus might act as mosquito feeding- deterrents.\n\n    Repellents (topical and area) can provide protection from mosquito (and other blood-feeding insects) bites and thus from the disease agents that they transmit while feeding. Mosquitoes transmit pathogens that cause devastating human diseases, including dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile, and Zika viral infections, that continue to affect millions of people worldwide. Limiting the impact of mosquito-borne diseases is an important goal for global public health agencies, and the use of mosquito repellents is one important tactic. Among U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-registered topical insect repellents, a majority of more than 500 products contain the active ingredient N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (also known as DEET; www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/skin-applied-repellent-ingredients), which is the most widely used and effective repellent against mosquitoes and other disease vectors. Other commercially successful insect repellents include IR3535 [insect repellent 3535, ethyl butylacetylaminoproprionate (EBAAP), a derivative of beta-alanine ], (p)icaridin (and other piperidine derivatives), and para-menthane-3,8-diol (distilled from Eucalyptus citriodora). Historically, research into biologically derived DEET alternatives has primarily focused on plant metabolites. Despite the exploitation of many genera for pharmaceutical exploration, bacteria have thus far remained unexplored in the search for insect repellent chemistries.\n\n    In a screen for repellent activities produced by Xenorhabdus, we observed that Xbu extracts deterred adult female Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex mosquitoes from feeding on an artificial diet in in vitro feeding experiments. The compounds exhibiting feeding-deterrent activity from bacterial cultures were concentrated via a three-step procedure, including reversed-phase chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). In addition to other molecules, the feeding-deterrent active fraction consistently contained two highly abundant molecular species that we provisionally identify as members of the previously described class of molecules called fabclavines. Here, we present data on the enrichment and characterization of mosquito feeding-deterrent activity produced by Xenorhabdus and present evidence that fabclavines may be potent mosquito feeding-deterrents. Our discovery adds bacteria as a notable, potential source of novel mosquito feeding-deterrents and lays the groundwork for future exploration of bacterially derived secondary metabolites as feeding-deterrents for other pest insects.",
        "Methods": "    No live animals or human subjects were used in mosquito-deterrent screening assays in this study.\n\n    Colonies of A. aegypti (Liverpool strain), A. gambiae (G3), and C. pipiens (Iowa strain) were maintained at the University of Wisconsin according to standard procedures reported previously. Briefly, mosquito colonies were maintained at 26.5 +- 0.5 C and 80 +- 5% relative humidity. Larvae were fed TetraMin fish food. Adult mosquitoes were maintained on a constant exposure to 10% sucrose presented through cotton balls. For egg production, adult female mosquitoes were offered defibrinated rabbit blood (HemoStat Laboratories, CA, USA) via Hemotek membrane feeding system (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, UK) described below. Edible collagen casing membrane (Nippi Edible Collagen Casing, ViskoTeepak, WI, USA) was selected as a membrane of choice for blood feeding and feeding-deterrent screening, as all three species of mosquitoes fed readily through it. For feeding-deterrent screening assays, 20 nulliparous, mated, 7- to 10-day-old adult female mosquitoes, hatched from the same batch of eggs, were separated in screened paper containers (height x width = 8.2 cm x 8.5 cm; Neptune Paper Products, NJ, USA). Separated mosquitoes were starved for 12 to 16 hours before the screening assays.\n\n    Mosquitoes were exposed to Xbu feeding-deterrent compounds or test repellents for 30 min at room temperature (incandescent light, 25 to 26 C) between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (U.S. Central Time) using a modified membrane-feeding apparatus described in Fig. 1.\n\n    Briefly, the Hemotek temperature controller was set to a constant temperature of 37 C 5 to 10 min ahead of the assay. A 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm piece of a fresh, pre-cut, and thoroughly water-washed collagen casing membrane was secured to the metal feeder using an O-ring. Approximately 2.5 ml of the cocktail diet containing 2% (v/v) red food dye (McCormick & Company Inc., MD, USA) was introduced from the opening at the back of the metal feeder. A cotton cloth was placed on top of the collagen casing and secured by rubber bands. Test compound or water was then applied by immersing the feeder assembly in 1 ml of the respective test solution, and the metal feeder assembly was then secured to the feeder housing and exposed to mosquitoes housed in a screened container. Several types of cloth materials varying in thickness and texture/thread count were evaluated with an objective of finding the one that provided optimal mosquito feeding success. Eventually, a double-layer cotton cloth obtained from JOANN Fabrics (Madison, WI) was used with A. aegypti. The features and dimensions of the chosen cotton cloth were as follows: thread count = 14.9 x 17.0 threads in 1 cm2 (average of 10 measurements), diameter of the circular cloth applied to metal feeder = 3.67 cm (see Fig. 1A), and total area of the circular cloth area exposed to mosquitoes = ~10.57 cm2. However, for A. gambiae and C. pipiens, one layer of muslin cloth (thread count = 24.3 x 33.9 threads in 1 cm2; average of 10 measurements) was used, as this cloth worked well with these mosquitoes. Both types of cloth materials are shown in fig. S8.\n\n    Because the Xbu compounds were dissolved in water for testing, DEET and picaridin were also prepared in 0.2-mum filtered double-distilled water. DEET was diluted from SC Johnson's OFF! Deep Woods containing 25% DEET and picaridin from Clean Insect Repellent (purchased from Walgreens, USA) containing 7% picaridin. One percent stock solutions of DEET and picaridin (equivalent to 10 mg/ml) were dissolved in water from which a range of dilutions was prepared for determination of feeding-deterrence dose. Both of these repellents were tested at a concentration range of 1 to 0.01% (v/v) corresponding to 0.95 to 0.0095 mg/cm2. Both compounds dissolved well in water at the tested concentrations. DEET and picaridin were tested on the same day with a 4-hour gap in between tests. The HPLC-separated, lyophilized bacterial sample was dissolved in water and filtered through a 0.2-mum filter. For an accurate assessment, protein content in this sample was determined via two methods: (i) bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and (ii) total amino acid analysis (Molecular Structure Facility, University of California, Davis, CA). The difference in protein content determined by these two methods was negligible. Thus, for routine measurements, the BCA method was used. A dosage range from 0.73 to 0.048 mg/ml (v/v) corresponding to 69.5 to 4.57 mug/cm2 of the mosquito feeding-deterrent active compounds was tested with A. aegypti. Testing with A. gambiae and C. pipiens was done only with one concentration of Xbu compounds that yielded a feeding-deterrence dose of 90% with A. aegypti [i.e., 0.060% (v/v), corresponding to 0.057 mg/cm2; Table 1]. Three replicate feeding experiments were conducted for each compound with mosquitoes hatched from different egg batches (to account for cohort bias) over a period of 3 weeks. One replicate consisted of 20 mosquitoes tested on the same day with each concentration of the dilution range. For example, one replication of samples with a concentration range of 69.5 to 4.57 mug/cm2 was tested on the same day. Extensive washing of the metal feeders, replenishing of collagen membrane, cotton cloths, and feeding solution for each exposure test and time gaps between assays assured that there was no carryover of the compounds or contamination of the feeders in between assays. As an extra precaution, feeding-deterrence assays with bacterial compounds were purposely performed on a different day than assays with DEET and picaridin. After the completion of the screening assay (30 min), mosquitoes were killed by freezing at -20 C. Fed versus unfed mosquitoes were counted under a dissecting microscope and verified by at least two people. Fed mosquitoes could be easily distinguished as they were engorged and had red abdomens, which were clearly visible even to an unaided eye (fully fed or partially fed), while unfed mosquitos were lean and did not have red abdomens. Mosquitoes that were not engorged and had no red color were considered as unfed and hence deterred (Figs. 1C and 2B). This distinction provided a reliable, quantitative means of assessing the feeding success of mosquitoes with different compounds and across assays and allowed a robust comparison. Count data (proportion of unfed mosquitoes from a total) were used for statistical analysis. Several tests with Xbu Peak#3 from different batches exhibited consistent, concentration-dependent feeding-deterrent activity. Here, results of three replications are presented. Figures 1B and 2A and Tables 1 and 2 present results of all of the feeding-deterrence screening experiments.\n\n    Xbu bacteria obtained from H. Goodrich-Blair (Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA) were maintained as glycerol stocks at -80 C. For culturing, the bacteria were freshly streaked onto nutrient bromothymol blue triphenyltetrazolium chloride agar (NBTA) plates. A single, isolated blue colony (image of bacteria streaked on LB plate is seen in fig. S9) was taken for further growth in modified minimal medium containing 0.05 M Na2HPO4, 0.05 M KH2PO4, 0.02 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.001 M MgSO4, 0.25% yeast extract, and 0.1 M glucose supplemented with 1% yeast extract. A single bacterial colony was resuspended in 1.5-ml medium from which 200 mul was inoculated in a flask containing 400-ml medium. Bacterial cultures (typically six flasks of 400 ml) were grown at 30 C at 120 rpm in a rotary shaker to stationary phase and harvested at 72 hours after inoculation via centrifugation (3913g, Beckman rotor JA14 at 4 C).\n\n    The chilled cell-free culture supernatant was mixed with two volumes of ice-cold acetone and incubated cold for 12 to 16 hours while stirring. After precipitation, spent medium/acetone was discarded and precipitates containing the mosquito feeding-deterrent active compounds were dissolved in ultrapure water so as to concentrate these to about 10x of the original culture volume (i.e., 240 ml of water). This solution was first centrifuged at 3578g at 4 C (Beckman rotor JA20) and then filtered through 0.45-mum filter and loaded on a C18 flash reversed-phase column (Reveleris Flash Cartridge, 12 g, BUCHI Corporation, DE, USA) using a peristaltic pump. The column was then connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC; Akta Prime Plus, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, PA, USA). Solvents for reversed-phase columns were (i) 0.2-mum filtered double-distilled water and (ii) HPLC-grade, 0.2-mum filtered ACN (Fisher Scientific, USA). Both solvents contained 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).\n\n    An ACN gradient of 50 to 100% was used to collect the mosquito feeding-deterrent active peak fraction on C18 flash column via FPLC. The elution pattern of the mosquito feeding-deterrent active peak was consistent and reproducible between different batches of cultures/purifications. Representative results of this step are shown in fig. S1. The active fraction from the C18 flash chromatography was filtered through a 5-kDa molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration device (Sartorius, Fisher Scientific, USA), and the flow through was subjected to further purification using HPLC on an analytical reversed-phase C18 column [Vydac C18 (5 mum, 4.6 mm inside diameter x 150 mm), catalog no. 218TP5415, Fisher Scientific, USA]. A gradient of 13 to 40% ACN over 40 min yielded four major peaks detectable at 214 nm, with most of the repellent activity concentrated in Peak#3, which eluted at an ACN concentration of ~24% and a retention time of ~14:00 min. Representative images of HPLC C18 purification are shown in fig. S2, with mosquito feeding-deterrent active Xbu Peak#3 indicated. Other peaks (except peak number 4) had no feeding-deterrent activity (fig. S3). Several HPLC runs were conducted to generate material for feeding-deterrent activity analysis.\n\n    MS was performed in the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. MALDI-TOF spectra of the active, C18 flash chromatography fraction and the subsequent HPLC-separated active fractions were acquired on a SCIEX 4800 TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (SCIEX, MA, USA). Samples (0.5 mul) were spotted onto a 384-well Opti-TOF insert and 0.5-mul alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fluka, Switzerland) at 6 mg/ml in 75% ACN, 0.1% TFA was added, and the sample and matrix were mixed on a plate shaker. The spot was air-dried, and data were acquired in positive ion reflector mode over the m/z range of 700 to 4000 using a laser intensity of 2800 and averaging 1000 shots per spectrum. Mass assignment was performed using external calibration, with calibration taking place immediately before data collection. Electrospray MS and MS/MS were performed using unassisted nanospray by loading the mosquito feeding-deterrent active fraction into pulled, coated borosilicate tips (New Objective, MA, USA) and acquiring positive ion, profile mode spectra on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA). MS and MS/MS data were collected in the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolving power setting of 120,000. MS data were acquired over the m/z range of 150 to 1800, while HCD MS/MS data were collected from m/z 100 to 1500 and CID MS/MS spectra were collected from m/z 180 to 1500. CID and HCD fragmentations used 35% normalized collision energy.\n\n    To estimate feeding-deterrence dose, we used Probit analysis on the log10-transformed feeding counts data using Statistical Analysis Software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA). The feeding response variable obtained from mosquito counts data followed a binomial rather than a normal distribution. For this kind of nonnormal dataset, a generalized linear model (GLM) is appropriate. The Probit model is one kind of GLM that is used for analyses related to a dose-dependent variable. Data were log10-transformed because of the wide range of concentration values (0.01 to 1) investigated. Feeding-deterrent activity (Tables 1 and 2) was expressed as a dose (in mg/cm2) of the compound (bacterial or DEET or picaridin) applied to cloth that resulted in a 50 or 90% inhibition in mosquito feeding rate similarly as described previously. Relative efficacy (RE90) of the deterrent activity was derived by dividing a dose that results in 90% feeding-deterrence of DEET to that of the picaridin and Xbu Peak#3, respectively. Least-squares estimation was conducted to compare differences among feeding-deterrent activity between the three compounds based on adjusted P values (Table 2). P values in Fig. 2 were calculated using Fisher's exact test using Stata statistical software (Stata Statistical Software: Release 15, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).",
        "Results": "    In the context of insect repellents, a deterrent is defined as \"something that inhibits feeding or oviposition when present in a place where the insect would, in its absence, feed, rest or oviposit\". Here, we define compounds produced by Xbu as mosquito feeding-deterrents because, in the presence of Xbu compounds, female mosquitoes failed to feed on the food source described in this section.\n\n    Among methodologies to evaluate mosquito deterrents/repellents, in vitro assays offer important advantages. Because of the risk associated with accidental exposure to infectious agents during standard arm-in-cage assays, and because of inconsistency in results among test subjects due to varying mosquito attraction to human subjects, researchers have developed artificial feeding systems. Blood is contained in a warming chamber and accessed by adult female mosquitoes through a natural or artificial membrane. Membrane feeders provide flexible systems that can be modified in terms of feeding solutions, membrane types, and solution temperature. These systems eliminate the need to expose animals or human volunteers, an especially important consideration when the compounds in the initial screening phases are of unknown toxicological or dermatological properties. Thus, we chose to modify our existing Hemotek membrane feeding system (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, UK) to screen feeding-deterrent compounds produced by Xbu bacteria. The main features of this system (Fig. 1) included (i) easy setup, (ii) minimal laboratory space requirements, (iii) a thermostat-regulated temperature source that eliminates the need for a water heater and circulation pump, and (iv) capacity for up to five screening assays at a time. The modifications used for the final bioassays included introduction of a loosely woven cotton cloth for application of the feeding-deterrent compounds, a collagen membrane, and use of a cocktail diet containing a red food dye instead of blood.\n\n    We first tested this system with positive [DEET or picaridin at 0.95 mg/cm2 in water; equivalent to 1.0% (v/v)] and negative (water) controls applied to cloth covering the membrane feeder. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 30 min and then frozen at -20 C before scoring and counting. Mosquito feeding success was then scored by counting fed and unfed mosquitoes following bioassays in the presence or absence of the repellent compounds. The outcomes of the screening assay are shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). Using this system, we obtained reproducible and consistently high mosquito feeding success when the cotton cloth was treated with water and 0% feeding when DEET or picaridin was tested as positive repellent controls. Results of three replicate experiments (20 mosquitoes per replicate; total number of mosquitoes tested in three replicate experiments = 60) are presented in Fig. 1B and show an average feeding success of 96.67%, with water controls with Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex pipiens also fed well (75 to 80%; Fig. 2), indicating that the bioassay can be used with multiple mosquito species. On the basis of these results, we determined that the bioassay provided a robust and reproducible test arena to screen mosquito feeding-deterrent activities in the Xbu extracts at various stages of purification.\n\n    In addition, this bioassay was optimal to screen minimal amounts of compounds, a major concern when working with naturally produced microbial compounds not easily obtainable in large quantities. The method also provided rapid results as well as consistent measures of feeding-deterrence that were reproducible across assay dates.\n\n    Next, we developed a procedure to isolate mosquito feeding-deterrent active compounds from Xbu cultures. Xenorhabdus bacteria are known to produce antibiotics and secondary metabolites in the late stationary phase of their growth cycle. Accordingly, we used 72-hour bacterial cultures to harvest mosquito feeding-deterrent compounds from the cell-free culture supernatants. Mosquito feeding-deterrent active compounds in the culture supernatants were concentrated via acetone precipitation. In the next step, water-soluble acetone precipitates yielded a broad peak detected at 280 nm on a reversed-phase C18 flash chromatography column, indicating that the mosquito feeding-deterrent active compounds coeluted with other compounds detectible at 280 nm. The feeding-deterrent activity concentrated and eluted as a single broad peak fraction. Representative images of C18 flash purification results are shown in fig. S1. The peak fraction was subjected to MS analysis for determination of molecular masses and structural characterization. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS revealed the presence of several abundant molecular species including compounds at m/z (mass/charge ratio) 1302.94, 1312.96, and 1430.07 in this fraction (Fig. 3A), with additional masses at m/z 44.03 units higher, leading to the idea that these were likely related. The difference of 44 atomic mass units is consistent with addition of one C2H4O moiety.\n\n    The mosquito feeding-deterrent active fraction from the C18 flash chromatography was subjected to a second fractionation step using analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after an ultrafiltration step (see Materials and Methods for details). Four major peaks were observed, with most of the repellent activity concentrated in peak number 3 (hereafter referred as Xbu Peak#3), which eluted at ~24% acetonitrile (ACN). Representative images of HPLC C18 purification are shown in fig. S2. None of the other peaks showed feeding-deterrent activity (fig. S3, A and B) except peak 4. The activity in peak 4 is likely due to cross-contamination from peak 3 as a result of incomplete resolution of these peaks. MS analysis of Xbu Peak#3 showed two highly abundant masses at m/z 1302.9 and 1346.9 (Fig. 3B), indicating that these compounds, previously observed in the active fraction from C18 flash chromatography, had been enriched in the mosquito feeding-deterrent fraction, as well as many other lower-abundance molecular species. MALDI-TOF MS on mosquito feeding-deterrent active Peak#3 was performed on three different batches of the fractionated compounds. In each replicate, these two masses were the most abundant ions detected. Spectra for these experiments are presented in fig. S4. A number of other lower-abundance molecular species are observed in each replicate fractionation of Xbu cultures (see fig. S4). Several of these compounds do not reproduce across all fractionations, eliminating them from consideration as the active component. Others, most notably at m/z 1430 and 1474, are observed in all of the active fractions. However, their relative enrichment in the active HPLC fraction is decreased compared to m/z 1302 and 1346. This can be seen when comparing the signal intensities for m/z 1302, 1346, 1430, and 1474 in the C18 flash fraction before and after HPLC (Fig. 3, A and B, and fig. S4). The decrease in m/z 1430 and 1474 relative to m/z 1302 and 1346 indicates only a partial coelution with the activity.\n\n    Because we were interested in identifying the compounds, we subjected the mosquito feeding-deterrent active fraction to MS/MS analysis by unassisted nanospray on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Nanospray MS displayed the same major molecular species observed by MALDI-TOF MS, with each compound in a dominant charge state of 2, as well as other lower-abundance species. Charge states from 1 to 4 were detected (fig. S5). MS/MS was performed on the doubly charged species at m/z 651.9 and 673.9 using both collision-induced dissociation (CID) and high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentations. The MS/MS spectra revealed that these compounds were structurally very similar, with several ions common to both compounds, and many ions showing a difference of 44 Da between them, as previously observed by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS/MS spectra and the inferred fragment ion assignments show excellent agreement with the recently described \"fabclavines\" isolated from a similar strain of Xbu. Using the naming convention described in that work and the structures for fabclavines Ib and IIb, the observed fragment ions were consistent with assignment of m/z 1302 as fabclavine IIb and m/z 1346 as fabclavine Ib (fig. S6, A and B), suggesting that the two major constituents of the active fraction are fabclavines.\n\n    Results of N-terminal Edman degradation analyses on mosquito feeding-deterrent active Peak#3 that contains two related peptides (provided in table S2) were inconclusive in determining the sequence of amino acids, possibly explained by an inaccessible N terminus of the molecule due to macrocyclization. Total amino acids were measured from mosquito feeding-deterrent active Peak#3 by two different strong cation ion exchange chromatography methods, sodium- and lithium-based elution systems (Molecular Structure Facility, University of California, Davis, CA, USA). Both systems resulted in significant signals for amino acids Asx and His (fig. S7, A and B). In addition, two unidentified signals were observed, which could be 2,3-diaminobutyric acid (elution profiles were consistent with this compound). Together, these data indicate that two of the amino acids Asx and His and possibly 2,3-diaminobutyric acid are likely to be present in the feeding-deterrent active fraction:amino acids that are also described in fabclavines, which, in addition to these, also contain phenylalanine or histidine, and a modified proline residue.\n\n    Next, we determined the mosquito feeding-deterrence dose of the compounds produced by Xbu with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. For this, we tested a range of concentrations of the deterrent active fraction and compared their feeding-deterrent activities to that of DEET and picaridin. Table S1 lists the mosquito fed/unfed count data used for estimating feeding-deterrence. Table 1 shows feeding-deterrence dose (expressed in mg/cm2) of the compound that resulted in 50 or 90% reduction in mosquito feeding.\n\n    A dose resulting in 50% reduction in feeding among Xbu Peak#3 fraction and DEET was similar (Xbu Peak#3 = 0.014 and DEET = 0.012 mg/cm2), whereas it was 6.14x lower than that of picaridin (0.086 mg/cm2). A dose resulting in 90% reduction in feeding among Xbu Peak#3 was much lower compared to both DEET and picaridin (Xbu Peak#3 = 0.057, DEET = 0.178, and picaridin = 0.471 mg/cm2), indicating that a much lower concentration of Xbu compounds is required to achieve 90% reduction in feeding as compared to DEET or picaridin. The relative efficacy (RE90) of Xbu Peak#3 derived as a ratio of the dose resulting in 90% feeding reduction of DEET or picaridin to that of Xbu Peak#3 was 3.12 and 8.26, respectively, suggesting that mosquito feeding-deterrence dose of Xbu compounds is more potent in inhibiting mosquitoes from feeding on the cocktail diet under the conditions of the screening assay as compared to DEET or picaridin. Table 2 shows the Probit-analyzed comparison among the least-squares estimates for each compound's effect. The repellency comparison based on adjusted P values among DEET and picaridin was significant (P < 0.05); DEET and Xbu Peak#3 were not significantly different (P > 0.05); and Xbu Peak#3 was significantly different from picaridin (P < 0.05). Together, feeding-deterrent activity of the bacterial compounds is equal to or better than DEET and picaridin.\n\n    While the exact mechanism by which Xbu compounds exert mosquito feeding-deterrence is a subject for future in-depth investigations, visual observations during feeding indicated that landing and probing by Aedes mosquitoes on the cloth treated with Xbu compounds were dose dependent (movie S1). At a 50% feeding-deterrence dose, a majority of mosquitoes landed and about half succeeded in feeding, while at 90% or a higher dose, few mosquitoes landed and none fed. Movie S1 shows the behavior of mosquitoes in the presence of water or Xbu compounds at 0.057 mg/cm2 (the concentration that caused 90% feeding-deterrence). The mosquitoes that landed attempted to probe through the cloth and were seen cleaning their proboscises soon after probing but did not imbibe food.\n\n    Thus, mosquito contact with the treated surface preceded feeding-deterrence at low dose. Deciphering feeding-deterrence by olfactory or gustatory mechanisms against low-volatility compounds, including DEET and picaridin, is difficult due to overlapping sensory responses. Addition of DEET to blood deterred mosquitoes from feeding through direct contact with the blood meal, likely via gustatory response. External gustatory sensilla on antennae of the Chagas vector Rhodnius prolixus mediate feeding-deterrence to quinine or caffeine when applied to mesh covering feeding solutions. Certain fatty acids exert feeding-deterrence in A. aegypti when applied to cloth surfaces covering the artificial diet. Feeding-deterrence exhibited by Xbu compounds might elicit a combination of olfactory and gustatory responses upon contact by mosquitoes with the treated cloth surfaces in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n    We also observed feeding-deterrence exhibited by Xbu compounds with A. gambiae and C. pipiens. For tests with these mosquitoes, we modified our screening assay by incorporating a single layer of a muslin cloth (rather than two layers as before). These mosquitoes had difficulty feeding with the two layers of cotton cloth described for Aedes. One layer of muslin yielded 75 to 80% feeding rate (Fig. 2). Feeding assays performed with 0.057 mg/cm2 (the concentration that caused 90% feeding-deterrence with Aedes) for A. gambiae and C. pipiens are shown in Fig. 2. Results indicate that the Xbu compounds exert a potent feeding-deterrent activity against A. gambiae and C. pipiens, as was seen with Aedes. Aedes mosquitoes were also included in this trial using the single layer of cloth.",
        "Conclusion": "    The bacteria associated with entomopathogenic nematodes offer an enormous potential for novel bioactivities especially attributable to low-molecular weight natural products. Genome mining projects continue to uncover information on biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for production of several of the bacterial secondary metabolites awaiting identification and assignment to their natural biological functions.\n\n    Here, we provide evidence that a potent mosquito feeding-deterrent activity could be concentrated from Xbu cultures. MS and MS/MS data support the putative identification of the two most abundant compounds enriched in the deterrent active fraction as fabclavines, strongly suggesting that the feeding-deterrent activity is likely exhibited by these compounds. The feeding-deterrent activity, as determined by membrane mosquito feeding experiments, is comparable to or higher than the gold standard repellent DEET or picaridin against A. aegypti. Furthermore, the feeding rate of Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes decreased significantly in the presence of Xbu compounds, suggesting that these compounds are effective in inhibiting a broader range of mosquito species. These results suggest that the bioactivities of the fabclavine class of natural products may be exploited in novel applications such as mosquito feeding-deterrence. The authors recognize that the mosquito feeding-deterrent active fraction is a mixture of compounds, dominated by two copurifying, closely related molecular species at m/z 1302 and 1346. Future studies should (i) explore chromatographic or otherwise resolution of all compounds in these active fractions to identify those specifically responsible for deterrence activity, (ii) determine whether the compounds can affect feeding-deterrence individually or require application as a mixture, (iii) demonstrate deterrent activity of fabclavines via de novo synthesis or knockout experiments, and (iv) determine efficacy and toxicological properties of the deterrent active compounds for use in mosquito deterrent/repellent formulations for eventual testing on human skin.",

        "Title": "    Face Orientation and Motion Differently Affect the Deployment of Visual Attention in Newborns and 4-Month-Old Infants",
        "Abstract": "    Orienting visual attention allows us to properly select relevant visual information from a noisy environment. Despite extensive investigation of the orienting of visual attention in infancy, it is unknown whether and how stimulus characteristics modulate the deployment of attention from birth to 4 months of age, a period in which the efficiency in orienting of attention improves dramatically. The aim of the present study was to compare 4-month-old infants' and newborns' ability to orient attention from central to peripheral stimuli that have the same or different attributes. In Experiment 1, all the stimuli were dynamic and the only attribute of the central and peripheral stimuli to be manipulated was face orientation. In Experiment 2, both face orientation and motion of the central and peripheral stimuli were contrasted. The number of valid trials and saccadic latency were measured at both ages. Our results demonstrated that the deployment of attention is mainly influenced by motion at birth, while it is also influenced by face orientation at 4-month of age. These findings provide insight into the development of the orienting visual attention in the first few months of life and suggest that maturation may be not the only factor that determines the developmental change in orienting visual attention from birth to 4 months.",
        "Introduction": "    Research suggests that attention may be conceptualized as a collection of dissociable functions or components, each with a dedicated underlying central nervous system pathway or structure. Orienting visual attention is one such function and the topic of this paper. Efficiency of orienting visual attention is crucial to exploring the environment for further processing and learning. It undergoes dramatic developments in the first year of life, including acquisition of the capacity to disengage attention and look away from salient or captivating stimuli impinging on the fovea. Disengagement from fixation is a prerequisite for initiating a saccade to a new target and has been studied in controlled laboratory situations using the gap-overlap paradigm. This paradigm measures the flexibility in attentional switching in response to changes in the visual environment and may also be used to investigate the disengagement of attention during infancy. Infants' gaze is first drawn to a visual stimulus on the midline and then a stimulus is presented in the visual periphery. This typically draws the eyes away from the midline stimulus and towards the peripheral stimulus. If a temporal gap is introduced between the disappearance of the midline stimulus and the appearance of the peripheral stimulus, the saccadic latency to reach the new target is reduced. This is presumably because disengagement is no longer necessary prior to shifting attention towards the peripheral stimulus. Conversely, if the midline stimulus remains present while the peripheral stimulus appears, the saccadic latency to reach the new target increases as disengagement of attention is now required prior to any shift away from the midline stimulus.\n\n    Earlier research has shown that when two stimuli are presented at the same time several factors may influence the orienting of attention from the central to the peripheral stimuli (i.e., overlap condition). For instance, disengagement is affected by the infant's age, as it is well documented by the phenomenon of obligatory attention. Obligatory attention is the difficulty 1-2-month-old infants' have in breaking gaze from the stimulus they are fixating. Saccadic reaction time of younger infants are particularly impaired in the overlap condition relative to those of older infants. The frequency and speed of shifts of gaze to a target in the periphery when a stimulus remains present in the center increase substantially around 3-4 months of age. By 4 months of age, infants are able to move their attention and gaze easily and rapidly, and staring behaviour becomes rare.\n\n    Orienting is affected also by stimulus attributes. Finlay and Ivinskies demonstrated that a comparatively salient stimulus in the central visual field makes it more difficult for infants to disengage their gaze. For example, Hunnius and Geuze recently investigated the efficiency of orienting attention from central to peripheral stimuli in ecological contexts using two different dynamic stimuli: a socially relevant stimulus and an abstract stimulus. The former consisted of a short video sequence of the face of the infant's mother, and the latter consisted of a stimulus that matched the video of the mother in terms of dynamic characteristics, colour range, and luminance. These stimuli both appeared as central stimulus and as peripheral target. Infants were more likely to shift their gaze when the central stimulus was a face and the peripheral target was an abstract stimulus, while they were less likely and also slower to shift gaze in the opposite condition (i.e., abstract central, face peripheral). This effect was most marked between 10 and 18 weeks, whereas at 6 weeks of age, the infants rarely looked away from the central stimulus regardless of what it was or of what was presented in the periphery.\n\n    Taken together these results suggest that the efficiency of orienting attention from central to peripheral stimuli, specified in terms of the saccadic reaction time to reach the peripheral target, may be affected by the age of the viewer and by the characteristic of the central and the peripheral stimuli. While at birth disengagement is not yet completely efficient, by 4 months of age, infants are able to move their attention and gaze easily, rapidly and efficiently. Starting from these findings it becomes very relevant to explore how the characteristics of the central and the peripheral stimulus influence the deployment of attention differentially at birth and at 4 months of age.\n\n    The aim of the present study was to compare the ability of 4-month-old infants and newborns to orient attention away from central to peripheral stimuli (i.e., overlap condition) in two experiments in which the saccade latency toward peripheral stimuli was recorded. In both experiments two attributes of the central and peripheral stimuli were manipulated: orientation of the face (upright vs. inverted) and motion (dynamic vs. static).\n\n    There are mainly two ways in which facial orientation affects face processing in young infants. First, facial orientation affect infants' recognition of faces. It has long been known that faces are extremely difficult to recognize when seen upside down (i.e. face inversion effect). The face inversion effect refers to the greater impairment in performance for face recognition relative to object recognition due to stimulus inversion. It has been assumed that the face inversion effect found in adults originate from the prolonged experience with upright face during the course of development. However, a number of studies have shown that the face inversion effect is present very early during development. These include a few studies reporting somewhat better face recognition for upright than inverted faces even at birth and a greater number of studies in infants over 4-months of age. These findings suggest that infants' early representation of faces contains information that is orientation-specific.\n\n    Second, and more relevant to the current study, upright faces are known to recruit attention from birth. When presented with face-like and nonface-like patterns, newborns spontaneously look longer at, and orient more frequently toward, upright face-like configurations. An upright face preference at birth has been demonstrated with both static and moving stimuli, and with both schematic and veridical images of faces. Note, however, that at birth upright the face preference seems to depend on the existence of general biases that orient newborns' attention toward certain structural properties that faces share with other visual stimuli. One such structural properties is the so called \"top-heavy\" property, and it consists of a greater number of high contrast elements in the upper half of the configuration. At birth, top-heavy configurations made of geometrical patterns embedded in a rectangular area can elicit preference over the inverted versions of such configurations, analogous to the preference for upright faces. These findings suggest that newborns have only very crude representation about faces even if it is orientation-specific. However, a change in the determinants of infants' face preference seems to occur in the following few months. At 3 months of age, upright face preference appears to become more selective to those perceptual characteristics that distinguish faces from other stimulus categories. Moreover, by 3 months of age infants begin to show evidence of the formation of face prototypes. Overall, this pattern of results is consistent with an experience-expectant perspective on face processing. The experience-expectant perspective emphasize the relevance of both general biases and exposure to certain experiences in driving functional specialization of face processing during the first months of life. There is also evidence showing that facial orientation influences the pattern of eye movement by 4-month-olds while exploring faces. During the presentation of upright faces, 4-month-old infants spent more time exploring the internal features of faces. Moreover, they alternated their gaze as frequently between the face's internal features as between external and internal features. However, the exploration and the gaze shift between the internal features decreased during the presentation of inverted faces, suggesting that the attentional mechanisms involved in infants' face processing are different for upright and inverted faces. Accordingly with these results, Valenza, Franchin, and Bulf have recently showed that upright and inverted faces differently affect the deployment of attention in 8-month-old infants. Using a Posner-like cuing task, they found that infants spent more time in shifting attention between two inverted faces, but not between two upright faces.\n\n    In addition to face orientation, dynamic properties of stimuli are also known to attract infants' attention from birth. It is a commonplace observation that newborns readily attend to moving visual stimuli and that they show a visual preference for dynamic stimuli, such as flickering or flashing stimuli. In the presence of a central stimulus, newborns localize peripheral stimuli at greater eccentricities when the peripheral stimulus is flashing than when it is not flashing. The frequency of detection of a target in the periphery increased between 2 and 10 weeks of age when the central stimulus was static and the peripheral target was moving, but not when the central stimulus was moving and the peripheral target was static. Similarly a flickering peripheral stimulus affects the probability of, and latency to, move fixation from a central location to the peripheral stimulus. These findings show that attention to a focal dynamic stimulus attenuates detection of a peripheral stimulus while flickering or movement in the peripheral stimulus increases the likelihood of its detection and decreases the latency of the associated eye movement. Previous studies have shown that sensitivity to various motion information undergoes considerable development in the first few months after birth. However, there is evidence showing that motion is a rich source of information from birth. Newborns preferentially look at point-light display depicting biological movement over non-biological movement, demonstrating the detection of the movement of biologically relevant signals. There are also studies reporting facilitative effect of motion on newborns' and infants' face recognition, while others have shown that facial movements may distract newborns' attention and consequently disrupt their recognition of dynamic talking face.\n\n    When considered together both facial orientation and motion trigger attention and it is a relevant source of information even from birth. In order to find out how these attributes modulate the orienting of attention during the course of development, we conducted the following two experiments. First, we manipulated the orientation of the central and peripheral face using faces in motion (Experiment 1). Second, we contrasted face orientation attribute and motion attribute of the stimuli between the central and peripheral stimuli (Experiment 2).",
        "Methods": "    Experiment 1 examined the possibility that the orientation of the central and peripheral face stimuli may differently affect the deployment of visual attention in 4-month-old (Experiment 1a) and in newborn infants (Experiment 1b). In Experiment 1, all facial stimuli were shown in dynamic condition, and only their orientation was manipulated. Given that only face orientation is manipulated in Experiment 1, it might be expected that this attribute would affect orienting in a similar way for both the age groups. That is, it might be expected that, for both age groups, the latency of orienting will be longer when the central face is upright compared to when it is inverted and also when the peripheral face is inverted compared to when it is upright. Alternatively, motion per se is an effective producer of newborns' visual attention and effect of motion may dominate over the effect of face orientation at birth. Given that both the central and the peripheral stimuli are dynamic, dynamic property of stimuli may overwhelm the effect of facial orientation for newborns who has only crude representation about faces. Then, face orientation might only affect orienting in the 4-month-old infants.\n\n    Participants of this study were tested after their parents had provided written informed consent. The protocol was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194) and approved by the Chuo University Human Research Ethics Committee (Experiments 1a and 2a), and by the Pediatric Clinic of the University of Padua (Experiments 1b and 2b). The individual depicted in the Fig 1 of this manuscript has given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publish her photograph.\n\n    The final sample consisted of 20 healthy Japanese infants aged 4-months (14 male, 6 female, mean age = 122 days, ranging from 107 to 133 days). All participants are healthy full-term infants (birth weight ranging between 2480g to 3578g) with no known visual problem or developmental atypicality. An additional 6 infants were tested but were excluded from the analysis for not having at least one valid trial in each of the four test conditions.\n\n    All stimuli were displayed on a 24-inch wide LCD monitor (Dell S2409W) controlled by a computer. Tobii X120 which was connected to the same computer was placed just below the monitor to obtain eye-tracking data. The infant and the LCD monitor were located inside an enclosure, which was made of iron poles and covered with cloth. There were loudspeakers, one on either side of the CRT monitor. The experimenter could observe the infant behaviour live via a TV monitor connected to a digital camera positioned just below the monitor screen throughout the experiment.\n\n    Stimuli were two-frame dynamic images of three Asian females in full colour (see Fig 1a). There were three motion types: blinking, mouth opening, and nodding. Each dynamic stimulus consisted of two photograph of the same female face with a slightly different pose. The first frame of all dynamic stimuli was a face looking straight ahead with eyes open and mouth closed (see Fig 1a top). The second frame of the dynamic stimuli (see Fig 1a bottom) were either a face with closed eyes (blinking stimuli), a face with mouth open (mouth opening stimuli), or a face with her head tilted slightly down (nodding stimuli). The two frames in each dynamic stimulus were shown alternating with a duration of 500ms per frame. This produced the impression of blinking, mouth opening, or nodding. The dynamic stimuli always started with the first frame at the stimulus onset. Static stimuli were identical to the first frame of the dynamic stimuli. Each stimulus appeared in either its upright or inverted orientation. Each facial image subtended approximately 12 (547 pixel) x 15 (700 pixel) of visual angle (VA) and the distance between the nearest edges of the left/right image and central image was approximately 10  as viewed from a distance of approximately 50cm. All stimulus images were shown against mid-grey background (see Fig 1b).\n\n    Stimuli were paired so that facial orientation (upright vs. inverted) was manipulated between central and peripheral stimuli. There were four stimulus combination conditions as shown in Table 1. Each infant was shown 36 trials consisting of 4 stimulus combinations x 3 facial identities x 3 motion types in a random order within each experimental block. The left/right position of the peripheral stimuli on each trial was counterbalanced across 36 trials.\n\n    Each infant sat on his/her parent's or an experimenter's lap in front of the LCD monitor. Before starting the experiment, calibration of the eye-tracker was performed using a 5-point calibration procedure for infants with Tobii Studio. Based on the calibration, eye-tracking data was obtained throughout the experiment and, using in-house program using Visual Basic 6.0 and Tobii Software Development Kit (SDK), was used to control stimulus presentation. Prior to the experiment, the area of the central stimulus and the two areas of the peripheral stimuli were defined. The eye-tracking data during each trail was also recorded and exported after the experiment.\n\n    Prior to each trial, an animated fixation point with a short beeping sound was presented at the center of the monitor. The experimenter pressed a key to initiate each trial as soon as the infant paid attention to the cartoon. The presentation of each trial was initiated only if the infant gaze tracking data was available and the infants gaze was located on the center area of interest (central AOI) at the timing of experimenter's key press.\n\n    On each trial, a central stimulus appeared on the center of the LCD monitor for 2 seconds, followed by a peripheral stimulus either on the left or on the right to the central stimulus. After the onset of the peripheral stimulus, each trial terminated automatically if the infants gaze entered in the area of the peripheral stimulus (peripheral AOI). The experimenter terminated the trial if infants looked away from LCD monitor or looked away from the central stimulus, or if 5 seconds elapsed after the onset of the peripheral stimulus (the trial did not terminate automatically).\n\n    If infants were willing to attend to the monitor after the completion of the first block, the experimenter initiated one more block of stimulus presentation. Thus, each infant was allowed to receive as many trials until they complete two blocks of 36 trials. The experimenter terminated stimulus presentation at any stage of experiment if infants became inattentive to the monitor or fussy.\n\n    The eye-tracking data collected at a rate of 60Hz during each trial. The eye-tracking data contained information about the x and y position of the infants gaze position at each time point. We defined AOIs corresponding to the central and peripheral stimulus position as shown in Fig 1b. Saccade latency was calculated by measuring the time from the onset of the peripheral stimuli to the time point when the infants' gaze falls out of the central AOI. The central AOI corresponded to the area of central stimuli (12  x 15  area around the center of the monitor, see Fig 1b). The peripheral AOI corresponded to the area of peripheral stimuli (12  x 15  area, positioned 10  apart either from the left edge or the right edge of the central AOI, see Fig 1b).).\n\n    The saccade latency was analyzed from trials on which there was a well defined shift of gaze from the central toward the peripheral stimuli.\n\n    The saccadic latency was calculated by measuring the time from the onset of the peripheral stimuli to the time point when the infants' gaze reached on the peripheral AOI. Total of 958 trials were observed across infants. Among these, trials were considered as invalid and rejected if (a) there was less than 500ms of continuous looking at the central stimuli immediately before the onset of the peripheral stimuli, or infants' gaze was not on the central AOI (30%, 285 trials out of 958 trials), (b) the gaze shifted other than the peripheral stimulus direction (4%, 42 trials), (c) the gaze data was lost before infants' gaze arrive in the peripheral AOI (17%, 164 trials), or (d) the saccade latency was less than 200ms (0%, 3 trials). Finally, based on previous studies (7, 9, 16), trials were discarded if (e) the gaze shift did not occur within 5sec of the onset of the peripheral stimulus (1%, 14 trials).\n\n    Table 2 shows the mean number of the valid trials and its proportion as a percentage among the number of trials for each condition shown to the infants.\n\n    A 2 central stimulus orientation (upright/inverted) x 2 peripheral stimulus orientation (upright/inverted) repeated measures ANOVA on the proportion of valid trials revealed no significant effect or interaction (all p's >.100).\n\n    Fig 2a shows average saccadic latency in each stimulus combination condition. Shapiro-Wilk test with Bonferroni correction detected a significant deviation from normal distribution except for the inverted central vs. upright peripheral stimulus condition (all p's < .050), due to data skew that typically occur for latency data. Therefore, we applied reciprocal transformation to latency data to compute the saccadic rate (Fig 2b). The saccadic rate was computed as 1000/latency for each trial. After transformation, visual inspection of histogram suggest skewness was reduced, and Shapiro-Wilk test with Bonferroni correction did not detect deviation from normal distribution for any of the saccadic rates (all p's > .100). We performed a 2 central facial orientations (upright, inverted) x 2 peripheral face orientations (upright, inverted) repeated measures ANOVA on the saccadic rate. The analysis revealed a main effect of peripheral facial orientation alone, F(1,19) = 4.62, p = .045, eta p 2 = .20 (upright: M = 1.65 shift per seconds SD = 0.39; inverted: M = 1.48 shift per seconds, SD = 0.44). The greater saccadic rate for upright peripheral stimuli shows a faster gaze shift toward the upright stimuli regardless of the orientation of the central stimuli. No other effect or interaction reached significance (all p's > .100).\n\n    The final sample consisted of fourteen 1- to 3-day-old Caucasian infants (M age = 38 h, SD = 17 h, range = 16-86 h). Nine additional newborns were tested but excluded from the final sample for not contributing at least one valid trial in each of the four test conditions. Infants had a normal delivery, birth weight between 2470 and 4050 g, and an Apgar score of 9 or 10 at 5 minutes. Newborns were tested only if awake and in an alert state. Parents (mother, father or both) were present during the observation of their son/daughter.\n\n    Stimuli were presented on a 30-inch Apple Cinema monitor 30 cm away from the newborn. Plain white curtains were drawn on both sides to prevent distraction. Above the monitor, a video camera (IVC 800) recorded the newborn to monitor the newborn's looking behavior on-line and for off-line coding. The experimenter could observe the infant behaviour through a monitor connected to the video camera.\n\n    Stimuli were exactly the same utilized in Experiment 1a with 4-month-old infants (see Fig 1 and Table 1).\n\n    Each newborn sat on an experimenter's lap in front of the monitor at a distance of about 30 cm. This experimenter was naive to the experimental hypothesis and blind regarding the stimuli presentation; he/she fixed his/her gaze on a camera on the ceiling throughout the session. A central flickering attention getter was used to attract the newborns' attention at the start of the testing. When the newborn's gaze was properly aligned with the attention getter, the sequence of trials was started by the experimenter who watched the newborn on a monitor and pressed a key on the computer keyboard which turned off the attention getter and activated the onset of the stimuli. As in Experiment 1a on each trial, a central stimulus appeared on the center of the monitor for 2 seconds, followed by a peripheral stimulus either on the left or on the right to the central stimuli. Also in Experiment 1b the distance between the nearest edges of the left/right image and central image peripheral stimulus was about 10  of visual angle (5.3 cm). The peripheral stimulus was presented until the newborn looked at it or until 10 seconds elapsed. Once the newborn looked to the peripheral stimulus or if the maximum duration was reached, the experimenter pressed a key to replace the peripheral target with a central flickering attention getter and the next trial was presented.\n\n    Each newborn was shown 36 trials consisting of 4 stimulus combinations x 3 facial identities x 3 motion types divided into 3 blocks of 12 trials each. Within each block the 4 stimulus combinations were repeated in a random order 3 times each. The 3 facial identities and the 3 motion types were randomized along the entire experiment. The left/right position of the peripheral stimuli was randomized and counterbalanced across the 36 trials. If newborns were willing to attend to the monitor after the completion of the first block, the experimenter initiated the following block of stimulus presentation. Thus, each infant was allowed to receive up to two blocks of 36 trials. The experimenter terminated stimulus presentation at any stage of experiment if newborns became inattentive to the monitor or become fussy.\n\n    In contrast to Experiment 1a where saccade latency was registered through a Tobii eye tracker system, in the present experiment video-recordings of the newborns' looking behaviour were coded off-line frame by frame by two independent coders blind to the experimental hypothesis. As in previous experiment saccadic latency reflected the time taken by neonates to reach on the peripheral stimuli. Temporal resolution of the video recordings used to obtain newborn data was 25 frames per seconds.\n\n    A total of 248 trials were observed across all infants. Among these, trials were considered as invalid if (a) the newborn's gaze was not on the central stimulus when the peripheral one appeared (11%), (b) the newborn did not look continuously at the central stimulus for at least 500ms immediately prior to the presentation of the peripheral stimulus (5%), (c) the newborn oriented towards the peripheral stimulus before 500ms (0%), (d) the newborn's gaze did not shift directly to peripheral stimulus but moved in other directions before engaging the peripheral stimulus (9%), and (e) the newborn had their eyes closed for whatever reason (e.g. blinking, yawning; fussing) (14%). Finally, based on a previous study [8), trials were rejected if (f) the newborn did not orient towards the peripheral stimulus within 10000ms of its appearance (1%).\n\n    Inter-rater reliability calculated over 50% of the data was .9 (Cohen's K) for the number of valid trials and correlation for saccadic latency was .87.\n\n    The mean number of the valid trials and its' proportion in percentage among the number of trials for each condition shown to the newborns is shown in Table 2. A 2 central stimulus orientation (upright/inverted) x 2 peripheral stimulus orientaion (upright/inverted) repeated measures ANOVA on the proportion of valid trials revealed no significant effect of central stimulus orientation, F(1,13) = 0.46, p = .511, or peripheral orientation, F(1,13) = 0.07, p = .802, or their interaction F(1,13) = 0.12, p = .739, suggesting that newborns' proportion of valid trial was similar for all the conditions.\n\n    Fig 1c shows average saccadic latency in each stimulus combination condition. Shapiro-Wilk test with Bonferroni correction detected no significant deviation from normal distribution (ps > .1). As in the previous experiment we performed a 2 central facial orientations (upright, inverted) x 2 peripheral face orientations (upright, inverted) repeated measures ANOVA on saccadic latency. The analysis did not reveal any main effect of central facial orientation, F(1,13) = 2.66, p = .127, or of peripheral facial orientation F(1,13) = 0.26, p = .619, or of their interaction F(1,13) = 0.24, p = .636.\n\n    Taken together the results of Experiments 1 revealed that an influence of face orientation on the deployment of visual attention occurred at 4 months but not at birth. In 4-month-old infants, the number of valid trials was also greater when the central stimulus was upright face compared to when it was inverted face (see Table 2). Considering that most of the trial rejection was due to inattention to the central stimuli before or at the peripheral stimulus onset, the results suggest that upright central stimuli are more effective in holding infants' attention than the inverted stimuli. Further, their orienting occurred more quickly when the peripheral stimulus was an upright face compared to when it was an inverted face (Experiment 1a). Unlike in the current study, Hunnius and Geuze reported that 10 to 18 weeks old infants shift their gaze more frequently when the central stimulus was a dynamic face and the peripheral target was a dynamic abstract stimulus. As they used mother's face as the face stimuli, Hunnius and Geuze discussed that their results suggest that mother's face being less able to hold or attract the attention of the infants. Such a view would explain the difference between the results of Hunnius and Geuze and the results from 4-months in the current study. Unlike the special case of mother's face, the current results obtained with unfamiliar faces suggest that upright faces in general hold and attract attention of infants around 4-months of age.\n\n    In contrast to 4-month-olds, newborns did not show any effects of face orientation on the proportion of valid trials or on saccade latency (Experiment 1b). The finding with newborns are consistent with Farroni et al's study, in which saccade latency for upright face-like target were no faster than for inverted ones in the overlapping condition.\n\n    Overall the results of Experiments 1 suggest that the face orientation differently affects orienting of visual attention at 4 months of age than at birth. Most probably, at birth attention is strongly triggered by the salience of a general attribute of the stimulus such as motion, and consequently the face orientation is not sufficient to affect orienting unlike four months later. To test this explanation, a second experiment was carried out in which motion and face orientation were directly contrasted.\n\n    To better understand the results of Experiment 1, a second Experiment was carried out in which we varied the face orientation and motion of the central and peripheral stimuli. We expected face orientation to be the main factor affecting the orienting of visual attention at 4 months, but motion to be more influential at birth.\n\n    The final sample consisted of 18 healthy Japanese infants aged 4-months (9 male, 9 female, mean age = 120 days, ranging from 111 to 133 days). All participants were healthy, full-term infants (birth weight ranging between 2476g to 3500g) with no known visual problem or developmental atypicality. An additional 4 infants were tested but were excluded from the analysis for not contributing at least one valid trial in each of the four test conditions.\n\n    Apparatus, Stimuli. Procedure, and Data Analysis were same as those in Experiment 1 except for the following. Face motion as well as orientation was contrasted between the central and peripheral stimuli. Static stimuli were created by taking the first frame of the dynamic stimuli used in Experiment 1 (see Fig 1) for each motion condition and face. This gave the four stimulus combination conditions listed in Table 3.\n\n    A total of 764 trials were observed across infants. Among these, trials were considered as invalid if (a) there was less than 500ms of continuous looking at the central stimuli immediately before the onset of the peripheral stimuli, or infants' gaze was not on the central AOI (31.94%, 244 trials), (c) the gaze shifted other than the peripheral stimulus direction (5%, 39 trials), (d) the gaze data was lost before infants shift gaze toward the peripheral stimuli (11%, 109 trials), or (e) the saccade latency was less than 200ms (0%, 4 trials). Finally, based on previous studies, trials were discarded if (f) the gaze shift did not occur within 5sec after onset of the peripheral stimulus (1%, 7 trials).\n\n    The mean number of the valid trials and its proportion as a percentage of the number of trials for each condition shown to the infants is shown in Table 2.\n\n    A two-way ANOVA with 2 levels of movement property (dynamic central + static peripheral, static central + dynamic peripheral) x 2 levels of stimulus orientations (upright central + inverted peripheral, inverted central + upright peripheral) on the proportion of valid trials revealed a marginally significant interaction, F(1,17) = 3.53, p = .08, eta p 2 = .17. Simple effect analysis following up the interaction revealed no significant effect (p < .010).\n\n    Fig 3a shows average saccadic latency in each stimulus combination condition. Shapiro-Wilk test with Bonferroni correction detected a significant deviation from normal in static upright central vs. dynamic inverted peripheral stimulus condition (p < .010), due to the positive data skew typical of latency data. Therefore, we applied the reciprocal transformation to the saccadic latency data to give saccadic rate (Fig 3b) as in Experiment 1. After transformation, visual inspection of histogram suggest skewness was reduced, and Shapiro-Wilk test with Bonferroni correction did not detect deviation from normal distribution for any of the gaze shift rates (p's > .100). We performed a two-way repeated ANOVA with 2 levels of movement property (dynamic central + static peripheral, static central + dynamic peripheral) x 2 levels of stimulus orientation (upright central + inverted peripheral, inverted central + upright peripheral) on the saccadic rate. The analysis revealed no significant main effect or interaction (all p's > .100). While Fig 3b shows a trends of greater saccadic rate for the conditions with upright peripheral stimuli (which is consistent with a trends of a shorter saccadic latency for these conditions as seen in Fig 3a), it did not reach significance.\n\n    The final sample consisted of 14 healthy 1- to 3-day-old newborns (M age = 40 h, SD = 15 h, range = 20-92 h). An additional 3 newborns were tested but were excluded from the analysis for not contributing at least one valid trial in each of the four test conditions. Infants had a normal delivery, birth weight between 2470 and 4050 g, and an Apgar score of 9 or 10 at 5 minutes. Newborns were tested only if in an awake and in alert state.\n\n    Stimuli were exactly the same as for Experiment 2a (see Table 3).\n\n    Apparatus, Procedure, and Data Analysis were same as for Experiment 1b, except for the following. A total of 252 trials were observed across newborns. Among these, trials were considered as invalid if (a) the newborn's gaze was not on the central stimulus when the peripheral one appeared (14%), (b) the newborn did not look continuously at the central stimulus for at least 500ms immediately prior to the presentation of the peripheral stimulus (3%), (c) the newborn oriented towards the peripheral stimulus before 500ms (0%), (d) the newborn's gaze did not shift directly to the peripheral stimulus but moved in other directions first (10%), (e) the newborn had their eyes closed for whatever reasons (e.g. blinking, yawning; fussing) (16%). Finally, based on previous work, trials were also considered as invalid if (f) the infant only oriented towards the peripheral stimulus more than 10000ms of its appearance (5%).\n\n    Table 2 shows the mean number of valid trials and its proportion as a percentage of the total the number of trials for each condition shown to the newborns.\n\n    A two-way ANOVA with 2 levels of movement property (dynamic central + static peripheral, static central + dynamic peripheral) x 2 levels of stimulus orientation (upright central + inverted peripheral, inverted central + upright peripheral) on the proportion of valid trials revealed a significant interaction between movement property and stimulus orientation F(1,13) = 5.03, p = .043, eta p 2 = 0.28. Simple effect analysis showed a marginally significant effect of movement property only for the combination of upright central vs inverted peripheral, t(13) = 2.08, p = .058. Newborns showed a higher proportion of valid trials with static central upright face than dynamic central upright face, suggesting that the stimulus attribute that influence their proportion of valid trials is different by those that affected 4-month-old infants.\n\n    Fig 3c shows average saccadic latency for each stimulus combination condition. Shapiro-Wilk test with Bonferroni correction detected no significant deviation from normal (p > .080 for the upright static/inverted dynamic condition and ps > .100 for the other 3 conditions). A two-way ANOVA with 2 levels of movement properties (dynamic central + static peripheral, static central + dynamic peripheral) x 2 levels of stimulus orientations (upright central + inverted peripheral, inverted central + upright peripheral) on the saccadic latency revealed a significant main effect of dynamic properties, F(1,13) = 7.80, p = .015 eta p 2 = 0.38, with longer latencies in the dynamic central condition (M = 3354 ms, SD = 237 ms) than in the static central condition (M = 2626, SD = 333 ms). The main effect of stimulus orientation, F(1,13) = 0.01, p = .948, and the interaction between the two factors, F(1,13) = 0.46, p = .508, were not significant\n\n    Unlike our prediction, neither the dynamic property nor the facial orientation influenced dominantly to the orienting behaviour in 4-month-olds. On the other hand, both the proportion of valid trials and the saccadic latency showed that the dynamic property predominantly influenced to the orienting behaviour in newborns.",

        "Discussion": "    In the present study we investigated the role played by face orientation and motion on orienting visual attention in 4-month-old infants and newborns. Findings showed that these stimulus attributes differently modulate the orienting of attention between 4-month-old infants and newborns, revealing developmental change during the first months of life.\n\n    A first difference between 4-month-old infants and newborns concerns the saccadic latency to the peripheral target: Four-month-old infants are faster than newborns in shifting their gaze toward a target in the periphery when a stimulus persists in the center of the screen. Our results support previous findings that show a substantial decrease of saccadic latency between 9 and 16 weeks, a timing that coincides with a period of increased activity in the cortical area thought to mediate the disengagement and shifting of attention and gaze. The difference in speed of orienting between 4-month-old infants and newborns may be explained as the consequence of the maturation of the cortical area that mediate the orienting of visual attention.\n\n    A second difference between 4-month-old infants and newborns concerns the pattern of attentional behaviour. Overall both Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that the orienting of attention is mainly influenced by motion but not by face orientation at birth, but it is also influenced by face orientation at 4-months of age. The proportion of valid trials in newborns was higher when the central stimulus was a static upright face (Experiment 2b), while it was the same regardless of the upright and inverted orientation of faces when both the central and the peripheral stimulus were dynamic (Experiment 1b). Similarly newborns' saccadic latency was not influenced by facial orientation when both the central and the peripheral stimuli were dynamic (Experiment 1b). Again, irrespective of the orientation of the face, newborns' saccadic latency was slower when the central stimulus was dynamic and the peripheral stimulus was static compared to the opposite (Experiment 2b). By contrast, Experiment 1 and 2 suggest that both facial orientation and motion influence the orienting of attention in 4-month-olds. Four-month-old infants' saccades occurred more quickly when the peripheral stimulus was an upright as compared to an inverted face when both the central and the peripheral stimulus were in motion (Experiment 1a). However, the influence of the facial orientation disappeared when the face orientation attribute was contrasted with the dynamic attribute (Experiment 2a).\n\n    A limitation of this study is that we are not able to disentangle which stimulus (i.e., the central one ore the peripheral one) was more responsible for the observed effects. For example, any latency effect found in the current study could have been due to an increase in shifting speed to moving peripheral stimuli or, conversely, slowed disengagement from moving central stimuli. Future research that involves greater number of conditions would be needed to establish which one was the case.\n\n    Why would 4-month-old infants be influenced by a different stimulus attribute compared to newborn infants? There are at least three possible interpretations of our finding. First, our findings may partly reflect an unequal sample sizes between the age groups. Indeed, both 4-month-old experiments report findings on 20 infants, whereas both newborn experiments report findings on 14 newborns. Given that in Experiment 1b we obtained a null result, the difference in statistical power may explain for the different pattern of results. However a significant statistical effect was obtained in Experiment 2b with the same sample size for newborns. Moreover our findings for newborns are consistent with Farroni et al's study, in which saccade latency was no faster for upright face-like target than for inverted ones in the overlapping condition. Second, data were collected in two different labs with infants drawn from different populations. While exactly the same procedure and stimuli were employed, a different testing apparatus was utilized. Indeed saccadic latency was registered through a Tobii eye tracker system in the experiments with 4-month-old infants but coded offline from video-recordings of looking behaviour for newborns. While the use of an eye tracker may result in a more accurate and objective recording of saccadic latency than laboratory observation, it should not influence the pattern of attentional behaviour shown by participants. Instead, we conclude that the change in the pattern of attentional behaviour from birth to 4 months is not artefactual but real, and that our results fit the early and rapid development of face processing in the first year of life that mainly result from postnatal face experience. As outlined in the introduction, stimulus properties that elicit face preference undergo considerable developmental change in the first few months of life. Newborns, with their minimal experience with faces, prefer not only faces but also non-face like patterns that share certain structural properties with faces, i.e. top-heavy properties or congruency, suggesting that they possess facial representation in which only very general structural properties are embedded. For these infants, movement, which easily triggers attention from birth, may compete with attention to upright faces, hence weakening the newborn's attentional orientating toward faces. Such competitive rather than facilitative effect of motion information on newborn's attention to face would account for the lack of any advantage for upright faces in Experiment 1. Consistent with this, the results from Experiment 2 demonstrated that motion information dominates face orientation in eliciting an orienting response from newborns.\n\n    By 3-months of age, infants develop more specific representations of facial configuration, with more realistic facial characteristics required to elicit face preference in infants. Perhaps because they encounter faces nearly exclusively in motion during their daily interactions, motion information is also shown to facilitate perception and attention to faces in infants by around 4-months of age. In line with these previous findings our results suggest that movement of a real face elicits and supports attention and rapid orienting towards faces in 4-month-old infants unless the movements are in competition with face orientation. Overall, we believe that the current report has demonstrated that face orientation and motion differently affect the deployment of visual attention in newborns and 4-month-old infants\n\n    Visual experience with faces is anyway not the only opportunity that infants have to learn about people. Indeed the infants are not passive observers and their motor experience and emerging exploration skills increase their spontaneous interest in and attention towards faces. For example, self-produced reaching experience strengthens a spontaneous preference for faces over objects in 3-month-old infants and facilitates infants' perception and understanding of observed action. Moreover infants' motor activity level, assessed via parent report, predicts face preference in 3-month-old infants. These findings suggest that new motor skills provide infants with different ways to interact with others, and alter their attention to and engagement with social interaction partners. Given that motor ability advances considerably during the first 4 months of life, it creates opportunities for infants to interact with objects and people in new and progressively more sophisticated ways. This, in turn, increases motor and social stimulations, and impose infants with an increased need to dynamically shift and guide their attention. At the same time, increased motor and social stimulations may also boost their social development. Interestingly, a study in mice have shown that an enriched environment that provide pups with more opportunities for motor activity and social exchanges accelerates the development of visual system. Considering that the development of motor skills in infants is associated with increased motor and social stimulations, it would act to enrich social environment. Consequently, it may act to accelerate social development. When considered together, not only passive experience with faces, but also the development of motor skills and the resultant active engagement with others would jointly account for the currently observed developmental change in the orienting behaviour in the first 4-months of life.",

        "Title": "    Heterogeneity of germline variants in high risk breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in India",
        "Abstract": "    Breast and ovarian cancers now account for one in three cancers in Indian women and their incidence is rising. Major differences in the clinical presentation of breast and ovarian cancers exist between India and the United Kingdom. For example, Indian patients with breast cancer typically present a decade earlier than in the UK. Reasons for this could be multifactorial, including differences in underlying biology, environmental risks, and other systematic factors including access to screening. One possible explanation lies in variable incidence or penetrance of germline mutations in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. We performed a methodical database and literature review to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of high-risk cancer susceptibility genes in Indian patients with breast and ovarian cancers. We identified 148 articles, but most studies were small, with inconsistent inclusion criteria and based on heterogeneous technologies, so that mutation frequency could not be reliably ascertained. Data were also often lacking on penetrance, histopathology, and survival outcomes. After filtering out unsuitable studies, only 13 remained, comprising 1028 patients. Large-scale research studies are urgently needed to determine mutation prevalence, spectra, and clinico-pathological features, and hence derive guidelines for screening, treatment, and prevention specific to the Indian population.",
        "Introduction": "    The global cancer burden is expected to increase from 14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012, to 21.7 million cases and 13 million deaths by 2030. However, these large numbers are contrasted by the very diverse nature of cancer that makes every patient unique. Precision medicine has enormous potential to transform cancer care by identifying genomic and epigenetic markers for screening, treatment, and prognosis. These gains are particularly relevant for countries such as India, grappling with both a rising cancer burden and competing demands for essential health care. India's cancer burden, currently estimated at over 1.5 million new cases is predicted to nearly double in the next 20 years, with age-adjusted mortality rates of 64.5 per 100 000 (GLOBOCAN 2012). Cumulatively, breast, cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancers account for more than 70% of cancers in women in India, thus establishing tackling women's cancers as high priority for healthcare providers and research.\n\n    Significant phenotypic differences exist in breast and ovarian cancers between patients in India and in the UK. The incidence of breast and ovarian cancer is relatively low in India in comparison with the UK: breast cancer 23.8 versus 92.9 cases per 100 000 women in the UK, ovarian cancer 4.9 versus 11.7/100 000 women in the UK (GLOBOCAN 2012). However, a high proportion (~11-26%) of Indian patients with breast cancer present at ages younger than 35 years. Conversely, approximately half of newly diagnosed breast and ovarian cancer cases occur in women aged 65 years and older in the UK, compared with only 15% in India (Fig. 1). The incidence of the more aggressive histological type of breast cancer, triple-negative disease, is also estimated to be higher at 31% in India, nearly double that of the UK. Breast cancer incidence also fluctuates substantially across India, with age-standardised incidence rates varying between 41/100 000 rate in urban centres such as New Delhi and 12.4/100 000 in rural cancer registries, thus adding a further layer of complexity.\n\n    These phenotypic differences could be a result of differences in tumour biology such as differences in the incidence of high-risk germline susceptibility genes, environmental modifiers, or systematic factors such as access to screening and treatment. Germline mutations in high-risk susceptibility genes (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2) account for 5-10% of breast cancers and up to 20% of ovarian cancers in white Europeans. Women with a germline BRCA1 mutation have a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer by age 70 years of up to 63% and of breast cancer by age 70 years of up to 85%. Risks of ovarian and breast cancers in women by age 70 years among BRCA2 carriers are reported to be up to 27% and 84%, respectively. Other genes in which germline mutations confer susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer, albeit with lower frequency and penetrance include PALB2, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, STK11, CHEK2, RAD51, and ATM.\n\n    We systematically reviewed the literature and relevant data repositories to characterise the prevalence and spectrum of germline variants in breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in the Indian population, including putative BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations. We excluded SNPs with high frequency in the population. We investigated the literature for details of clinical, family history, pathology, and survival data in these patients.",
        "Methods": "    A comprehensive literature search was performed to include articles published between 1 January 1990 and 1 December 2016 using the following search terms on ethnicity, condition, and high penetrance genes (Table 1): 'India and (breast cancer or ovarian cancer) and (BRCA1 or BRCA2 or PALB2 or TP53 or PTEN or CDH1 or STK11 or CHEK2 or RAD51C or RAD51D or ATM or BARD1 or NBN or MLH1 or MSH2 or MSH6 or PMS2 or EPCAM)' in EMBASE and PubMed/Medline to identify relevant published and unpublished studies as well as studies in progress. Further searches were carried out in the BIC database using the keyword 'Indian' in the ethnicity fields and also in the ClinVar database. Additional database searches included the 1000genomes, TCGA, COSMIC, dbSNP, ICGC, HGMD, ExAC, and the GWAS catalog.\n\n    This initial search was supplemented by checking reference lists, and contact with authors of included studies for information on any relevant published or unpublished studies. No language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and keywords to select potentially relevant studies from the retrieved list of articles.\n\n    All studies included in the analysis met the following inclusion criteria: (i) data reported on any genes included in Table 1; (ii) at least 10 patients of Indian origin; and (iii) contained DNA sequence variation data. The susceptibility genes selected are those commonly tested in clinical practice. Lynch syndrome genes were included as they confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer in addition to colon and uterine cancers (Table 1). Importantly, inclusion was not restricted by NCCN or Manchester definitions of familial risk to ensure broad inclusion of studies with available data.\n\n    The exclusion criteria were: (i) articles containing data limited to loss of heterozygosity and/or methylation studies; (ii) duplicate publications; (iii) studies that did not perform direct DNA sequencing to validate variants detected by PCR-based techniques using re-amplified genomic DNA; and (iv) studies that did not screen the entire susceptibility gene. If studies had overlapping data, only the latest or largest study was included (Fig. 2).\n\n    The first step of a two-stage selection process involved screening titles and abstracts. Subsequently, for all references categorised as 'include' or 'uncertain' by both reviewers, full text was retrieved wherever possible and final inclusion decisions were made on the full paper. Data extraction was carried out using pre-designed and piloted data extraction forms with differences resolved by consensus and/or arbitration involving a third reviewer.\n\n    Three reviewers extracted detailed information relating to variants; clinical evidence, including family history when available; clinical diagnosis; and histopathology. The information collected included the following: year of publication; authors' names; journal; geographic location of study; cancer type; genotyping methods; details of germline variant, total numbers of cases and controls; frequencies of variant carriers in cases and controls; histopathology; overall and progression-free survival where available; and age of presentation.\n\n    All variants extracted from the publications were queried against the BIC database for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and ClinVar to confirm whether they had been reported previously by other studies and to obtain their pathogenic classification. The SNP identifier for each of the variants, where available, was obtained from the dbSNP database.",
        "Results": "    The combined search for key terms led to the selection of 148 articles. After screening titles, abstract, and keywords, we extracted 120 full texts of articles considered eligible for inclusion. After reviewing the full texts and citations, we identified 67 studies meeting the inclusion criteria of which 31 contained data suitable for extraction. Of the 31 articles, only 13 articles contained usable data that satisfied both the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig. 2, Table 2). These publications included familial breast and/or ovarian cancer as well as sporadic cases. For the purposes of this review, we used a broad definition of FEOTN (familial/early-onset/triple-negative) based on the studies included in the review, specifically one or more of the following: at least one first-degree relative with breast and/or ovarian cancer irrespective of age; early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer diagnosed with a family history; relatives affected first or second degree; triple-negative breast cancer in an early onset case; or bilateral breast cancer diagnosed < 50 years. Data were included from probands and from family members who were carriers, where given. We also included data from sporadic cancer patients where the paper contained this information. However, none of the publications on sporadic cases reviewed reported any pathogenic germline variants and therefore we focused our analysis on FEOTN cases (Fig. 2).\n\n    We identified a total of 1028 breast and/or ovarian cancer cases from the 13 studies. A breakdown of the number of studies from different categories of breast and/or ovarian cancer is presented in Table 3. The majority of the studies were conducted in or near the largest cities of India with the exception of two that were carried out within the Indian populations of Malaysia and Singapore. The patients recruited in any study usually resided in or near the big cities, which are densely populated and are more affluent than the rural populations of India (Fig. 3).\n\n    Many different platforms were used for genetic testing in the 13 studies, with the majority using PCR-based approaches including hetero-duplex formation, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC), and Sanger sequencing.\n\n    Only two studies with a cohort size of 141 and 91 used next generation sequencing (NGS) with Illumina HiScanSQ system, and these also reported the highest proportions of variants in the cohort.\n\n    All 13 FEOTN publications reported data on BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 and only three studies tested for other susceptibility genes such as TP53, RAD50, RAD52, ATM, and CHEK2, with mutations in these found very rarely if at all. We therefore limited our analysis to BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Twelve studies reported previously identified pathogenic BRCA1 variants and 10 reported novel variants they considered likely to be pathogenic. The novel variants were not present in any of the online databases listed in the Methods section. Initially, we considered variants causing protein truncation only to be likely pathogenic. We then predicted the functional effects of non synonymous missense variants using SIFT, PolyPhen and CADD and identified 2 additional variants, 5360A>C and 5377G>A, considered deleterious/probably damaging by all three algorithms (Supplementary Table 1). In total, we identified 26 previously reported pathogenic variants and 18 novel likely pathogenic variants for BRCA1 from a total cohort of 926 (Tables 4 and 5). In combination, the previously reported and the novel variants were detected in 71/926 cases, 39 of whom carried the 'Ashkenazi' 185delAG mutation.\n\n    For BRCA1, there were seven additional recurrent mutations, five in BIC and/or ClinVar and two that were novel (Tables 4 and 5). Of the five previously reported variants, c.2275C>T, c.2338C>T, c.3352C>T, and 4838delAGinsGCC each occurred in two cases and the other, c.4485-1G>A, occurred in three cases. The two novel variants were c.1052delT and c.632insT, the former detected in four cases and the latter in two cases, all from single studies (Table 5).\n\n    For BRCA2, there were four variants previously reported as pathogenic in ClinVar detected in the FEOTN cases; these were detected in 6/974 cases. The only recurrent variant, 6079del4, was detected in 3/974 cases from two different studies (Table 6). The number of variants reported to be novel and likely pathogenic was 16, and each of these variants was detected in single cases in single studies (Table 7). Furthermore, there were 9 non synonymous missense variants of which only one,c.3578T>C, was considered deleterious/probably damaging by SIFT, POlyphen and CADD (Supplementary Table 2).\n\n    Ten of the 13 studies reported data on the putative founder mutation BRCA1 185delAG (Fig. S1, see online supplementary material). The mutation was detected in 39/927 (4.2%) cases with breast or ovarian cancer, the majority being from South India or Malaysians of Indian descent. The frequency of 185delAG varied, for example one study from New Delhi found only one carrier in 204 cases, but a high prevalence was reported in Bangalore (10/61 cases, 0/100 controls, Fisher exact test P = 3.7x10-5) and Chennai (10/91 cases, 0/2 controls) (Table 2).\n\n    The reported BRCA2 founder mutation 6174delT was not detected in any of the studies included in our analysis. Frequencies of BRCA mutations identified in the included studies in the Indian population are contrasted with those of white European populations (Tables 4 and 6).\n\n    The BIC and the ClinVar databases contain DNA sequence variations reported by genetics clinics from across the world. The majority of the DNA variants in these repositories are unpublished. The most frequent reported entry in BIC for the BRCA1 gene was 185delAG, which was also the most prevalent in our analysis (Table 8). Eight out of the 20 top entries in BIC were also detected in our literature survey, although not all of these variants were shown to be pathogenic (Table 8). None of the pathogenic BRCA2 variants identified from our literature search were present in the top 20 BIC entries for BRCA2 (Table 9).\n\n    A search in BIC using the keyword 'Indian' in the ethnicity field revealed 23 BRCA1 variants and 11 BRCA2 variants. All these variants were detected in patients of Indian descent from Singapore or Malaysia. Seven of the BRCA1 variants were present in our dataset collated from the literature (Tables 10 and 11). However, of the seven variants that overlapped, only two (180delA and 185delAG) were classed as pathogenic in BIC and ClinVar (Tables 10 and 11). Of the 11 BRCA2 variants present in BIC with Indian ethnicity, three were also present in our literature dataset and of the three only one was classed as pathogenic, Q2957X. Another interesting observation was that the BRCA2 variant E1593D present in both our dataset and in the subset of 11 BIC variants, was also reported in two additional Pakistani patients in BIC.\n\n    The same search performed in ClinVar with 'Indian' detected 40 variants for BRCA1 and 30 for BRCA2, which included all variants also present in BIC.\n\n    Individual searches in additional databases such as TCGA, ICGC, dbSNP, GWAS catalogue, COSMIC, and HGMD did not yield any results. Although these databases contain ethnicity data, they use a very broad definition of 'Asians', yet the ethnicity data in the 1000genome database are region-specific and therefore this makes comparisons difficult. Furthermore, there were no data in ICGC on breast and ovarian cancers from India.\n\n    Studies in the literature used very heterogeneous criteria to define a family history of disease. Mutation prevalence in women with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer was presented in 11 of the 13 studies, but only seven of these provided clear criteria for family history (>=1 first degree relative affected with breast or ovarian cancer at any age). Women with sporadic breast or ovarian cancer were reported in seven publications. None of the 13 studies provided penetrance data. One small study with 91 patients presented survival information and found no significant association with pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\n\n    Two studies provided some data on breast cancer histopathology, with none describing complete histological details such as grade of cancer, hormone receptor, and HER2 status. Eachkoti et al. reported the majority of cases (22/25) to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) with two inflammatory carcinomas (an aggressive type of breast cancer) and one Paget's disease. Similarly Thirthagiri et al. identified IDC as the commonest histological type for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Where grade was available, tumours were of grade 2 and 3, with no grade 1 tumours identified. BRCA1 tumours were largely triple negative and less commonly HER2 positive, whereas BRCA2 tumours were more likely to be hormone receptor positive. The data, however, were not available for the three markers in eight cases and for at least one of the three markers in an additional seven cases out of the total 28 tumours included. No studies were identified including information on the histology of ovarian tumours.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We have reported the findings of a methodical review of reported germline variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other high-penetrance breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes within women of Indian descent. Our searches highlight both the diversity of the Indian population as well as the paucity of data on germline variants in these genes in the Indian population. There are very limited Indian-specific data and, even where these are available, there is great variability in inclusion criteria, definition of high-risk groups (such as those with a family history), mutation detection methods, geographical origin, and ethnicity, thus making any India-wide assessment unreliable. The small cohort size mean that the spectrum of mutations identified in BRCA genes is unlikely to be representative of the Indian population and is indeterminate for other high-risk susceptibility genes in this population. Our searches have identified 18 BRCA1 and 16 BRCA2 variants in the Indian population that had not been previously reported elsewhere, nor currently present in BIC or ClinVar. There were no studies of sporadic or unselected cases and also very limited data on penetrance or survival that could be used for calculating cancer risks and hence implementing counselling and screening in Indian populations.\n\n    The spectra of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been characterized in a number of different populations worldwide, with significant variation among populations in the contributions of these genes to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Founder mutations account for differing proportions of cancer in different populations; for example in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [12], three founder mutations have a combined population frequency of 2% and represent 60% of breast cancer families with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. Similarly, BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations account for 78% of families with hereditary breast cancer in Chile.\n\n    Our search reveals a much lower frequency (2.3%; 39/1700) of the putative Ashkenazi founder mutation 185delAG in Indian patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer. The carriers of this mutation were usually from the south of India. Other studies have explored how this variant arose in the Indian population. Kadalmani et al. examined the haplotypes of carriers of this variant and their families, and concluded that it arose independently from the Ashkenazi variant. Another study by Laitman et al. came to a similar conclusion based on haplotype analyses of carriers from ethnically diverse backgrounds, which included Indians from Cochin, south India. Other founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were not detected in any of the Indian patients with breast and ovarian cancers, and no India-specific founder mutations were detected.\n\n    Our literature search shows that variation in the prevalence of high-penetrance alleles in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 may contribute to the reported differences in breast and ovarian cancer incidence across India, in Indians in other countries, and between India and the west. The earlier average age of breast cancer among Indian women is especially intriguing in this respect. Data are, however, very limited and have not been collected systematically in terms of inclusion criteria, details such as family history, and critical clinical co-variates such as histopathology. Furthermore, very limited work has been published to address environmental risk factors specific to the Indian population and distinct from Western populations, such as consanguineous marriage, betel quid consumption, and pregnancies. Current guidelines on cancer screening and prevention in gene carriers are based on evidence predominantly derived from white populations of northern European origins. Work is needed to modify existing risk-prediction models such as Manchester or BOADICEA for use in women of different ethnicities. Indeed, previous work has found that overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive-predictive values were lower in the Asian population than in Caucasian populations. In conclusion, there is an urgent unmet need for large-scale studies in geographically distinct regions, with high-quality data and longitudinal studies of relatives to help elucidate the role of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in the Indian population. Understanding these differences through research to derive India-specific paradigms for diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment is critical and essential to improving women's health in India. Clinics in countries with the Indian diaspora and established clinical genetics services may be able to contribute to penetrance and survival data and further tease out the differences in environmental risk factors between Indian diaspora and Indian patients.",

        "Title": "    Where genotype is not predictive of phenotype: towards an understanding of the molecular basis of reduced penetrance in human inherited disease",
        "Abstract": "    Some individuals with a particular disease-causing mutation or genotype fail to express most if not all features of the disease in question, a phenomenon that is known as 'reduced (or incomplete) penetrance'. Reduced penetrance is not uncommon; indeed, there are many known examples of 'disease-causing mutations' that fail to cause disease in at least a proportion of the individuals who carry them. Reduced penetrance may therefore explain not only why genetic diseases are occasionally transmitted through unaffected parents, but also why healthy individuals can harbour quite large numbers of potentially disadvantageous variants in their genomes without suffering any obvious ill effects. Reduced penetrance can be a function of the specific mutation(s) involved or of allele dosage. It may also result from differential allelic expression, copy number variation or the modulating influence of additional genetic variants in cis or in trans. The penetrance of some pathogenic genotypes is known to be age- and/or sex-dependent. Variable penetrance may also reflect the action of unlinked modifier genes, epigenetic changes or environmental factors. At least in some cases, complete penetrance appears to require the presence of one or more genetic variants at other loci. In this review, we summarize the evidence for reduced penetrance being a widespread phenomenon in human genetics and explore some of the molecular mechanisms that may help to explain this enigmatic characteristic of human inherited disease.",
        "Introduction": "    One old conundrum in human genetics is that not everyone with a given pathological mutation (or mutations) will eventually develop the disease in question. The proportion of those individuals harbouring a particular pathogenic mutation or genotype who exhibit clinical signs of the associated disorder within a specific and clearly defined time period is termed the penetrance of that disorder. If this proportion equals 100 %, the disease and/or disease genotype(s) are said to show complete penetrance. If not, they are said to exhibit reduced (or incomplete) penetrance. Reduced penetrance is likely to be a consequence of the combination of a variety of different genetic and environmental factors. A classic example is phenylketonuria, where inactivating mutations in the PAH gene encoding the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase lead to severe intellectual disability in the context of a normal diet, whereas a life-long phenylalanine-restricted diet makes possible a relatively healthy life (Blau et al.). Regrettably, few other examples of reduced penetrance are as simple, well understood or clinically manipulable as this one, and the precise mechanisms by which different factors give rise to reduced penetrance remain largely unknown (Zlotogora).\n\n    In formal terms, penetrance measures the proportion of individuals in a given population with a specific disease-associated genotype who also express the corresponding disease phenotype. Large family/population studies have traditionally been considered necessary to measure penetrance, either for specific mutations/genotypes or as a disease average. 'Cascade genetic screening', whereby relatives of previously identified carriers are screened both for the mutation(s) in question and for the presence/absence of clinical symptoms, is one means to determine the degree of penetrance for a given genotype (Berge et al.). As we discuss below, large-scale sequencing and genotyping studies of apparently healthy individuals from the general population provide a powerful new approach to understanding the penetrance of pathological mutations/genotypes. The outcomes of such studies should allow us to predict how likely it is that a given disease will manifest itself in an individual who carries a specific genotype.\n\n    Reduced penetrance is most obviously evident in disorders that follow an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. In these instances, reduced penetrance is a characteristic of the underlying mutation, rather than a genotype. However, reduced penetrance can also occur in autosomal recessive disorders where one and the same mutation can have different phenotypic effects, depending at least in part upon the second disease allele present. Irrespective of the mode of inheritance, in most cases penetrance is likely to be a function of the specific mutation(s) involved. Thus, in some conditions normally characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, two incompletely penetrant (or otherwise non-penetrant) alleles may act in recessive fashion while mimicking the normal dominant form of the disease (e.g. Grundy et al.; Croxen et al.; Kowalewski et al.; Castaman et al.; Rossetti et al.; Vujic et al.; Schaaf et al.). For a dominantly inherited condition, one consequence of reduced penetrance is that the clinical phenotype may not be evident in one generation, but can nevertheless still be transmitted (through an apparently unaffected parent) to subsequent generations where it again manifests itself; specimen examples of this from clinical practice include hereditary hyperekplexia (Kwok et al.), cherubism (Preda et al.), retinitis pigmentosa (Rio Frio et al.), rhabdoid tumour predisposition syndrome (Ammerlaan et al.), autism spectrum disorder (Fujita-Jimbo et al.) and hypercholesterolaemia (Garcia-Garcia et al.). For all the above reasons, reduced penetrance presents a major challenge to genetic counsellors attempting to interpret the medical history of a patient's family to quantify the disease risk to the patient's offspring (Emery; Otto and Maestrelli).\n\n    Reduced penetrance is not uncommon; indeed, there are many known examples of bona fide disease-causing variants or genotypes that fail to cause disease in at least a proportion of individuals who carry them (Zlotogora; Waalen and Beutler). By definition, penetrance refers to the black and white issue of whether the clinical phenotype associated with a certain genotype is present or not. We routinely distinguish it from variable expressivity which refers to the degree of variation of the clinical phenotype in those individuals with a particular genotype. Although, in principle, penetrance and expressivity are distinct terms with specific meanings (depending upon the way a given clinical phenotype is defined), in practice they are closely inter-related and likely to manifest via similar mechanisms. We also distinguish reduced penetrance from small effect size. Thus, most carriers of the risk alleles discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may never develop the disease in question; this is because these variants generally only make a small contribution to the multifactorial aetiology of the condition. To be able instead to say that the variant is non-penetrant in some individuals, we require the same variant in other individual(s) to make the crucial difference between the phenotype being manifested or not. In what follows, we shall focus specifically on the molecular mechanisms that could account for the phenomenon of reduced penetrance. This notwithstanding, the discussion of genetic variants that modulate the expressivity of a particular disease has sometimes also been deemed appropriate.\n\n    In this review, we present the evidence for reduced penetrance being a widespread phenomenon in human genetics, evidence that comes not only from a plethora of case studies of monogenic disorders but also more recently from the next generation sequencing of entire exomes or genomes of apparently normal healthy individuals from the general population. Here, we have attempted to explore the individual genetic components that contribute to the complexity of primarily monogenic disorders with reduced penetrance. This notwithstanding, the action of modifier genes is one of the mechanisms responsible for reduced penetrance, and one that has increasingly become recognized as blurring the distinction between monogenic conditions and complex disease (Nadeau; Badano and Katsanis; Sidransky). Finally, we explore some of the molecular mechanisms which could account for the reduced penetrance of many human inherited disorders and provide evidence to support the view that, at least in some instances, complete penetrance requires the presence of one or more genetic variants at other loci.\n\n    In the wake of the sequencing of multiple human genomes, it has become apparent that healthy individuals can harbour quite large numbers of potentially disadvantageous variants without suffering any obvious ill effects (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium; MacArthur et al.; Xue et al.; Shen et al.). The underlying reasons are likely to be many and varied: thus, the variants may damage the protein in question but the intact protein may not be necessary for the health of the carrier; individuals may be asymptomatic carriers of single-mutant alleles that could, in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity, cause recessive disease; the mutation may be dominant but the clinical phenotype might only be mild and classed as lying within the range of normal healthy variation; the disorder might be late in onset with expression being age- or sex-dependent; or the disorder may require additional genetic and/or environmental factors for it to manifest clinically.\n\n    Assessing the magnitude of the 'genetic burden' imposed on the general population by the presence of deleterious alleles has been a key aim of medical and population genetics for many decades. With the advent of large-scale sequencing technologies, it has become possible to estimate the number of amino acid substitutions in the human exome that would be predicted in silico to be damaging (Kryukov et al.; Lohmueller et al.; Boyko et al.; Goode et al.). However, personal genome sequences have not only provided estimates of the number of disease variants carried by each subject (Asan et al.), but have also given us a glimpse of the likely complexity of the functional interpretation of such data (Ashley et al.; Strom and Gorin). More recently, Tennessen et al. suggested that 2.3 % of the 13,595 single nucleotide variants carried by the average person impact upon protein function, involving ~313 genes per human genome. Adopting an alternative approach, Bell et al. surveyed 437 genes known to be related to a recessive Mendelian disease and identified 2.8 mutations per individual (range 0-7). Taken together, these studies suggest that individuals typically carry hundreds of mildly disadvantageous variants and perhaps several tens of potentially severe disease alleles.\n\n    In a pilot study for the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, we reported the prevalence of disease alleles, defined by reference to the disease-causing mutations (DMs) listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD; http://www.hgmd.org; Stenson et al.), in population samples of African, European and East Asian origin. These numbers were surprisingly high: 57-80 disease alleles per individual in a sample of 179 participants. Moreover, further examination of these data showed that 191 disease alleles were present in the homozygous state in at least one individual, and hence were not simply present because their phenotypic/clinical effects had been masked by a normal allele. Although little phenotypic information other than sex, ethnicity, place of origin and relationship to other participants is available for the 1000 Genomes Project donors, the Project's ethical framework requires that sample donors are non-vulnerable adults who are competent to consent to participation in the project and hence are likely to lack any obvious severe disease phenotype. Instead, we need to seek some other explanation for the high number of DMs present. One possibility is that the penetrance of disease alleles and genotypes could be much lower and more variable than previously realized. Conventionally, most studies of human inherited disease that have contributed mutation data to HGMD have sought to identify a disease genotype, given a clinical phenotype (Cooper et al.). This is a very different scenario from identifying a phenotype given a (potentially disease associated) genotype. Indeed, the former strategy inevitably avoids the whole issue of penetrance because, by definition, it focuses exclusively upon those individuals in whom the mutation of interest has been penetrant. It follows that a given variant could be genuinely causative in a set of individuals manifesting a particular disease, yet may also be present in a set of healthy individuals who differ in any one of a number of ways to be discussed below.\n\n    Since the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium paper was published in 2010, two further reports have appeared that served to improve our knowledge of deleterious mutations in the genomes of apparently healthy individuals. The most readily recognized deleterious variants in the human genome are those that disrupt a protein-coding gene, either by leading to a loss of function (e.g. a nonsense or frameshift variant) or by altering an amino acid in the encoded protein (missense variants). The former category of mutation has been studied by MacArthur et al. who identified 1,285 putative loss-of-function variants (i.e. nonsense mutations, splice site-disrupting single nucleotide variants, micro-insertions/micro-deletions, etc.) in the genome sequences of 185 humans from the 1000 Genomes Project. From these data, they estimated that an average human genome typically contains ~100 genuine loss-of-function variants with ~20 genes having both copies inactivated. Following on from this study, Xue et al. focused on missense mutations, ascertaining the numbers of potentially deleterious missense variants in the genomes of apparently healthy individuals using low-coverage whole-genome sequence data from 179 individuals in the 1000 Genomes Pilot Project. Each individual was found to carry 281-515 missense substitutions predicted with a high degree of confidence to be damaging to the gene product, 40-85 of which were present in the homozygous state. Taken together, these studies suggest that a typical healthy individual has about 80 of their genes severely damaged or inactivated in both copies, further emphasizing the stark contrast between damage to gene and protein on the one hand, and damage to health on the other. The 1000 Genomes Project participants also carried 40-110 variants (3-24 homozygous) classified by HGMD as DMs. Whereas many of these DMs could conceivably represent disease attribution errors of some kind, between 0 and 8 DMs per individual (0-1 homozygous) were predicted to be highly damaging.\n\n    Among the missense DMs, Xue et al. identified known pathological variants such as HBB (c.20A>T; p.Glu7Val), which leads to increased resistance to malaria in heterozygotes but to sickle cell disease in homozygotes [confined to Africans (Yoruba, YRI) in whom there were 12 heterozygotes and 1 homozygote]. In addition, Xue et al. identified an USH2A variant (c.2138G>C; p.Gly713Arg), previously reported as being causal for Usher syndrome type 2, a recessive disorder characterized by combined deafness and blindness; three homozygotes were noted in the YRI. Manual curation of the HGMD-1000GP overlap revealed the presence of three types of DM: (1) plausible severe disease-causing variants, (2) variants convincingly causative for pathological conditions, yet quite compatible with adult life and (3) variants probably incorrectly assigned as disease causing. After applying various filtering criteria designed to enrich for true disease alleles, the list was reduced to 45 candidates (Xue et al.). Of these putative disease alleles, 34 were present in the heterozygous state and were deemed likely to be present in asymptomatic carriers. Among the remaining 11 (Table 1), the 6 linked to dominant disorders were explicable in terms of either late onset (e.g. Gly507Arg in MYBPC3) or covert disease (Arg208His in SERPIND1). In similar vein, the presence of homozygotes for four of the five recessive disorders could be explicable in terms of late onset and/or reduced penetrance of disease. The USH2A mutation (Gly713Arg) was, however, intriguing: this variant was predicted to be damaging to the protein, and pathogenic in some populations but not in others (e.g. YRI). One explanation put forward to explain this apparent contradiction was that, in the YRI population, the USH2A locus is subject to copy number variation (Matsuzaki et al.) that could provide functional complementation of the mutant gene. In the majority of cases, however, the most likely explanation for the absence of disease at the time of recruitment was considered to be the probable late onset of disease, although clinical penetrance was often variable, and some phenotypes, such as loose anagen hair syndrome [caused by Glu337Lys in KRT75 (MIM 600628)], might not even be regarded as \"diseases\" sensu stricto. These factors notwithstanding, the findings of Xue et al. suggest that incidental findings which are potentially relevant to health and well-being might be made in as many as 11 % of individuals sequenced.\n\n    Reduced penetrance is one of several possible explanations for why some variants of putative pathological significance, listed in HGMD and/or Locus-specific Mutation Databases, nevertheless occur in apparently healthy individuals (Ashley et al.; Bell et al.; Xue et al.; Golbus et al.; Wang et al.; Kenna et al.; Shen et al.). It is not hard to see why reduced penetrance might be much more common among described mutations than originally thought: whereas known pathological mutations have almost invariably been identified through retrospective analyses of families or well-defined groups of clinically symptomatic patients, relatively few prospective studies of asymptomatic carriers have so far been performed to derive estimates of penetrance (e.g. Jensen et al.; Mavaddat et al.). Indeed, establishing that a specific mutation identified in a particular patient with a given disease is the pathological lesion responsible for that individual's clinical phenotype does not allow one automatically to judge whether this mutant genotype will invariably give rise to the same clinical phenotype in all other individuals harbouring it. This can only be established (or refuted) empirically by comprehensive, ideally prospective, studies of the genotype in question.\n\n    One fairly obvious reason why comparing the output of genome sequencing projects (e.g. the 1000 Genomes Project) with a comprehensive database of putatively pathological mutations (e.g. HGMD) is likely to generate a considerable number of potentially pathogenic mutations in the general population, is that many such mutations are quite frequent in the population at large. In particular, carrier frequencies for mutations underlying recessive conditions can often be quite high. Thus, the ABCA4 Gly863Ala mutation causing Stargardt disease has a carrier frequency of 1.8 % in Europe (Maugeri et al.), the GJB2 35delG mutation causing congenital deafness has a carrier frequency of 2.9 % in southern Europe (Gasparini et al.), the ERCC8 Tyr322Term mutation causing Cockayne syndrome has a carrier frequency of 6.8 % in Israeli Christian Arabs (Khayat et al.) and the SPG7 Ala510Val mutation associated with adult-onset neurogenetic disease has a carrier frequency of 3-4 % in the UK population (Roxburgh et al.). Disease allele frequencies can be as high as 10 % in certain ethnic groups, e.g. Jews (Zlotogora et al.; Ostrer and Skorecki). A recent screen of the Korean population for 20 common mutations contributing to six autosomal recessive disorders yielded a combined carrier frequency of 6.7 % (Song et al.). Screening an ethnically diverse US population sample (N = 364,890) for 87 different CFTR mutations responsible for causing cystic fibrosis yielded a combined carrier frequency of 2.6 % (Rohlfs et al.). As part of the NHLBI-Go Exome Sequencing Project, a screen of 5,400 individuals from the general population for variants in eight long QT syndrome genes yielded a total of 33 different missense mutations (affecting 173 alleles), representing a carrier frequency of 3.2 % (Refsgaard et al.). A similar screen for cardiomyopathy-associated gene variants yielded combined carrier frequencies for mutations reported to be disease associated of 25 % (1,474/5,810) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 15 % (963/6,334) for dilated cardiomyopathy and (22 %) 1,393/6,359 for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (Andreasen et al.); the high number of detected cardiomyopathy-associated gene variants suggests, however, that many are only modest disease modifiers or even non-pathogenic. Nishiguchi and Rivolta screened 46 complete genome sequences from the general population for mutations in 106 genes associated with recessively inherited retinal degeneration and identified null mutations in ten individuals (22 %). Finally, a routine screen of 23,453 individuals for 417 pathogenic mutations associated with a total of 108 recessive diseases concluded that 24 % of individuals were carriers of at least one disorder, whilst 5.2 % were carriers of two or more disorders (Lazarin et al.). Clearly, there is a veritable abundance of actual and potential pathological variants segregating in the general population.\n\n    The examples that we cite in the text that follows and in the accompanying tables are by no means comprehensive and have been provided simply to illustrate the many and varied mechanisms that are already known to underlie the phenomenon of reduced penetrance in relation to clinical disorders. However, these examples also demonstrate that it is often very hard for authors, diagnosticians and mutation database curators alike to classify the pathogenicity of identified variants with any degree of certainty. Thus, is a given missense mutation a bona fide pathological lesion that exhibits greatly reduced penetrance, or is it essentially a neutral or near-neutral variant that occasionally finds itself in cis to other variants that are responsible for conferring the disease phenotype upon the individual concerned, or is it a variant with small effect that is sometimes present in affected individuals whose major causative lesions remain unknown?\n\n    A considerable number of autosomal dominant disorders are characterized by incomplete penetrance. Well-studied examples include the hair disease monilethrix (KRT86; De Cruz et al.), congenital cataract (GJA3; Burdon et al.), different types of retinitis pigmentosa (PRPF8 and PRPF31; Maubaret et al.; Saini et al.), LMNA mutation-associated muscular phenotypes (Rankin et al.) and long QT syndrome (Giudicessi and Ackerman; Mathias et al.).\n\n    One rather well-understood example of incomplete penetrance of a dominantly inherited mutation is factor V Leiden (F5, Arg534Gln; Arg506Gln in legacy nomenclature; rs6025) which occurs at polymorphic frequencies (2-5 %) in European populations, but is associated with a sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis and a two- to threefold increased risk of pregnancy loss (Kujovich). Despite these very evident disease associations, the vast majority of factor V Leiden carriers appear to be clinically unaffected. This could help to account for the high frequency of this variant in the general population, together perhaps with the survival advantage conferred by factor V Leiden carriership in various other clinical contexts including severe sepsis (Kerlin et al.; van Mens et al.). In similar vein, the asymptomatic (clinically covert) state is much more common than the clinically overt state in several other dominant disorders of haemostasis, including protein C deficiency (Tait et al.; McColl et al.), protein S deficiency (Dykes et al.), antithrombin deficiency (Tait et al.; McColl et al.) and von Willebrand disease (Rodeghiero et al.; Castaman et al.). Thus, in disorders of haemostasis and thrombosis, even with well-characterized variants that are known to confer a significantly increased disease risk, the clinical penetrance is often so low that more healthy individuals carry the variant than those who actually manifest disease.\n\n    Reduced or incomplete penetrance has also been described for autosomal recessive disorders. Probably the best characterized example of incomplete penetrance in a recessive disorder is provided by the Cys282Tyr (rs1800562) mutation in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene (Beutler). The Tyr282 homozygous genotype is present in approximately 1 in 200 people of Northern European origin and is responsible for 80-90 % of hereditary haemochromatosis (Weiss; Rochette et al.). Although Tyr282 homozygosity displays a relatively high biochemical penetrance (i.e. iron accumulation), its clinical penetrance is low (McCune et al.). Available data suggest that 38-50 % of Tyr282 homozygotes develop iron overload and 10-25 % develop some type of haemochromatosis-associated morbidity (Whitlock et al.). However, these statistics conceal what appears to be a gender effect: large-scale studies of newly diagnosed Tyr282 homozygotes, in whom liver disease had been specifically assessed, revealed that disease manifested in 24-43 % of males, but only 1-14 % of females (Rossi et al.). Various genetic modifiers have been identified as influencing the clinical expression of haemochromatosis. These include mutations in the HAMP, HFE2 and TFR2 genes and polymorphisms in the BMP2, BMP4, CYBRD1, HP, LTA, MPO, TMPRSS6 and TNF genes (Milet et al.; Rochette et al.; Valenti et al.; Pelucchi et al.). In addition, several environmental modifiers (e.g. diet, alcohol intake) are also known to affect the penetrance of the HFE genotype.\n\n    In another recessive disorder, Gaucher disease, the most common GBA mutation, Asn370Ser (Asn409Ser in HGVS nomenclature; rs76763715), is also characterized by low penetrance and exhibits extensive phenotype heterogeneity even in the homozygous state (Sibille et al.; Horowitz et al.; Fairley et al.). However, close examination of asymptomatic Ser370 homozygotes, serendipitously diagnosed by prenatal carrier screening, revealed a variety of previously unidentified disease manifestations indicating that the clinical penetrance of this disease genotype may be greater than previously appreciated (Balwani et al.).\n\n    Clinical penetrance is in part a function of the mutation(s) in question. For a given disease, some causal mutations may exhibit complete clinical penetrance, whereas other mutations in the same gene show incomplete or even very low penetrance. Thus, whereas the penetrance of the most common CFTR gene lesion, DeltaPhe508 (rs113993960), in cystic fibrosis is very high, the penetrance of the CFTR Arg117His (rs78655421) mutation (in any allele combination) appears to be so low as to call into question its putative role as a pathological mutation (Thauvin-Robinet et al.).\n\n    As yet, relatively few studies have been performed on low-penetrance mutations with a view to identifying the features responsible at the molecular level for their low penetrance. One exception is in retinoblastoma where it has been found that low-penetrance RB1 mutations tend either to lead to a reduction in the amount of Rb protein produced (through promoter or splice site mutations) or yield a partially functional Rb molecule through missense mutation or in-frame deletion (Onadim et al.; Kratzke et al.; Bremner et al.; Otterson et al.; Scheffer et al.; Genuardi et al.; Harbour; Klutz et al.; Lefevre et al.; Valverde et al.; Sanchez-Sanchez et al.; Sampieri et al.; Gamez-Pozo et al.; Park et al.; Hung et al.). Of particular interest is the category of temperature-sensitive mutations in the Rb pocket domain (DeltaAsn480, Arg661Trp, Cys712Arg) whose 'reversible fluctuations' in a threshold level of Rb pocket-binding activity could be responsible for their characteristic low penetrance (Otterson et al.). On the basis of studies performed to date, it would appear that a high proportion of RB1 mutations with reduced penetrance are splice site mutations, although not all splice site mutations display low penetrance.\n\n    Some mutations are associated with specifically reduced penetrance as compared to other mutations of the same type in the same gene. For example, BRCA1 Arg1699Gln is characterized by a cumulative risk of breast or ovarian cancer by the age of 70 years of only 24 % (Spurdle et al.), much lower than for the average pathogenic BRCA1 mutation (~71 %; van der Kolk et al.). Individuals with GJB2-associated deafness who harbour two nonsense/truncating mutations exhibit a much more severe clinical phenotype, and hence are more likely to come to clinical attention, than those harbouring two missense mutations (Azaiez et al.). This serves to illustrate that, in recessive disorders, the clinical penetrance of one mutation may be strongly influenced by the nature of the other mutation in trans. In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, however, null COL3A1 mutations tend to exhibit lower penetrance than missense and splicing mutations (Leistritz et al.); this is presumably because a faulty gene product can disrupt the entire triple helical collagen molecule, whereas a null mutation merely reduces the amount of normal collagen produced (Arnold and Fertala). In the same vein, patients with heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, due to missense mutations in the BMPR2 gene, present earlier and with more severe disease than patients harbouring truncating mutations (Austin et al.). It is thought that the missense mutations are associated with stable BMPR2 transcripts encoding BMPR2 protein which exerts a dominant negative effect on BMP signalling, thereby rendering missense mutations more detrimental than truncating mutations. The majority of BMPR2 missense mutations were penetrant prior to the age of 36 years, whereas the majority of truncating mutations became penetrant only after the age of 36 years (Austin et al.). With mutations of the TNFRSF1A gene causing TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome, missense mutations in cysteine residues have been reported to be more penetrant than missense mutations in non-cysteine residues (Aksentijevich et al.; Aganna et al.). Intriguingly, a SOD1 Leu117Val missense mutation which yields a mutant protein indistinguishable from wild-type SOD1 (in terms of its activity, stability and folding) causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but with unusually low penetrance and slow progression (Synofzik et al.). Finally, clinical penetrance may vary not only with the mutation type, but also with the location of the mutation in the gene/protein (Jackson et al.; Risch et al.; Yatsenko et al.; van der Werf et al.; Ho et al.).\n\n    In autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis, the penetrance of the PRSS1 Arg122His mutation has been calculated to be 86 %, whereas that of PRSS1 Ala16Val is of the order of 55-65 % (Grocock et al.; Joergensen et al.). It is thought that the comparatively low penetrance of this latter mutation may be related to its particularly mild biochemical phenotype. The Ala16Val substitution alters the N-terminal residue of the trypsinogen activation peptide, thereby increasing the rate of N-terminal processing by chymotrypsin C by ~5.8-fold (Szabo and Sahin-Toth). Since the activation peptide is released during the activation process, the Ala16Val mutation is absent from active trypsin and hence cannot influence trypsin function.\n\n    Missense mutations in the MEFV gene responsible for familial Mediterranean fever can differ quite dramatically in terms of their clinical penetrance. For example, Met694Val is generally characterized by high penetrance, whereas both Glu148Gln and Val726Ala exhibit reduced penetrance (Shohat and Halpern). In this disorder, the carrier frequency is higher than would be expected from the prevalence of the disease, suggesting that the penetrance of pathogenic MEFV mutations may often be incomplete in the compound heterozygous state (Gershoni-Baruch et al.; Zaks et al.; Caglayan et al.; Camus et al.; Soriano and Manna).\n\n    Double missense mutations in cis are not infrequently encountered in patients with an inherited disease. One of the two mutations may represent a hypomorphic (i.e. less functional) allele, as for example with the GLA Asp313Tyr occurring in cis to the pathogenic Gly411Asp in patients with Fabry disease (Yasuda et al.). Double missense mutations in cis may however be associated with a highly variable clinical phenotype (e.g. MEFV, Pro369Ser/Arg408Gln as a cause of familial Mediterranean fever; Ryan et al.). A low-penetrance missense mutation may be associated with a particularly severe clinical phenotype when it occurs in cis with a second known pathogenic mutation, e.g. MYH7 Val606Met and Ala728Val in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Blair et al.). Similarly, two missense mutations in cis, each individually exerting a comparatively mild or no effect on the clinical phenotype, can act in concert leading to a more severe effect on the phenotype than either acting alone (e.g. CFTR Arg347His and Asp979Ala in cystic fibrosis; Clain et al. or RET Cys634Tyr and Tyr791Phe resulting in pheochromocytoma with high penetrance; Toledo et al.). By contrast, Brugnoni et al. have intriguingly claimed that two different CLCN1 mutations do not give rise to myotonia congenita when they occur in cis on the same allele, although both lesions cause the disease when inherited on their own.\n\n    In diseases that exhibit locus heterogeneity, clinical penetrance may vary between mutations in different genes. For example, in pancreatitis, penetrance may vary from virtually 100 % in the case of the most common mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) gene, via an intermediate level for SPINK1 and CFTR mutations, to the much more subtle risk conferred by the disease modifiers, namely variants in the chymotrypsin C (CTRC), calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) and anionic trypsin (PRSS2) genes, which can only be identified through large cohort studies (Lerch et al.). It should, however, be noted that in cases where mutations in the SPINK1 and CASR genes (Felderbauer et al.) or SPINK1 and CFTR genes (Masson et al.) are co-inherited, chronic pancreatitis can ensue. Other such examples of digenic inheritance are discussed below (see digenic mutations and disease penetrance).\n\n    Reduced penetrance alleles are also characteristic of many triplet repeat expansion disorders. For example, in Huntington disease, the possession of intragenic (HTT) CAG repeats of 36-39 copies (in 0.01 % of controls and ~5 % of consultands) is often associated with reduced penetrance manifesting as a later onset of clinical symptoms (McNeil et al.; Quarrell et al.; Sequeiros et al.; Panegyres and Goh; Huntington Study Group COHORT Investigators). Contractions of the expanded CAG repeat length below a certain threshold can occasionally be responsible even for the non-occurrence of Huntington disease in a given at-risk individual (Nahhas et al.). However, it should be appreciated that a substantial proportion of the variance in age of onset in Huntington disease is due either to variation in genes other than HTT or in the environment (Wexler et al.). Other repeat expansion disorders characterized by reduced penetrance of alleles of intermediate size include fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (Jacquemont et al.; Sevin et al.), spinocerebellar ataxia types 10 (Alonso et al.; Rankin et al.) and 17 (Oda et al.; Nolte et al.), inherited prion disease (Kaski et al.) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Boeve et al.; Ogaki et al.).\n\n    Some allelic variants may influence the expression of their host gene so as to alter the penetrance of a potentially pathological mutation in the same gene. Such modulatory variants may reside within exons, introns or regulatory regions. For example, the common Arg413Gln F7 polymorphism (Arg353Gln in legacy nomenclature; rs6046), which serves to reduce the level of secreted coagulation factor VII by ~25 % (Arbini et al.; Hunault et al.), is over-represented among individuals with clinically symptomatic factor VII deficiency (Millar et al.). This is consistent with the view that Arg413Gln is a functional polymorphism and that the presence of Gln413 increases the likelihood that an individual, whose haemostatic potential is already compromised by a heterozygous F7 mutation, will come to clinical attention due to a bleeding diathesis. The same principle applies to the functional Arg202Gln MEFV polymorphism (rs224222) where the Gln202 allele occurs in the homozygous state at a disproportionately higher frequency (15 %) in familial Mediterranean fever patients than in normal controls (2.7 %) (Yigit et al.). In similar vein, the T allele of a functional C/T polymorphism (rs11024595) in the promoter region of the SAA1 gene is significantly over-represented in familial Mediterranean fever patients as compared with normal controls (Migita et al.). The MLH1 Lys618Ala mutation (AAG>GCG; rs35502531), initially supposed to be a benign polymorphism, has been found to be significantly over-represented in sporadic cancers associated with Lynch syndrome; MLH1 Ala618 appears to have a reduced ability to bind PMS2, one of the MLH1 protein's mismatch repair partners (Medeiros et al.). Finally, the functional KCNE1 Asp85Asn polymorphism (rs1805128), which occurs in the general population with a frequency of 0.8 %, occurs at a frequency of 3.9 % in long QT syndrome patients (Nishio et al.).\n\n    Various reported examples of the modulation of the impact of pathogenic missense mutations by allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are given in Table 2. Thus, the missense polymorphism Asp216His (rs1801968) in the TOR1A (DYT1) gene serves to moderate the clinical impact, in both cis and in trans, of the TOR1A c.904-906 del GAG mutation, the major mutation underlying early-onset dystonia (Kock et al.; Risch et al.; Martino et al.). Similarly, in long QT syndrome, the genotype of a missense polymorphism (Lys897Thr; rs1805123) in the KCNH2 gene appears to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic individuals carrying a low-penetrance Ala1116Val pathogenic mutation (Crotti et al.). Another example of the modulatory effect of a missense polymorphism on disease allele penetrance is provided by the His558Arg substitution (rs1805124) in the SCN5A gene in a case of Brugada syndrome type 1 caused by compound heterozygous mutations (Asp1690Asn and Gly1748Asp) in SCN5A. Both mutations reduced the peak Na+ current density due to limited trafficking of the SCN5A protein towards the membrane, but Gly1748Asp also profoundly affected channel gating. The His558Arg polymorphism was found to be capable of rescuing the defective trafficking of SCN5A Asn1690 towards the membrane when present in cis to the pathological lesion (Nunez et al.). Intriguingly, cotransfection with Asn1690, either alone or together with the modulatory His558Arg polymorphism, completely restored the gating defect associated with the pathogenic Gly1748Asp mutation in trans, although it only slightly rescued its trafficking.\n\n    In passing, it is perhaps pertinent to note that interplay between functional SNPs may, depending upon the precise combination of alleles involved, also be sufficient to bring about disease in the absence of a pathogenic mutation sensu stricto. Thus, a particular allele of one SNP may contribute to pathogenesis, but only in the presence of specific allele of another SNP. These SNPs may be neighbouring, as in the case of Glu918Asp (rs16022) and Glu993Val (rs16023) in the CACNA1A gene, which appear to contribute to migraine susceptibility (D'Onofrio et al.). In the same way, when they occur together in cis, two otherwise neutral missense polymorphisms in the FMO3 gene [Glu158Lys (rs2266782) and Glu308Gly (rs2266780)] result in a decrease in FMO3 enzymatic activity that is sufficient to give rise to a mild form of trimethylaminuria (Akerman et al.; Zschocke et al.; D'Angelo et al.). However, the interacting SNPs can also be located within different genes as in the case of Pro589Ser (rs1049296) in the transferrin (TF) gene and Cys282Tyr (rs1800562) in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene which interact so as to increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (Robson et al.; Kauwe et al.). A further example of the combined effect of two unlinked SNPs is provided by an intronic SNP in the thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) gene (c.1478-8C>T; rs 9406328) and a missense SNP in the metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) gene (Gln279Arg; rs17576), which together increase the risk of lumbar disc herniation (Hirose et al.). This type of situation may occupy the middle ground between monogenic and complex disorders.\n\n    The modifying SNP may also be regulatory in nature and can serve to render the pathogenic coding mutation more or less deleterious (and hence more or less penetrant) depending upon whether the allele harbouring it is more or less expressed than the wild-type allele. An example of this is provided by the -30C>T variant (rs17249141) in the LDLR gene promoter that has been shown to act in concert with a low-penetrant missense mutation in cis so as to give rise to an unusually severe form of familial hypercholesterolaemia (Snozek et al.). The modulating influence of regulatory SNPs on the penetrance of coding mutations located in cis appears to be a widespread phenomenon in medical genetics, with the high expressing SNP allele usually increasing the clinical penetrance of the linked coding mutation (Lappalainen et al.). One regulatory SNP is thought to act as a low-penetrance cancer susceptibility factor in its own right: homozygosity for the intronic 309T>G MDM2 variant (rs2279744), which leads to enhanced binding of the Sp1 transcription factor and MDM2 up-regulation, appears to increase the risk for many types of tumour, presumably in concert with other lesions (Hu et al.).\n\n    Introns may also harbour SNPs that are capable of modulating the clinical penetrance of a given pathogenic mutation. Thus, a short tract of five thymidines (5T) in intron 8 of the CFTR gene, found in ~10 % of individuals from the general population, can give rise to either congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD), non-classical cystic fibrosis or a normal phenotype when found in trans to a severe CFTR mutation (Kiesewetter et al.; Cuppens et al.). The number of TG repeats immediately adjacent to 5T is not only significantly associated with the level of alternative splicing of exon 9 of the CFTR gene (Cuppens et al.; Niksic et al.), but also influences clinical penetrance both in the context of cystic fibrosis and CAVD (Groman et al.; Buratti et al.; Lebo and Grody). Another intronic modifying polymorphism is found in the FECH gene responsible for erythropoietic protoporphyria, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by incomplete penetrance. This polymorphism (c.315-48T>C; rs2272783) modulates the use of a cryptic acceptor splice site, yielding an aberrantly spliced FECH mRNA which is degraded via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Gouya et al.). The hypomorphic C allele increases the penetrance of erythropoietic protoporphyria when it occurs in trans to a pathogenic FECH mutation (Gouya et al.). Finally, in a family with hyperinsulinism, a c.636+385A>G SNP (rs732941) in intron 5 of the HADH gene, which creates a cryptic acceptor splice site, acts in concert with a pathogenic HADH mutation (c.636+471G>T) in the same intron, which creates a cryptic donor splice site, to generate a 141-bp pseudoexon that leads to premature termination of translation (Flanagan et al.).\n\n    A common C>T variant within an enhancer in intron 1 of the RET gene (rs2435357) serves to increase the clinical penetrance of RET coding sequence mutations (Emison et al.). The T allele disrupts a SOX10-binding site, thereby reducing RET transactivation (Emison et al.). A comparable example is provided by an intronic enhancer SNP (rs2596623) in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) gene, which was found to be responsible for the pituitary cell-specific over-expression of a mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta2 (Arg338Trp) in a case of pituitary cell-specific resistance to thyroid hormone (Alberobello et al.).\n\n    Variants in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the KCNQ1 gene reportedly modify disease severity in individuals with type 1 long QT syndrome resulting from KCNQ1 gene mutations (Amin et al.). These variants serve to reduce KCNQ1 gene expression, such that patients with one or more variants on their mutated KCNQ1 alleles have a shorter QT interval and a milder clinical phenotype, whereas patients with the variants on their normal KCNQ1 alleles exhibit significantly longer QT intervals and a more severe clinical phenotype. Another example of a modifying 3'UTR variant is provided by the G>A polymorphism (rs1799963) at position 20210 in the prothrombin (F2) gene, which increases the risk of venous thrombosis by enhancing F2 mRNA 3' end formation efficiency, thereby boosting thrombin formation (Gehring et al.). This F2 20210G>A polymorphism has been claimed to interact with a common F13A1 Val34Leu (rs5985) variant to confer a greatly increased risk of myocardial infarction (Butt et al.). Some 3'UTR variants are located within microRNA-binding sites and may constitute low-penetrance risk factors for disease in their own right (Ahluwalia et al.; Kontorovich et al.; Qiu et al.; Arnold et al.). Finally, various SNPs in other non-coding RNAs (e.g. lincRNAs; Jendrzejewski et al.; Kumar et al.) appear to be disease associated and may therefore also influence disease penetrance.\n\n    Humans are characterized by marked inter-individual differences in the expression levels of their genes (Stranger et al.; Skelly et al.; Cowley et al.; Cheng et al.). Since gene expression is controlled by a combination of cis- and trans-acting regulatory factors, one means by which heritable differences in gene expression may be mediated is through polymorphism either of trans-acting regulatory (transcription) factors or of the cis-acting target sequences to which they bind. In the case of disease genes, such inter-individual variation in gene expression levels and patterns can influence the penetrance of pathological mutations. However, it should be appreciated that there are also substantial environmental and stochastic (non-genetic) components to gene expression that are likely to contribute to variable penetrance, even between monozygotic twins (Grundberg et al.).\n\n    Differential allelic expression is a widespread phenomenon and is thought to be relevant to as many as 50 % of all human genes (Williams et al.; Cheung and Spielman; Palacios et al.). In autosomal dominant conditions where the two alleles of the disease gene are expressed at different levels, this discrepancy can favour either the mutant or the wild-type allele and hence may influence clinical penetrance in either direction (de la Chapelle). Thus, in pulmonary arterial hypertension, a disease caused by mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) gene, the penetrance of the BMPR2 disease allele is dependent upon the level of expression of the wild-type BMPR2 allele (Hamid et al.). Similarly, in erythropoietic protoporphyria, an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the ferrochelatase (FECH) gene, the penetrance of the pathogenic FECH allele is influenced by the level of expression of the wild-type FECH allele (Gouya et al.; Di Pierro et al.). Other examples of autosomal dominant conditions where the degree of clinical penetrance is modulated by differential expression of the wild-type and mutant alleles include hereditary elliptocytosis (SPTA1, Wilmotte et al.), Marfan syndrome (FBN1, Hutchinson et al.), retinoblastoma (RB1, Taylor et al.), colorectal cancer (APC, Yan et al.; TGFBR1, Valle et al.) and breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1, Ginolhac et al.).\n\n    Perhaps, the best understood example of penetrance depending upon the level of expression of the wild-type allele is retinitis pigmentosa type 11 (Utz et al.). This autosomal dominant condition is caused by mutations in the pre-mRNA processing factor 31 (PRPF31) gene located on chromosome 19q13.42. The clinical penetrance of the underlying mutations has been shown to depend upon the level of wild-type PRPF31 mRNA expression displayed by the patient (Vithana et al.; Rivolta et al.; Liu et al.). Cells from asymptomatic carriers of PRPF31 mutations express a higher level of the wild-type allele than cells from affected patients: high enough for the wild-type PRPF31 mRNA level to lie within the range of the unaffected general population (Rivolta et al.; Liu et al.). The penetrance of PRPF31 mutations is reduced by transcriptional repression mediated by the product of the CCR4-NOT transcription complex, subunit 3 (CNOT3) gene which is linked to PRPF31 (McGee et al.; Venturini et al.). PRPF31 expression has also been found to be strongly influenced by an unlinked eQTL on chromosome 14q21-q23 (Rio Frio et al.). The penetrance of PRPF31 mutations is therefore determined at least in part by a trans-acting modifier located on a different chromosome. The trans-acting alleles are inherited from the parent lacking the PRPF31 mutation; these alleles are presumably present in the general population, but appear only to be relevant to disease when they modulate the penetrance of PRPF31 mutations.\n\n    A slightly different scenario is exemplified by Schimke immune-osseus dysplasia (SIOD), a recessive condition, which appears to result from biallelic mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene. Several examples of SIOD families with incomplete penetrance have been reported (Bokenkamp et al.; Dekel et al.; Elizondo et al.). It has recently been shown that SMARCAL1, a protein involved in chromatin remodelling, influences the transcription level of many genes (Baradaran-Heravi et al.). Although SMARCAL1 deficiency is insufficient in itself to cause SIOD in Drosophila and mouse models, the addition of environmental (viz. heat shock) and genetic insults affecting transcription can successfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of SIOD (Baradaran-Heravi et al.). The penetrance of SIOD therefore appears to be dependent upon the magnitude of the alteration of gene expression consequent to SMARCAL1 deficiency.\n\n    In the case of a splicing mutation (c.291+1 G>A; rs71640277) in intron 3 of the GH1 gene causing growth hormone deficiency type II, the expression levels of the mutant and wild-type alleles were found to correlate with the penetrance and expressivity of the deficiency state in different members of the same family (Hamid et al.). Some splicing mutations associated with low penetrance affect splicing in such a way that both normal-length and truncated transcripts are expressed from the same mutant allele, but presumably to different extents in different individuals (e.g. RB1, c.2211G>A; Schubert et al.). Other such examples of reduced penetrance due to 'leaky splicing' involve splicing mutations in the SPAST gene causing hereditary spastic paraplegia (Svenson et al.) and in the BTK gene causing X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (Kaneko et al.). The reduced penetrance characteristic of some splicing mutations may also result from alternative splicing (Rave-Harel et al.; Chiba-Falek et al.; Nissim-Rafinia and Kerem; Zinman et al.; Szymanski et al.; Cogan et al.; Lee et al.) or internal translational start site initiation (Sanchez-Sanchez et al.).\n\n    Special cases of differential allelic expression are of course provided by X-inactivation (Dobyns et al.) and imprinting (Lo et al.), both of which are discussed below.\n\n    Formally, use of the term 'autosomal dominant' implies that the homozygotes exhibit the same or a similar clinical phenotype to the heterozygotes, as is the case in Huntington disease where the length of the expanded HTT CAG triplet repeat appears to be predictive of the age of onset irrespective of the presence or absence of a second expanded HTT allele (Lee et al.). However, in practice, for most 'dominant' human disorders in which homozygotes have been reported, their clinical symptoms tend to be significantly more severe than in the heterozygotes (Vogel and Motulsky). This would seem to be especially true in the context of low-penetrance mutations such as those identified in the SCN4A and CLCN1 genes, causing muscle channelopathies, conditions which are usually held to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Patients homozygous for sodium channel mutations causing paramyotonia congenita (SCN4A, Ile1393Thr), hypokalemic periodic paralysis (SCN4A, Arg1132Gln) and myotonia congenita (CLCN1, Gly190Ser, Ile556Asn, Ala313Thr, Ile556Asn) display much more severe clinical features than patients heterozygous for these mutations (Plassart-Schiess et al.; Arzel-Hezode et al.; Shalata et al.). The aforementioned mutations were also found to exhibit reduced penetrance in heterozygotes.\n\n    Mutations in the RET gene, associated with isolated Hirschsprung disease, are dominant loss-of-function mutations with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Basel-Vanagaite et al. reported a c.1263+5G>A splicing mutation in the homozygous state in three females with severe Hirschsprung disease and in the heterozygous state in a male patient with short-segment Hirschsprung disease. In addition, a hypomorphic RET-predisposing allele, rs2435357, located in the first intron of the RET gene, was found in the heterozygous state in the male patient but not in the three affected females. Whilst the heterozygous c.1263+5G>A mutation is known to be low penetrance for short-segment Hirschsprung disease, the homozygous state is fully penetrant for total aganglionosis or long-segment Hirschsprung disease. Thus, the penetrance of RET gene mutations in Hirschsprung disease depends not only on the nature of the mutation but also on the allele dosage.\n\n    Estimates of the clinical penetrance of recurrent pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) vary quite widely, depending upon CNV size, genomic location and the disorder in question (Ben-Shachar et al.; Vassos et al.; Breckpot et al.; Ciuladaite et al.; Hosak et al.; Klopocki et al.; Rosenfeld et al.; Vaags et al.; Weischenfeldt et al.; Dabell et al.; Carvill and Mefford; Tropeano et al.). In their study of children known to carry a CNV associated with intellectual disability and congenital abnormalities, Girirajan et al. reported synergy between multiple large CNVs leading to a particularly severe clinical presentation. Such a two-hit model, or 'oligogenic heterozygosity' as it has been termed, also appears to be characteristic of autism (Pinto et al.; Schaaf et al.; Klei et al.; Gau et al.).\n\n    The penetrance of a given CNV may also be influenced by genetic variants in the vicinity. Thus, a submicroscopic deletion of 1q21.1 (encompassing the RBM8A gene) has been reported to interact with a low-frequency functional SNP in the regulatory region of the wild-type RBM8A allele to cause thrombocytopaenia with absent radii (Albers et al.).\n\n    Several papers have now suggested that CNVs can also act as genetic modifiers of phenotype severity in a variety of different disease contexts (Beckmann et al.; Chaudru et al.; El-Hattab et al.; Mulley et al.; Jiang et al.; Carvalho et al.; Shen et al.). CNVs may influence the penetrance of a clinical phenotype indirectly as well as directly. For example, a mutant gene might be 'covered' by a CNV in a given individual, so that the expected clinical phenotype would be masked by the presence of an additional wild-type copy in cis to the gene in question. Consistent with this postulate, Ng et al. reported that ~30 % of nonsense SNPs occur in genes residing within segmental duplications, a proportion some threefold larger than that noted for synonymous SNPs. Genes harbouring nonsense SNPs were also found to belong to larger gene families (Ng et al.) suggesting that some functional redundancy could also exist between paralogous human genes. In support of this idea, Hsiao and Vitkup reported that those human genes which have a homologue with >90 % sequence similarity are ~3 times less likely to harbour disease-causing mutations than genes with less closely related homologues. Hsiao and Vitkup interpreted their findings in terms of 'genetic robustness' against null mutations, with the duplicated sequences providing 'backup' by potentiating the functional compensation/complementation of homologous genes in the event that the latter acquired deleterious mutations. The capacity to be functionally compensated appears to vary, in the order non-disease genes > monogenic disease genes > polygenic disease genes (Podder and Ghosh). One example of how a CNV can ameliorate the clinical phenotype is spinal muscular atrophy where an increased copy number of the SMN2 gene can greatly reduce the severity of the disease caused by the homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene, because the SMN2 gene, which lacks a splicing enhancer, can nevertheless generate some functional product thereby compensating functionally in a copy number-dependent fashion for the loss of the SMN1 gene (Vitali et al.; Harada et al.; Wirth et al.). Another example of how the clinical and/or phenotypic impact of a mutant gene can be nullified by a CNV is provided by a foetus that possessed paternal (Gln318Term) and maternal (Arg356Term) nonsense mutations of the CYP21A2 gene but lacked the normal clinical sequelae of congenital adrenal hyperplasia; this was found to be due to a duplication of the CYP21A2 gene on the paternal allele (Kleinle et al.; Lekarev et al.).\n\n    \"For a so-called single gene disorder, there is one gene that may be primarily responsible for the pathogenesis with one or more independently inherited modifier genes that influence the phenotype. On the other hand, for a complex trait, the primacy of any individual gene is not perceptible, and the interaction of two or more independently inherited pairs of alleles, most likely influenced by additional modifier genes, results in the disease. The consequence of this conceptual framework is that there is no such thing as a 'single' gene disorder. In other words, there is no obvious clear distinction between simple Mendelian and complex traits: genetic diseases represent a continuum with diminishing influence from a single primary gene influenced by modifier genes, to increasingly shared influence by multiple genes\".\n\n    Dipple and McCabe\n\n    It is sometimes claimed that sickle cell anaemia is the simplest of all Mendelian disorders in that it is caused by one specific mutation (Glu7Val) in the beta-globin (HBB) gene. However, this single-mutation monogenic disorder is not as simple as it might at first appear; indeed, it is characterized by marked clinical heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance of subphenotypes which is due in part to allelic variation and in part to variants in unlinked modifier genes (Steinberg and Sebastiani). If we extrapolate from the archetypal example of sickle cell disease to other Mendelian disorders, it is not unreasonable to expect the action of modifier genes to be the rule rather than the exception. Indeed, variants in unlinked modifier genes have been reported to influence penetrance in a variety of different inherited diseases including pancreatitis (Khalid et al.), breast cancer (Wolf et al.; Wang et al.; Walker et al.; Antoniou and Chenevix-Trench; Esteban Cardenosa et al.; Harlid et al.), Gaucher disease (Taddei et al.; Zhang et al.), retinitis pigmentosa (Rio Frio et al.; Venturini et al.), haemochromatosis (Krayenbuehl et al.), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Daw et al.), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (Finch et al.) and amyloid polyneuropathy (Soares et al.) among others. In familial late-onset Alzheimer disease, modifying loci may either influence the risk (Sleegers et al.; Cruchaga et al.) or the age of onset of disease (Wijsman et al.; Marchani et al.). Importantly, a significant excess of rare coding APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 variants was noted in probands from late-onset Alzheimer disease families even though these variants did not actually co-segregate with the disease; this suggests that the variants in question may nevertheless serve to modulate the risk of disease (Cruchaga et al.). An excess of rare variants as compared to controls has also been noted in patients with various other disorders including hypertriglyceridaemia (Johansen et al.; Talmud), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Lopes et al.) and autism spectrum disorder (Mondal et al.).\n\n    A typical example of a modifier gene in action is provided by long QT syndrome. The clinical penetrance of KCNQ1 (potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1) mutations in this disorder is influenced by two coding sequence polymorphisms [Ser49Gly (rs1801252) and Arg389Gly (rs1801253)] in the ADRB1 gene. Individuals homozygous for the Arg389 allele tend to have shorter QT intervals, whereas individuals homozygous for Ser49 tend to have longer QT intervals than those with other genotypes (Paavonen et al.). Interestingly, those individuals doubly homozygous for Arg389 and Ser49 were found to be indistinguishable from the remainder of the patient cohort, both in terms of their QT intervals and in terms of clinical penetrance.\n\n    The minor allele of a variant in the complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene, Ser1610Thr (rs4844609), which has a population frequency of 0.02, is associated with episodic memory decline and susceptibility to Alzheimer disease (Keenan et al.). However, this effect appears largely dependent upon an interaction with APOE-epsilon4, itself an important risk factor for Alzheimer disease (Mayeux et al.).\n\n    Hirschsprung disease is one of the most complex genetic disorders in terms of the number of modifier genes (Garcia-Barcelo et al.; Tang et al.) known to influence the penetrance of its causative mutations, which has been estimated to be of the order of 50-70 % (Bolk et al.). The best characterized of these modifier genes is the neuregulin 1 gene (NRG1; Tang et al.); however, most probably still remain to be identified. Some Bardet-Biedl syndrome patients also present with Hirschsprung disease. It appears that RET, the major gene involved in the aetiology of Hirschsprung disease, acts as a modifier of the Hirschsprung disease phenotype in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (de Pontual et al.). Some families with Hirschsprung disease and Bardet-Biedl syndrome harbour mutations in their BBS4, BBS5, BBS7 and RET genes (de Pontual et al.). Sanchez-Mejias et al. reported a Hirschsprung disease family in which mutations in three different genes (RET, NTRK3 and EDN3) contributed to the disease phenotype; the RET and NTRK3 mutations were both necessary and sufficient to give rise to the clinical phenotype, whereas the EDN3 mutation appeared to act as a modifier. More recently, copy number variations in various neurodevelopmental genes (MAPK10, ZFHX1B, SOX2 and NRG2) have been shown to modify the penetrance of Hirschsprung disease (Jiang et al.; Tang et al.). Taken together, these findings are consistent with an impact of both common and rare variants on the inheritance (and hence penetrance) of this highly complex disorder (Sanchez-Mejias et al.; Nunez-Torres et al.; Alves et al.).\n\n    Table 3 lists a number of well-characterized examples of specific variants in modifier genes that serve to modulate the clinical penetrance of diseases caused by mutation(s) at unlinked loci.\n\n    The plastin 3 (PLS3) gene acts as a modifier of the clinical penetrance of autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy, caused by the homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. Oprea et al. studied spinal muscular atrophy-discordant families with affected and unaffected SMN1-deleted siblings and found that all unaffected SMN1-deleted siblings were characterized by a high PLS3 expression level in blood cells, considerably higher than in their affected counterparts (and despite high PLS expression being evident in only 5 % of healthy controls). Although it is still unclear whether PLS3 expression is regulated by cis- or trans-acting factors, it would appear that high PLS3 expression serves to rescue the spinal muscular atrophy patient from the detrimental effects of SMN1 deletion by promoting axonogenesis through elevation of the level of F-actin (Oprea et al.) and ultimately by improving neuromuscular transmission (Ackermann et al.).\n\n    A unique kind of modifying effect is exemplified by alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome, caused by mutations of the ATRX gene. The ATRX protein binds to variable number tandem repeat sequences (VNTRs) in the human genome, and genes associated with these VNTRs are dysregulated when ATRX is mutated (Law et al.). Law et al. identified 917 ATRX targets in primary human erythroid cells, including one in the alpha-globin (HBA) locus. This psidelta VNTR was found to be highly polymorphic in terms of its length and acted as a length-dependent negative regulator of gene expression, its length serving to influence the degree of alpha-thalassaemia observed in an alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome patient. Thus, the length of the psidelta VNTR could explain the incomplete penetrance of alpha-thalassaemia noted in individuals with identical ATRX mutations. A similar mechanism could underlie other genetic traits characterized by reduced penetrance.\n\n    In a typical autosomal Mendelian condition, a single mutation (dominant) or two mutations (recessive) at a specific locus give rise to a clinical phenotype. By contrast, digenic inheritance occurs in cases where the interaction of mutations in two different genes is required for the expression of the clinical phenotype. In this situation, a mutation in one copy of each gene is required for the full clinical phenotype to manifest. In the absence of one of the component mutations, the other mutation may be non-penetrant (digenic inheritance sensu stricto) or could be responsible for a less severe clinical phenotype (digenic inheritance sensu lato). At least 100 cases of probable and possible examples of digenic inheritance causing human inherited disease have been reported to date (Table 4).\n\n    Digenic inheritance may occur as a result of mutations in genes encoding different subunits of the same multimeric protein (e.g. PRPH2 and ROM1), an oligomeric protein complex (e.g. KCNJ10 and SLC26A4; KRT14 and KRT5) or simply two proteins that interact functionally with each other (CDH23 and PCDH15; DSG2 and DSC2; PARK7 and PINK1). However, mutations in receptor/ligand pairs can also give rise to digenic inheritance (e.g. PROK2 and PROKR2). Alternatively, digenic inheritance can involve mutations located in different genes, but compromising the same regulatory (e.g. HFE and HAMP), biosynthetic (e.g. ZMPSTE24 and LMNA; CPOX and PPOX; MYOC and CYP1B1) or degradative (e.g. PCSK9 and LDLR) pathway. Finally, the combination of a mutation in a transcription factor with a mutation in a target gene of that transcription factor can also serve to reduce the amount of the protein in question to a level sufficient to cause a disease phenotype (e.g. MITF and TYR; FOXC1 and PITX2).\n\n    In practice, it is not always clear if a given situation constitutes true digenic inheritance (e.g. Kajiwara et al.) or whether it is simply the coinheritance of two mutations in different genes (e.g. Gruber et al.; Serrano-Fernandez et al.; Ekvall et al.). In the former case, the expression of the disease phenotype actually requires the presence of both gene lesions. In the latter case, coinheritance of the two gene lesions may serve to aggravate the clinical phenotype, but each lesion is independently associated with its own characteristic clinical sequelae. In true digenic inheritance, mutations in both genes must be present for the genetic disorder to be manifest. Since many of the disorders reported (in Table 4) to be characterized by digenic inheritance also have monogenic forms in which just one of the two genes has been mutated (whether in the heterozygous or homozygous/compound heterozygous state), it is unclear how many of the examples listed really represent digenic inheritance sensu stricto. However, in many of the listed examples, the doubly heterozygous probands exhibit earlier onset or a more severe clinical phenotype than their singly heterozygous relatives (although this is not invariably so; Marras et al.). Further, whereas the truly 'digenic' patients tend to be characterized by complete penetrance, the monogenic disease genotypes often exhibit reduced penetrance as in e.g. normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (see Table 4).\n\n    In some of the cases listed in Table 4, the digenic inheritance may be confined to a single proband and hence it is not always straightforward to distinguish true digenic inheritance from the chance coinheritance of two mutations in unlinked genes. This notwithstanding, the requirement for the involvement of a second mutated gene may depend upon the specific mutations that are segregating in the pedigrees. If digenic inheritance eventually turns out to be more frequent than previously appreciated, it could provide yet another reason why some potentially pathogenic alleles are present in the general population in the absence of overt disease. At the very least, in many cases the clinical penetrance of the condition in question is likely to be greater when two relevant genes have been functionally compromised by mutation than if only one had been mutated.\n\n    Triallelic inheritance has been described as being \"a bridge between Mendelian and multifactorial traits\" (Eichers et al.). There are a burgeoning number of reported examples of digenic triallelic inheritance including nephronophthisis (Hoefele et al.), venous thrombosis (Formstone et al.; Brenner et al.) and cortisone reductase deficiency (Draper et al.). It would not be altogether surprising, in conditions where digenic or even trigenic inheritance has been reported, if the individual component mutations were found to exhibit a reduced clinical penetrance as compared to mutations underlying the monogenic forms of the disease.\n\n    In some disorders, incomplete penetrance of a particular mutation can be due to the oligogenic nature of the disease and hence to the requirement for multiple genes to be mutated for the condition in question to manifest. An inherited predisposition to cancer can be monogenic, but is also very likely to have an oligogenic aetiology in many instances (Fearnhead et al.; Koren-Michowitz et al.; Okkels et al.; Kury et al.; Wasielewski et al.; Martinez and Kolodner; Plon et al.; Morak et al.; Gracia-Aznarez et al.). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, van Blitterswijk et al. detected FUS and TARDBP mutations in combination with ANG mutations, and C9orf72 repeat expansions with TARDBP, SOD1 and FUS mutations. At least five relatively common polymorphisms in four different genes, CFB (Arg32Gln, rs641153), C2 (Glu318Asp, rs9332739), CFH [Tyr402His (rs1061170) and non-coding variant rs1410996] and ARMS2 (Ala69Ser, rs10490924), interact so as to confer increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (Maller et al.). Common polymorphisms in the LEPR (Gln223Arg, rs1137101) and ADRB2 [Arg16Gly (rs1042713) and Gln27Glu (rs1042714)] genes jointly confer increased risk of obesity even though none of these polymorphisms exhibits a significant influence on their own (Pereira et al.). Other examples of oligogenic inheritance, involving the mutation or polymorphism of multiple unlinked genes in the same individual, include isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (KAL1, PROK2 and NELF; Sykiotis et al.), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3 and TNNT2; Girolami et al.; Lopes et al.), iminoglycinuria (SLC36A2, SLC6A20, SLC6A18, SLC6A19; Broer et al.), long QT syndrome (KCNH2, SCN5A and KCNE1; Yoshikane et al.), chronic pancreatitis (SPINK1, CFTR and CTRC; Rosendahl et al.), atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (CFH, CD46 and CFI; Roumenina et al.; Bresin et al.), Parkinson disease (LRRK2, SNCA, MAPT, GBA, BST1, PARK16; Wang et al.), acrocallosal syndrome (KIF7, AHI1, BBS2 and BBS4; Walsh et al.), autism spectrum disorders (Neale et al.) and a low plasma level of HDL cholesterol, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis (Cohen et al.; Wang et al.; Johansen and Hegele).\n\n    One of the best characterized oligogenic disorders is Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) where at least 17 genes are known to contribute to the clinical phenotype, and the severity of the disease phenotype may vary as a result of the interaction of mutations in different BBS genes. Although mutations at more than one locus have often been found to segregate with the disease, thereby modulating both its penetrance and expressivity (Badano et al.; Zaghloul and Katsanis; Cardenas-Rodriguez et al.), the jury is still out in relation to claims of digenic triallelic inheritance in BBS (Katsanis et al.; Beales et al.; Badano et al.; Fauser et al.; Smaoui et al.; Chen et al.; Abu-Safieh et al.). This notwithstanding, some common BBS gene variants appear to be detrimental to protein function and may well interact with the much rarer pathogenic BBS mutations so as to influence the severity of the BBS phenotype (Zaghloul et al.).\n\n    Some idea of the likely complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships in complex disease has come from the comparative exome sequencing of 237 ion channel genes performed in sporadic idiopathic epilepsy patients and unaffected controls (Klassen et al.). Both rare and common variants were identified in the two groups. Although these variants were more numerous in the patient group, they were not found to be predictive of disease: as the authors opined, \"absolute numerical counts of SNP burden hold little predictive value as a global pathogenic measure\". However, 51 % of cases and 14 % of controls had >=2 non-synonymous variants in their sodium channel genes. In similar vein, 24 % of cases and 6 % of controls had >=2 non-synonymous variants in their GABA receptor alpha genes (Klassen et al.). Such findings are quite consistent with an oligogenic model of sporadic epilepsy (Dibbens et al.). What is required here, however, is not a simple variant number count, but rather an assessment, on an individual basis, of the net effect of an oligogenic variant profile (requiring ascertainment of the various gains or losses of function associated with specific variants and computed with an eye to the nature of potential joint effects) on a clinically or phenotypically relevant output measure such as the electrical signature of a cell type or brain region.\n\n    Perhaps, the best characterized oligogenic disorder to date is familial venous thrombosis. The risk of venous thromboembolism is known to be increased in patients who carry more than one genetic variant disrupting the 100+ genes of the 'hemostaseome' (Fechtel et al.). Thus, 19 % of symptomatic individuals harbouring a protein C (PROC) gene mutation were also found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden (F5 Arg534Gln; Koeleman et al.), a functional polymorphism which occurs at a frequency of 2-5 % in European populations. In a replication study, 9.5 % of venous thrombosis patients were found to carry both mutations (Gandrille et al.) suggesting that their co-occurrence increases the likelihood of their coming to clinical attention. Similar findings have been noted in families with protein S (PROS1) deficiency; among symptomatic individuals, 38 % also carried the factor V Leiden mutation (Koeleman et al.). Likewise, coinheritance of antithrombin (SERPINC1) deficiency and factor V Leiden not only increases clinical penetrance, but also reduces the age of clinical presentation (van Boven et al.). In a larger-scale study involving 132 thrombophilic families, the risk of thrombosis was increased and the age of onset lowered in cases of double heterozygosity for two gene variants (combinations of variants in PROC, PROS1, F5 and F2) as compared to individuals carrying single variants of these genes (Tirado et al.). ABO blood group is also known to modify the risk of venous thrombosis in individuals with hereditary thrombophilia through an influence on the plasma levels of factor VIII and the factor VIII carrier protein, von Willebrand factor (Tirado et al.; Nossent et al.; Cohen et al.). Such studies provide strong circumstantial support for the joint impact of multiple mutations in thrombotic disease (Martinelli et al.). The elevation of risk for each individual variant is, however, low, and incomplete penetrance is evident for all prothrombotic variants. This means that the vast majority of individuals bearing these variants do not suffer from thrombotic disease. It is nevertheless reasonable to suppose that patients with recurrent venous thrombosis will tend to have a greater number of prothrombotic variants than those who have experienced a single thrombotic event, with those individuals who never experienced thrombosis harbouring even fewer prothrombotic variants (Fechtel et al.). Since the number of genes known to influence haemostasis is large and the number of variants with potential impact larger still, we may expect that a substantial number of different variant combinations will be capable of conferring an increased risk. This genetic risk will accompany each prothrombotic challenge (such as pregnancy, long haul air travel, contraceptive pill usage and immobilization after surgery), with the greatest risk of venous thrombosis accruing to those possessing the largest number of prothrombotic variants in their genomes (Fechtel et al.). Our task is to come to understand how specific DNA sequence changes in the large number of genes known to play a role in haemostasis and thrombosis act either synergistically or antagonistically so as to confer disease predisposition upon the individual, thereby influencing the clinical penetrance, by shifting their haemostatic balance towards either a prothrombotic or anticoagulant phenotype (Franchini and Mannucci; Westrick and Ginsburg; Fechtel et al.).\n\n    The sex dependence of the penetrance of inherited mutations has been reported in a variety of different heritable disorders including haemochromatosis (HFE; Rossi et al.), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (MYBPC3, MYH7; Michels et al.; Page et al.), arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (PKP2; Dalal et al.), long QT syndrome (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A; Zareba et al.), hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (CACNA1S; Kawamura et al.; Li et al.; SCN4A; Ke et al.), familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (BMPR2; Austin et al.), hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPAST; Mitne-Neto et al.), hereditary dystonia/dopa-responsive dystonia (GCH1; Furukawa et al.), cardiac disease (LMNA; van Rijsingen et al.), Hirschsprung disease (RET; Emison et al.), autism spectrum disorder (SHANK1; Sato et al.), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9ORF72; Le Ber et al.; Williams et al.) and familial obesity (SHP; Yang et al.). A male-biased effect on the penetrance of duplications and deletions at 16p13.11 is evident in a range of neorodevelopmental conditions including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability and schizophrenia (Tropeano et al.). In the case of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, both genetic and metabolic marker data were consistent with a modifying role for variation in oestrogens and/or oestrogen metabolism upon disease risk (Austin et al.). The low penetrance of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis due to SCN4A mutations in females is also likely to be due to the effect of oestrogens (Ke et al.).\n\n    Allelic variation may also influence the clinical phenotype in a sex-specific fashion. Thus, Lahtinen et al. reported that the common KCNE1 Asp85Asn (rs1805128) polymorphism was associated with a QT-interval prolongation in male but not female type 1 long QT syndrome patients harbouring the KCNQ1 Gly589Asp mutation. KCNE1 Asp85Asn may thus be a sex-specific QT-interval modifier in type 1 LQTS. Similarly, the Ile148Met (rs738409) PNPLA3 polymorphism is a disease modifier in primary sclerosing cholangitis with bile duct stenosis, but only in male patients (Friedrich et al.). Finally, a Val89Leu polymorphism (rs523349) in the steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) gene, which serves to reduce the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, has been claimed to influence the severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms but in a male-specific fashion (Gillespie et al.).\n\n    An intriguing parent-of-origin effect has been noted in two apparently unrelated retinoblastoma families with a heterozygous, low-penetrance splice site mutation (c.607+1G>T) in the RB1 gene which causes skipping of exon 6 (Klutz et al.). The abundance of the resulting nonsense (frameshifted) RB1 mRNA relative to the wild-type was found to vary between members of one and the same family. Those individuals in family #1 who inherited the mutant RB1 allele from their mother displayed a similar level of nonsense and wild-type RB1 transcripts, and only one of eight carriers developed retinoblastoma. By contrast, those individuals in family #2 who inherited the mutant RB1 allele from their fathers displayed a reduced abundance of the nonsense transcript with six of eight carriers developing retinoblastoma, indicating that the mutant transcript has residual function. Assuming that this is not a chance result (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.04), it may be that the gender of the transmitting parent can influence the penetrance of the pathogenic mutation.\n\n    There is good evidence to suggest that sex-specific genomic architecture can influence the expression of human phenotypes, including disease traits (Ober et al.). It is likely that the underlying mechanism is differential gene regulation in males and females, particularly in relation to sex steroid-responsive genes (Zhang et al.; Dimas et al.).\n\n    Another mechanism by which sex influences penetrance is via genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting results from the epigenetic modification of a gene or gene region that leads to the mutually exclusive expression of either the maternal or the paternal allele. Imprinted alleles are silenced (by DNA methylation or histone modification), so that the corresponding genes are expressed only from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the other parent. In the case of disease genes, imprinting can influence the penetrance of pathological mutations depending upon whether the wild-type or the mutant allele is imprinted. Genomic imprinting can give rise to markedly different levels of clinical penetrance depending upon the parental origin of the disease allele. Examples include SGCE mutations in myoclonus dystonia (Zimprich et al.; Muller et al.; Grabowski et al.) and SDHD mutations in paraganglioma (Badenhop et al.; Simi et al.; Baysal et al.). In both cases, maternal imprinting ensures that the pathologically effective mutations are almost invariably inherited from the father. Intriguingly, in one family with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b, Jan de Beur et al. reported a case of the incomplete penetrance of an imprinting mutation. These authors found that both the clinically affected and unaffected siblings had inherited the same GNAS1 allele from their affected mother, indicating that some dissociation must have occurred between the genetic GNAS1 defect responsible for the disease and its epigenetic mark. The inconsistent acquisition of a paternal epigenotype on a maternal GNAS1 allele would appear to provide evidence for the incomplete expression of a reprogramming defect that affects imprinting.\n\n    Age-dependent penetrance is present if the clinical symptoms of a given disease are increasingly likely to manifest themselves with increasing age of the at-risk individual. Age-dependent penetrance has been reported for mutations in a wide variety of different human disease genes, e.g. MYBPC3 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Michels et al.; Page et al.), LMNA in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (Vytopil et al.), MC4R in familial obesity due to melanocortin-4 receptor deficiency (Stutzmann et al.), GBA in Parkinson disease (Anheim et al.; Rana et al.), BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer susceptibility (Chen and Parmigiani; Al-Mulla et al.; Mavaddat et al.), MEN1 in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Machens et al.), RET in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (Frank-Raue et al.) and SDHD and SDHB in predisposition to paragangliomas (Hensen et al.; Hes et al.). The APOE epsilon4 allele (comprising the T allele of rs429358 and the C allele of rs7412 in cis) serves to reduce the age of onset of Alzheimer disease from 78.4 years in patients lacking the allele, to 75.3 in heterozygous carriers to 72.9 in carriers of two APOE epsilon4 alleles (Sando et al.).\n\n    Age-dependent penetrance is particularly evident where large numbers of heterozygous carriers harbouring specific gene mutations have been identified by cascade screening, e.g. LRRK2 Gly2019Ser (rs34637584) in Parkinson disease (Latourelle et al.; Healy et al.; Sierra et al.), GLUT1 Arg232Cys in familial idiopathic generalized epilepsy (Striano et al.), RET Cys634Trp (rs77709286) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (Milos et al.), ACADM Lys329Glu (rs77931234) in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (Andresen et al.), PKP2 Gln59Leu in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (Lahtinen et al.) and MYBPC3 c.2308+1G>A (rs112738974) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Oliva-Sandoval et al.). However, there are always anomalous cases; thus, in a family segregating a pathogenic missense mutation (Arg1205His) in the vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35) gene, six family members between the ages of 54 and 73 years exhibited signs of Parkinson disease, but one individual was still asymptomatic at age 86 (Nuytemans et al.).\n\n    Specific mutations may sometimes differ from each other in terms of the average age of onset of clinical symptoms. Thus, for example, patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who harbour mutations in exons 9 or 10 of the HNF4A gene have been found to develop disease much later (average 40 vs. 24 years) than MODY patients with mutations in exons 2-8 (Harries et al.). This difference in age-related penetrance is thought to be a consequence of the exon 9 and 10 mutations being absent from three of the nine HNF4A isoforms encoded by the HNF4A gene, whereas the mutations located in exons 2-8 affect all nine isoforms.\n\n    In some cases, the clinical penetrance of a particular mutation can change quite dramatically with age. For example, the cumulative incidence among carriers of the Arg1441Gly mutation in the LRRK2 gene causing Parkinson disease was found to be 12.5 % until the age of 65 years, but 83 % until age 80 (Ruiz-Martinez et al.). However, the penetrance of the common TTR Val30Met mutation causing autosomal dominant familial amyloid polyneuropathy has been estimated to be 1.7 % until the age of 30 years, 22 % until the age of 60, but still only 69 % until age 90 (Hellman et al.). Majounie et al. showed that the pathogenic GGGGCC hexanucleotide expansion in the C9orf72 gene associated with a high proportion of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia was non-penetrant in individuals younger than 35 years, 50 % penetrant by age 58 but almost fully penetrant by age 80. Age-dependent penetrance could thus provide another explanation for why some putatively pathological mutations listed in HGMD are present in apparently healthy individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project.\n\n    A glimpse of the way ahead is provided by a recent study of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of a specific granulin (GRN) mutation (Thr272Ser) responsible for autosomal dominant frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a disease whose onset typically occurs in the sixth decade of life (Milanesi et al.). Unsurprisingly, both the symptomatic and asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers had lower serum levels of progranulin than non-carriers. However, using whole-genome microarray analysis, the leukocyte expression of the TMEM40 and LY6G6F genes was found to be significantly higher in FTLD patients harbouring GRN mutations as compared to asymptomatic carriers. Further, elevated expression of the genes was correlated with increased brain damage and could therefore be directly related to the pathology of the disease (Milanesi et al.).\n\n    As briefly discussed above in the context of the influence of gender upon penetrance, epigenetic modifications may also account for incomplete penetrance. Thus, when monozygotic twins are discordant for disease phenotypes, epigenetic differences should be considered (Wong et al.; Kaminsky et al.; Gordon et al.; 2012). Indeed, monozygotic twins have been reported who differ both in relation to a specific clinical phenotype and in terms of an epigenotype. For example, monozygotic twins discordant for childhood leukaemia have been found to have discordant BRCA1 methylation status (Galetzka et al.). Similarly, hypermethylation of SLC6A4, encoding the serotonin transporter, has been reported in one member of a monozygotic twin pair discordant for bipolar disorder (Sugawara et al.).\n\n    Epigenetic differences may also contribute to incomplete penetrance in other conditions such as asthma, where DNA methylation has been reported to modulate the risk of disease conferred by genetic variants at the zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2; Berlivet et al.), forkhead box P3 (FOXP3; Runyon et al.), interferon-gamma (IFNG; Runyon et al.) and interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R; Soto-Ramirez et al.) gene loci.\n\n    A special case of imprinting is provided by X-inactivation (Dobyns et al.). When a disease gene is X-linked, skewed X-inactivation can cause variable penetrance of pathogenic mutations in female carriers (Van den Veyver). Examples of this phenomenon involve mutations in the TIMM8A gene (Xq22.1) in dystonia-deafness syndrome (Plenge et al.), the EBP gene (Xp11.23) in X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (Shirahama et al.), the FLNA gene (Xq28) in otopalatodigital type 1 syndrome (Hidalgo-Bravo et al.), the ABCD1 gene (Xq28) in a family with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (Wang et al.) and the ZIC3 gene (Xq26.3) in a family with complex heart defects (Chhin et al.). It should, however, be pointed out that some ZIC3 mutations are characterized by reduced penetrance in males, a finding that cannot be explained by skewed X-inactivation (Megarbane et al.).\n\n    The environment, in its broadest sense, will often influence clinical penetrance, either ameliorating or exacerbating the impact of heritable genetic variants (Hunter). Indeed, environmental modifiers of disease penetrance (e.g. diet, alcohol intake, drugs, metabolic syndrome) have long been known to influence the penetrance of HFE C282Y homozygosity in haemochromatosis (Beutler; Rossi et al.; Deugnier and Mosser).\n\n    One way to explore the relative contribution of genes and environment is by studying monozygotic twins harbouring the same pathogenic mutation(s) and sharing the same genetic background. Although the vast majority of such monozygotic twin pairs have been found to be concordant in terms of their clinical phenotypes (e.g. Miesfeldt et al.; Munhoz et al.; McDade et al.), others are quite discordant (Matsuo et al.; Amann et al.; Martin et al.; Holmgren et al.; Lachmann et al.; Czlonkowska et al.; Biegstraaten et al.; Fencl et al.; Iatropoulos et al.), suggesting that the environment can often play an important role in determining both the penetrance and expressivity of pathological mutations. [It should be borne in mind that there are various alternative genetic explanations for discordant phenotypes in monozygotic twins, including de novo post-zygotic mutation (Kentsis et al.; Vogt et al.), compensatory mutations (Mankad et al.) and somatic copy number variation (Bruder et al.) that obviate the need for a major contribution from the environment, as well as acquired epigenetic differences (Galetzka et al.; Bennett et al.)].\n\n    An environmental influence on penetrance is perhaps at its most evident in cancer susceptibility (Houlston and Peto; Shen). Indeed, an environmental component is very important in colorectal cancer where inherited genetic variants at a number of different loci interact primarily with dietary variables and overweight to confer risk (Hutter et al.; Siegert et al.). In similar vein, inherited differences in skin pigmentation influence the risk of melanoma, but this risk is further modified both by latitude of habitation and lifestyle choices (van der Velden et al.; Bishop et al.; Begg et al.; Meyle and Guldberg; Scherer and Kumar). Parity and breast feeding are both known to be modifiers of risk of breast/ovarian cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers (McLaughlin et al.; Jernstrom et al.; Cullinane et al.; Antoniou et al.). Another example of a gene-environment interaction in the context of cancer is provided by cytochrome P450 gene variants that may influence cancer risk by virtue of their roles in xenobiotic metabolism, detoxification of carcinogens, and to a lesser extent the bioactivation of procarcinogens (Rodriguez-Antona et al.). Lung cancer provides an excellent example of the interaction of genes and environment. Three different GWAS, published virtually simultaneously, provided the first convincing evidence for an association between heritable genetic variation at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 locus on chromosome 15q25.1 and lung cancer (Amos et al.; Hung et al.; Thorgeirsson et al.). Although allele T of SNP rs1051730, a synonymous variant located within exon 5 of the CHRNA3 gene, was found to be strongly associated with smoking quantity, the issue of whether the association with lung cancer was direct or indirect (i.e. mediated through cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence) remained unclear. Galvan and Dragan performed a meta-analysis of reported studies of the 15q25 region and found that this locus was not associated with lung cancer risk in never-smokers. This lack of effect argued for an indirect effect of genetic variation at the 15q25 locus on lung cancer risk via an association between these variants and smoking/nicotine dependence. However, Wang et al. subsequently examined the relationship between rs1051730 and lung cancer and concluded that, in addition to its indirect influence on disease risk (through smoking behaviour), this variant also exerted a rather larger (and direct) effect. Kaur-Knudsen et al. concurred, demonstrating that homozygosity for rs1051730 was associated with a smoking behaviour-adjusted relative risk of lung cancer of 1.6, indicating that rs1051730 is associated with an additional risk of lung cancer over and above that derived from its effect on smoking behaviour. Finally, in a lung cancer case-control study, VanderWeele et al. employed two 15q25.1 SNPs, rs8034191 and rs1051730, to show that the proportion of increased risk due to smoking was only 3.2 % and that the association of the 15q25 variants with lung cancer operates primarily through pathways other than smoking behaviour. All of the above notwithstanding, the risk of lung cancer conferred directly or indirectly by genetic variants on 15q25 would be small if the individual concerned simply opted not to smoke (Brennan et al.).\n\n    The penetrance of genetic variants conferring susceptibility to infectious disease is clearly contingent upon exposure to the specific pathogens concerned (Vannberg et al.; Chapman and Hill). One example is the CCR5 32-bp (c.554del32) deletion which is associated with a lower rate of HIV infection and a delay in the onset of AIDS (Smith et al.). Sex may also play a role in some conditions; thus, in multiple sclerosis, women appear to be more responsive to the environmental risk factors that cause the disease (Goodin; O'Gorman et al.).\n\n    Diet is also an important modifier of clinical penetrance. Thus, an inherited predisposition to obesity (exemplified by the association between dietary fat intake and obesity in carriers of the PPARG2 Pro12Ala allele; Memisoglu et al.) is in principle modifiable by diet (Walters et al.; Ramachandrappa and Farooqi). Similarly, the impact of genetic variants at the FTO locus on risk of obesity can be attenuated by physical activity (Kilpelainen et al.). Diet is also an important modifier of clinical penetrance in phenylketonuria, as mentioned in the \"Introduction\" to this review, where the penetrance of the condition can be very substantially reduced by restricting dietary phenylalanine (van Spronsen).\n\n    Heavy coffee drinkers have been known for some time to have a reduced risk of developing Parkinson disease. However, the risk of developing Parkinson disease has been found to be reduced even further for heavy coffee drinkers by a specific variant in the GRIN2A gene; compared to light coffee drinkers with an rs4998386_CC genotype, heavy coffee drinkers with the same genotype have an 18 % lower risk, whereas heavy coffee drinkers with an rs4998386_TC genotype have a 59 % lower risk (Hamza et al.).\n\n    More unusually, altitude has been reported to act as a modifier of the phenotypic severity of hereditary paraganglioma type 1 caused by mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase D (SDHD) gene (Astrom et al.). Since chronic hypoxic stimulation at high altitude causes sporadic carotid body paragangliomas, Astrom et al. proposed that SDHD might be involved in oxygen sensing. Thus, whilst SDHD mutations could impair oxygen sensing, low altitude may serve to reduce the penetrance of these mutations.\n\n    The clinical penetrance of psychological disorders and traits has long been known to be strongly influenced by gene-environment interactions (Dick). For example, a 44-bp deletion/insertion polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 was reported to be associated with depression after stressful life events (Caspi et al.). Recently, Klengel et al. gave us a glimpse of the likely complexity of the mechanisms underlying gene-environment interactions in the context of psychological disorders. These authors demonstrated that a risk variant for post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression in the FK506-binding protein 5 gene (FKBP5) is demethylated in several cell types in children exposed to trauma. This demethylation persists into adulthood and confers an increased risk of developing disease. In FKBP5 risk allele carriers, excessive cortisol release during early life stress leads to demethylation within the glucocorticoid-responsive elements of FKBP5 in intron 7 with the consequence of long-lasting disruption of the ultra-short feedback loop that balances FKBP5 and glucocorticoid receptor activity, causing dysregulation of the stress hormone system. The FKBP5 risk allele corresponds to a functional polymorphism located in intron 2 of the FKBP5 gene that alters the chromatin interaction between the transcriptional start site and long-range enhancers, thereby increasing the transcriptional activity of FKBP5 over and above that of the wild-type allele. Only the risk allele is able to form a three-dimensional complex which includes RNA polymerase II and a glucocorticoid-responsive element located within intron 7 of FKBP5. Enhanced transcription of the risk allele facilitates the PolII-dependent demethylation in intron 7 in response to elevated glucocorticoids under early life stressful conditions. The reduced methylation of intron 7 CpGs leads to increased induction of FKBP5 by glucocorticoid receptor activation, especially in risk allele carriers, representing an enhancement of the ultra-short feedback loop leading to increased glucocorticoid receptor resistance. If this occurs during developmentally critical periods, then the methylation patterns will remain stable over time (Klengel et al.). Hence, the demethylation in FKBP5 intron 7 depends upon both childhood trauma and the sequence variant in intron 2, in a tripartite gene-environment interaction (Szyf).\n\n    The above examples represent the tip of the iceberg because the clinical penetrance of most monogenic conditions and all complex disease is likely to be influenced by the environment in some way or another. A further glimpse of this complexity is perhaps provided by Kallberg et al. who reported interactions between HLA-DRB1 SE alleles, the A allele of the PTPN22 Arg620Trp (rs2476601) polymorphism and smoking in conferring risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Gene-environment interactions are also evident in asthma (Custovic et al.; Chang et al.) and eczema (Bisgaard et al.) and will become increasingly apparent in other disorders as new techniques are developed to identify them (Aschard et al.). To this end, mouse models are beginning to come into their own as a means to study the role of gene-environment interactions in the aetiology of human disorders; by these means, short-term gestational hypoxia has been found to increase the penetrance of vertebral defects in congenital scoliosis (Sparrow et al.).",

        "Conclusion": "    A holy grail of human medical genetics is to be able to deduce the likely clinical phenotype of an individual from their genotype or genomic sequence. It was once perhaps naively assumed that, at least for \"monogenic\" disorders, genotype-phenotype relationships would be that simple, and also fairly straightforward to discern. However, it has been clear for some time that it is inappropriate to regard such disorders as either simple or monogenic in any strict sense. Further, in many cases, the reality is that we cannot readily draw straight lines of causation from known genotypes to specific clinical phenotypes. This is because instances abound of individuals who harbour a disease-associated mutation/genotype, but who do not express certain features of the disease or who may even be asymptomatic. This phenomenon of reduced penetrance may or may not be the norm, but it is far from being a rare exception. Our appreciation of its full extent is still emerging, although some of the different mechanisms underlying reduced penetrance are now becoming apparent (Fig. 1).\n\n    It has become clear from large-scale sequencing studies that many individuals in the general population harbour large numbers of potentially disadvantageous variants without suffering any obvious ill effects (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium; MacArthur et al.; Xue et al.; Shen et al.). Thus, it would appear that many mutations are, on their own, insufficient to cause disease and need to occur in the presence of other genetic variants, either allelic or non-allelic, as well as facultative environmental factor(s), for a disease state to ensue. Indeed, many pathological mutations may only be conditionally pathogenic, exerting a detrimental effect only if and when the genetic and external environments interact to push the phenotype over some notional threshold into pathology.\n\n    Penetrance is best thought of as being a genotype-specific rather than a gene-specific or disease-specific phenomenon. Thus, in any given disease gene, some mutations may exhibit complete penetrance, whereas others may show incomplete or even quite low penetrance. Generally speaking, mutations that display low penetrance also tend to exert milder effects on the clinical phenotype and/or protein function, while the more highly penetrant a mutation is, the less frequent it is likely to be in the general population (Coventry et al.; Marth et al.; Gorlov et al.; Tennessen et al.; Nelson et al.; Subramanian; Fu et al.). Whereas highly penetrant mutations may exert their pathogenic effects with relatively little interaction with other genetic or environmental factors, low-penetrance mutations are generally characterized by significant gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (Cordell). Different combinations of such variants may contribute to the variable penetrance characteristic of both monogenic and complex disease.\n\n    Whatever the molecular basis may be in the case of a given mutation, reduced penetrance is in general likely to present a serious impediment to the implementation of any scheme designed to classify the pathological significance of human genetic variants (e.g. Plon et al.; Tavtigian et al.). Reduced penetrance is also likely to present problems in identifying pathological mutations in whole-genome/exome sequencing programmes unless it is explicitly built into the disease models being considered (Varga et al.). Despite the complexities it introduces, it also offers hope in the sense that if we are able to identify environmental factors, drugs or other types of intervention that serve to reduce the penetrance of a given pathological variant, or alternatively delay the onset of its pathological sequelae beyond the natural lifespan of its carrier, we shall have a whole new range of therapeutic approaches at our disposal.\n\n    Human genetic variation occurs as a continuum ranging from neutral polymorphisms, through functional polymorphisms and disease susceptibility variants to true pathological mutations with high penetrance. However, in addition and as discussed above, it has become increasingly clear that our genomes contain many 'putatively disadvantageous variants' that are probably insufficient on their own to cause disease, but nevertheless still have the potential to contribute to pathogenesis. Since it has also become clear that many genetic disorders are not monogenic as originally supposed, but may instead involve mutations in two or more genes, we speculate that different combinations of pathological mutations with low penetrance, functional polymorphisms, disease susceptibility variants and 'putatively disadvantageous variants' may vary quite considerably in terms of their net functional and hence clinical effect. Such combinations are likely to exert an influence on the age of onset and/or clinical severity of the disease in question.\n\n    The rationale of genetic studies of complex phenotypes has generally relied upon either the 'common disease, common variant (CDCV)' hypothesis or the 'common disease, rare variant (CDRV)' hypothesis. The former postulates that complex phenotypes result from the cumulative effects of a number of common variants, each with a modest effect size and relatively low penetrance. The latter proposes that complex phenotypes result from multiple rare variants, each with relatively high penetrance and large effect sizes (Schork et al.). It is highly likely that both rare and common alleles will contribute to complex phenotypes and so effect sizes may be expected to differ quite widely, with rare variants with large effects complemented by a large number of frequent variants with small effects. The clinical phenotypes of complex phenotypes are therefore likely to be due to individual effects of, and interaction between, multiple causative or contributory alleles, as well as non-genetic determinants.\n\n    The full relevance of digenic and oligogenic inheritance to the phenomenon of incomplete or variable penetrance remains to be elucidated. If, however, it turns out that digenic and oligogenic conditions are more common than originally anticipated, then many disease contributory variants will have evaded purifying selection, and hence those variants that in combination (but not individually) have significant pathogenic potential will not be as infrequent as might be expected under the CDRV hypothesis. Since both multiple common and rare variants may be involved in conferring disease susceptibility, we are not obliged to favour either the CDCV hypothesis or the CDRV hypothesis. Moreover, in view of the likely complexity of the gene-gene interactions involved, we concur with Lupski et al. that \"for a given individual, what is important to know is not only the number and location of pathogenic variants taken one at a time, but also the unique composition of his or her genome-wide mutational burden\".\n\n    Lupski et al. (2011) charted progress on the road to a unified genetic model for human disease and opined that such a model should unite categories of diseases, previously held to be distinct entities, as part of a continuum which would include chromosomal syndromes, genomic disorders, Mendelian traits and common diseases or complex traits. Concurring with this view, we envisage an integrated concept of genetic aetiology in which different types of mutation (from single base substitutions to copy number variants), different combinations of mutations in multiple genes (whether in homozygosity or heterozygosity), cis-acting or trans-acting modifiers, common variants, rare variants, de novo variants and even somatic variants, jointly serve to exacerbate or ameliorate a given clinical phenotype. Further, to explain the scale of reduced penetrance, we need to conceptualize clinical phenotypes as being derived, potentially at least, from the expression of different genetic variants in two or more genes. On the basis of the data collated for this review, it seems reasonable to conclude that digenic, oligogenic and polygenic influences are much more frequent than has perhaps hitherto been realized. Unravelling such influences will undoubtedly be key to understanding the molecular basis of reduced penetrance. The impact of disease genotypes may also be modified by epigenetic and environmental factors, allowing both for synergistic and antagonistic interactions resulting in highly individualized contributions to the phenotype (whether deleterious or protective) that will variously perturb the balance of specific biological pathways so as to give rise to disease.\n\n    With the advent of next-generation sequencing, very large numbers of genetic variants are being detected in individual genomes and it has been necessary to develop new algorithms to identify those variants which are of key functional/clinical importance. However, if in using these tools, we focus exclusively on single infrequent variants under the assumption that they will invariably exert their effects in splendid isolation, then there is a very real danger that we shall inadvertently exclude from consideration those more frequent variants with modest effects, blithely ignoring their potential for interaction with the rare variants. The irony would then be that, despite having the requisite mutation and polymorphism data available, the molecular basis of genotype-phenotype relationships in many inherited diseases (including, of course, the phenomenon of reduced penetrance) could still remain unintelligible. The alternative, anticipating multigenic influences on the clinical phenotypes associated with disorders traditionally regarded as being monogenic, should not only to lead to new insights into the nature of reduced penetrance, but is also likely to improve our understanding of the nature of complex disease.",
