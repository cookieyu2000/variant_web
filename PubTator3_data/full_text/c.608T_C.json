        "Title": "    ITGB5 mutation discovered in a Chinese family with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal-dominant genetic disorder, and mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene are one of the major genetic causes. As this study shows, there are many patients with BPES who do not have FOXL2 mutations, as the screening results in all family members were negative. Using whole-exome sequence analysis, we discovered another possible mutational cause of BPES in integrin subunit beta 5 (ITGB5). The ITGB5 mutation (c.608T>C, p.Ile203Thr) appears in the base sequence of all BPES+ patients in this family, and it appears to be a three-generation-inherited mutation. It can cause changes in base sequence and protein function, and there may be cosegregation of disease phenotypes. ITGB5 is located on the long arm of chromosome three (3q21.2) and is close to the known pathogenic gene FOXL2 (3q23). This study is the first to report ITGB5 mutations in BPES, and we speculate that it may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of BPES or indirectly through the regulation of FOXL2.",
        "Introduction": "    Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare congenital malformation, most of which is inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern, with a reported incidence of 1:50,000. BPES patients usually have common facial features, such as ptosis, narrow fissure, inverted epicanthus, widened epicanthus spacing, and low bridge of the nose, and also can be accompanied by microcephaly, premature ovarian failure, growth retardation, hypopituitary function, low intelligence, and other congenital abnormalities. In addition, some BPES patients may also have small eyes, nystagmus, eyelid varus or ectropion, strabismus, and lacrimal system anomalies, which can affect the visual development. Clinically, BPES is divided into types I and II. Female patients with type I are usually associated with infertility, primary amenorrhea or early menopause, and atrophy of a smaller uterus and ovaries. The main difference from type I is both male and female patients with type II can have children. BPES affects the appearance and ovarian function and fertility in female patients, which is a severe threat to physical and mental health.\n\n    Exons are the coding regions of proteins and, therefore, the most genetically valuable regions of DNA. All exons in the genome are termed the exome. The human genome is about 1.8 x 105 exons, accounting for only 1% of the human genome. Studies have shown that base mutations cause the occurrence and development of a variety of diseases in exons. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) utilizes sequence capture technology to capture and enrich exome DNA and then performs high-throughput sequencing. When studying diseases caused by genetic mutations, WES has obvious advantages. Compared with other genetic detection technologies, WES has the advantages of full detection range, high read depth, and reasonable cost. Therefore, WES technology is currently considered to be the most efficient and cost-effective genetic testing technology.\n\n    FOXL2 is known to be the major pathogenic gene in BPES. Using a combination of methods to detect mutations, the underlying genetic defect can be identified in the majority (88%) of patients with typical BPES. Overall, FOXL2 mutations accounted for 81% of the genetic defects found in BPES. In this study, FOXL2 mutation screening and WES were performed on a single Chinese BPES family, and the new candidate pathogenic genes and mutations were identified.",
        "Methods": "    In this study, a Chinese family with a history of BPES was recruited from the Plastic Surgery Hospital of Weifang Medical University. Of these nine family members, five were BPES+, of which four were female, and one was male. All of the family members denied consanguinity, improper drug use, had no history of disease or history of preterm birth.\n\n    Informed consent: Informed consent has been obtained from all individuals included in this study.\n\n    Ethical approval: The research related to human use has been complied with all the relevant national regulations, institutional policies, and in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration and has been approved by the authors' institutional review board or equivalent committee and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Plastic Surgery Hospital of Weifang Medical University.\n\n    Peripheral venous blood from BPES patients and healthy subjects was collected for genomic DNA extraction using TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TIANGEN BIOTECH, Beijing, China). The coding region of FOXL2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (forward primers: GAGTACCGGCAGATTTCAAG, GTTCGAGAAGGGCAACTACC, and CCTGACCTCTGTGACCTTGC. Reverse primers: AGTTGTTGAGGAAGCCAGAC, TGAGAGAGAGAGGCCAAGAGGTC, and AACAAAGCAGCAGCAGCGACAGC). Purified PCR products were sent to Beijing Liuhe BGI Technology Co., Ltd for sequencing. Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was used for the sequence alignment to screen for gene mutations. The wild-type FOXL2 gene sequence was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n\n    WES was performed by Beijing Novogene Biotech Co., Ltd. All BPES+ patients and the father (healthy subject) in this family participated in the study.\n\n    Raw high-throughput sequencing data were evaluated for quality in the presence of a reference sequence or a reference genome (GRCh37/hg19). Filtering on raw reads was based on the sequencing error rate, the data volume, and the degree of similarity to obtain clean reads, which was used for downstream analysis. The resulting sequence data were compared to the reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/), and the comparison results were obtained. SAMtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) was used to sort the comparison results, and duplicate reads were identified and labeled using Picard Tools (https://sourceforge.net/projects/picard/). We then used the comparison results after repeated labeling to carry out the final statistical calculations.\n\n    Data were analyzed using NCBI dbSNP database, the 1000 Genomes Project, and other existing databases. For the comparison results, we combined SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/), MutationTaster (https://www.mutationtaster.org/), Polyphen2 (http://gegetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), and other pathogenicity detection software to identify SNVs and indels using SAMTools and filtered the SNVs and indels by using the international filtering standards. ANNOVAR software (https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/) was used to annotate SNV and indel sites. This mainly included four steps: screening based on mutation harmfulness, screening based on sample conditions, screening based on the candidate genes and their relationship with disease phenotypes, and finally obtaining the candidate pathogenic mutations (Figure 1).\n\n    For linkage analysis, we used the Merlin tool (http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/Merlin/index.html) to combine the high-throughput sequencing data in the family with the allele frequency of the Chinese population in the HapMap database and used known SNVs as linkage markers to obtain the linkage candidate regions.\n\n    We conducted significant enrichment analysis on the candidate genes, including gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. In this process, we referred to the theories and methods of Chen et al., Yuan et al., and Liu et al., to identify the main metabolic and signal transduction pathways involved in these genes, analyzed the necessity of the candidate genes, and explored their relationship with the disease. Finally, we screened the candidate genes and ranked them according to how strongly they were associated with the disease.",
        "Results": "    Among the nine family members included in this study, there were five with BPES (Figure 2a). The clinical information of the patients was obtained by three plastic surgeons and an ophthalmologist at the Plastic Surgery Hospital of Weifang Medical University (Table 1). All patients had the typical ocular features of BPES: narrow fissure, ptosis, inverted epicanthus, widened epicanthus spacing, and low and flat nose bridge. In addition, the family proband (III:2) was diagnosed with bilateral amblyopia, strabismus, ametropia, and ophthalmoplegia. Currently, there is no unified standard for the treatment of patients with BPES. The family proband received frontal muscle fascial flap suspension surgery in our hospital. The operation was successful, and the patient's prognosis was favorable (Figure 2b and c). We found that except for one female patient (II:5 - young and unmarried with regular menstrual history, but had never given birth), the other females had normal menstruation and fertility, confirming that these patients have type II BPES.\n\n    According to Sanger sequencing analysis, the FOXL2 gene mutation screening results of the BPES+ patients recruited in this study were all negative. After WES analysis, we screened out a total of 52,215 mutation sites, detected 1,211 harmful mutations that might affect protein function, and obtained 33 pathogenic variants (SNV variants) and 11 likely pathogenic variants (including five SNV variants and six indel variants) through harmful degree analysis. A total of 44 variants and 43 candidate genes were identified (two SNV mutation sites were detected on the pathogenic candidate gene FLG [Filaggrin]). We also detected 20 candidate genes corresponding to SNVs and one candidate gene corresponding to indels through dominant inheritance pattern screening. There were 21 candidate genes and 21 mutation sites. Among them, the candidate gene FLG corresponding to an SNV overlapped with the harmfulness detection results, but the mutation sites were different. In the end, we obtained 63 candidate genes with 65 mutation sites (three mutation sites were detected on the candidate gene FLG), among which 58 SNV sites and 7 indel sites were identified.\n\n    The linkage analysis results showed that 27, 120, 46, 14, 49, 21, and 17 SNVs were obtained on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 15, respectively. The log odds score (LOD) values of these SNVs were greater than 1.5 (Figure 3). However, LOD values of all results, although greater than 1 but less than 3, indicate possible linkage, indicating that mutations at these sites may have cosegregation of disease phenotypes.\n\n    Gene ontology functional enrichment analysis could generate three results: cell component, biological pathway, and molecular function. Among them, 60 variants were enriched in cell component, 59 in biological pathway, and 60 in molecular function (Figure 4a-c). Enrichment analysis of KEGG pathway revealed seven variants (Figure 4d). At the same time, we screened candidate genes and ranked them according to how strongly they were associated with the disease (Figure 5). The top seven genes were toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, CD36, FKBP prolyl isomerase family member 6, inactive (FKBP6), CD46, ITGB5, and Kell metallo-endopeptidase (kell blood group, KEL). The variants corresponding to these candidate genes are all SNVs. According to the American Society of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) variation classification standard, ITGB5 currently has no disease-causing grade, whereas the remaining genes do, and their genetic mode is heterozygous. Of these, ITGB5 was the strongest gene associated with the disease among the genes screened by the dominant pattern. TLR2 showed the strongest association with disease. However, this mutation did not come from the proband maternal lineage but from the proband father (the healthy subject). This indicates that the mutation of this gene is not directly related to the incidence of BPES. In addition, there may be other underlying diseases in the proband and his father that have not been screened for. FKBP6 is associated with the Lipin 3 (LPIN3) gene and the RAD9 checkpoint clamp component A (RAD9A) gene and has been associated with Williams syndrome and Williams-Beuren syndrome, but FKBP6 does not have an advantage in terms of the strength of association with the target disease. We annotated the top seven genes based on the screened candidate genes (Table 2).\n\n    The ITGB5 gene, which encodes the beta subunit of integrin and can combine with different alpha chains to form a variety of heterodimers of integrin, is the strongest gene associated with the disease among the genes screened by the dominant pattern. Integrins are complete cell surface receptors involved in cell adhesion and cell surface-mediated signal transduction. alpha-v, beta-5 integrins are involved in the adhesion of the vitreous. This gene is also involved in the pathogenesis of keloids, diarrhea, glioblastomas, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer, among other diseases. We performed the data analysis based on NCBI website, pathogenicity prediction software, and research data (Figure 6). A missense mutation (c.608T>C, p.Ile203Thr) in the ITGB5 gene can change isoleucine at the 203rd position of the amino acid sequence to threonine, causing changes in the splicing sites and protein function. According to the analysis of amino acid conservatism, this mutation is highly conserved across species. Moreover, the LOD value of this mutation is greater than 1.5, suggesting the possibility of cosegregation of disease phenotypes. This mutation was present in exons of all BPES patients in this family, suggesting that this gene mutation may be related to the pathogenesis of BPES. In addition, the ITGB5 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q21.2), which is close to FOXL2 (3q23), a known pathogenic gene of BPES, and located upstream of the FOXL2 gene.",
        "Conclusion": "    In summary, through our in-depth screening and analytical methods, we detected a possible pathogenic gene mutation in a typical Chinese BPES family, other than the FOXL2 gene mutation. Using WES, we discovered this new candidate pathogenic gene to be ITGB5. This study is the first to describe that a mutation in ITGB5 could lead to genetic pathogenesis of BPES, and further studies with a larger patient cohort are needed to verify this novel finding.\n\n    Funding information: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81471880).\n\n    Conflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest.\n\n    Data availability statement: The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we recruited a Chinese BPES+ family with facial features typical of BPES, and through analysis of clinical data from the female members, this pedigree was confirmed to be type II BPES. We conducted FOXL2 gene screening on DNA samples from family members and found no FOXL2 gene mutation in this family, indicating that FOXL2 is not the pathogenic gene in this BPES family. Subsequently, WES was performed to screen for SNVs and indels. There are 3.6-4.4 M single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome, and the vast majority (more than 95%) of high-frequency SNPs (population medium gene frequency >5%) are recorded in the dbSNP database, and the high-frequency SNPs are generally not the main mutation sites for disease. At the same time, the human genome has about 350k indels at coding regions or splicing sites that may alter the translation of proteins. The results of mutation tests are usually enormous, but the number of mutations that are truly relevant to the disease being studied is limited. To screen for mutations truly related to the disease under study from the massive mutation-detection results, we need to conduct further analysis and screening of this data.\n\n    In 2015, the ACMG developed standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variation, which became the gold standard for the interpretation of data after high-throughput sequencing. The ACMG has developed a variation classification system and recommends specific standard terminology, which divides the variation into five types, including pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign, to describe mutations found in genes responsible for Mendelian diseases. Based on the existing information analysis methods, we classified the harmfulness of mutation sites and obtained 33 pathogenic variants and 11 likely pathogenic variants. Subsequently, we screened for dominant inheritance patterns of Mendelian diseases. In dominant diseases, the pathogenic mutation from either parent is usually heterozygous, and the heterozygous mutation on the candidate gene should be considered first. The candidate sites we choose should be heterozygous mutations on the autosomes of patients but not on the chromosomes of healthy individuals. The BPES family in this study had three successive generations of onset, and the clinical phenotype was typical and single. Both male and female family members had the disease, which was in line with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern, and the disease showed a trend of aggravation by generation. We detected 20 candidate genes corresponding to SNVs and one candidate gene corresponding to an indel in this family. Subsequently, we identified the most important biochemical metabolic pathways and signal transduction pathways involved by the mutant genes through significant enrichment analysis and screened out the genes strongly associated with the disease through genotypic phenotype 1 analysis. In the end, we found that ITGB5 was the gene that was most strongly associated with disease in the genes screened by dominant pattern.\n\n    The human ITGB5 gene is a member of the integrin family, and its main function is to participate in the adhesion of immune cells. ITGB5 is commonly present as a dimer, including alpha and beta subunits, which preferentially bind to cellular adhesion molecules and constitute components of the extracellular matrix. ITGB5 is highly expressed in the lung and moderately expressed in the spleen and shows low expression in the small intestine, lymph, thymus, and liver. This gene has a variety of functions in biological processes, including cell migration during cell growth and wound repair, cell variation and apoptosis, and regulation of potential metastasis of some tumor cells.\n\n    A mutation in the ITGB5 gene (c.608T>C, p.Ile203Thr) appeared in the base sequence of all patients with BPES in this family. Based on linkage analysis, the LOD value of this mutation was greater than 1.5, suggesting the possibility of cosegregation of disease phenotypes. In addition, ITGB5 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q21.2) and is just upstream of the known pathogenic gene of BPES, FOXL2 (3q23). We speculate that it may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of BPES or indirectly involved through the regulation of FOXL2.",

        "Title": "    Genotypic and Allelic Frequencies of GJB2 Variants and Features of Hearing Phenotypes in the Chinese Population of the Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort",
        "Abstract": "    Background: This study aimed to describe the distribution of the genotype and allele frequencies of GJB2 variants in the Chinese population of the Dongfeng Tongji cohort and to analyze the features of the hearing phenotype. Methods: We used data from 9910 participants in the Dongfeng Tongji cohort in 2013 and selected nine GJB2 variants. Pure tone audiometry was employed to measure hearing. Differences in genotype and allele frequencies were analyzed via chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Results: Of the 9910 participants, 5742 had hearing loss. The genotype frequency of the GJB2 variant c.109G>A was statistically significantly distributed between the normal and impaired hearing groups, but not for the variant c.235delC. A higher frequency of the c.109G>A homozygous genotype was found in the hearing loss group (0.5%) than in the normal hearing group (0.1%). Patients with c.109G>A and c.235delC homozygous mutations exhibited varying degrees of hearing loss, mainly presenting sloping and flat audiogram shapes. Conclusions: A significant difference was found in the genotype frequency of the GJB2 variant c.109G>A between the case and control groups, but not in that of the variant c.235delC. Different degrees of hearing loss and various audiogram shapes were observed in patients with c.109G>A and c.235delC homozygous mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss is a common sensory disorder affecting more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, including 430 million with moderate or severe hearing loss. Hereditary factors or predispositions account for approximately 50% of hearing loss. Genetic hearing loss includes syndromic and non-syndromic types, with marked genetic heterogeneity. Of the genetic cases, about 70% are non-syndromic deafness, of which around 80% are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. To date, 124 genes have been identified for non-syndromic hearing loss and 77 for autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. The most common cause of non-syndromic hearing loss is mutations in the gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) gene (OMIM: 121011), which encodes the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26) on chromosome 13q12.11.\n\n    Since hearing loss related to GJB2 was first described in 1997, more than 300 pathogenic variants of GJB2 have been reported. In different regions of the world, the spectrums and frequencies of mutations in GJB2 vary widely. The mutant allele of c.35delG is prevalent in populations of Europe and the Middle East, c.235delC is common in East Asia, and p.W24X is mainly found in India. In addition, c.167delT and p.R143W are found in Ashkenazim and Ghanaians, respectively. The c.109G>A, a specific variant of GJB2, is also common among deaf patients in East Asia. However, the classification of this missense variant has been controversial. The c.109G>A variant was initially reported as a benign polymorphism because of its high prevalence among people with normal hearing. Later, c.109G>A was identified as homozygous or in trans with known pathogenic GJB2 mutations in affected individuals. Currently, c.109G>A is considered a pathogenic mutation with incomplete penetrance, and the homozygous mutation is associated with various hearing phenotypes. Similarly, the other GJB2 variants show diverse phenotypes, ranging from mild to profound, which largely depend on the genotype. Patients with biallelic \"truncating\" mutations that completely block protein expression generally have severe to profound hearing loss, whereas patients with at least one \"non-truncating\" mutant allele have a lower hearing threshold due to impaired but not inactivated protein function. However, even among patients with the same genotype of the GJB2 mutation, auditory phenotypes show great variability. Therefore, further investigation of genotype-phenotype correlations is needed to guide clinical evaluation and genetic counseling of patients with hearing loss associated with the GJB2 mutations.\n\n    Given the dominant role of GJB2 mutations in hearing loss and their genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity, it is important to analyze the frequency distribution and genotype-phenotype correlation of GJB2 mutations in hearing loss patients for genetic diagnosis and counseling. This study aimed to: (1) analyze the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of GJB2 mutations in the Chinese population from the Dongfeng Tongji (DFTJ) cohort and (2) investigate audiogram shapes in patients with hearing loss with regard to different genotypes of c.109G>A and c.235delC mutations in the GJB2 gene.",
        "Methods": "    The DFTJ cohort is a prospective study launched in September 2008 in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, China, based on retired employees of Dongfeng Motor Corporation. The baseline survey was conducted between September 2008 and June 2010, with subsequent follow-ups every five years. Information on demographic characteristics, lifestyle, health status, and medical history was collected by trained interviewers using a standardized questionnaire. In addition, participants performed physical examinations and provided samples of peripheral venous blood after an overnight fast. A total of 27,009 participants completed baseline questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood sample collections. Between April and October 2013, 25,978 participants completed the first follow-up. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) was first added in 2013, with 11,513 participants in the baseline population undergoing the test. The approval of the DFTJ cohort protocol was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Dongfeng General Hospital, Dongfeng Motor Corporation. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.\n\n    After the exclusion of 57 participants with invalid audiometric data and 1544 participants who lacked the genotype and failed quality control, this study included 9912 participants with complete data on nine GJB2 mutations and audiometry. After those participants missing the age variable data (n = 2) were removed, 9910 participants were used for the final analysis.\n\n    In a special soundproof room at Dongfeng General Hospital, participants underwent pure tone tests administered by professional audiologists using a calibrated pure tone audiometer (Micro-DSP ZD21, Micro DSP Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China) after an otological examination. Air conduction thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz were recorded for each ear and coded as a maximum when the maximum was unresponsive. Hearing loss was defined as an average threshold at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz (PTA0.5-4 kHz) greater than 25 decibels of hearing level (dB HL) in the better ear. The severity of hearing loss was categorized as mild (25 dB HL < PTA0.5-4 kHz <= 40 dB HL), moderate (40 dB HL < PTA0.5-4 kHz <= 60 dB HL), and severe-profound (PTA0.5-4 kHz > 60 dB HL).\n\n    Based on Liu's classification criteria, the audiogram shapes of 5742 participants with hearing loss were classified as follows: sloping, where the difference between the mean thresholds at 4 kHz and 8 kHz and the mean thresholds at 0.5 kHz and 1 kHz was greater than 15 dB HL; flat, where the difference between the thresholds at 0.5 to 8 kHz was less than 15 dB HL; mid-frequency U-shaped, where the difference between the worst hearing thresholds at mid-frequency and those at lower and higher frequencies was greater than 15 dB HL; ascending, where the difference between the low-frequency thresholds and the high-frequency thresholds was greater than 15 dB HL; and residual, where only residual hearing was present at lower frequencies. Those not belonging to any of the above audiogram shapes were classified as \"other\". Due to the relatively small sample size of patients with mid-frequency U-shaped (0.8%) and ascending (3.7%) hearing loss, the two types were combined into the \"special\" type.\n\n    For the purpose of genetic analysis related to hearing loss, nine common GJB2 mutations in the Chinese population were selected. Nine GJB2 variants or single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected as follows: c.11G>A (rs111033222), c.79G>A (rs2274084), c.*84T>C (rs3751385), c.109G>A (rs72474224), c.235delC (rs80338943), c.341A>G (rs2274083), c.368C>A (rs111033188), c.571T>C (rs397516878), and c.608T>C (rs76838169). These variants were genotyped in a genome-wide association study scan of the DFTJ cohort using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 chips (Affymetrix China Inc., Shanghai, China)and Illumina Infinium Omni Zhong Hua-8 Chips (Illumina Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). In brief, these SNPs were successfully genotyped after quality control, excluding any SNPs with missing call rate > 5%, minor allele frequency < 1%, and p value of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium < 10-5. There were 703,302 SNPs in the Illumina dataset and 549,196 in the Affymetrix dataset. Genotypes of markers in the Illumina and Affymetrix datasets were imputed separately using the 1000 Genomes Project ALL Phase 3 Integrated Release Version 5 haplotypes as a reference panel. Detailed descriptions of the genotyping and quality control processes are available elsewhere.\n\n    The categorical variables were expressed as numbers with percentages, and the continuous variables as means with standard deviations. Comparisons of differences in genotype and allele frequencies between groups were conducted using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. The threshold for significance was set at a two-sided p-value of less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using R software (version 4.2.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",
        "Results": "    Table 1 shows the characteristics of the total samples. A total of 9910 participants were included in the study, with a gender makeup of 52.4% (n = 5197) female and 47.6% (n = 4713) male. The mean age was 67.2 years. In total, 5742 participants had hearing loss, including 66.3% (n = 3806) mild, 27.5% (n = 1581) moderate, and 6.2% (n = 355) severe to profound. In addition, the mean ages of the controls and patients were 63.9 (7.0) and 69.7 (7.1) years, respectively.\n\n    Table 2 shows the genotype and allele frequencies of the nine mutations of the GJB2 gene in the cohort and between the hearing-impaired and normal groups. Based on the variant annotation in the ClinVar database (, accessed on 13 May 2023), two variants are reported as pathogenic variants (c.109G>A and c.235delC); five are benign or likely benign variants (c.79G>A, c.*84T>C, c.341A>G, c.368C>A, and c.608T>C); one is uncertain (c.571T>C); and the last has a conflicting interpretation of pathogenicity (c.11G>A). We found a significant difference (p-value < 0.001) in the genotype frequency distribution of c.109G>A between the case and control groups (Table 2). Compared to the normal hearing group, the frequency of homozygous genotype was higher in the hearing loss group (0.1% in the normal hearing group and 0.5% in the hearing loss group). The homozygous mutation in c.109G>A affected a wide range of frequencies, and the detailed characteristics and pure tone thresholds of the 31 participants with homozygous genotypes in the cohort are shown in Table 3. The frequency distribution of p.V37 I alleles was nearly the same between the case and control groups (6.0% in controls and 6.3% in the hearing loss group), but not significantly different. Furthermore, the frequency of the c.109G>A homozygous genotype increased with hearing threshold in 5742 participants with hearing loss (0.4% mild, 0.7% moderate, and 0.8% severe-profound) (Figure 1), but no significant difference was observed between groups (p = 0.369). Likewise, no statistical difference was found for the frequency distribution of c.109G>A alleles across hearing loss severity groups (p = 0.274) (Figure 2).\n\n    However, regarding c.235delC, the most common mutation reported in the Chinese population with hearing loss, the frequency distributions of its genotype and allele were not found to differ significantly between controls and cases (Table 2). The carrier frequency of c.235delC was 1.1% in the general population controls (Table 2). Among the 5742 patients with hearing loss, the carrier frequency was 1.4%, and only two patients were identified with homozygous mutations (Table 2), with proportions of 0.1% and 0.3% in moderate and severe-profound hearing loss, respectively (Figure 1). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the allele frequency of c.235delC between the different hearing loss severity groups (p = 0.661) (Figure 2).\n\n    Moreover, among the five benign variants, we found statistically significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of c.*84T>C between case and control groups (Table 2). The allele frequency of c.*84T>C was comparable between the case and control groups (53.9% in the control group and 52.5% in the hearing loss group). A similar distribution was observed for the other four benign variants (c.79G>A, c.341A>G, c.368C>A, and c.608T>C) (Table 2). There were no statistical differences in genotype and allele frequencies for the remaining two variants (c.11G>A and c.571T>C) (Table 2).\n\n    Figure 3a shows the distribution of audiogram shapes in the overall hearing loss group: 66.6% were sloping, 11.6% were flat, 4.5% were special, 6.7% were residual, and 10.6% were other. We analyzed the audiogram shape distributions of the two pathogenic variants (c.109G>A, and c.235delC) under different genotypes. As shown in Figure 3b, the c.109G>A and c.235delC variants presented various audiogram shapes, mainly showing sloping and flat types. The proportions of the sloping type in the c.109G>A heterozygous and homozygous genotypes were 70% and 82.1%, and the proportions of the flat type were 10% and 7.1%. For the c.235delC variant, the proportions of the sloping phenotype were 66% in the heterozygous genotypes and 100% in the homozygous genotypes; the flat phenotype was 14.4% in the heterozygous genotype.",
        "Conclusion": "    To sum up, we observed a statistically significant distribution of genotype frequencies of the GJB2 variants c.*84T>C and c.109G>A between cases and controls in a Chinese population in the large-scale DFTJ cohort, but not for the c.235delC variant. Patients with c.109G>A and c.235delC homozygous mutations exhibited diverse hearing loss severities and audiogram shapes. These findings could provide evidence for genetic diagnosis and counseling for hearing loss.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    In this study of 9910 participants from the DFTJ cohort, we described an overview of the genotype and allele frequency distributions of nine variants with the GJB2 gene and analyzed the audiogram phenotypic profiles of two pathogenic variants for the hearing loss group. A significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases and controls was observed for the variants c.*84T>C and c.109G>A, while the other seven variants (including c.235delC) were not statistically different between cases and controls. Homozygous mutations in c.109G>A and c.235delC showed different degrees of hearing loss and various shapes of audiogram, mainly sloping and flat. This study was a large-scale population analysis of GJB2-related variants (including 4168 participants with normal hearing and 5742 patients with hearing loss), and contained objective pure tone audiometric measurements that could effectively characterize the hearing phenotype.\n\n    Consistent with our expectations, we found that the genotype frequencies of the c.109G>A variant in GJB2 were statistically significantly distributed between cases and controls. The frequency of homozygous genotype in the hearing impaired group was 0.5%, lower than that reported in other Chinese populations in a recent study, where c.109G>A homozygous genotypes accounted for 2.6% of patients with hearing loss (there were eleven c.109G>A homozygous genotypes in the eighty-eight patients with mild to moderate hearing loss and fourteen in the eight hundred and fifty-seven patients with severe to profound hearing loss). A possible explanation for this difference could be the different populations included. The age of the subjects in our study was generally much older, which might not exclude the contribution of aging to the hearing loss phenotype. In addition, we observed that the allele frequencies of c.109G>A were approximately equal between the normal and impaired hearing groups, with no significant difference. This might be because most of the alleles were contributed by unaffected heterozygote carriers, as observed in our study where the proportion of c.109G>A heterozygotes approximated between control and case groups (Table 2). Accordingly, it is more appropriate to compare genotype frequencies rather than allele frequencies in case and control analyses to interpret the variants related to autosomal recessive inheritance patterns in the GJB2 gene. In agreement with several previous studies, we observed that patients with the c.109G>A homozygous genotype displayed different levels of hearing loss. Notably, Chai et al. further investigated potentially pathogenic variants in fourteen patients with severe to profound hearing loss of the c.109G>A homozygous genotype, and they identified another pathogenic variant of CDH23 coexisting with the c.109G>A homozygous mutation in one patient. Therefore, when c.109G>A homozygous mutations are identified in patients with severe to profound hearing loss, there may be concurrent mutations in other genes or other alternative causes, such as infection or aging. However, because of the lack of such data, alternative etiologies of c.109G>A homozygous mutations in patients with severe to profound hearing loss were not investigated in our study, and further studies are needed to elucidate them.\n\n    The c.235delC variant has been reported to be the most prevalent GJB2-associated variant in Chinese patients with hearing loss. In addition, Dai et al. reported that the frequency distributions of 235delC homozygous and heterozygous genotypes in patients with hearing loss varied significantly in different regions of China, ranging from 0% to 14.7% for the homozygous genotype and 1.7% to 16.1% for the heterozygous genotype. In general, the 235delC variant is more commonly found in northern China. In our study, we observed two hearing-impaired patients with c.235delC homozygous genotypes, who showed moderate and severe to profound hearing loss, respectively. Participants in the DFTJ cohort were retired employees of Dongfeng Motor Corporation who had normal hearing before beginning work. However, it should be noted that individuals with severe hearing loss would not be hired. This restriction on hearing performance might explain the inconsistent frequency of c.235delC homozygous mutations observed in our study compared to other studies. The 235delC variant in the GJB2 gene causes a frameshift mutation that prematurely terminates translation and produces a non-functional gap junction protein. Patients with the c.235delC homozygous genotype usually present with severe to profound prelingual hearing loss. However, other studies have shown that patients with the c.235delC homozygous mutation also show mild to moderate hearing phenotypes. Consistent with these findings, one of the patients in our study with the c.235delC homozygous genotype had moderate hearing loss, suggesting that the hearing phenotype of patients with the c.235delC homozygous mutation was diverse.\n\n    We found that the genotype and allele frequencies of c.*84T>C were statistically different between the normal and impaired hearing groups. The c.*84T>C is located in the 3'UTR region of the GJB2 gene and has been identified as a benign variant. Technological advances in sequencing and many other assays have facilitated the elucidation of the non-coding genome. Many noncoding elements have been found to be linked to hearing loss, and the identification of non-coding variants in hearing loss is expected to improve diagnostic rates. The genotype and allele frequencies of the c.*84T>C variant reported in our study may provide a molecular epidemiologic basis for future studies on non-coding region variants. In addition, two previous studies reported a significant association of the c.*84T>C with noise-induced hearing loss. We observed that the allele frequencies of four benign variants (c.79G>A, c.341A>G, c.368C>A, and c.608T>C) were similar between cases and controls, whereas another study reported that their allele frequencies were greater in controls than in patients.\n\n    In agreement with a previous study, the audiogram shapes of the c.109G>A and c.235delC variants presented various audiometric configurations in this study, with a dominance of sloping and flat types. Similarly, Liu et al. found that audiogram shapes in most patients with GJB2-related hearing loss were generally residual, sloping, or flat, but similar to those observed in hearing impaired patients without the GJB2 mutation, suggesting a possible poor correlation between the type of GJB2 mutation and audiogram shape.\n\n    The limitations of this study should also be considered. First, the participants were from a single cohort and might not be representative of the general Chinese population, which limited the generalizability of the results. Second, other pathogenic variants in GJB2 were not included in the study. Finally, this study also did not consider the case of compound heterozygotes in the GJB2 gene or in combination with other genes, which requires further research.",

        "Title": "    Factor 8 Gene Mutation Spectrum of 270 Patients with Hemophilia A: Identification of 36 Novel Mutations",
        "Abstract": "    Hemophilia A (HA) is the most severe X-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by hemizygous mutations in the factor 8 (F8) gene. The aim of this study is to determine the mutation spectrum of the F8 gene in a large HA cohort from Turkey, and then to establish a phenotype-genotype correlation.\n\n    All HA cases (270 patients) analyzed molecularly in the Ege University Pediatric Genetics Molecular Laboratory between March 2017 and March 2018 were included in this study. To identify intron 22 inversion (Inv22), intron 1 inversion (Inv1), small deletion/insertions, and point mutations, molecular analyses of F8 were performed using a sequential application of molecular techniques.\n\n    The mutation detection success rate was 95.2%. Positive Inv22 was found in 106 patients (39.3%), Inv1 was found in 4 patients (1.5%), and 106 different disease-causing sequence variants were identified in 137 patients (50.6%). In 10 patients (3.7%), amplification failures involving one or more exonic regions, considered to be large intragenic deletions, were identified. Of 106 different F8 mutations, 36 were novel. The relationship between F8 genotype and inhibitor development was considered significant.\n\n    A high mutation detection rate was achieved via the broad molecular techniques applied in this study, including 36 novel mutations. With regard to mutation types, mutation distribution and their impact on clinical severity and inhibitor development were found to be similar to those previously reported in other hemophilia population studies.",
        "Introduction": "    Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 5000 males, and it is the most severe inherited bleeding disorder. The clinical phenotype of HA is classified as severe (FVIII:C <1%), moderate (FVIII:C 1%-5%), and mild (FVIII:C >5%) in accordance with the level of coagulant activity of FVIII (FVIII:C).\n\n    The coagulation factor 8 gene (F8) is one of the largest genes in the genome, spanning 186 kb, consisting of 26 exons, and being localized at Xq28. More than 3000 unique mutations have been recorded across both the HA Mutation Database (HAMSTeRS) and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Mutations are classified into three groups: large rearrangements (intron 22 inversion, intron 1 inversion), intragenic deletions or insertions, and single-nucleotide variants (missense, nonsense, and splice site). In severe HA the most common gene defect is an intron 22 inversion, which is responsible for 40%-50% of cases. However, taking all phenotypes into consideration, point mutations are found in about 47%, making them the most prolific. The other F8 gene variants, such as intron 1 inversion (Inv) and large deletions, are seen less frequently.\n\n    The F8 genotype is reported to be associated with clinical severity, risk of inhibitor formation, and response to immune tolerance therapy. Taking this into account, mutation analysis of the F8 gene is crucial for prediction of disease severity, choice of appropriate treatment, and optimal genetic counseling. The aim of this study is to determine the mutation spectrum of the F8 gene in HA patients and then to establish a phenotype-genotype correlation.",
        "Methods": "    All HA cases (270 patients) analyzed molecularly in the Ege University Pediatric Genetics Molecular Laboratory between March 2017 and March 2018 were included in this study. Demographic features, factor VIII:C levels, and inhibitor status were all obtained from medical records retrospectively. The clinical severity of the patients was classified into three groups (severe, moderate, and mild) in accordance with their factor VIII:C levels, which had been measured previously using a standard one-stage clotting assay. The FVIII inhibitor titers of all HA patients in this study were quantified using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay. Informed consent for all molecular studies was obtained from either the patient directly or from their guardians. The study was approved by the Erciyes University Ethics Review Committee.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from 2 mL of peripheral blood in EDTA using a Gentra Puregene Blood Kit (QIAGEN), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Using the inverse-shifting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, all patients were first screened for intron 22 inversion (Inv22) with the HA Genotyping Kit, Part A (MultiGen Healthcare). Any negative results were then tested for Inv1 via multiplex PCR. In patients found to be negative for both Inv22 and Inv1, a sequencing analysis of all the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the F8 gene was then performed. The sequence analysis was performed on an Illumina MiSeq or MiniSeq platform using the HA Genotyping Kit, Part B (MultiGen Healthcare).\n\n    Sequence variants were interpreted in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. All identified F8 gene variants with a frequency of less than 1% in public databases were selected. Databases included NCBI dbSNP build141 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), the 1000 Genomes Project (http://www.1000genomes.org/), the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/), and the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) Exome Variant Server (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). Selected variants were then checked against the HAMSTeRS database (http://www. HAMSTeRS.ac.uk/) and the HGMD [5,6]. The impact of novel variants on the protein structure was then classified using several in silico prediction tools such as MutationTaster, Polyphen-2, and SIFT. Conservation of residues across species was evaluated using the PhyloP algorithm and GERP.\n\n    The mutations found in this study were classified as either high-risk (Inv22, Inv1, large deletions, point mutations including nonsense, frameshifts) or low-risk F8 genotypes (missense variants, inframe deletion/insertions and splice mutations). As outlined in the RODIN study, which suggested an association between the F8 genotype and its impact on inhibitor development, the mutations identified in this study were also classified within the same parameters.\n\n    IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all analyses. Comparisons were made using the Fisher exact test and p<0.05 was considered significant.",
        "Results": "    Molecular analysis was performed for 270 HA patients (age at diagnosis: 7.9+-5.27 months) from unrelated families. Of the patients, 269 were boys. In 106 HA patients (39.3%), Inv22 mutation was found. Following the second step, Inv1 was found in 4 HA patients (1.5%). The remaining Inv22- and Inv1-negative patients were then analyzed for F8 sequence variations and a disease-causing variant was found in 137 (50.6%). In patients with no F8 gene mutation, sequence views were reevaluated using IGV. In 10 patients (3.7%), amplification failures involving one or more exonic regions, considered as large intragenic deletions, were identified. The sequence analysis of the patients in whom these deletions were found was then resequenced, and the same results were confirmed (del ex1, del ex2-9, del ex7-13 (in two unrelated families), del ex9, del ex11-12, del ex12, del ex14, del ex15-22, del ex26). After all molecular analysis steps, no mutations were found in 13 HA patients (4.8%). Across the whole study group, considering Inv22, Inv1, and F8 sequence analysis, the mutation detection success rate was 95.2%.\n\n    A total of 106 different likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants were identified within 137 families. Of the variants, 56 (52.9%) were missense, 18 (16.9%) nonsense, 25 (23.7%) frameshift, 6 (5.6%) splice site, and 1 (0.9%) inframe deletion. Among the 106 mutations, 36 mutations in 42 families were novel (33.9%). Of the 36 novel mutations, 16 (44.5%) were frameshift, 15 (41.7%) missense, and 5 (13.8%) nonsense. The novel mutations identified in this study, including their distribution in exonic and domain levels, are given in Table 1. A list of all mutations detected in this study is given as supplemental data in the Appendix.\n\n    Taking the clinical severity of the 270 HA patients into consideration, 221 (81.9%) cases were severe, with 49 (18.1%) moderate or mild. The mutation spectra of both severe and/or mild/moderate HA groups are given in Figure 1.\n\n    One of the patients in the study group was an 11-month-old girl, admitted to the hospital due to a right occipital fracture and epidural hematoma. She was born to consanguineous parents, and her father had severe HA. Her coagulation test results were found compatible with severe HA. In this patient, the homozygous variant c.608T>C (L203P) was found. Segregation analysis showed that the father had the same mutation hemizygously and the mother heterozygously.\n\n    Of all HA patients with a causative mutation identified in this study, 67.3% (173 of 257) were classified as high-risk. Among severe HA patients, this frequency increased to 78.9% (168 of 213).\n\n    The association between mutation risk group and clinical severity was found to be statistically significant (p<0.001).\n\n    Inhibitor status of all but 2 HA patients (1 with severe and 1 with mild/moderate HA) was evaluated in this study. The frequency of inhibitor-positive patients was found to be 14.1% (38 of 268). When only severe HA patients were taken into consideration, this frequency was 16.7% (37 of 220). From among the mild/moderate HA group, only one patient was found to be inhibitor-positive (2%; 1 of 48).\n\n    In the patients with Inv22, the frequency of inhibitor positivity was 23.6% (25 of 106), significantly higher than in those without Inv22 (p=0.001). Two of 4 patients (50%) with Inv1 showed inhibitor positivity.\n\n    In the high-risk mutation group, inhibitor positivity was found in 35 of 173 patients (20.2%). In the low-risk mutation group, inhibitor development was detected in only 3 of 84 patients (3.6%). The association between mutation risk group and inhibitor development was statistically significant (p<0.001).",
        "Conclusion": "    A high mutation detection rate has been achieved via the broad molecular techniques performed in this study, including 36 novel mutations.

        "Discussion": "    Since the discovery of the F8 gene in 1984, a number of studies evaluating the F8 gene mutation spectrum of patients have been published. From 846 families with severe and nonsevere hemophilia, Oldenburg et al. showed intron 22 inversion to be responsible for 35.7% of cases, point mutations for 47.5%, and small deletion/insertions for 10.2%. Intron 1 inversion, large deletions, and splice site mutations were rarely found. In our study, the mutation detection rate in the F8 gene was 95.2%. This was achieved through following a protocol that involved up to three procedures: Inv22, Inv1, and F8 sequencing analyses. The frequencies of mutation types in our study are similar to those found in previous studies.\n\n    In mild/moderate HA cases, missense mutations are the major mutation type with a frequency of 70%-80%. In this study, we found the frequency of missense mutations to be highest (77%) among mild/moderate HA patients, supporting earlier studies.\n\n    Studies from Turkey evaluating the F8 mutation spectrum in HA patients are limited. In 1999, El-Maarri et al. investigated intron 22 inversions using Southern blot analysis in 141 HA patients from Turkey. Intron 22 inversion mutation was found in 29% of all HA cases and in 42% of the severe HA cases. In another study, the mutation detection rate of DNA sequencing in intron 22 inversion-negative patients was reported as 61%, with 36 different F8 gene mutations being detected. In these previous studies from Turkey, patient numbers were limited and a complete molecular diagnosis algorithm was not followed. In terms of patient numbers, this is the largest study from Turkey and it also includes the broadest range of molecular testing techniques.\n\n    Large deletions are responsible for 3% of severe HA cases. To date, about 265 different large deletions (>50 bp) in the F8 gene have been recorded in the HAMSTeRS database. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a standard test used for the detection of large deletions in the F8 gene. MLPA analysis was not available in our laboratory; however, following the reanalysis of the F8 gene due to amplification failures in 10 patients, large deletions were considered. In X-linked diseases it has been shown that, in males, amplification failure in PCR may indicate deletion mutations. However, MLPA analysis should be performed to confirm the hemizygous deletions. Furthermore, due to the existence of the other X chromosome with wild type, F8 gene MLPA analysis is also necessary for detecting female deletion carriers.\n\n    Currently, more than 3000 unique mutations have been recorded in the databases of HAMSTeRS and HGMD. In this study, we found 36 different novel mutations in 42 unrelated families. Interestingly, a novel specific missense mutation (c.608T>C) in 5 unrelated families has been reported here for the first time, suggesting a founder effect. We reinvestigated the family history from these patients to evaluate them for a common ancestral region. We identified no consanguinity between these families. Three of them were from the Aegean Region of Turkey and 2 from the Middle Anatolian Region. However, each family was from a different city.\n\n    Approximately 25%-30% of patients with severe HA develop inhibitors within 14 exposure days. Inhibitor risk is lower in patients with mild and moderate disease than those with severe disease. However, these patients still developed inhibitors at an incidence reported as 6.7% by the 50th exposure day. In our study of mild/moderate HA patients, the risk of inhibitor development was also significantly low (2%) when compared to the risk of severe HA. It has been reported that there is a firm correlation between genotype and inhibitor development in HA patients. The incidence of inhibitors is greatest in patients with disruptive structural variations such as large multi-exon deletions (67%-88%), while being comparatively lower in those with HA due to missense variants (<12%). Data from the recent SIPPET (Survey of Inhibitors in Plasma-Product Exposed Toddlers) study showed the risk of inhibitor formation to be highest in those with variants predicted as being null. No correlation between inhibitor risk and type of product used was observed. These results support HA genotype being a strong driver of inhibitor formation, with variants resulting in little or no protein synthesis putting patients most at risk. Consistent with these data, inhibitor formation was identified as 23.6% in patients with Inv22, 30% in those with large intragenic deletions, and 50% in those with Inv1. However, in patients with missense mutations, this rate was found to be 2.6%. By dividing the mutations into two groups, high-risk and low-risk, we were able to show the risk of inhibitor development being significantly higher in patients with high-risk mutations.\n\n    In this study, no causative F8 gene defect could be found in 4.8% of the patients. While MLPA for large deletions/duplications could not be performed in the mutation-negative patients, amplification failures in one or more exonic regions in 10 HA patients were found, indicative of large intragenic deletions. Despite large duplications being rare molecular defects causing HA, we considered that the mutation detection rate would increase slightly following an evaluation of mutation-negative patients using MLPA. However, this is by no means a guarantee of 100% mutation identification. Several factors can lead to this situation. First, some complex gene rearrangements and intronic mutations cannot be detected using the standard molecular tests currently available. Second, type 2 von Willebrand disease and the combined deficiency of FVIII and FV can also decrease the FVIII activity level, leading to a misdiagnosis of HA. These alternatives should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases being F8 gene mutation-negative but having low levels of FVIII activity. Although the source of factor concentration (plasma or recombinant) is considered to be an important factor of inhibitor development in patients with HA, the type of factor concentrate was not reviewed and is considered outside of the scope of this study.\n\n    In this study, we present a large cohort of Turkish HA patients and their mutation spectrum. Our molecular analysis pipeline included intron 22 and 1 inversion analysis and DNA sequencing of all exonic regions of the F8 gene. MLPA is a standard test used for the detection of large deletions in the F8 gene, but unfortunately we could not perform MLPA as a part of our protocol. As an X-linked disorder, in HA, hemizygous deletions in one or more exonic regions of the F8 gene can be determined by evaluating amplification failure in PCR and showing it in next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, NGS analysis needs to be standardized for confirmation and carrier detection.",

        "Title": "    Complex Modes of Inheritance in Hereditary Red Blood Cell Disorders: A Case Series Study of 155 Patients",
        "Abstract": "    Hereditary erythrocytes disorders include a large group of conditions with heterogeneous molecular bases and phenotypes. We analyzed here a case series of 155 consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of hereditary erythrocyte defects referred to the Medical Genetics Unit from 2018 to 2020. All of the cases followed a diagnostic workflow based on a targeted next-generation sequencing panel of 86 genes causative of hereditary red blood cell defects. We obtained an overall diagnostic yield of 84% of the tested patients. Monogenic inheritance was seen for 69% (107/155), and multi-locus inheritance for 15% (23/155). PIEZO1 and SPTA1 were the most mutated loci. Accordingly, 16/23 patients with multi-locus inheritance showed dual molecular diagnosis of dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis/xerocytosis and hereditary spherocytosis. These dual inheritance cases were fully characterized and were clinically indistinguishable from patients with hereditary spherocytosis. Additionally, their ektacytometry curves highlighted alterations of dual inheritance patients compared to both dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary spherocytosis. Our findings expand the genotypic spectrum of red blood cell disorders and indicate that multi-locus inheritance should be considered for analysis and counseling of these patients. Of note, the genetic testing was crucial for diagnosis of patients with a complex mode of inheritance.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary anemias are a heterogeneous group of conditions that are characterized by complex genotype-phenotype correlations. Based on clinical manifestations and morphological red blood cell (RBC) alterations, hereditary anemias can be broadly classified into four different subtypes: (i) disorders of hemoglobin synthesis, such as thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies; (ii) hypo-regenerative anemias, such as congenital dyserythropoietic anemias; (iii) aregenerative anemias, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia (iv) RBC membrane defects that are due to either alterations to the structural organization of the membranes, such as hereditary spherocytosis (HS), hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), and hereditary elliptocytosis, or to alterations to membrane transport functions, such as hereditary stomatocytosis; and (v) nonspherocytic hemolytic anemias, due to RBC enzyme defects.\n\n    The conventional workflow for diagnosis of hereditary anemias starts with the first line of investigation of evaluation of familial history, with complete blood counts and peripheral blood smears. Then, specialized biochemical tests are required. Finally, genetic testing serves as the confirmatory test. Currently, genetic testing is used early in the diagnostic workflow of hereditary anemias, which removes the need for some of the specialized tests, especially when the clinical data for the patients are not informative, or when the patient is transfusion dependent. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), as mainly the targeted NGS approach, has revolutionized the framework of the diagnosis of hereditary anemias by reducing both time and cost. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to diagnose many hereditary anemia phenotypes according to phenotypic features and conventional diagnostic testing. In general clinical genetics setting, the diagnostic yield ranges from 38% to 87% of patients, depending on how many and which genes are included, and on the depth of the phenotypic assessment required. A drawback of NGS-based genetic testing remains the data analysis, which includes several variants of unknown significance. Functional tests are therefore crucial to assess the pathogenicity of new variants that are detected by NGS.\n\n    One of the major advantages of the NGS approach is the identification of both polygenic conditions and modifier variants associated with causative mutations. Indeed, studies of Mendelian conditions have revealed the extent to which many rare diseases can be characterized by complex modes of inheritance, such as digenic inheritance and dual molecular diagnoses, which occur when pathogenic variations at two or more loci lead to expression of two or more Mendelian conditions.\n\n    In this study, we evaluated a large case series of 155 consecutive patients with different forms of hereditary anemias and erythrocytosis who were referred to the Medical Genetics Unit ('Federico II' University Hospital, Naples, Italy) for NGS-based genetic testing, from January 2018 to September 2020. Among the diagnosed patients, 15% showed multi-locus inheritance, which mainly involved PIEZO1 and SPTA1 variants.",
        "Methods": "    In total, 155 patients with clinical suspicion of different types of hereditary anemia were included in this study. Their diagnoses were based on history, clinical findings, and laboratory data. For HS/hereditary stomatocytosis patients, the diagnosis was also based on ektacytometry.\n\n    The local University Ethical Committee approved the collection of the patient data (DAIMedLab, 'Federico II' University of Naples; N  252/18). DNA samples were obtained from the patients after they had signed their informed consent, and according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Whenever possible, affected and unaffected relatives were also enrolled to correctly assess the pathogenicity of each variant by analysis of the family segregation.\n\n    Genomic DNA preparation was performed as previously described. To evaluate the quality of the extracted genomic DNA before fragmentation, samples were quantified using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Then, the genomic DNA was run on 0.8% agarose DNA gel electrophoresis.\n\n    Genetic testing was achieved by targeted NGS using a custom 86-gene panel for hereditary RBC defects. This panel is an updated version of a similar previously published panel, and it was composed of 86 genes that are causative of congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, RBC membrane defects, hemolytic anemias due to RBC enzyme defects, anemias due to iron metabolism defects, hereditary hemochromatosis, and hereditary erythrocytosis.\n\n    For the probe design, coding regions, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, and 50-bp flanking splice junctions were selected as the regions of interest. The probe design was performed using the web-based tool SureDesign (, accessed on 2 August 2019; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The sequence length was set at 150 x 2 nucleotides. The total probe size was 298,393 kbp. Sample preparation was performed using target enrichment (SureSelectQXT) for the Illumina platform (SureSelect Custom Tier1 1-499 kb; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    High-throughput sequencing was performed using a benchtop sequencer (MiSeq; Illumina). The alignment of sequencing reads to the genomic locations, quality control metrics, and identification of variants were achieved using the Alissa Align and Call software (v1.1.2-2; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Variant annotation and analysis were performed using the Alissa Interpret software (v5.2.6; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). As previously described and according to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the pathogenicity of each variant was evaluated by gathering evidence from various sources: population data, computational and predictive data, functional data, and segregation data.\n\n    Due to the large range of prevalence in the population of these heterogeneous disorders, we selected both rare and low-frequency variants (minor allele frequency: <0.01, 0.05, respectively), as reported by the gnomAD browser ( accessed on 5 April 2021). The InterVar ( accessed on 5 April 2021) and Varsome ( accessed on 5 April 2021) web tools were used for clinical interpretation of the new variants, following the ACMG and the Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines. Automated output was adjusted using the available evidence for each patient (Table 1 and Table S1). For the functional data criteria for the new variants, we did not perform in vitro functional studies that are supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product, as needed to obtain strong evidence of pathogenicity. However, we selected and report those variants with moderate pathogenic evidence, i.e., variants located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain. Moreover, the validation of the variants was assessed by analysis of clinical data and family history, ektacytometry analysis, and peripheral blood evaluation, whenever possible.\n\n    All of the prioritized variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and by analysis of inheritance patterns, whenever possible. The validations were performed using 50 ng genomic DNA. Custom primers were designed using the Primer3 software (v. 0.4.0; freeware online). The primer sequences are available on request (roberta.russo@unina.it). Nucleotide numbering reflects cDNA numbering with +1 corresponding to the 'A' of the ATG translation initiation codon in the reference sequence, according to the nomenclature for the description of sequence variants of the Human Genome Variation Society (, accessed on 5 April 2021). The initiation codon is codon 1.\n\n    To rank the mutated genes based on their genic intolerance, we used the Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) percentile, as retrieved from the Genic Intolerance database (, accessed on 5 April 2021). The RVIS is a gene-based score that is designed to rank genes in terms of whether they have more or less common functional genetic variation relative to the genome-wide expectation, given the amount of apparently neutral variation the gene has. A gene with a positive score has more common functional variation, and a gene with a negative score has less, and is referred to as 'intolerant'.\n\n    Quantitative data were compared using Mann-Whitney tests. Multiple comparisons were performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, with post-hoc correction using Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Qualitative data were compared using chi-squared tests. A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    Among the 155 patients originally suspected of red blood cell defects, final diagnoses were reached for 130/155 (84%). Overall, 69% (107/155) showed monogenic inheritance, and 15% (23/155) showed multi-locus inheritance (Figure 1A). The genetic features of the patients with multi-locus inheritance patterns are summarized in Table 2. The complete clinical features were available for only 20/23 patients within this subset (Table S2).\n\n    Among the patients with multi-locus molecular diagnosis, 18/23 (78%) showed variants of the PIEZO1 gene, and 7/23 (30%) showed SPTA1 variants. In agreement with this, PIEZO1 and SPTA1 were the most mutated loci among the other causative genes identified in this case series (Figure 1B). Of note, the high frequencies of mutations in both of these genes were mainly related to their low genic intolerance, as suggested by the high values of the RVIS percentiles for both genes (Figure 1B). Accordingly, most of the variants in PIEZO1 and SPTA1 genes were originally predicted as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or likely benign (Table 1). Interestingly, the reevaluation of PIEZO1 and SPTA1 pathogenic variants by ACMG rules demonstrated that 26/35 (74%) and 17/35 (48.6%) PIEZO1 variants were predicted as VUS by InterVar and Varsome tools, respectively. Similarly, SPTA1 pathogenic variants were predicted as VUS in a range from 43.8% (Varsome) to 93.8% (InterVar) (Figure S1). Accordingly, whenever possible, automated outputs were adjusted and explained using the available evidence for each patient (Table 1 and Table S1).\n\n    In total, 16 of the 23 patients with multi-locus diagnosis (70%) showed dual molecular diagnosis of hereditary stomatocytosis, most of which were affected by dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis type 1 (DHS1), and hereditary spherocytosis mainly due to biallelic SPTA1 variants (Table 2). Here, we named this combination as \"dual inheritance\". The family segregation of the variants identified in some of the patients with multi-locus inheritance is summarized in Figure S2.\n\n    To investigate the multi-locus contributions to the hematological phenotype in these dual inheritance patients (only those patients with dual inheritance of DHS and HS (n = 16) with code P1, P3-P9, P11-P15, P18_P20, indicated in bold in Table 2), some RBC indices were compared with those with DHS1 (n = 37, patients with clinical and molecular diagnosis described in) and HS (n = 21, patients with clinical and molecular diagnosis included in the 155 ones here described): hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], and ferritin:age ratio (Figure 2A and Table 3). Overall, there were no differences in these RBC indices between dual inheritance and HS, while significant differences were seen for dual inheritance versus DHS1 (Figure 2A and Table 3). Indeed, dual inheritance patients showed lower Hb, MCV, and MCH compared to DHS1 patients. As expected, MCV and MCH were higher in DHS1 patients than HS patients (Figure 2A and Table 3). Interestingly, DHS1 patients showed significantly higher ferritin:age ratio compared to both dual inheritance and HS patients (Figure 2A and Table 3).\n\n    To investigate the multi-locus contributions to the hydration and deformability of RBCs of some representative dual inheritance patients (n = 11), the ektacytometry curves were analyzed in comparison with DHS1 (n = 18, patients with clinical and molecular diagnosis described in) and HS (n = 116, on the basis of the recently published study). Some of these Osmoscan profiles for the dual inheritance patients are reported in Figure S3. Three Osmoscan parameters were evaluated across the three subgroups of patients: (i) the minimum osmolality of 'O min', as the osmolality at which the deformability reaches a minimum, which represents 50% of RBC hemolysis in conventional osmotic fragility assays, and reflects the mean cell surface:volume ratio; (ii) the maximum elongation index as 'EI max', which corresponds to the maximal deformability or elongation obtained near the isotonic osmolality, and is an expression of the membrane surface; and (iii) the hypertonic osmolality as 'O hyper', which represents the osmolality in the hypertonic region that corresponds to 50% of the EI max, and which reflects the mean cell hydration status. Overall, there were no significant differences in 'Omin' and 'EI max' between dual inheritance and DHS1 (Figure 2B). Indeed, these analyses demonstrated lower O min and O hyper for dual inheritance compared to HS, while EI max was significantly higher in dual inheritance compared to HS (Figure 2B). The parameter 'O hyper' was decreased in dual inheritance compared to both DHS1 and HS demonstrating a substantial dehydration status of RBCs (Figure 2B).",
        "Conclusion": "    In this study, we evaluated a large case series of 155 consecutive patients with different forms of RBC defects who were referred to the Medical Genetics Unit ('Federico II' University Hospital, Naples, Italy) for NGS-based genetic testing, from January 2018 to September 2020. Among the diagnosed patients, 15% showed multi-locus inheritance, which mainly involved PIEZO1 and SPTA1 variants. The data from the present study demonstrate that the first and second line of investigations included in the conventional workflow for diagnosis of hereditary anemias can fail to provide differential diagnoses for patients with multi-locus inheritance. Indeed, we have shown that the clinical parameters, such as the RBC indices and the iron status, are not informative for any differential diagnosis of dual inherited conditions. Moreover, the Osmoscan profile did not provide easy discrimination between these multi-locus and monogenic RBC defects.\n\n    Of note, our study further highlighted the importance to reevaluate the pathogenicity of the identified genetic variants in light of the new data presented in the literature and of the follow-up of the clinical case. For PIEZO1 and SPTA1 genes, we demonstrated that the ACMG rules often failed to assess the pathogenicity of the identified variants. For this reason, the introduction of functional tests is useful to define the pathogenicity of VUS and to establish a correct genotype-phenotype relationship.\n\n    Genetic testing is already a routine part of the diagnostic workflow for patients with RBC defects, and is indeed widespread in clinical practice. Additionally, genetic testing is used more early in the diagnostic workflow of hereditary anemias. These data further demonstrate the crucial role for NGS-based genetic testing for diagnosis of such RBC defects, and also for the identification of multi-locus inheritance. Correct genetic diagnosis has become important also to guide treatment and personalized clinical management of these patients. For example, for patients with multi-locus inheritance caused by DHS1 and HS, it is crucial to avoid splenectomy, which is beneficial for patients with HS but contraindicated for DHS1.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    Multi-locus inheritance defines a genetic disease that arises from mutations to more than one gene. Such multi-locus cases can be caused by (i) biallelic or triallelic mutations in two distinct genes, in cis or trans; (ii) co-inheritance of pathogenic variants responsible for two or more distinct disease entities, which can lead to a mixed phenotype; or (iii) pseudo-multi-locus inheritance due to monogenic Mendelian conditions, with a broad spectrum of phenotypes due to co-inheritance of genetic modifiers. It is now clear that many Mendelian conditions can be characterized by complex modes of inheritance. In this context, NGS-based genetic testing has revolutionized the diagnosis of genetic diseases by identification of multi-locus inheritance for several diseases, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, polycystic kidney disease, and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\n    In the present study, we examined multi-locus inheritance in patients with RBC defects. A case series of 155 consecutive patients were examined who were referred in the Medical Genetics Unit ('Federico II' University Hospital, Naples, Italy) from January 2018 to September 2020. The genetic analysis was conducted using a third version of a custom targeted NGS panel that included 86 causative genes of hereditary RBC defects. We obtained an overall diagnostic yield of 84% of the patients, thus improving the diagnostic yield previously reached by the first (34 genes) and second (71 genes) versions of these NGS panels targeted for RBC defects (65%). This is in agreement with diagnostic rates reported in the literature. Indeed, the custom panels for hereditary anemias that are available include variable numbers of genes (e.g., 50-200) with diagnostic rates reported from 38% to 87%, which depend on how many and which genes are included, and on the depth of the phenotypic assessment required. Our diagnostic workflow provides the use of whole exome sequencing in the negative cases to find new causative genes of RBC defects, or of CGH-array to find possible deletion/duplication.\n\n    In the present cohort of patients, 69% showed monogenic inheritance and 15% multi-locus inheritance, as mainly a dual molecular diagnosis. These data are in agreement with the literature. Indeed, dual molecular diagnoses have been reported to account for at least 4% of diagnosed cases, with higher rates seen for case series of selected phenotypes (12%) and for cases with apparent phenotypic expansion (32%).\n\n    Here, most of these dual inheritance cases were due to co-inheritance of pathogenic variants of the PIEZO1 and SPTA1 genes, which are responsible for two distinct diseases: DHS1 and HS. Accordingly, these genes were the most frequently mutated loci among the causative genes identified in the present case series. PIEZO1 and SPTA1 are two large and highly polymorphic genes that show reduced genetic constraints. Of note, our data suggested that ACMG classification fails to assess the pathogenicity of genetic variants in both genes. Indeed, although the ACMG guidelines were intended to be used universally for all Mendelian disorders, certain criteria require gene- or disease-specific knowledge for an accurate variant interpretation. The mutated genes identified here were classified based on their genic intolerance, using RVIS percentile scores. According to their low intolerance to variation, the PIEZO1 and SPTA1 genes showed the highest RVIS values. Indeed, the more intolerant to variation a gene is, the less likely it is to be mutated. Interestingly, among the causative genes described here, PKLR and SEC23B also showed high frequencies of mutations, and accordingly, they showed intermediate RVIS percentiles. This might explain the high prevalence of patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia II among those with congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, as well as the increased number of patients diagnosed with pyruvate kinase deficiency in recent years.\n\n    The multi-locus inheritance led to a mixed phenotype that was more similar to HS than DHS1, in terms of the RBC indices of Hb, MCV, and MCH. Interestingly, as assessed by the ferritin:age ratio, the iron balance of these dual inheritance cases was also more similar to HS than DHS1. Therefore, in terms of the Hb levels, the clinical phenotype was more severe for these dual inheritance patients compared to DHS1. In contrast, for MCV, MCH, and the ferritin:age ratio, the phenotype of the multi-locus cases was milder compared to DHS1.\n\n    Within the present case series, there were seven severe cases who were transfusion dependent (patients P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P10, P20). Of note, four of these seven transfusion-dependent patients showed dual inheritance of DHS1/HS. The hemolytic indices for bilirubin and LDH did not differ in the multi-locus patients compared to those who were monogenic. However, most of the multi-locus patients had splenomegaly, and four of them had undergone splenectomy.\n\n    Here, we also identified a rare case of a syndrome characterized by hydrops, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia, which was due to a homozygous variant in the LARS2 gene. This patient (P8) was a 3-year-old Swedish female who showed multi-locus inheritance of variants in the ABCB6, KCNN4, and LARS2 genes. Indeed, she had microcytic anemia with fetal ascites that required two intrauterine transfusions. She also showed impairment of psychomotor development and bilateral deafness.\n\n    We further characterized the deformability and hydration status of RBCs from the patients with dual inheritance by ektacytometry analysis. Here, the co-inheritance of DHS1 and HS resulted in peculiar bell-shaped ektacytometry curves that were left shifted, as for the patients with DHS1. Indeed, comparisons of the 'O hyper' parameter (which reflects the hydration status) among these dual inheritances, DHS1, and HS patients highlighted lower values for dual inheritance compared to both DHS1 and HS. Overall, comparisons of these ektacytometry curves for dual inheritance with those of DHS1 and HS highlighted the dehydrated conditions of the RBCs, as seen for DHS1. The 'O min' value, which reflects the mean cell surface:volume ratio, was more similar to DHS1. Finally, the 'EI max' (as an expression of the cell membrane surface) was higher for the multi-locus cases compared to both DHS1 and HS.",

        "Title": "    Structural and mechanistic insights into the precise product synthesis by a bifunctional miltiradiene synthase",
        "Abstract": "    Selaginella moellendorffii miltiradiene synthase (SmMDS) is a unique bifunctional diterpene synthase (diTPS) that catalyses the successive cyclization of (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via (+)-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) to miltiradiene, which is a crucial precursor of important medicinal compounds, such as triptolide, ecabet sodium and carnosol. Miltiradiene synthetic processes have been studied in monofunctional diTPSs, while the precise mechanism by which active site amino acids determine product simplicity and the experimental evidence for reaction intermediates remain elusive. In addition, how bifunctional diTPSs work compared to monofunctional enzymes is attractive for detailed research. Here, by mutagenesis studies of SmMDS, we confirmed that pimar-15-en-8-yl+ is an intermediate in miltiradiene synthesis. Moreover, we determined the apo-state and the GGPP-bound state crystal structures of SmMDS. By structure analysis and mutagenesis experiments, possible contributions of key residues both in class I and II active sites were suggested. Based on the structural and functional analyses, we confirmed the copal-15-yl+ intermediate and unveiled more details of the catalysis process in the SmMDS class I active site. Moreover, the structural and experimental results suggest an internal channel for (+)-CPP produced in the class II active site moving towards the class I active site. Our research is a good example for intermediate identification of diTPSs and provides new insights into the product specificity determinants and intermediate transport, which should greatly facilitate the precise controlled synthesis of various diterpenes.\n\n    Based on the structures of SmMDS and the results of mutagenesis experiment, we find a channel between the two active sites, identify the intermediate pimar-15-en-8-yl+ and propose the cyclization mechanism of (+)-CPP to miltiradiene.",
        "Introduction": "    Diterpenes constitute a large family of natural products. According to backbone structure, diterpenes can be categorized as abietanes, pimaranes, kaurenes, labdanes and fusicoccanes (Hanson et al., ). Diterpenes are diverse in structure and stereochemistry, especially abietane-type diterpenes, thereby providing abundant sources for drug discovery. Triptolide and its analogues exhibit anticancer activity in multiple cancers, including pancreatic cancer (Ding et al., ), breast cancer (He et al., ) and glioma (Liu et al., ). The anti-ulcer agent ecabet sodium is a dehydroabietic acid derivative prepared from pine resin. Carnosol, an abietane-type diterpene, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities (Johnson, ; Shi et al., ; Figure 1a). Due to its high medical value, different approaches to synthesize abietane-type diterpenes have been explored. When focusing on the chemical synthesis or the enzymatic reaction of therapeutic natural products, we face an interesting question regarding the mechanisms by which the synthetic process selects a particular isomer of a complex molecule (Hong and Tantillo, ). Considering that the cyclization reactions catalysed by diterpene synthases (diTPSs) show high substrate selectivity and product stereospecificity, diTPSs have become a good target system for structural and functional studies to answer this question.\n\n    The diversity of diterpenes derived from the (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) precursor is determined by stereochemically controlled class II and class I diTPS combinations (Andersen-Ranberg et al., ; Christianson, ). The enzymatic synthesis of miltiradiene, the key backbone precursor of abietane-type diterpenes, has attracted considerable attentions. Usually, miltiradiene is synthesized through a two-step cyclization reaction that includes sequential conversion of GGPP via (+)-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) to miltiradiene (Gao et al., ). Recently, monofunctional class II diTPS and class I diTPS for biosynthetic miltiradiene have been isolated from seven angiosperm plants (Bozic et al., ; Bruckner et al., ; Cui et al., ; Gao et al., ; Jin and Cui, ; Pateraki et al., ; Su et al., ; Zerbe et al., ). In one case, however, a bifunctional diTPS with two independent active sites (class II/class I) was discovered in Selaginella moellendorffii (S. moellendorffii miltiradiene synthase, SmMDS; Sugai et al., ). Previously, we applied modular pathway and chimeric diTPS engineering attempts for the high production of miltiradiene in yeast (Hu et al., ; Zhou et al., ). However, few reports on the structural mechanism of diTPSs can provide structural basis for directed enzyme evolution.\n\n    To date, the crystal structure of only three plant diTPSs has been reported, namely monofunctional taxadiene synthase from Taxus brevifolia (TbTS; Koksal et al., ), monofunctional ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCPS; Koksal et al., ) and bifunctional abietadiene synthase from Abies grandis (AgAS; Zhou et al., ). Compared to abietadiene, levopimaradiene and neoabietadiene (multiple conjugated double-bond products of AgAS), miltiradiene contains the specific cyclohexa-1,4-diene structure of the distal ring (Gao et al., ). The apo-state structure of AgAS from gymnosperms has been determined and provides the inferred structure-function relationships underlying mixture abietadienes (Zhou et al., ). The bifunctional diTPS AgAS produces multiple abietane-type products, but SmMDS strictly converts GGPP to dominant miltiradiene with characteristic double bonds (>95% of total products; Martin et al., ; Vogel et al., ). Thus, we focused on the structure-function catalytic mechanisms to produce diverse abietane backbones and the precise control over carbocation intermediates in the reaction.\n\n    Here, through sequence alignment of SmMDS and other class II and class I diTPSs, by site-directed mutagenesis, we identified E690 mutagenesis leads to multiproduct sandaracopimaradiene and miltiradiene. We further determined the apo-state and GGPP-bound state crystal structures of SmMDS, providing the possible catalytic structural mechanism of the bifunctional active pockets and the transportation of (+)-CPP. Our findings are a good example of the intermediate product transport mode in a bifunctional diTPS and the mechanisms by which SmMDS control the fate of carbocations to generate a single product.",
        "Methods": "    All the E. coli strains and plasmids are listed in Table S2. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA).\n\n    The YJ28 strain was used to obtain the compound miltiradiene and abietatriene. Single colonies were grown in 50 mL of YPD liquid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) in a 250 mL shake flask at 30  C and 230 rpm for 48 h (Zhou et al., ). The entire culture volume was transferred into 500 mL of fresh seed medium and incubated for 24 h and then transferred into 2 L of fresh seed medium and incubated for another 24 h. The seed medium was used to inoculate 8 L of fermentation medium in a New Brunswick BioFlo/CelliGen 115 bioreactor (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with a maximal working volume of 14 L. Fermentation was performed at 30  C. During fermentation, the pH was maintained at 4.0 with the automatic addition of ammonium hydroxide, the agitation rate was kept at 250 rpm, and the dissolved oxygen was kept above 40%. Concentrated glucose solution (40%, wt/vol) was fed periodically to keep the glucose concentration above 1.0 g/L. Additional YPD medium was fed after the initial 30 h of fermentation. The culture was then harvested by extraction after 96 h of total fermentation time.\n\n    Yeast cell suspensions were concentrated at 1 L, lysed using a nano homogenizer machine (AH-1500; ATS Engineering Limited, Brampton, ON, Canada) and extracted 10 times using an equal volume of hexane. Organic fractions were pooled and dried using a nitrogen evaporator (Baojingkeji, Henan, China) and then dissolved in 10 mL of methanol before purification using preparative liquid chromatography. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation was performed using a SHIMADZU LC-20AR (Kyoto, Japan) with a YMC HPLC column (YMC-Pack ODS-A, 250 x 20 mmL.D., S-5 mum, 12 nm). The mobile phase, consisting of a mixture of water (A) and methanol (B), was pumped at a flow rate of 8 mL/min. The injection volume was 500 muL. The gradient elution was 100% B from 0 to 50 min.\n\n    The coding sequence of the miltiradiene synthase gene from S. moellendorffii was optimized for expression in E. coli. The full and truncated fragments were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pET-24a plasmid using the XhoI and NdeI restriction sites. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21-(DE3) competent cells (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The bacteria were grown at 37  C to an optimal density at 600 nm (OD  600 ) of 0.8-1.0 and cooled to 16  C. After adding 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-d-galactopyranoside, the induction continued by shaking for 16-20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole. Bacteria were disrupted using an automatic cryogenic crusher and separated by centrifugation. Protein supernatant was loaded to a pre-equilibrated Ni-affinity chromatography column. The SmMDS protein with a His tag at the C-terminus was washed with lysis buffer containing 50, 100 and 300 mm imidazole. Selected fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The concentrated protein was applied to a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, USA) with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and buffer B containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Finally, the protein was purified using Superdex 200 HR 10/300 gel filtration (GE Healthcare) with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The full-length diTPS from Pinus contorta that catalyses (+)-CPP to isopimaradiene and sandaracopimaradiene (PcmISO1) and a diTPS from P. contorta that catalyses (+)-CPP to pimaradiene (PcmPIM1) with a His tag at N-terminus were purified by a Ni-affinity chromatography column.\n\n    The SmMDS protein was concentrated at 8 mg/mL (with 2 mm miltiradiene) for crystal screening. SmMDS crystals were grown at 16  C by the hanging drop method using 1 muL of protein, 0.8 muL reservoir buffer and 0.2 muL of crystal seeds. The reservoir contains 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5) and 22% (v/v) poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (PEG 2000 MME). To obtain crystals of the SmMDS-GGPP complex, 0.2 muL of 20 mm GGPP was added to the hanging drop to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the crystals were soaked for different times. Finally, crystals were dehydrated using reservoir solution containing 10% glycerol (v/v) before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen for data collection.\n\n    X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamlines BL18U and BL19U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). SmMDS and SmMDS4h diffraction data were processed with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, ).\n\n    The crystal belonged to the space group P212121, and the phase was determined by the molecular replacement (MR) method using the AgAS structure (PDB ID: 3S9V). Electron density maps were calculated by PHENIX (Adams et al., ). Model building was performed using Coot (Emsley et al., ) and refined with PHENIX. The structures of CPP, copalol and sandaracopimaradiene were downloaded from the PubChem website, and the .cif files were generated using PHENIX. The final structure was analysed by PHENIX. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table S1.\n\n    Mutants were constructed by PCR using an overlap extension strategy with pET-24a-truncated SmMDS (90-867) as a template. Following PCR, DpnI was used to digest the wild-type template. The digested product was then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha chemically competent cells. The mutants were verified by sequencing.\n\n    In vitro enzyme activity assays were performed in a 100 muL reaction system containing 50 mug of purified enzymes and 2.5 mug of GGPP (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) for 2 h at 16  C, except for assays with the E690A, T608, S717A and Y837G mutants, which required more substrates and extended incubation times to detect products (10 mug of GGPP for 24 h). The reaction mixture was then extracted three times with a threefold volume of n-hexanes, followed by GC-MS analysis, which was carried out on a DB-5MS column (15 m x 0.25 mm x 0.10 mum film thickness) using helium as a carrier gas. The initial oven temperature was set at 50  C for 2 min followed by a 40  C/min gradient to 170  C, and 20  C/min gradient to 240  C, 40  C/min gradient to 300  C and held at 300  C for 1 min.\n\n    The product of the first active site remains as diphosphate, so calf intestinal (CIP) alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was used to hydrolyse phosphate. The dephosphorylation product copalol was also determined using GC-MS analysis. After verification of the product, miltiradiene and copalol were quantified by GC-MS analysis. Miltiradiene was extracted and prepared from the fermentation product of strain YJ28. We also obtained abietatriene, the spontaneously oxidized product of miltiradiene.\n\n    PcmISO1 (NCBI accession numbers: JQ240314), a diTPS from P. contorta, catalyses (+)-CPP to isopimaradiene and sandaracopimaradiene. PcmPIM1 (NCBI accession numbers: JQ240316), a diterpene synthase from Pinus contorta, catalyses (+)-CPP to pimaradiene (Hall et al., ). The sequences of PcmISO1 and PcmPIM1were synthesized by Shanghai Generay Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. Since the D611A mutant generates (+)-CPP when co-incubated with GGPP, the catalytic products of the PcmISO1 and D611A mixture when co-incubated with GGPP are isopimaradiene and sandaracopimaradiene. Pimaradiene is the product of the PcmPIM1 and D611A mixture with GGPP as the substrate.",
        "Results": "    Bifunctional SmMDS catalyses protonation-initiated cyclization of GGPP to (+)-CPP and converts (+)-CPP to miltiradiene based on ionization-initiated cyclization (Figure 1a; Sugai et al., ). SmMDS showed high homology with AgAS (identity = 38.36%), isopimaradiene synthase from Picea abies (PaISO, identity = 38.67%) and the levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase from Picea abies (PaLAS, identity = 37.84%; Keeling et al., ). All of these enzymes are bifunctional class II/class I diTPSs that share the same intermediate (+)-CPP. AgAS and PaLAS convert (+)-CPP to multiple products that have the same abietane-type skeleton as miltiradiene, while PaISO produces the single pimarane-type product isopimaradiene. We focused on the relationship between amino acid specificity and product complexity and analysed the sequence alignment to delineate the amino acid differences in the second active site that determine product diversity. Three crucial residues, namely E690, S717 and H721, which are unique in SmMDS and PaISO, are most likely to modulate product diversity. Compared to key residues in multiproduct diTPSs, E690, S717 and H721 were special in SmMDS, while these positions were occupied by tyrosine, alanine and valine in AgAS and PaLAS (Figure 1b).\n\n    The enzyme activity of the E690Y mutant decreased significantly. After extending the reaction time and adding more substrates, the E690Y mutant produced no detectable products. Previous research reported that the PaISO:H694Y mutation resulted in a slight amount of the products sandaracopimaradiene and isopimaradiene (Keeling et al., ). We hypothesized that the outcome alteration was derived from the replacement of carboxyl groups with hydroxyl groups in the side chain, whereas the enzyme inactivity of SmMDS:E690Y may be caused by too long side chain. Then, we constructed a slightly shorter hydroxylated side chain mutant, E690S, and found that it exhibited partial enzyme activity. Moreover, E690S can also convert GGPP to a new product, sandaracopimaradiene, which was identified by comparing the mass spectra of GC-MS results with previously characterized enzyme products (Hall et al., ; Figures 2a and S1).\n\n    To investigate different amino acid substitution effects on E690, we further performed saturation mutagenesis experiments (Figure 2b). E690Q, which has similar side chain length with WT, had the highest enzyme activity in all of the mutants. E690 mutants that have hydrophobic side chain, namely E690I, E690L, E690V and E690M, all had lower enzyme activity, or no enzyme activity (E690A). E690T, E690C and E690N, which have similar polar neutral side chains to E690S, produced sandaracopimaradiene and miltiradiene. Besides, E690G and E690H were also multiproduct mutants that produce sandaracopimaradiene and miltiradiene. Other too long or special side chain substitutions, that were E690W, E690R, E690F, E690K and E690P, all had no detectable products. Surprisingly, similar property but shorter side chain substitution, E690D, totally abolished its enzyme activity. These results highlighted the importance of residue E690 and also shed light on the rational enzyme design focusing on amino acid property and length.\n\n    AgAS:A723S leads to pimaradiene production, while both PaLAS:A713S and PaISO:S721A result in isopimaradiene and sandaracopimaradiene (Wilderman and Peters, ). The enzyme activity of SmMDS:S717A was almost the same as that of SmMDS and produce only miltiradiene, as well as that of SmMDS:S717G (Figure 2b). Single mutant SmMDS:S721V totally abolished its enzyme activity (Figure 2b). The catalytic activity of the double mutant SmMDS:S717A/H721V was reduced. After extending the reaction time and adding more substrates, S717A/H721V catalysed GGPP to form a series of small products with a molecular ion peak at m/z 272 (Figure S2).\n\n    The SmMDS:E690S and similar polar neutral side chain amino acid substitutions indicate that SmMDS catalysed (+)-CPP to generate the pimar-15-en-8-yl+ intermediate, and deprotonation of the carbocation resulted in sandaracopimaradiene (Figure 2c). E690 determines the abietane-type transformation of miltiradiene. The single mutation effect of S717 did not seem obvious in SmMDS, while the double mutant S717A/H721V resulted in small alterations. These results made us consider what the choreographed reaction process is and how specific amino acids participate in and affect the reaction. Meantime, we solved the crystal structure of SmMDS and attempted to reveal the mechanism of tricycle diterpene formation.\n\n    First, we solved the crystal structure of SmMDS in its apo state (Table S1). The crystal structure contains residues 94-867 and an additional LEHHHHHH tag at the C-terminus. The enzyme with the truncation of the N-terminal residues 1-93 retains catalytic activity (Figure S3) and adopts the classical alphabetagamma module of plant diTPSs (Figure 3a). We superposed the SmMDS structure with three available plant diTPS structures, which showed RMSD values for Calpha of 2.1, 1.8 and 1.6 A for monofunctional TbTS, monofunctional AtCPS and bifunctional AgAS, respectively, suggesting that they all have a similar overall architecture (Figures S4d,e,h, S5 and S6; Robert and Gouet, ).\n\n    To obtain the binding states of SmMDS, we soaked crystals of SmMDS and different mutants with the substrate GGPP and/or miltiradiene. Fortunately, we observed the density for GGPP in a WT structure named as SmMDS4h, whose crystal were soaked with GGPP for 4 h (Table S1). SmMDS and SmMDS4h structures differed in the conformation of amino acids around the two active pockets, especially in the class I active pocket (Figure S4a,b). In the SmMDS structure, alpha33 (residues 839-844) showed strong electron density, and the downstream residues 845-850 were not modelled in the structure because of weak electron density. In the SmMDS4h structure, the density of residues 839-850 was not present. This region is predicted to adopt a loop conformation as the corresponding region in TbTS (Figure S4c). Deletion of residues 841-867 from SmMDS (SmMDS1-840) significantly impaired SmMDS activity, while the SmMDS1-846 truncation retained enzyme activity (Figure S3), suggesting that residues 841-846 play an important role in maintaining enzyme activity. Based on the structures, we propose that residues 840-850 form a flexible loop that may turn to the class I active site during the class I active site reaction.\n\n    The entrance of class II active site is separated into two tunnels by Thr270 (Figure 3b). We name the tunnel between residues Glu221 and Thr270 as tunnel 1, while the tunnel between Thr270 and Phe425 as tunnel 2. In the apo state, we observed a continuous rope-shaped density occupies part of the class II active site and the tunnel 2, which we assume to be a small molecule from the cell extract. While in the SmMDS4h structure, the continuous rope-shaped density becomes weaker and moved from the active cavity to tunnel 1 (Figure S7). Using Ligand_identification (Terwilliger et al., ) wizard from PHENIX, the rope-shape density was predicted to be corresponding to a nonaethylene glycol (2PE) molecule which was constructed in many crystal structures as a exogenous molecule from Escherichia coli. Thus, we temporarily construct 2PE molecule, which fits the electron density well (Figure 3c,d). Besides, substrate GGPP can be modelled in the class II active site of SmMDS4h structure perfectly, in which the pyrophosphate group has the occupancy of 0.5 (Figure 3d).\n\n    In the previously reported structure of AtCPS in complex with the GGPP analogue AG8 (Koksal et al., ), the class II active site was shown to be relatively narrow than that of SmMDS, mainly because of that loop 457-468 in the AtCPS structure is in a more compact conformation than loop 468-479 in the SmMDS structure (Figures S4g and S5). The distinct pocket sizes of AtCPS and SmMDS may correlate with the mechanism by which GGPP is catalysed to different enantiomers of ent-CPP and CPP. The substrate analogue AG8 in AtCPS is located in a limited space, and the phosphate part has dual conformations (Figure 3f). In SmMDS4h structure, the pyrophosphate is predicted flexible and the constructed part interacts with the density that 2PE is located (Figure 3d). Lys478 contributes to the only positive part in the class II active pocket and mutating Lys478 to alanine lost the enzyme activity totally (Figure 3e,h). So, we infer that the dynamic pyrophosphate of SmMDS could possibly interact with Lys478 in catalytic process.\n\n    The DXDD motif is located in the isoprene terminal part of GGPP. Mutating residues around the isoprene part of GGPP affected the enzyme activity differently (Figure 3g,h). D391A, D391G and D391N/D392G mutants abolished the entire enzyme activity. E435A mutant had partial enzyme activity. In AgAS, the tyrosine-histidine dyad is speculated as the catalytic base in which mutating histidine to alanine produced hydroxylated derivatives of CPP (Criswell et al., ; Mafu et al., ; Potter et al., ). After soaking with GGPP, a water molecule appeared between Tyr521 and His335, other than the predicted possible catalytic base dyad (Tyr273 and His335), which indicates that Tyr521 may assist the possible catalytic base dyad in SmMDS catalysing process (Figure 3g).\n\n    Compared to the class II active site in the two previously solved structures, the most significant change site is Trp381 (Figure 3g). Trp381 is not strictly conserved (Figure S5). The corresponding residue in a CPS from Salvia miltiorrhiza is serine, and serine substitution of tryptophan reduced its catalytic activity by more than 100-fold in the production of (+)-CPP (Cui et al., ). While in SmMDS, the enzyme activities of mutants W381F, W381Y, W381H, W381S and even W381A were all decreased slightly, indicating that W381 is replaceable in SmMDS (Figure 3h). We found that two positively charged residues, Lys255 and Lys474, are highly conserved among CPSs but exhibit considerably different conformations in the SmMDS structure compared to those in the AtCPS and AgAS structures (Figures 3e and S5). The two residues are located at the entrance of the class II active site, and mutating either residue affected the enzyme activity to different degrees (Figure 3e,h). On the basis of these results, we propose that in addition to the residues located in the pocket, other residues near the pocket entrance influence catalysis. Residues K255 and K474 may assist substrate entry into the class II active pocket by interacting with pyrophosphate.\n\n    The class II active site is located at the betagamma interface. Mutating residues around the pocket, such as Lys478, Asp391 and Asp392 can influence the enzyme activity. The K478A mutant almost lost its enzyme activity entirely. In addition, by analysing SmMDS structure, we found a relatively continuous channel that is close to K478 (Figure 4a). The channel is composed of a narrow part and a broad part with lengths of 17 and 22 A, respectively, with the exit at the alphabeta interface. We predict that (+)-CPP leaves the class II active pocket through this channel. To validate the internal channel, we mutated three residues within this putative channel, namely Leu437, Lys820 and Arg824. L437 is located in the narrow part of the channel, and the mutant L437R retained low activity (Figure 4b, approximately 12% activity relative to the activity of the wild-type protein). This may be because arginine has a longer side chain than leucine, and the longer side chain is able to block the channel. For K820, which is located at the channel exit, both the K820A and K820G mutants lost part of its enzyme activity (Figure 4b). R824A completely lost the catalytic activity, which perhaps led to a completely blocked channel and almost decreased the entire catalytic ability (Figure 4b).\n\n    To further investigate whether this channel is functionally important, we compared the miltiradiene-producing activity of wild-type SmMDS with that of a mixture of two mutated SmMDS proteins, D391A and D611A. As D391A and D611A possess class I and class II activity, respectively, the D391A and D611A mutant mixture can recover the whole enzyme activity if the newly produced (+)-CPP enters the class I active site via free diffusion (Figure S3). Our results showed that compared to the enzyme activity of the SmMDS, this mutant mixture exhibited significantly reduced enzyme activity (Figure 4b). Interestingly, the R824G and D611A mutant mixture restored catalytic ability of the SmMDS in the same level as the D391A and D611A mutant mixture did. Thus, we infer that after (+)-CPP leaves the channel, it may move towards the class I active site via a surface route that is currently unclear but probably lined with positively charged residues. This observation is distinct from the previously reported bifunctional AgAS, where the CPP intermediate is transferred between class II and class I active sites via free diffusion (Peters et al., ; Zhou et al., ). On the basis of these observations, we propose that the structural integration of alpha and betagamma modules endows SmMDS with a higher miltiradiene-producing efficiency, probably by means of forming an internal transportation route between the two active sites. Notably, in a previous study, a fusion of kaurene synthase-like (KSL) and CPS from Salvia miltiorrhiza significantly increased miltiradiene production in an engineered yeast strain (Zhou et al., ). Therefore, the detailed structural information of the channel of bifunctional SmMDS may provide a basis for designing and optimizing a fusion protein comprising both class I and class II diTPSs activities.\n\n    In the SmMDS4h structure, the position of alpha-helixes surrounding the class I active site appears to be tilted to active pocket, which may be caused by enzymatic reaction after soaking with GGPP (Figure S4a,b). In the SmMDS4h structure, alpha29, alpha30 and alpha31 turn to the active site, which facilitates the binding of one magnesium ion by the residues in the conserved motif of N 758DXXT 762XXXE 766 (the bold residues). The bold residues in the conserved motif D 611DXXD 615 bind another two magnesium ions, thus stabilizing the pyrophosphate group. Mutating the residues that bind magnesium ions completely abolished the enzyme activity (Figure 4c).\n\n    The diterpene cyclization reaction can be divided into a series of carbocation intermediates that are catalysed by nearby residues or water molecules. To better understand the mechanism of the class I active site reaction, we docked (+)-CPP and miltiradiene with SmMDS4h structure using AutoDockTools and AutoDock Vina software (Sanner, ; Trott and Olson, ; Figures 4d and S8). SmMDS protein were co-crystallized with miltiradiene. Interestingly, in both SmMDS and SmMDS4h structures, miltiradiene-like residual density was observed in the class I active site, and its position matched to that of the docked ring structures of (+)-CPP and miltiradiene (Figure S8), thus supporting the docking results.\n\n    Around (+)-CPP, we found E690, S717, H721, and other key residues (Figures 4d and S8). Targeted mutagenesis of these residues showed that a single residue substitution can alter the product outcome. The T608G mutant exhibited a falling of enzyme activity compared to the enzyme activity of wild-type SmMDS. After extending the reaction time and adding more substrates, T608G produced a mixture of diterpene products, namely, miltiradiene and (+)-copalol (Figures 5a,b and S9a). As the single mutation resulted in multiple products, we hypothesized that (+)-CPP was converted to a (+)-copal-15-yl+ intermediate and that water-assisted deprotonation of this carbocation resulted in the product (+)-copalol (Figure 5b).\n\n    Multiple sequence alignment of Class I diTPSs that use (+)-CPP as substrate showed that Y837 is a highly conserved residue (Figure S6). Both the Y837F and Y837G mutations decreased the enzyme activity of SmMDS (Figure 4c). After extending the reaction time and adding more substrates, Y837G produced no products, whereas Y837F generated a mixture of diterpene products with a molecular ion peak at m/z 272. The mixture of products was identified to be sandaracopimaradiene, miltiradiene and two other products (Figures 5c and S9b; namely peak4 and peak5). The yield of the compound corresponding to peak 4 was too low to prepare, so we investigated it using gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (GC-Q/TOF). The results showed that its spectrum matched that of isopimara-9(11),15-diene in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library. The compound corresponding to peak 5 was identified to be aromatic abietatriene by comparing the mass spectra with prepared abietatriene (Figure S10). Abietatriene is assumedly derived from miltiradiene spontaneously, but Y837F catalysed GGPP to produce it in small amounts. We hypothesized that the hydroxyl group of the conserved Y837 stabilized intermediate carbocations during cyclization. When phenylalanine was substituted for Y837 (Y837F), the interacting status between the protein and carbocations was destabilized, resulting in multiple diterpene products.\n\n    The functional identification of mutants reveals that copal-15-yl+ and pimar-15-en-8-yl+ are key intermediates in the class I active site, which are quenched to (+)-copalol and sandaracopimaradiene, respectively. Based on structural and mutagenesis analyses, we proposed a structural mechanism model in which key residues stabilize intermediate carbocations during the cyclization of (+)-CPP to miltiradiene (Figure 6). The model described five intermediates (1-5) in the catalytic process. At the beginning of the catalysis reaction, the class I active site utilizes a trinuclear metal cluster triggering the ionization of the isoprenoid substrate (+)-CPP, resulting in the loss of diphosphate abstraction. The ionization of (+)-CPP leads to an allyl cation that can be drawn with two mesomeric structures, namely copal-15-yl+ (intermediate 1) and intermediate 2. Then, the carbocation transfers to form the pimar-15-en-8-yl+ (the intermediate 3). Subsequently, the specific C8-C9 double bond formed at intermediate 4, with the participation of Y837, S717, H721 and E690. Moreover, based on our molecular docking results, both E690 and Y837 are located at the newly formed ring of miltiradiene and may participate in the final 1,2-methyl migration of intermediate 4 to intermediate 5.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Here, we successfully determined the apo and GGPP-bound state crystal structures of SmMDS and explored the precise control over copal-15-yl+ and pimar-15-en-8-yl+ intermediates in the presence of enzyme and further demonstrated an effective transport mode of (+)-CPP. As described for multiple sequential post-transition-state bifurcations, the inferred pimar-15-en-8-yl+ rearrangement mechanisms in the absence of enzymes have significant implications for ensuing selectivity prediction and controlling biosynthesis of complex organic reactions in general6. Early mechanistic work by Ravn et al.  demonstrated the intermediacy of pimar-15-en-8-yl+ (intermediate 3) in the cyclization of (+)-CPP to a mixture of abietadiene double-bond isomers catalysed by AgAS. From the intramolecular proton transfer perspective, later work by Wilderman and Peters  suggested that a shift from intermediate 3 to isopimar-8(14)-en-15-yl+ was needed. However, here we demonstrate that copal-15-yl+ is an intermediate derived from the cleavage of the (+)-CPP diphosphate group, while pimar-15-en-8-yl+ (intermediate 3) is the intermediate between (+)-CPP and miltiradiene. Among them, an inferred shift from the intermediate 3 to pimar-8(9)-en-15-yl+ (intermediate 4) provides an intermediate for the subsequent intramolecular proton transfer. SmMDS:T608G produced (+)-copalol as a minor component of its product output, indicating that (+)-copalol is a potential stable intermediate. Further site-directed mutagenesis of N607 and T608 around (+)-copalol suggested that a pair of charged N607 and T608 stabilizes the formation of the copal-15-yl cation intermediate. Furthermore, SmMDS:E690S and similar polar neutral side chain mutants lead to two isomeric products, sandaracopimaradiene and miltiradiene. Mutagenesis of residues E690, S717, H721 and Y837 around sandaracopimaradiene explained the catalysis mechanism of the C ring stereocentre in the pimar-15-en-8-yl+ cation intermediate. We inferred that another pair of charged S717 and H721 assists in regulating the transition state. Compared to other diTPSs with multiple products, SmMDS specifically has more charged amino acids in the class I active site, which perhaps produce a single product, miltiradiene, in such an enzymatic reaction (Figures 1 and S6).\n\n    In the field of metabolic engineering, perhaps one of the most arduous is controlling metabolic flux distributions, that is, how to make a particular biosynthesis route when other metabolic routes competitively share the same precursors. The biosynthesis of miltiradiene is an example facing this situation. Miltiradiene is an important precursor in the biosynthesis of tanshinones, triptolides and resin acids. Importantly, the characteristic cyclohexa-1,4-diene structure of the C ring in miltiradiene is rare in other abietane-related diterpenes. Through chimeric fusion proteins of class II and class I diTPSs, more metabolic flux of (+)-CPP flowed to class I diTPS, and, as a result, the production of miltiradiene was improved, reaching a highest miltiradiene titre of 3.5 g/L in a 5-L bioreactor (Hu et al., ). The modular architecture of chimeric fusion proteins is betaalpha  and  gammabetaalpha (bold is the active domain); however, we directly found an inner channel in SmMDS with an active  alphabetagamma  domain. This natural strategy makes (+)-CPP metabolic flux concentrated and quick, generating more miltiradiene. The production of miltiradiene and no other competitive products from (+)-CPP is undoubtedly significant to S. moellendorffii. The accepted hypothesis is that plant diTPSs evolved from archaea by fusion of the alpha and betagamma enzymes (Moosmann and Ecker, ). S. moellendorffii belongs to an ancient lineage, namely lycophyte, which diverged shortly after land plants evolved vascular tissues (Banks et al., ). The alphabetagamma architecture of SmMDS may support this hypothesis from the perspective of early vascular plants.\n\n    In summary, we described the X-ray crystal structures of SmMDS in apo and GGPP-bound state. They are first reported structures of a bifunctional diTPS that produces only a single product. Furthermore, we proposed a catalytic mechanism taking into account the individual contributions of key active site residues. Structural and mutagenesis analyses show that copal-15-yl+ and pimar-15-en-8-yl+ are intermediates between (+)-CPP and miltiradiene. The associated molecular docking demonstrates that several key amino acid residues, such as E690, Y837, S717 and H721, precisely control intermediates and exhibit unique enzymatic selectivity. Moreover, we observed an inner channel that assisted (+)-CPP transportation, which may prevent the competition from other enzymes using (+)-CPP as a substrate in plant. Our findings advance the structural determinants of product specificity in class I active site and the transport mode of (+)-CPP in bifunctional diTPSs, providing an effective strategy for the biosynthesis of high-value bioactive diterpenes.",

        "Title": "    Multiple FGF4 Retrocopies Recently Derived within Canids",
        "Abstract": "    Two transcribed retrocopies of the fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) gene have previously been described in the domestic dog. An FGF4 retrocopy on chr18 is associated with disproportionate dwarfism, while an FGF4 retrocopy on chr12 is associated with both disproportionate dwarfism and intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). In this study, whole-genome sequencing data were queried to identify other FGF4 retrocopies that could be contributing to phenotypic diversity in canids. Additionally, dogs with surgically confirmed IVDD were assayed for novel FGF4 retrocopies. Five additional and distinct FGF4 retrocopies were identified in canids including a copy unique to red wolves (Canis rufus). The FGF4 retrocopies identified in domestic dogs were identical to domestic dog FGF4 haplotypes, which are distinct from modern wolf FGF4 haplotypes, indicating that these retrotransposition events likely occurred after domestication. The identification of multiple, full length FGF4 retrocopies with open reading frames in canids indicates that gene retrotransposition events occur much more frequently than previously thought and provide a mechanism for continued genetic and phenotypic diversity in canids.",
        "Introduction": "    Gene retrocopies, often previously referred to as processed pseudogenes, are formed through the mRNA-mediated gene duplication of cellular gene transcripts. In mammals, this process is mediated by long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (L1) acting in trans. L1s are the only autonomous, retrotransposable elements still active today in mammals, and while over 100 active, full-length L1s have been identified in humans, dogs have more than 200 active L1s. L1 insertion is accomplished through target primed reverse transcription, a process that results in duplication of genomic DNA at the insertion site, called a target site duplication (TSD). Because gene retrocopies are formed from processed mRNA, they also lack introns and contain a polyA tail, features that distinguish them from their parental gene. Although retrocopy insertions can occur anywhere in the genome, the L1 machinery shows a preference for the TTAAAA consensus sequence as an insertion site.\n\n    Retrocopies are more likely to come from highly expressed genes, with some genes having over a dozen retrocopies. Most of the retrocopies present in any given reference genome arose millions of years ago and have since acquired numerous sequence variants differentiating them from their parent genes. While many retrocopies have also lost their open reading frame (ORF), L1 is still actively producing retrocopies with intact ORFs in mammalian genomes. Hundreds of recent, polymorphic gene retrocopies have been reported in humans and mice. Notably, polymorphic retrocopies were more common in mice than in humans, consistent with mice having more active L1s. A recent survey of retrocopies in the canfam3 reference genome has identified over 3000 retrocopies, 476 of which were intact, and several gene retrocopies have also been identified on the canine Y chromosome. However, it is still unclear how many recent, polymorphic retrocopies are in canids that are not present in the canfam3 reference genome.\n\n    Two expressed, polymorphic fibroblast growth factor 4 gene (FGF4) retrocopies have been described previously in dogs on chr18 and chr12, referred to as FGF4L1 (CFA18) and FGF4L2 (CFA12) in this study. Both FGF4L1 and FGF4L2 are associated with forms of disproportionate dwarfism that are common across many popular dog breeds, and there is evidence that these genes have been under selection owing their strong phenotypic effects. FGF4L2 has also been associated with canine chondrodystrophy, a disorder characterized by premature degeneration of the intervertebral discs, which predisposes affected dogs to intervertebral disc herniation. However, chondroid disc degeneration can also be seen in dogs without FGF4L2, indicating the possibility of alternative risk loci for the disorder.\n\n    Because two recent, functional FGF4 retrocopies had already been described in dogs, we hypothesized that more FGF4 retrocopies could be segregated across dog breeds, which may contribute to limb morphology and/or disc disease. Previous FGF4 retrocopies were identified following genome-wide associations for disproportionate dwarfism. In the current study, two approaches were utilized to identify additional FGF4 retrocopies in dogs. First, discordant read mapping of paired-end Illumina reads from publicly available whole-genome sequence data was used to identify additional polymorphic FGF4 retrocopies in canid genomes that would not be identified by common variant calling techniques. The second approach was to perform exon to exon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the presence of an intron-less retrocopy, followed by inverse PCR to identify the site of insertion. Five additional FGF4 retrocopies were then identified, sequenced, and characterized.",
        "Methods": "    Data from six BioProjects (PRJNA448733, PRJEB16012, PRJNA288568, PRJNA377155, PRJEB20635, and PRJEB32865) were utilized for this approach. This included 1125 individuals from 160 different breeds, as well as 101 indigenous dogs, 141 wolves, and 3 coyotes (Supplemental Table S1). The canine reference genome, CanFam3, does not contain any full length FGF4 retrocopies, and thus all reads coming from FGF4 retrocopies are aligned to the parental FGF4 gene locus. To identify any such novel FGF4 retrocopies, aligned paired end Illumina sequence data in the region surrounding the FGF4 gene (CanFam3 chr18:48,412,000-48,418,000) were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive and analyzed. Sequencing files were viewed in Integrative Genomics Viewer. Discordant paired end reads mapping from exon to exon (Supplemental Figure S1 shown in red) are indicative of the presence of an FGF4 gene retrocopy somewhere in the genome as retrocopies lack introns, while discordant paired end reads, wherein one mate maps to the FGF4 gene locus and the other mate maps to another region of the genome, are indicative of the putative insertion site for an FGF4 retrocopy (Supplemental Figure S1 shown in teal). The presence of both forms of discordant reads was used as an indication of an FGF4 retrocopy insertion.\n\n    Whole-genome sequence data were not available for any of the individuals treated by surgical decompression for presumed IVDD. Therefore, a molecular approach was developed to test for novel FGF4 retrocopies in DNA samples. A total of 164 surgical cases that were previously shown to have 0 copies of FGF4L1 and FGF4L2 were used for novel FGF4 retrocopy discovery. The presence of FGF4 retrocopies was tested by amplifying the region between exon 1 and exon 3 of FGF4 (Supplemental Table S2). The identification of a reduced size, intron-less product indicates the presence of an FGF4 retrocopy (Supplemental Figure S2). When an individual tested positive for an FGF4 retrocopy and negative for the two known FGF4 retrocopy insertions, inverse PCR was then performed to identify the insertion site of the FGF4 retrocopy. For inverse PCR, 1 mug of genomic DNA was digested with the MboI restriction enzyme according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and fragments were then circularized by ligation at final concentrations varying between 1 and 10 ng/muL using T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer's instructions for sticky end ligation (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). A set of inverted primers were designed that amplified circular DNA fragments containing the 5' end of the FGF4 retrocopy insertion (Supplemental Table S2). PCR was then performed using LongAmp Taq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis and isolated for Sanger sequencing using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). All PCR primers were designed using primer3 .\n\n    All canine DNA samples used for retrocopy sequencing and subsequent population genotyping of the FGF4 retrocopies came from the Bannasch Canine Repository and were obtained under UC Davis Animal Care and Use Committee protocol 18,561 (Supplemental Table S3). Red wolf tissue samples for DNA extraction were obtained with the approval of the United States Fish and Wildlife Services. PCR primers were designed to flank the insertion sites of FGF4 retrocopies identified via discordant paired end reads or inverse PCR (Supplemental Table S1). Entire retrocopy insertions were then amplified through PCR using LongAmp Taq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The full sequence of each retrocopy was obtained through Sanger sequencing using a series of internal primers (Supplemental Table S2). Variants in the parental FGF4 gene were observed in a dataset of 722 canids to determine which single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were unique to FGF4 retrocopies.\n\n    Evolutionarily conserved elements (ECR) near the FGF4 retrocopy insertion sites were defined using the 4-Way Multiz Alignment & Conservation track for CanFam2 on the UCSC genome browser, which shows a measure of evolutionary conservation between dog, human, mouse, and rat genomes using Multiz alignment.\n\n    Breeds were selected for population genotyping based on the breeds in which they were identified, excluding breeds where whole-genome sequencing data indicated they did not contain any FGF4 retrocopies. PCR assays utilizing three primers per assay were designed for each FGF4 retrocopy for population genotyping, as previously described. In each assay, a shared internal primer at the 3' end of the FGF4 retrocopy produces a different size amplicon when the retrocopy is present (Supplemental Table S1).\n\n    Height was measured in selected cases to determine if FGF4 retrocopies had any effect on height. All height measurements were performed by the same individual using a standard wicket (height measuring device for dogs). Multivariable linear regression was performed in R studio using the generalized linear model function with sex and FGF4 genotype included to identify any association with height.",
        "Results": "    In addition to the two known FGF4 retrocopies, FGF4L1 and FGF4L2, evidence for four additional FGF4 retrocopies in canids was observed in the whole-genome sequence dataset (Table 1). The novel FGF4 retrocopies include a copy on CFA27 (FGF4L3) seen in three Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers (NSDTR); a copy on CFA22 (FGF4L4) seen in two Norwich Terriers; a copy on CFA13 (FGF4L5) seen in a Belgian Malinois and a Dutch Shepherd; and a copy on CFA36 (FGF4L6) seen in two red wolves. Sequence read archive (SRA) accession numbers for these individuals are available in Supplemental Table S4.\n\n    Discordant reads were also observed at the 3' end of the FGF4 gene locus aligning to a partial FGF4 retrocopy insertion in the CanFam3 reference genome at chr7:68,372,263-68,373,442. To confirm whether this was a real FGF4 retrocopy fragment or a mistake in the reference assembly, primers were designed flanking the insertion and the region was amplified in six Boxers. Five were heterozygous for the CFA7 partial FGF4 retrocopy insertion, and Sanger sequencing confirmed the sequence matched the reference genome. Because this retrocopy only contains the 3' UTR of the gene and has no ORF, this retrocopy fragment was not considered for further analysis.\n\n    A surgically treated population of 164 individuals that had neither FGF4L1 nor FGF4L2 was then tested for the presence of any FGF4 retrocopy using an exon-exon PCR assay. Four of these individuals tested positive for the presence of an FGF4 retrocopy. These samples were first tested for the other newly discovered FGF4 retrocopies. One sample, a Shetland Sheepdog, was heterozygous for FGF4L5. The medical history of this individual indicates that it received a hemilaminectomy to treat a mass that was not disc-related.\n\n    The three remaining dogs were all Pit Bull Terrier mixes that had received hemilaminectomies for IVDD at relatively young ages (age at time of surgery of 3, 5, and 8 years), and none of the newly discovered or previously defined FGF4 retrocopies were present in these individuals, indicating they contained a novel FGF4 retrocopy. Inverse PCR was then performed to discover the insertion site of the novel FGF4 retrocopies in these individuals, which was on CFA13 (FGF4L7) at approximately CFA13:25,020,600. The three dogs were all heterozygous for FGF4L7, and Sanger sequencing revealed that FGF4L7 is a full length FGF4 retrocopy.\n\n    Novel FGF4 retrocopies were confirmed through PCR amplification and sequencing. The genomic location for the FGF4 retrocopies, their TSD, and genomic sequence surrounding the TSD are shown in Table 1. Exact TSD length varied from 11 to 17 bases, with a median of 15 bp. The loosely conserved L1 consensus insertion site sequence (TTAAAA) was only observed at the FGF4L5 insertion site. Insertion sites for 6/7 of the FGF4 retrocopies had a low G/C content compared with the Canfam3 average of 41.3% (Table 1). All FGF4 retrocopies inserted into intergenic regions of the genome. Both FGF4L1 and FGF4L3 inserted into a LINE element, while FGF4L4 inserted into a long terminal repeat (LTR). The number of evolutionarily conserved regions within 2.5 kb of the insertion sites is also reported in Table 1.\n\n    Comparison of each FGF4 retrocopy to the parental FGF4 sequence showed that each novel copy has a fully conserved ORF (Figure 1). The 5' UTR of FGF4L3 is truncated by 112 bp compared with the other retrocopies, and the 3' UTR in both FGF4L1 and FGF4L4 is truncated by 530 bp and 83 bp. No single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified in either the ORF or the 5' UTR of any of the retrocopies. However, six SNVs were identified in the 3' UTR that differed from the reference genome FGF4 gene sequence. Analysis of a whole-genome sequencing variant calling dataset from 722 canids indicated that these SNVs are also present at the parental FGF4 gene (Supplemental Table S5). Therefore, no SNV specific to any of the dog FGF4 retrocopies was identified. Rather, the differences between FGF4 retrocopies are owing to different haplotypes of the parental FGF4 gene from which the retrocopies formed. Notably, the 3' end of the parental FGF4 gene in wolves contains several SNV not identified in any domestic dogs (Supplemental Table S5).\n\n    The red wolf FGF4L6 3' UTR sequence contained two single nucleotide indels not observed in any domestic dog FGF4 sequences: a deletion (CFA18:48,415,685delA) and an insertion (CFA18:48,416,575_48,416,576insA). These indels were not identified in any canids other than the two red wolves in a whole-genome sequencing variant calling dataset, which included 46 gray wolves. The parental FGF4 locus was sequenced in seven red wolves to determine whether these variants also exist in the parental gene in red wolves or if they are unique to the retrocopy. While three individuals were heterozygous for the CFA18:48,416,575T>TA insertion at the parental FGF4 gene, CFA18:48,415,685CA C was not identified in any of the parental FGF4 sequences, indicating this variant may have occurred after retrotransposition and may be unique to FGF4L6.\n\n    A targeted population genotyping approach based on the breeds in which FGF4 retrocopies were identified was utilized to determine allele frequencies of the FGF4 retrocopies. A complete list of FGF4 retrocopy genotyping results is available in Supplemental Table S3. FGF4L3 was only observed in the NSDTR breed in the whole-genome sequencing dataset, and was thus tested in 100 randomly selected NSDTR. The allele frequency of FGF4L3 was 8.5% in the NSDTR.\n\n    FGF4L4 had an allele frequency of 16.7% in Norwich Terriers (n = 30). Further testing for FGF4L4 in related terrier breeds identified this retrocopy in Norfolk Terriers (n = 10, allele frequency 30%), Border Terriers (n = 32, allele frequency 71.9%), and Skye Terriers (n = 10, allele frequency 5%). Given the previous association of FGF4 retrogenes with skeletal dysplasia, FGF4L4 genotype was also compared to height at the withers in 24 Border Terriers using multiple linear regression. The regression analysis identified no significant association between FGF4L4 and height in Border Terriers (p = 0.877, n = 24), although only one homozygous wild type individual was included (Supplemental Figure S3).\n\n    FGF4L5 was not identified in any other Shetland Sheepdogs (n = 58) or Belgian Malinois (n = 14). Australian Shepherds (n = 19) and Anatolian Shepherd dogs (n = 5) also tested negative for FGF4L5. No additional Dutch Shepherd samples were available for population genotyping of FGF4L5 in the breed. FGF4L6 was tested in 14 red wolf samples, 5 of which were heterozygous (allele frequency 15.6%).\n\n    Pit Bull Terriers and Pit Terrier Mixes were then tested for FGF4L7 (n = 201), and all tested negative for the retrocopy. Because FGF4L7 was identified in dogs treated for IVDD and could be contributing to the disorder, all mixed breed dogs from the Bannasch Canine Repository that had been treated surgically for IVDD were also tested for FGF4L7 (n = 55), all of which tested negative. However, two discordant reads mapping to the FGF4L7 were subsequently identified in the whole-genome sequence data of a single Chinese village dog (SRR7107669). Several breeds developed in Asia were then tested for FGF4L7, including Chow Chow (n = 22), Pugs (n = 9), Pekingese (n = 8), and Tibetan terriers (n = 6), none of which tested positive. However, FGF4L7 was identified in Chinese Shar-Pei (n = 22, allele frequency 34.1%).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Multiple recently transposed FGF4 retrocopies exist in canids in addition to the previously identified FGF4L1 and FGF4L2. Novel retrocopies appear to be breed or breed group specific, contain intact ORFs, and have not accrued mutations that differentiate them from parental FGF4 gene haplotypes. The FGF4 retrocopies were retrotransposed from FGF4 genes with distinct haplotypes, indicating that the same copy has not been retrotransposed multiple times. It is unclear whether any of these novel copies are expressed retrogenes, or in what tissue types they could be expressed. FGF4L7 was identified in three dogs treated surgically for IVDD, however, the significance relative to IVDD is unknown. The majority of IVDD surgical cases examined in this study that were not explained by FGF4L2 were found to have no FGF4 retrocopies, indicating that there are risk factors other than FGF4 retrocopies that predispose dogs to IVDD.\n\n    Evidence for the expression of both FGF4L1 and FGF4L2 has indicated that the FGF4 retrocopies are capable of expression. The 5' end of the FGF4 gene is GC-rich and contains many evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites that were previously hypothesized to be conducive towards expression of the retrocopies. Thus, the 5' end truncation of the FGF4L3 retrocopy likely affects expression. It has also been reported that the expression of retrocopies is highly dependent on the genomic environment of the insertion sites. Both FGF4L1 and FGF4L2 have inserted into regions containing nearby evolutionarily conserved elements (ECRs). Similarly, ECRs at all but one of the FGF4 retrocopy insertion sites may be conducive towards expression. The different genomic context at the insertion sites for FGF4L1 and FGF4L2 could also explain the different phenotypes between the copies. If expressed, the novel FGF4 retrocopies may show unique expression profiles, resulting in phenotypic associations other than height and IVDD. FGF4 is involved in several cellular processes including cell growth, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion, and is also a well-known proto-oncogene.\n\n    Although FGF4L2 has been shown to have a major association with IVDD, clinically significant IVDD has been reported in dogs lacking the FGF4L2 retrogene, implicating alternate causative factors. Additional FGF4 retrogenes are logical candidates for these FGF4L2 negative IVDD cases, however the additional FGF4 retrocopies identified in this study do not appear to provide a compelling explanation for this group of dogs owing to the limited frequency of the retrogenes in affected animals. Although FGF4L7 was identified in three dogs treated surgically for IVDD, it was not seen in any other breeds in the surgically treated data set, and the breed with the highest identified allele frequency (Shar-Pei; 0.341) is not known to be among the breeds highly predisposed to IVDD. Similarly, clinical IVDD is uncommon in Border Terriers and Norfolk Terriers, which had the highest allele frequency of the FGF4L4 retrogene. Interestingly, FGF4L7 inserted 5 Mb downstream from the HAS2 gene, a gene that has been implicated in the Shar-Pei wrinkled skin phenotype as well as Familial Shar-Pei Fever. Strong selection in this region of the genome in Shar Peis could explain the high allele frequency of FGF4L7 in the breed.\n\n    While FGF4L4 was not found to be associated with height in Border Terriers, the majority of Border Terriers tested had either one or two copies of FGF4L4, and only one individual with 0 copies was identified. If the retrocopy has a dominant effect on height in the breed, more homozygous wild type individuals will need to be measured to determine any effect. FGF4L4 was also found at low allele frequencies in other related terrier breeds, including the Skye, Norwich, and Norfolk Terriers, and may have originated in a common progenitor to the terrier breed group. As dog breeds are known to be highly inbred, a high allele frequency alone does not indicate selection, as it could be the result of random genetic drift followed by decreasing genetic diversity, as characterizes purebred dogs. Interestingly, FGF4L1 is also very common in Norwich and Norfolk Terriers, and the Skye Terriers used in this study were homozygous for both FGF4L1 and FGF4L2, making them the first breed to be identified with three FGF4 retrocopies.\n\n    All the FGF4 retrocopies in canids appear to have been very recently retrotransposed with no new mutations differentiating them from the parental FGF4 gene. Even the red wolf FGF4 retrocopy, FGF4L6, is nearly identical to the red wolf specific FGF4 haplotype. Dating the FGF4 retrocopy insertions is difficult owing to their short length (3.2 kbp) and sequence identity to the parental gene sequence; however, the FGF4 retrocopies are identical to canine-specific FGF4 gene haplotypes, which are distinct from modern wolf FGF4 haplotypes (Supplemental Table S5). This could indicate that the dog retrocopies occurred after domestication. Recently inserted, fully intact retrocopies such as the FGF4 retrocopies are very uncommon in reference genomes. Studies have found that less than 18% of the retrocopies in the human reference have a fully intact ORF, while only 1% of retrocopies share greater than 99% of their DNA sequence with their parental gene. However, these studies have focused on analyzing reference genomes, which miss polymorphic retrocopies that are more likely to be recent, such as the FGF4 retrocopies in canids, which are not found in CanFam3. It is possible that some unique aspects of the FGF4 gene increase its rate of L1 mediated retrotransposition. A search for FGF4 through a database of all retrocopies identified in over 40 mammalian reference genomes reveals that a squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) and a hedgehog (Echinops telfairi) also have FGF4 retrocopies, although they are only 61.2% and 90.6% identical to the parental genes, indicating they are not recent, but it is unknown whether other species have polymorphic FGF4 retrocopies not found in their reference genomes. Another possibility is that L1 mediated gene retrotransposition in general is occurring more frequently in canids. If this was the case, recent, polymorphic retrocopies may be more common in canids in a greater number of genes than just FGF4.\n\n    While next generation sequencing allows for the detection of polymorphic gene retrocopies, they often go unidentified or misidentified by common variant calling methods. However, more careful analysis of discordant Illumina paired-end reads has shown they are more common than previously thought. As with FGF4L1 and FGF4L2, retrocopies of other genes may have phenotypic consequences. As such, the possibility of retrocopy insertions should be considered when scanning critical intervals for disease trait associations. Recently inserted gene retrocopies can result in overexpression of the parental gene product, resulting in gain of function, which could be deleterious. In this study, whole-genome sequence data were successfully used to identify novel, polymorphic retrocopies of the FGF4 gene; a similar approach could be generalized to all genes to identify other polymorphic gene retrocopies in canids. Similar to the FGF4 retrocopies, other polymorphic retrocopies may play an important role in both breed health and phenotypic variation across dogs.",

        "Title": "    High carrier frequency of pathogenic PATL2 gene mutations predicted in population: a bioinformatics-based approach",
        "Abstract": "    Topoisomerase II homologue 2 (PATL2) has been confirmed to be a key gene that contributes to oocyte maturation. However, the allele distribution and carrier frequency of these mutations remain uncharacterized. So a bioinformatics subcategory analysis of PATL2 mutations from outcome data and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) databases was conducted. Altogether, the causative PATL2 mutation number detected in patients with oocyte maturation defects in the clinical studies and pathogenic PATL2 mutation sites predicted by software based on the database was approximately 53. The estimated carrier frequency of pathogenic mutation sites was at least 1.14% based on the gnomAD and ExAC database, which was approximately 1/877. The highest frequency of mutations detected in the independent patients was c.223-14_223-2del13. The carrier frequency of this mutation in the population was 0.25%, which may be a potential threat to fertility. Estimated allele and carrier frequency are relatively higher than those predicted previously based on clinical ascertainment. A review of PATL2 mutation lineage identified in 34 patients showed that 53.81%, 9.22% and 14.72% of the oocytes with PATL2 mutations were arrested at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, metaphase I (MI) stage and first polar body stage, respectively. Oocytes that could develop to the first polar body stage were extremely rare to fertilise, and their ultimate fate was early embryonic arrest. Phenotypic variability is related to the function of the regions and degree of loss of function of PATL2 protein. A 3D protein structure changes predicted by online tools, AlphaFold, showed aberrations at the mutation sites, which may explain partially the function loss. When the mutated and wild-type proteins are not in the same amino acid category, the protein structure will be considerably unstable. The integration of additional mutation sites with phenotypes is helpful in drawing a complete picture of the disease. Bioinformatics analysis of PATL2 mutations will help reveal molecular epidemiological characteristics and provide an important reference for new mutation assessment, genetic counselling and drug research.",
        "Introduction": "    Infertility issues are faced by 15% of couples worldwide, and almost half are estimated to have a genetic background. At present, >200 casual genes have been identified for female infertility, and genes related to oocyte maturation defect (OOMD) such as ZP1 (OOMD1), TUBB8 (OOMD2), ZP3 (OOMD3), PATL2 (OOMD4), WEE2 (OOMD5), ZP2 (OOMD6), PANX1 (OOMD7), BTG4 (OOMD8), TRIP13 (OOMD9), REC114 (OOMD10), ASTL (OOMD11), FBXO43 (OOMD12) and TBPL2 have been discovered by high-throughput sequencing. Topoisomerase II homologue 2 (PATL2) is a major pathogenic gene that is associated with germinal vesicle (GV) arrest and oocyte cleavage defects. Since the first case of homozygous mutation of PATL2 gene in a patient who suffered from assisted reproductive technology (ART) failure because of oocytes being arrested at the GV stage was reported, subsequent genetic testing was largely carried out and obtained important results in patients with phenotypes of recurrent failure in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), empty follicle syndrome (EFS), high proportion of GV-arrested oocytes, extremely low fertilisation rate, abnormal oocyte morphology and abnormally large first polar body. However, OOMD is a rare disease, and scarce variations have been found in suspected patients; therefore, limited mutants are available for molecular epidemiological analysis. Furthermore, the phenotype caused by PATL2 gene mutation was found to be insidious among the population and even in infertile women who underwent ART. Men carrying homozygous mutants of PATL2 did not exhibit fertility issues. Therefore, conducting an epidemiological analysis based on the outcome data and analysing the mutant distribution and carrier frequency of PATL2 using a population-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database was necessary.\n\n    Previous studies have shown that PATL2 is required in oocyte maturation in model organisms. PATL2, as a translation repressor, anchors to the mRNA binding protein (mRNP) granule and is expressed in a spatio-temporal pattern. PATL2 is expressed within a short time when metaphase I-arrested oocytes (referred to as GV oocytes) resume meiosis. Oocyte maturation is characterised by GV breakdown (GVBD) and first polar body extrusion. PATL2 expression gradually decreases with development and is almost undetectable after the extrusion of the first polar body. Subsequently, the function of the translation repressor in the embryo may be compensated by other proteins. Oocytes carrying PATL2 mutants have shown a spectrum of phenotypes, including GV arrest, fertilisation difficulty or early embryo arrest. Some mutants, such as p.Ile318Thr, have displayed considerably less disruptive protein function than some other mutants, such as p.Arg262* and p.Tyr186*, which have led to the complete loss of function [reviewed by ]. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore the database for prospective analysis to provide data for further mutation-phenotype correlation studies in the future.\n\n    When a different amino acid being incorporated into the polypeptide, it may have a wide range of effects on protein function. Mutations can lead to changes in the structure of an encoded protein. Changes of protein structure can be used for prediction of pathogenicity. Actually the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of proteins is one of the biggest challenges in biology. AlphaFold is an ideal online prediction tool for protein structure changes, recently developed based on artificial intelligence. Over 1,700,000 resolved proteins were used for training. Three-dimensional shape of proteins can be accurately predicted with amino acid sequences, using deep learning algorithms combined with tension control algorithms.",
        "Methods": "    The GeneCards database (https://www.genecards.org/), NCBI Gene Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), Ensembl database (https://ensembl.org) query sequence and mutations were used for this study. In addition, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT, RRID:SCR_012813, http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/), Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD, RRID:SCR_018393, https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/), Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL, https://www.genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=revel), and MutationAssessor (RRID:SCR_005762, http://mutationassessor.org/) were used to analyse the pathogenicity. The NCBI whole genome sequencing database (gnomAD) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database were probed for allele frequency. Mutation Assess Amino acid sequences of human PATL2 protein was compared to different species in multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega (RRID:SCR_001591, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). CADD>= 10 is the cutoff value. Evolutionary conservation of the variants among the species was analysed using ConSurf server (http://consurftest.tau.ac.il). The outcome data of the PATL2 pathogenic mutants reported in the literature were re-analysed.\n\n    To predict the 3D protein structure, Protein Data Bank (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org/), SWISS-MODEL (http://www.swissmodel.expasy.org), Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 tool (Polyphen - 2, http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2) and AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.com/) were used and the results were compared.",
        "Results": "    The data on pathogenic PATL2 mutants reviewed by Sun et al. and reported in a recent study were reanalysed. A total of 34 patients with OOMD were included. The reported average age of women was 31.41 +- 4.34, with an average infertility duration of 7.00 +- 3.04 years. A total of 84 IVF/ICSI cycles were recorded in 34 patients with 2.44 +- 1.61 as the average number of cycles. A total of 944 oocytes were retrieved, with an average of 11.24 +- 7.13 oocytes for each ART cycle. Among the 944 oocytes, 53.81% (508/944) were at the GV stage, 9.22% (87/944) were at metaphase I (MI), 14.72% (139/944) showed the first polar body (matured), and 22.25% (210/944) were empty follicles, exhibited atresia. Fertilisation and cleavage were extremely rare. None of the reported cases carrying the mutation located between p.342 and 446 (around exons 12 and 13) showed the first polar body. The cases in which oocytes developed into the first polar body were frequently found to carry a mutation at the N-terminus before position p.217. However, these oocytes failed to fertilise or were arrested at an early stage. Thus, complete loss-of-function mutations may prevent oocytes from developing into the first polar body phase. We conclude that phenotypic variability is related to the region of function and degree of loss of function of the PATL2 protein. Significant PATL2 protein impairment results in oocytes being arrested at an earlier stage.\n\n    We mapped 31 reported mutations onto the atomic model (Figure 1) and analysed the potential effects of these mutations, including 18 missense, 7 nonsense, 3 splicing and 3 deletion mutations. Among them, 74.19% (23/31), 67.74% (21/31) and 32.26% (10/31) were located in the mRNA decay factor PAT1 domain (p.252-491), helical region of PATL2 protein and non-helical regions or introns, respectively.\n\n    Based on the published articles, the c.223-14_223-2del13 mutation was the most frequently reported in different populations by different researchers, including 7 independent patients (Figure 1B). The other most frequent mutation was the homozygous mutation, c.T478C. Seven cases were found in two studies and one researcher contributed to six cases. In addition, homozygous missense mutations (c.T478C, c.T558A, c.C784T, c.G877T, c.A1108G, c.G1127A, c.C1376A and c.C1528A) and homozygous splicing mutations (c.A1225-2G and c.G877-1A) were found in the patients. A total of 7 nonsense mutations (p.P160*, p.Y186*, p.R262*, p.Q300*, p.E428*, p.Q434* and p.G457*) were detected. Moreover the mutations at the exon region found in two or more cases in different populations were c.T478C, c.T558A, c.T649A, c.G778A, c.C898T, c.G1282T and c.C1376A and 4 splicing sites (c.223-14_223-2del13, c.T1224+2C, c.A1225-2G and c.G877-1A), indicating a certain distribution frequency in the population. We found that a relatively high frequency of compound heterozygosity was found in the c. 223-14_223-2del13 site. Other mutations associated with compound heterozygous mutations include c.T558A, c.T566G, c.T649A, c.716delA, c.G778A, c.G839A, c.865delA, c.G877T, c.C898T, c.G920A, c.A931G, c.T953C, c.T1224+2C, c.A1225+2C, c.C1247A, c.A1273C, c.G1282T, c.C1300T and c.C1376A. Only one heterozygous mutation was found, but the second mutation was not found within the exon and flanking sequences (c.T649A and c.G1282T), suggesting that there may be variations in the regulatory or intronic regions.\n\n    Based on the above exon distribution analysis, the exon with the highest number of mutation sites was revealed, including Exon13 (6 sites, 9 patients), Exon10 (4 sites, 5 patients), Exon14 (3 sites, 5 patients) and Exon7 (3 sites, 5 patients), Exon9 (3 sites, 4 patients). Exon13 is a 142 base pair exon that encodes 48 amino acids (p.409-456) and spans five helices. Seven out of 48 (14.58%) amino acids were altered to cause the phenotype. In small laboratories, hotspot sequencing has been suggested to reduce the burden on patients and technicians, resulting in economic benefits.\n\n    We searched for the frequency of SNP alleles and 20 loci with SNP accession numbers in the reported cases. We found that the frequency of a single site was considerably low, some of which were only 1/150,000. The top three were c.G839A (0.00519), c.C805A (0.00340) and C.T478C (0.00306). The cumulative allele frequency of these loci was 48.09 per 100,000 people, which was approximately 1/2080.\n\n    A public database was obtained by whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing from all over the world. In addition to the mutation sites from the patients summarised in Figure 1, a total of 16 SNPs (Figures 2A, B) were predicted and labelled to be pathogenic by at least four software programs, among which 10 SNPs were located in the PAT1 domain p.252-491 (Figure 2C). The cumulative carrier frequency of these SNPs was approximately 64.86 per 100,000 individuals. As the number of cases increased, these loci were likely to be detected.\n\n    We performed statistical analysis of nonsense mutations and mutations predicted to be pathogenic using more than four software programs. In addition to the phenotypic seven nonsense mutations summarised in Figure 1, we searched for six mutations with stop codons (Figure 2D) which were recorded in Uniprot, including rs760151963 (c.T485A, p.L162*), rs1281934664 (c.C541T, p.Q181*), rs763592153 (c.C709T, p.R237*), rs1457057185 (c.T944G, p.L315*), rs1176737926 (c.C1030T, p.Q344*) and rs751701388 (c.C1087T, p.Q363*), and the incidence of these sites was extremely low. The cumulative carrier frequency of these nonsense mutations was approximately 3.81 per 100,000 individuals.\n\n    Thus, the cumulative allele frequency of the reported mutation sites, together with 22 mutations based on the public database, was estimated to be 1.14%, which indicated that one in 877 people might be a carrier.\n\n    Multiple sequence alignments of the amino acid sequence of the PATL2 protein were compared among species using Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). The comparison map was marked using ConSurf (Figure 2A). Comparative analysis revealed conservation in most of the predicted SNPs screened from the public databases (Figures 2A, B). Among the 22 pathogenic SNPs predicted by the software, loci rs1023630775 (c.T608A) and rs1354960600 (c.A622C) were located in the conserved region (p.201-285, p.451-530).\n\n    Mutation from the wild type into amino acids of different groups that have different properties may disrupt protein stability, resulting in incorrect folding and unstable 3D architecture. Both the alpha-helix and beta-strand structures have their own tendency towards amino acids, and some of them have unique patterns. For example, mutation of the positive charge into no charge (c.T608A, p.M203K) directly destroys the interaction with other amino acids and subsequently may lead to issues in folding. If the hydrophobic property is converted into polar property, the structure is affected. Furthermore, some amino acids are inherently dangerous, such as proline (c.T1133C, p.L378P), because proline is an imino acid with a stable angle, and mutations in proline will change the protein structure to a large extent. In addition, mutation in glycine (c.G1108A, p.G370R) leads to the R group (hydrogen atom) gaining extensive freedom, thereby affecting the stability of the protein structure.\n\n    According to the distribution map of mutation sites summarised here, all mutations were located in the FUGUE (CATH-based) domain (p.158-534). The percentages of mutations located in the mRNA decay factor PAT1 domain (p.252-491), at the N-terminal region (p.1-239) and at the C-terminal region (p.492-543) were 70.97% (22/31), 16.13% (5/31) and 3.23% (1/31), respectively. Of these, 67.74% (21/31) were located in the alpha helix predicted by the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. The percentage of stop codon mutations with truncated proteins which were all located in the FUGUE (CATH-based) domain was 22.58% (7/31).\n\n    The PATL2 protein sequence (NP_001138584.1) was first added in the SWISS-MODEL and Polymorphism Phenotyping 2.0 (Pyren-2) tool to obtain the predicted crystal of the PATL2 protein fragment (Figures 3C-E). The PANX1 protein fragment (p.299-540; 247aa) predicted by SWISS-MODEL is homologous to the PAT1 homologue 1 (SMTL ID: 2xer.1.A). Compared to its sequence, PATL2 has 10 inconsistent amino acids with four free breakpoints in the tertiary structure (Figure 3D). The PATL2 fragment predicted by Pyren-2 had no breakpoint, but only a part of the crystal was found (p.298-536; 239aa).\n\n    The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database was used to make predictions with minor modifications (Figures 3A, B, F). The free AlphaFold database is an artificial intelligence system developed by DeepMind that predicts a protein's 3D structure from an amino acid sequence. DeepMind is used to train the neural network to predict the distance between amino acid pairs and the angle of the chemical bond. It regularly achieves an accuracy competitive with the experiment. A full-length protein structure was produced, which was more accurate than that produced by the previous prediction technology. A total of 18 mutation sites were aligned in the 3D structure of PATL2 protein (Figure 4A). The distribution of the mutant sites is easily seen scattered in the different regions of the protein. Most of them are located in the helix regions. Of them ten mutants having obvious structure or binding changes compared to the wild type are demonstrated in Figure 4B. For example, the amino acid 458 of the protein mutates from ILE to MET, which leads to the change of the force among residues. There is interaction between ILE and the other three residues. After mutated to MET, only two residues have interaction with it, and the residues also change. There is hydrogen bond force between ILE458 and VAL451, and there is hydrogen bond force between MET and ASN454. Some mutations result in low hydrogen bond force between amino acid residues, such as R280Q. A hydrogen bond is formed between ARG280 and ASP283 before mutation, but after mutation to GLN there is no charge.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Populations in different regions have experienced a long history of integration and show a certain genetic distribution. With the development of high-throughput sequencing, an increasing number of human samples have been sequenced, and various infertility-related genes and loss-of-function mutations have been identified and confirmed. Particularly, when infertile patients with recurrent IVF/ICSI failure or with a family history sought help from genetic testing, pathogenic genes and loci quickly accumulated, together with a large number of loci of possibly pathogenic or unknown clinical significance, waiting to reveal their potential functions and effects. A prospective assessment based on public databases and analyses is necessary.\n\n    The carrying rate of suspected pathogenic alleles of PATL2 in the global population has not been estimated. Based on a public database of more than 300,000 whole genomes and whole exome sequencing, we predicted for the first time that the overall carrier frequency of suspected pathogenic mutation sites is at least 1.14%, which is 1/877. This study summarised 53 mutations in PATL2, including 31 mutations from reported independent individuals, six nonsense mutations and 16 predicted pathogenic mutations identified from the public database, which expanded the spectrum of genetic causes of oocyte maturation defects. Although 22 loci from the public database was not reported in the infertile population, they might be found in ART patients undergoing genetic testing as the sample size increases. Subsequent studies are recommended to confirm whether these mutations have true influence on oocyte maturation. It is believed that this carrier frequency will continue to be rewritten when additional sequencing results are shared, additional clinical cases are tested and confirmatory experiments are performed. Identifying more casual mutants will help establish the complete mapping of genetic factors in human infertility.\n\n    Analysing the distribution of these mutations showed that the highest frequency of mutations detected in the independent patients was c.223-14_223-2del13. The carrier frequency in the population was 0.25%, which may be a potential threat to fertility. Exons with additional mutation sites and cases were Exon13 (6 sites, 9 patients). This study carried out a molecular epidemiological analysis based on the updated definition of the PAT1 domain of the PATL2 protein within p.252-491. Analysis of 31 PATL2 compound heterozygous and homozygous mutation sites in patients with oocyte maturation defects showed that 70.91% of mutations were located in the PAT1 domain, indicating the important function of the RNA-binding domain. Identifying the regulatory RNA that can bind to this domain is an important future research goal.\n\n    We predicted the entire secondary and tertiary structures of the PATL2 protein. To the best of our knowledge, we mapped for the first time 23 helical regions on the secondary and tertiary structures of the PATL2 protein. A percentage of 65.71% of the mutation sites detected in the reported patients were in the helical region, and the rest were in the non-helical region. A percentage of 81.82% of the SNP identified in the public database were located in the helical region and 18.18% were located in the non-helical region, indicating the importance of changes in amino acid in helical regions. According to the polarity of the side chain, amino acids can be divided into four categories: polar with a positive charge, polar with a negative charge, polar without a charge and non-polar. Each amino acid has a specific R side chain, which determines its physical and chemical properties. The solubility of non-polar to polar amino acids in water increases. The mutants causing non-polar to polar changes with negative charges include two sites (p.L189R and p.P416H) and the ones causing changes from non-polar hydrophobic to polar uncharged include two sites (p.I318T and p.P510T). The amino acids in the polar uncharged (hydrophilic) side chain contain neutral polar residues; therefore, when the polar uncharged amino acids are between hydrophobic amino acids and charged amino acids, they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules to change the protein structure. Contrastingly, the hydrogen bond breaks when polar and uncharged amino acids become non-polar amino acids (such as p.T425P and p.T449A). Additionally, proline is an imino acid with a stable angle; therefore, the mutation of 425T to proline will greatly change the structure of the protein itself. Sites that change from polar uncharged to polar negative charge (e.g., p.G370R), from polar negative charge to polar uncharged (e.g., p.R279C, p.R280Q, p.R307Q and p.R376Q) and from polar positive charged to polar uncharged (p.D293Y) were found. Generally speaking, if wild-type and mutated amino acid do not belong to the same category, the protein structure is unstable.\n\n    The analysis of 944 oocytes reported in independent individuals diagnosed with oocyte maturation defects in ART cycles showed a phenotype spectrum: 53.81% of the oocytes were arrested at the GV stage, 9.22% at the MI stage, 15.36% at the first polar body stage and 21.61% exhibited atresia and had empty follicles. Even those carrying the same compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations at the same locus showed different phenotypes. The expression of PATL2 in granulosa cells of polycystic ovary patients was reported to have significantly increased. Although studies on the factors that influence PATL2 are rare, PATL2 mutants may be sensitive to other factors, such as the follicular microenvironment and external environment, at the early stage of meiotic recovery, resulting in differences in phenotypic profiles. ICSI oocytes failed to establish pregnancy, even though they were fertilised and cleaved. Thus, even if development reaches the first polar body stage, ICSI may not alter embryo fate. Although PATL2 expression is almost undetectable after extrusion of the first polar body in normal oocytes, early dysfunction has a subsequent effect on oocyte outcome. Recently, the results of the study by Hatirnaz and team provided the hope of pregnancy for patients with oocyte maturation abnormalities. According to the Hatirnaz and Dahan Classification System, the ongoing pregnancy in women with type II (MI arrest) and type V (GV, MI and MII mixed arrest) oocyte seemed to be achieved by dual stimulation in in vitro maturation (Duastim IVM) in the Hartinaz clinic; this did not include patients with Type I (GV arrest), Type III (MII arrest) and Type IV (GV-MI arrest) oocyte abnormalities. One patient had two failed IVF attempts because of GV arrest by PANX1 mutation and was treated with letrozole priming IVM, and one fertilised embryo was obtained, giving the PANX1 mutation oocyte a living potential. Therefore, this led to an important step forward in therapy. But at present the patients with pathogenic mutations are still suggested to stop the recurrent self oocyte attempts and refer to a oocyte donation strategy. For those with only one heterozygous mutation, it should also be noted, since biallelic gene effect may also reduce the fertility capacity largely.\n\n    Mouse is a good model for functional analysis when a novel mutation is found. But the phenotypes are not always same. It was found that Patl2-/- female mice exhibited influence on fertility not as severe as that in human, the Patl2 -/- oocytes could fertilise and develop to blastocyst stage. But the absence of Patl2 affected oocyte growth which showed abnormal small size of the GV oocytes and MII oocytes. Abnormal spindle morphology, misalignment of chromosomes on the spindle and numerous cytoplasmic asters were also notably found in the arrested oocytes. There may exist the other repair mechanism to overcome the barrier in oocyte development in mice.\n\n    Recently, it was reported that an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model was constructed from CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood of a 28-year-old patient with PATL2 compound heterozygous mutation, and was reprogrammed. iPSCs provide the possibility for in-depth research on their mechanisms and subsequent targeted therapies. Additionally, the PATL2Y217N mutant was transfected into 293T cells to explore the possible mechanism by which PATL2 mutations cause oocyte maturation defects. The mutant seemed to be more stable than PATL2WT, resulting in abnormal accumulation of the PATL2 protein. It is worth noting that mouse oocytes microinjected with PATL2Y217N cRNA showed decreased ubiquitination levels together with abnormally large polar bodies similar to those in patients. This phenomenon is similar to the phenotype observed in mouse MOS -/- oocytes, with anomalous polar bodies, partial symmetrical cleavage and abnormal spindles. Spatiotemporal and specific expression of PATL2 at the meiosis initiation stage and proper functioning of the downstream gene inhibition at an appropriate time (after the first polar body is extruded) are particularly important. Too little or too much untimely expression or accumulation has a severe influence on oocyte maturation. The interference of the above mutations in the process of early maturation allows us to consider the method to choose the appropriate time to correct the defect when designing a targeted therapy. Therefore, the choice of time, mode and dose may become a bottleneck for successful treatment and intervention.\n\n    In summary, bioinformatics analysis of PATL2 gene mutations will help reveal the molecular epidemiological characteristics, help identify the prevalence of PATL2 gene mutations and provide important references for new mutation assessment, function prediction, phenotype prediction, disease diagnosis, genetic counselling, drug research and incubation and formulation of intervention strategies. Furthermore, it provides a reference for a reasonable sample size involved in epidemiological studies of PATL2 gene mutations. Using the existing database for prediction analysis can reduce the number of discovery and confirmation cycles for novel loci. Patient-derived mutated animal models are recommended to be used for establishing whether these features also reappear in the model animal and for exploring the mechanisms underlying the phenotypes involved in structural defects and infertility.",

        "Title": "    A Novel Mutation p.L461P in KRT5 Causing Localized Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex",
        "Abstract": "    Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare genetic disease with widely different clinical manifestations, but the relationship between genotype and phenotype is not fully understood. In the present study, we recruited a Chinese family in which two members had been diagnosed with localized EB simplex (EBS), with clinical manifestation, including blisters and erosions on the soles of the feet since infancy.\n\n    To identify and confirm the genetic variation in a Chinese family diagnosed as localized EBS.\n\n    Our study included two patients, other healthy members of the family, and 100 normal controls. Genomic DNA samples were isolated from each participant, and then polymerase chain reaction (PCR) direct sequencing was performed.\n\n    The results of PCR direct sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation in codon 461 of exon 7 of KRT5 (c.1382T>C), which led to an amino acid change (p.L461P) in the patients with EBS but was absent in unaffected family members and 100 unrelated control samples.\n\n    The present study broadens the mutational spectrum of EBS, and this knowledge could be harnessed for prenatal screening, gene diagnosis, and gene therapy for localized EBS.",
        "Introduction": "    Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) comprises a group of hereditary disorders, in which blisters occur spontaneously or after minor injury or friction. The phenotypic spectrum of EB is highly variable, and there are differences in severity and associated extraneous manifestations between different types of EB. However, all types of EB present with traumatic blistering and fragility. Based on the level of the dermal-epidermal separation relative to the basement membrane, EB can be divided into four subtypes:simplex, junctional, dystrophic, and Kindler syndrome. In the most common subtype, EB simplex (EBS), separation occurs at or above the basal layer of keratinocytes in the epidermis. Statistics from 1986 to 2002 showed that the prevalence of EB was about 11 cases per 1 million residents and the incidence rate was about 19 cases per 1 million live births. EBS shows significant genetic and clinical heterogeneity. EBS can be subdivided into the generalized severe (Dowling-Meara), generalized intermediate (Koebner), and localized subtypes. Localized EBS (OMIM 131800) is the mildest subtype, in which bullous lesions usually occur during the birth or infancy period, although they may also appear during adolescence or early adulthood. Clinically, the vesicles and bullae are primarily confined to the palmar and plantar regions without nail and mucosal damage.\n\n    Almost all EBS mutations follow the pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance. EBS is mainly associated with mutations in two genes, KRT5 and KRT14. KRT5 and KRT14 genes encode basal epidermal keratin 5 and 14, respectively. Both keratin 5 and keratin 14 have a central rod-like alpha helix structure and a non-helix structure (head and tail) on both sides. At the beginning and end of the central rod-like region, there are two highly conserved amino acid sequences, called helix initiation peptide (HIP) and helix termination peptide (HTP). In most cases, the location of the mutation determines the severity of the clinical phenotype. For example, mutations in HIP and HTP that affect the assembly of keratin filaments lead to the most severe Dowling-Meara EBS (EBS-DM; OMIM 131760); Mutations often lead to localized EBS in nonhelical linker regions, while Koebner (EBS-K; OMIM 131900) mutations are more widely distributed along both keratin 5 and keratin 14 polypeptides. To date, more than 150 different pathogenic mutations associated with these genes have been described, most of them are associated with the more severe EBS-DM.\n\n    In the present study, two patients from a Chinese family who had been diagnosed with localized EBS were evaluated, and a novel missense mutation c.1382T>C (p.L461P), which was located at the 2B segment of the KRT5, confirmed a diagnosis of localized EBS. Identification of new mutations and genotype-phenotype associations leads to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic basis of localized EBS and is important for disease course prediction, gene diagnosis, genetic counseling, and gene therapy.",
        "Methods": "    In total, five members of the localized EBS pedigree (Fig. 1) were enrolled in the study. Members II:1 (42-years-old female) and III:1 (15-years-old female; proband) presented to our hospital. Our study also included proband's father, grandparents, and 100 normal control subjects. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating individuals (or their guardians), and 5 ml blood samples were drawn from each participant for DNA extraction. Clinical examinations of all participants were carried out by a dermatologist. The current research, which was performed in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, was authorized by the Institutional Review Board of Tongling People's Hospital. We received the patient's consent form about publishing all photographic materials. Ethical approval was gained from the Ethics Committee of Tongling People's Hospital (2020001).\n\n    We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify genomic DNA samples (Humphries et al. 1996), after which PCR products were sequenced with Sanger sequencing. Consulting the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) cDNA reference sequences NM_000424.3 for KRT5 and NM_000526.4 for KRT14, we identified a specific mutation present only in clinically affected family members. Multiple online bioinformatics software programs, including follows, PolyPhen2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2), SIFT (http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg), and Mutation Taster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/), were used to predict whether the resulting amino acid substitution could have an effect on the structure and function of the KRT5 and KRT14. We aligned the proteins of different species, including Bos taurus, Gallus gallus, Gorilla gorilla, Mus musculus, and Oryctolagus cuniculus. The change of structure between wild-type and mutation (p.L461P) was predicted by SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org, PBD: 3TNU). A structural comparison of the wild-type and mutation revealed notable differences between them.",
        "Results": "    There were two affected people in this family. The proband, a 15-year-old Chinese girl, was the only daughter of unrelated Chinese parents. She and her mother have similar clinical symptoms, and there is no other family history. Since birth, the proband and her mother have been prone to blisters after mechanical injury to the foot, but the blisters heal without scarring. The symptoms were worse in the summer and improved with age. Physical examinations were normal except the blisters (Fig. 2). Pathologic examination of the right plantar blister of the proband revealed hyperkeratosis of the epidermis, thickening of the granulosa and spinous layer, and vesicles form in the epidermis. The vessels in the dermal papillary layer were slightly dilated, with little inflammatory cell infiltration, and the perivascular stroma was slightly mucinous (Fig. 2).The diagnosis of this disease was based on the combination of typical clinical manifestations, family history and pathological examination, so it was diagnosed as localized EBS. The molecular tests we performed further confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n    Localized EBS is one of the most common clinical variant diseases of EBS, as well as the mildest type. According to published data, mutations in many genes are associated with EBS phenotype, including TGM5, PLEC, PKP1, KRT5, KRT14, DSP, JUP, DST, and EXPH5, but more than 75% of EBS cases are attributed to the mutation of KRT5 or KRT14 genes. Thus, here we selected these two genes as the candidate causative genes to screen for mutation.\n\n    Molecular analysis of the proband's DNA indicated a heterozygous T to C transition at nucleotide position 1382 (c.1382T>C) in exon 7 of the KRT5 gene. The mutation leads to the substitution of proline residue for leucine at codon 461 (p. Leu461Pro). The identical mutation in KRT5 was detected in the proband's mother. The mutation is located at the 2B segment of the KRT5, confirming a diagnosis of localized EBS. No additional mutation was identified in KRT5 or KRT14. No mutation was found in unaffected family members or the 100 population-matched healthy controls (Fig. 3). PolyPhen2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2), SIFT (http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg), and Mutation Taster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/) all predicted that the mutation c.1382T>C (p.L461P) was likely to disrupt protein function, although proline and leucine have similar polarity.\n\n    We compared proteins from different species and obtained structural-based multi-sequence alignment of KRT5 from different species, showing that the mutation (p. l 461pro) is located in a highly conserved region (Fig. 4).\n\n    In wild-type KRT5, Leu461 forms two hydrogen bonds, with Met457 and Val465, while the mutant Pro461 only forms one hydrogen bond, with Val465. The reduction in hydrogen bonds may impact the stability of 2B, alpha-helical domains whose spatial structure is maintained by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5). The c.1382T>C (p.L461P) mutation occurred in the non-helical junction region, and the proline of the same polarity replaced the leucine, which resulted in the existence of lightest EBS. Collectively, these results indicate that p.L461P in KRT5 is a causative mutation for localized EBS in this family.\n\n    To investigate whether there are any mutation-rich exons for KRT5 mutations, we retrieved all the reported mutation in KRT5. As shown in Table 1, about 28 novel KRT5 mutations responsible for EBS have been found since January 1, 2008. Mutations in the tail domain of KRT5 are often associated with EBS-migratory circinate erythema (EBS-Migr) and pigment forms of the disease, suggesting that this region may play a role in the regulation of pigmentation and inflammation. Also, as to the genetic diagnose, more attention should be paid to these exons coding for tail domains when screening for mutations causing EBS. We noticed that only a few mutations are associated with localized EBS, which are distributed in all regions of KRT5 but mainly gathered in the head and the non-helical linker regions. Examples include p.Val133Met, p.Asn146Lys, p.Met327Thr, p.Asp328Gly and the novel mutation (p.Leu 461Pro) in our study. It revealed that if the patients are diagnosis as localized EBS, sequences coding for head and the non-helical linker regions of KRT5 should have propriety for the mutation screening. Because the process of gene expression is complicated and can be influenced by other genes and external factors, it may be cautious in predicting the relationship between genotype and phenotype.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    KRT5 and KRT14 genes encode the intermediate filament (IF) proteins in the basal layer of the epidermis and related complex epithelia. The keratin intermediate filament (KIF) network is attached to desmosomes and hemi-desmosomes, connecting keratinocytes to adjacent cells and basement membranes, forming intercellular adhesions that protect epithelial cells from mechanical and other stresses. EBS is closely related to mutations in KRT5 and KRT14, but the mechanism by which mutations cause the formation and collapse of keratin networks remains unclear.\n\n    It is reported that disruption of KRT5/KRT14 filament network architecture can cause the fragility of basal keratinocytes, making the cells unable to bear mechanical pressure, then further leading to intracellular vacuoles, which eventually result in blistering of the skin. Sawant et al. found that threonine 150 (T150) KRT5 phosphorylation plays an important role in the formation of the KIF network, relating to the pathogenesis of EBS. In addition, other pathological mechanisms play important roles in the pathophysiology of EBS, including preinflammatory cytokines, the tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and signaling pathways which associated with them. Russell et al. found that the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (PKB) signal transduction channels of ERK and PKB due to mechanical stresses were involved in EBS, leading to the resistance of keratin mutated cells to apoptosis after channel activation. Beyond that, there are other mechanisms involved in the occurrence of disease, including impaired mechanical stress recovery, downregulation of cellular junction elements, and destruction of epithelial cell adhesion. So far, we do not know how the mutation (p.L461P) causes clinical manifestation in this family; further studies are needed to provide insights into the detailed molecular pathogenesis of the mutations identified in the present study.\n\n    At present, there are no effective treatment methods for EBS; the main treatment is symptomatic management. For example, plantar injection of botulinum toxin, as a safe and long-lasting method, can effectively block the occurrence of blisters. In addition, it has been reported that long-term oral erythromycin may be effective on EBS-DM. A 1% diacerein ointment is considered to be a well-tolerated and safe targeted therapy that significantly reduces blisters in most EBS-DM patients. Because of the overexpression of Th17 cytokines found in the blister roof and fluid in the skin of EBS-DM patients, with anti-IL-17 agents treatment, a sharp reduction in the number of blisters in all patients has been observed. The natural chemical sulforaphane produced by broccoli has been shown to treat blisters in KRT14 deficient mice by inducing the expression of KRT16 and KRT17 in the epidermal basal layer and improving the EBS phenotype. Recently, Peking et al. successfully developed an ex vitro gene therapy using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to correct a recurrent COL7A1 mutation of dystrophic EB in a xenograft mouse model. Clearly, considerable progress has been made in the treatment of EB with RNA, but there are limitations. Since it is a genetic disease, genome editing as state-of-the-art gene therapy approach may be harnessed for clinical treatment. Specifically, because the mutation is c.1382T>C in KRT5 gene, it could be corrected with cytidine base editor to convert C-to-T conversion.\n\n    Taken together, this is the first study reporting the KRT5: p.L461P missense mutation at the 2B helix, or any mutation in codon 461 of KRT5. Identification of this novel mutation (p.L461P) in KRT5 would lead to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic basis of localized EBS, which may be harnessed for gene diagnosis, genetic counseling, and gene therapy. Also, it provides more insight into the phenotype-genotype correlation in EBS.\n\n    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors have nothing to disclose.\n\n    FUNDING SOURCE: This work was supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of China (81201181, F.G.), Zhejiang provincial & Ministry of Health research fund for medical sciences (WKJ2013-2-023, F.G.).\n\n    The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.",

        "Introduction": "    The wide supply of vaccines against COVID-19 has allowed to drastically change the course of the pandemic, as of December 13, 2022, 63.8% of the world population is fully vaccinated. In February 2021, a few cases of unusual, severe thrombotic events associated with thrombocytopenia reported after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria) or with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine raises concern about safety. On April 7, 2021, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded for the presence of a causal relationship between vaccination with Vaxzevria and the adverse events of thrombosis combined with thrombocytopenia (VITT).\n\n    Moreover, data from a systematic review supported the relationship between VITT and adverse outcome occurrence, also proposing a score for predicting VITT mortality (FAPIC score), including fibrinogen levels, age, platelet count, and the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).\n\n    The binomial constituted by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis is very rare in medicine, and quickly HIT emerged as the most plausible among the clinical pictures characterized by these two signs. Indeed, also in VITT, we identified anti-PF4 antibodies as key elements in the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease.\n\n    Data from literature published in 2021 defined VITT in terms of five criteria: onset of symptoms 5-30 days after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, presence of thrombosis, presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000 per cubic millimeter), D-dimer level exceeding 4000 equivalent fibrinogen units (FEU), and presence of antibodies against PF4 detected by enzymatic immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This condition was mainly observed in women under 55 years of age between 4 and 16 days after administration of the Vaxzevria vaccine or, with an even higher incidence, the Janssen vaccine (Ad26COV2). According to the EMA, the incidence of VITT in people over 60 years of age is about 1.02 cases per 100,000 doses of vaccine, and this incidence increases by about 1 in 50,000/75,000 doses in people under 60 years of age.\n\n    In VITT, after vaccine administration, platelet Factor 4 (PF4) likely binds to certain components of the vaccine or the adenoviral vector itself, forming complexes that become neoantigens and induce the formation of antibodies against itself. Similarly to HIT, vaccine-PF4-IgG immune complexes activate platelets through their FcgammaRIIA receptors, causing their activation, aggregation, and further release of PF4, leading to a positive feedback cycle of further platelet activation. In addition, these complexes also activate monocytes, which release tissue factor and promote the associated activation of coagulation. Here, too, the once-triggered reaction feeds on itself. Alternatively, a possible trigger for the production of antibodies directed against PF4 might also be represented by the free DNA present in the vaccine; really, previous data from the literature reported that DNA and RNA, as well as DNA/RNA-based aptamers, should be able to induce PF4 conformational changes that might contribute to expose HIT antigens and, in turn, to induce the formation of antibodies against PF4/heparin complexes in mice. Unlike mRNA vaccines, which directly release mRNA into the cytosol of host cells, where they are translated into spike proteins without splicing reactions, adenoviral vector-based vaccine activity requires the nuclear transcription process, which might generate shorter \"spike\" protein variants, possibly responsible for soluble forms release able to induce a strong inflammatory process which might promote VITT development. Moreover, the presence of polysorbate as an adjuvant in ChAdOx1 and Ad26.CoV2.S vaccines, representing a nonanionic surfactant able to cross the blood-brain barrier and home-to-brain endothelial cells, if complexed with nanoparticles, might also be involved in promoting vaccine-induced complications.\n\n    Further molecular mechanisms might also contribute to trigger VITT mechanisms; really, it has been proposed that genetically determined FcgammaRIIa increased expression as well as altered glycosylation state of the IgG produced in response to vaccine administration, possibly responsible for a higher reactivity to platelet FcgammaRIIa, might also be involved in disease mechanisms. Moreover, it has been also suggested a possible contribution of adenoviral vector outflow into the circulation and/or previous presence of antibodies, cross-reactive to other coronaviruses, determining platelet-activating immunocomplexes formation.\n\n    To the best of our knowledge, little information is available concerning the relationship between host genetic variability and VITT development. Previous data from the literature suggested the possible contribution of specific HLA alleles or haplotypes in the modulation of anti-PF4/P hyperresponsiveness. Moreover, only a recent case report reported the genetic investigation of a VITT subject by Human Genotyping SARS-CoV-2 Research Array, investigating more than 870,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thus hypothesizing the possible contribution of genetic variants in genes involved in coagulation, thrombophilia, inflammation.\n\n    In the present study, we investigated the genetic background of VITT subjects by a high-throughput whole exome sequencing (WES) approach, in order to investigate the possible contribution of genetic risk factors influencing the development of adenoviral vectors-vaccines adverse events. In particular, in this report, we focused attention on genes selected for their involvement in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, platelet activation and aggregation, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, inflammation with particular attention to those involved in vascular damage, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia.",
        "Methods": "    Six patients referred to the Atherothrombotic Diseases Center (Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence) with a diagnosis of definite VITT underwent molecular characterization through WES analysis. There are six female patients of Caucasian origin with a mean age of 64 years. Of these six patients, five (VITT02, VITT05, VITT06, VITT18, and VITT21) received the Vaxzevria vaccine (AstraZeneca), and one (VITT03) received the JANSSEN vaccine (Johnson & Johnson).\n\n    The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the National Ethical Committee for studies on COVID-19 (approval n. 333 - 2020/2021 Istituto Nazionale per le Malattie Infettive \"L. Spallanzani\", Rome) and by the participating center's ethics committees (17104_oss). All cases of VITT were adjudicated independently by three blinded experts (VDS, PG, RM), according to the criteria proposed by Pavord et al..\n\n    Table 1 reported clinical data of the six patients with VITT analyzed: arterial and/or venous thrombotic events, hemorrhagic complications, neurological damage, and prognosis.\n\n    Peripheral blood DNA has been isolated using FlexiGene kit (QIAGEN , Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer's instructions, and quantified by NanoDrop  One/OneC Microvolume UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and Invitrogen Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The WES analysis has been performed through Illumina Technology. Genomic libraries have been prepared according to SureSelect XT HS protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The pooled libraries were paired-end sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\n    Concerning the Assembly and Variant Calling phases, reads were aligned with the human reference hg19 genome using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform16 was performed, and aligned reads were inspected with the IGV software (Broad Institute). The variant calling for the identification of nucleotide variants was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit HaplotypeCaller Module. Coverage statistics and the average depth of coverage were computed using custom scripts in the R software environment.\n\n    Rare SNVs and InDels were selected by removing all variants with no functional impact (intronic and missense) and with allelic frequency smaller than 0.0001. For each patient, all genes affected by rare variants were analyzed for overrepresentation analysis by using the \"gene list\" analysis tool of the Reactome database (reactome.org). Reactome pathways with entities FDR smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n    Genes for variants analysis have been selected according to gene ontology biological processes (blood coagulation [GO:0007596] and fibrinolysis [GO:0042730], platelet activation [GO:0030168] and aggregation [GO:0070527], integrin-mediated signaling pathway [GO:0007229], inflammatory response [GO:0006954], and Human Phenotype Ontology [autoimmune thrombocytopenia: HP:0001973]), as well as according to literature data (Table S1).\n\n    Variant prioritization phase was carried out as follows: nonsynonymous variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 in publicly available resources (dbSNP; in 1000 Genomes Project or Genome Aggregation Database) were considered. The pathogenic effect of the missense/splicing mutations was estimated using PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster, FATHMM, NetGene2, ASSP, and SpliceAI tools. Attribution of pathogenicity was performed according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines.\n\n    Given the large amount of sequence data, we looked for options to streamline variant selection. Using the gnomAD exomes and the gnomAD genome database, we selected only variants with a MAF < 0.01, and specifically, we focused on rare variants identified in genes involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, platelet activation and aggregation, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, inflammation with particular attention to those involved in vascular damage, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia.",
        "Results": "    In Table 1, the demographic and clinical characteristics of the 6 sequenced patients are reported. They were all females with a mean age of 64.2 +- 13.8 years. VITT05 (75 yrs) and VITT18 (42 yrs) patients exhibited the worse clinical outcome. VITT02 and VITT06 showed both venous and arterial thrombosis. Only 1, out of 6 patients, showed only arterial thrombosis (VITT18). The other 3 patients showed only venous thrombosis. No demographic and clinical differences were observed between the only subject (VITT03) receiving the JANSSEN vaccine and the other five subjects receiving the VAXZEVRIA vaccine.\n\n    Sequencing analysis of the 6 patients with VITT resulted in a total number of genetic variants of 140,563. The total number of variants per patient analyzed, split into rare (MAF <= 0.01) and nonrare variants, is shown in Figure 1(a). The number (Figure 1(a)) and the variant type distribution (Figure 1(b)) are similar among each patient analyzed. Among rare variants, ranging from 1619 to 1774 among the six patients with VITT, the higher percentage is represented by intronic (ranging from 38.2% to 42.3%), missense (ranging from 28.4% to 30.6%), and synonymous variants (ranging from 18.5% to 21.3%), whereas splice sites (ranging from 3.6% to 5.3%), 5'/3'-UTR (ranging from 3.9% to 5.1%), nonsense (ranging from 0.4% to 0.7%), and frameshift (ranging from 0.2% to 0.8%) variants are less frequent (Figure 1(b)).\n\n    Due to the rare occurrence of VITT (1/26,000-127,300), we first of all focused the attention on very rare variants in the 6 patients. The global analysis of all high-quality rare variants evaluated by overrepresentation analysis by using the \"gene list\" analysis tool of the Reactome database did not show a significant enrichment of mutated genes in biological/functional pathways common to the 6 different patients.\n\n    Next, we focused attention on rare variants identified in genes selected to be involved in biological/functional processes associated with blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, platelet activation and aggregation, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, inflammation with particular attention to those involved in vascular damage, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia (Table S1).\n\n    In Table 2 the patient code, the gene with the reference transcript, the description of the identified variant, the in silico predictors used for the prediction of pathogenicity of missense variants and splicing variants, and variant classification according to ACMG guidelines are reported. Altogether, in the six patients, n = 194, rare variants were identified, all at the heterozygous state (Table S2). As ACMG variant classification criteria were considered, n = 47, variants (24.2%) have been classified as uncertain significance variants (VUS): 4 in VITT05, 4 in VITT21, 6 in VITT03, 9 in VITT18, 11 in VITT06, and 13 in VITT02 (Table 2). No variant has been classified as likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant. Even if different genetic variants, patient VITT02 and VITT06 carried one of their mutation in the FGA gene and VITT02 and VITT18 in the SERPINA12 gene.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This paper addresses for the first time whether rare genetic variants could contribute to the development of VITT, a clinical condition mainly associated with COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccine administration and its adverse complications through a WES approach.\n\n    Due to the rare occurrence of VITT, in this paper, we focused the attention on rare variants. At a whole analysis of the rare variants identified in the 6 patients with VITT, no significant enrichment of mutated genes in biological/functional pathways common to different analyzed subjects was found. Therefore, we focused on potentially damaging mutations on the basis of ACMG criteria, occurring in selected genes involved in biological and functional processes associated with blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, platelet activation and aggregation, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, inflammation with particular attention to those involved in vascular damage, and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Actually, selected pathways have been described to contribute to a major push in VITT and in its complication severity.\n\n    For each patient, we identified different VUS ranging from 4 to 13 variants. VITT05 and VITT18 patients exhibited the worst clinical outcome.\n\n    In VITT05, a rare VUS in the STAB2 gene [c.2065C>G (p.Pro689Ala)] has been classified as harmful by most in silico predictors used. STAB2 gene encodes stabilin-2, expressed predominantly in the sinusoidal endothelium of the liver and spleen and acting as a systemic scavenger receptor for heparin, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, nonglycosaminoglycan, acetylated low-density lipoprotein, procollagen propeptides, and advanced glycation end products. Previous WES data also showed an association of STAB2 locus with venous thromboembolic disease; really, previous data demonstrated that stabilin-2, beyond its role as a scavenger receptor for the aforementioned components, acts as a clearance receptor for VWF, supporting the connection between stabilin-2 and VWF plasma levels. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that STAB2 genetic variants might affect stabilin-2 cell surface expression by possibly inducing protein misfolding or nonsense-mediated decay, thus influencing molecular pathways stabilin-2 mediated and, in turn, contributing to the development of a prothrombotic phenotype. Indeed, it has been observed a role for stabilin-2 in influencing the thrombus incidence in association with elevated VWF plasma levels, potentially by promoting the interaction of platelets and leukocytes with the vessel wall.\n\n    VITT05 patient was also a carrier of another rare variant in the CD47 gene [c.311A>G (p.Asp104Gly)], encoding the leukocyte surface antigen CD47, for which a variable prediction of pathogenicity by in silico tools was evidenced. The contribution of the CD47 gene might be considered critical, as well; really, the leukocyte surface antigen CD47 plays a role as a receptor for thrombospondin, a secreted matricellular protein observed to be upregulated in vascular cells after injury as well as in chronic disease, and modulator of integrin signaling. Indeed, the CD47-TSP1 binding has been previously shown to influence thrombus formation leading events, including the adhesion of platelets to the endothelial wall, nitric oxide/cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signaling induction, platelet activation, and aggregation. VITT05 also exhibited two further VUS in genes involved in inflammation pathways. A rare variant in COL6A1 gene [c.2191C>T (p.Arg731Cys)], encoding for alpha-1 chain of collagen VI, for which in silico tools used for pathogenicity prediction established a damaging effect, was detected. Data from the literature showed that the COL6A1 gene was upregulated in patients with nonemphysematous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, so supporting the profibrotic mast cell phenotype, through collagen VI deposition. Moreover, a further variant was found in the IL5RA gene [c.913G > A p.(Asp305Asn)], encoding the interleukin-5 receptor subunit alpha, involved in the survival, differentiation, and chemotaxis of eosinophils, contributing to modulate the innate immune system.\n\n    VITT18 is a patient with a severe disability as a consequence of cerebral stroke with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Interestingly, this patient carries a missense variant [c. 830G>A (p.Arg277Gln)] in GP6 gene encoding for platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI), a collagen receptor involved in collagen-induced platelet adhesion and activation, contributing to platelet procoagulant activity and thrombin and fibrin formation. The GPVI represents a receptor expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes and acts as a receptor for collagen as well as several plasma and vascular proteins (i.e., laminin, fibronectin, and galectin-3). Data from the literature suggested the contribution of platelet GPVI in influencing venous thrombotic complications; really GPVI might sustain the thrombo-inflammatory status by inducing neutrophil granular release. Moreover, it has been suggested the role of a GPVI-thrombin-fibrin feedforward loop supporting the thrombus formation. Apart from the GP6 gene variant, VITT18 patient also carries two rare missense variants in SERPINA12 and MFSD2B genes [c.1062C>G (p.His354Gln) and c.1000C>G (p.Pro334Ala)], both classified as damaging by all in silico prediction tools. SERPINA12 gene product, vaspin, is a member of the large family of serine protease inhibitors and has been observed to inhibit target protease kallikrein 7 (KLK7), the process accelerated by the presence of heparin. Actually, it has been evidenced that serum vaspin is an independent prognostic marker of major adverse cardiac events (cardiovascular death, recurrent acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or hospitalization for heart failure) in AMI patients. In particular, low vaspin levels have been found to be associated with increased inflammation in AMI patients.\n\n    As concerns MFSD2B, it encodes the sphingosine-1-phosphate transporter, able to mediate the export of sphingosine-1-phosphate in red blood cells and platelets. A mouse model highlighted that Mfsd2b knock-out could influence platelet intrinsic functions, thus supporting its possible role in limiting thrombus formation. In particular, the mouse model suggested that sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling could be involved in platelet biogenesis. Mfsd2b has been observed to be required for sphingosine-1-phosphate release in resting and activated platelets, really Mfsd2b knock-out is associated with a reduced platelet intrinsic function and, in turn, a reduced thrombosis in mice. Therefore, gain-of-function variants in the MFSD2B gene might contribute to a prothrombotic phenotype. VITT18 phenotype might be also supported by the presence of two further VUS: a variant in the BCL6 gene, encoding a transcriptional repressor, able to influence T cell proliferative capacity and fate, and a variant in TRPV1 gene, encoding a ligand-activated nonselective calcium permeant cation channel involved in the detection of noxious chemical and thermal stimuli. Data from mouse models reported that Bcl6 expression was reduced in the presence of mir-155 (microRNA 155) deficiency in advanced atherosclerosis, supporting its involvement in the modulation of the atherosclerotic process. Moreover, BCL6 has been observed to be involved in live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)-induced T follicular helper cell differentiation, influencing the antibody response. As concerns the TRPV1 gene, it has been shown that brain channels are activated by ischemic stroke, causing neurological and motor deficits as well as infarction after brain ischemia. Moreover, it has been reported that TRPV1 is present in platelets, thus representing a substrate for platelet activation by inflammatory mediators in atherosclerotic plaques.\n\n    In VITT02 patient, in whom both venous and arterial thrombosis occurred, a VUS with all damaging predictors of pathogenicity [c.608T>C (p.Leu203Pro)] was found in the SERPINA12 gene. In addition, in VITT02 patient, there has been evidence of the presence of VUS in genes involved in two strictly related biological processes: (cell-matrix adhesion [ITGA2B, ITGAD, and FGA, gene ontology term GO:0007160] and blood coagulation [THBD and FGA, GO:0072377]). Interestingly, VITT02 exhibited the presence of two variants in genes encoding for integrin family members, such as ITGA2B, encoding for the integrin alpha-IIb and associated with Glanzmann thrombasthenia (OMIM 273800), and ITGAD, encoding for the integrin alpha-D. Altogether, these loci might contribute to explain the thrombotic profile. Among other variants identified, two have not been previously described in the general population; the first one is a rare missense variant (c.1465G>C) in THBD gene, encoding for thrombomodulin, an endothelial-specific type I membrane receptor involved in the regulation of the coagulation process, determining the substitution of the Aspartic Acid at position 489 with an Histidine (p.Asp489His) located in the extracellular region in the serine/threonine-rich domain, a binding side for alpha-L/beta-2 and alpha-M/beta-2 integrin; the second one is a rare missense variant [c.1132T>A (p.Ser378Thr)] in the FGA gene, encoding for the fibrinogen alpha-chain. As concerns the THBD variant, the serine/threonine-rich domain represents a critical domain for protein anticoagulant activity, and data concerning other variants previously identified in the same domain possibly support its role. Further VUSs have been detected in the PIEZO1 gene, encoding the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1, which was shown to be a key modulator of abnormal platelet activation and thrombosis under hypertension, and GLCE gene, encoding the D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase, involved in heparan sulfate/heparin biosynthesis. In VITT02 patient, uncertain significant rare variants have also been detected in the CARD8 and EGFR genes, both involved in inflammation pathways. CARD8 protein represents an inflammasome sensor, mediating the activation of the inflammasome according to pathogen-associated signals response. In particular, it has been reported that CARD8 participates in the regulation of cytokines and chemokines expression in endothelial cells and atherosclerotic lesions. As concerns the EGFR gene, it encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase binding ligands of the EGF family. Data from RNA sequencing analysis, performed in glioblastoma tissue specimens according to the thrombotic phenotype, showed a higher EGFR expression in the group with many thrombi with respect to that with few thrombi.\n\n    Similarly to VITT02, a VUS in the FGA gene was also detected in VITT06 patient, also exhibiting both venous thrombosis and stroke. The missense variant identified in this patient [c.2068C>G (p.Gln690Glu)] has not previously been described and exhibited a variable pathogenicity prediction with the in silico tools used, thus supporting the possible contribution of fibrinogen chain alterations to a prothrombotic phenotype. This patient also exhibited VUS in VASP, TBXAS1, and ENTPD1 genes. VASP gene encodes the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, actin-associated proteins involved in a range of processes dependent on cytoskeleton remodeling and cell polarity; in particular, it regulates actin dynamics in platelets and plays an important role in regulating platelet activation/aggregation. TBXAS1 gene encodes the thromboxane-A synthase 1, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a potent inducer of blood vessel constriction and platelet aggregation. Data from the literature also evidenced the association of thromboxane A synthase 1 gene expression and promotor haplotypes with the risk of large artery-atherosclerosis stroke in the Iranian population. As concerns ENTPD1, it encodes the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 observed to be implicated in the prevention of platelet aggregation by hydrolyzing platelet-activating ADP to AMP. VITT06 patient also exhibited uncertain significance rare variants in FFAR2, NDST1, and NLRP2 genes. FFAR2 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by a major product of dietary fiber digestion, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and that plays a role in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis and in intestinal immunity. Previous data from the literature reported its role as a potential biomarker to predict AMI occurrence. NDST1 encodes a member of the heparan sulfate/heparin GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase family. It has been previously reported in mouse models that modification of the heparan sulfate fine structure by Ndst1 deletion contributes to decrease vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) proliferation, as well as vascular remodeling. NDS1 deficiency has also been previously shown to correlate with allergic airway inflammation. The NLRP2 gene encodes a member of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR) family. It interacts with components of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex and can regulate both caspase-1 and NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity. Previous data from the literature reported higher expression levels both in vitro and in vivo under ischemic stroke conditions.\n\n    In VITT03, in whom a deep vein thrombosis was observed, a missense VUS [c.1228G>T(p.Asp410Tyr)] classified by all in silico predictors as damaging has been identified in EPB41 gene, encoding for a structural element of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, for which gene expression studies evidenced its contribution in the thrombus formation network. Actually, a decreased erythrocyte membrane flexibility results in an increased red erythrocyte rigidity that might contribute to a thrombogenic potential. Apart from EPB41, VITT03 also carries a further missense VUS in the PDIA6 gene, encoding for the protein disulfide-isomerase A6, that, beyond its role as a molecular chaperone, able to inhibit aggregation of misfolded proteins, also plays a role in platelet aggregation. VITT03 patient also carries uncertain significance rare variants in AKT1 and NOTCH2 genes. AKT1 gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine protein kinase family. It has been demonstrated to contribute to dendritic cell survival and maturation. Moreover, AKT1 mutations are associated with Proteus syndrome, characterized by an increased risk of thromboembolism. NOTCH2 gene encodes a member of the Notch family, playing a role in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. Data from the literature reported that anti-PF4/heparin antibody production is impaired in B-cell-specific Notch2-deficient mice, lacking marginal zone (MZ) B cells.\n\n    In VITT21 VUS in COL5A1 and LRTM2 loci have been observed; interestingly, the LRTM2 gene encoded the leucine-rich repeat and transmembrane domain-containing protein 2 also involved in heparin binding. Moreover, this patient also displayed a further VUS in the COL5A1 gene, encoding the alpha 1 chain of the type V collagen, able to bind thrombospondin as well as heparin, thus supporting its possible involvement in the clinical phenotype. VITT21 also carries a VUS in the ADAM8 gene. ADAM8 gene encodes a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family, a family of transmembrane glycoproteins with heterogeneous expression profiles and proteolytic, cell-adhesion, -fusion, and -signaling properties. Data from the literature reported that ADAM8 has immunomodulation properties; in particular, it has been observed to be associated with the function of neutrophils during inflammatory responses.\n\n    In conclusion, WES analysis performed in 6 patients with VITT identifies a number of rare variants which are conditions possibly favoring the prothrombotic state triggered by the exposure to the vaccine.\n\n    To the best of our knowledge, no other studies are present in the literature sequencing patients with VITT. Only a recent paper addressed the genetic characteristics of a VITT patient by genotyping more than 870,000 known SNPs in the human genome with an approach not able to identify unknown and rare variants.\n\n    The observation of a burden of VUS for each VITT patient might raise the issue of whether one or more VUS are causative variants, and whether, instead, we should hypothesize a burden of susceptibility genetic factors in the modulation of the clinical phenotype after an acquired condition, such the exposure to adenovirus.\n\n    Data of the present study, to be confirmed and implemented, need functional studies and/or an extension to a larger number of patients, thus allowing a more comprehensive definition of these molecular pathways in modulating clinical manifestations of this condition also in consideration of a possible evaluation of the combined contribution of rare and common variants.",

        "Title": "    Identification of an unknown frameshift variant of NOG in a Han Chinese family with proximal symphalangism",
        "Abstract": "    Proximal symphalangism (SYM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder manifested by ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal joints of fingers, carpal and tarsal bone fusion, and conductive hearing loss in some cases. Herein, we clinically diagnosed a Chinese patient with fusions of the bilateral proximal interphalangeal joints in the 2-5 digits without conductive hearing loss. Family history investigation revealed that his mother and grandfather also suffered from SYM1. Whole exome sequencing was performed to detect the genetic lesion of the family. The candidate gene variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. By data filtering, co-segregation analysis and bioinformatics analysis, we highly suspected that an unknown heterozygous frameshift variant (c.635_636insG, p.Q213Pfs*57) in NOG was responsible for the SYM1 in the family. This variant was predicted to be deleterious and resulted in a prolonged protein. This finding broadened the spectrum of NOG mutations associated with SYM1 and contributed to genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with SYM1.",
        "Introduction": "    Proximal symphalangism (SYM1) is a hereditary disorder manifested by ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal joints, carpal and tarsal bone fusion, and conductive hearing loss in some cases. The typical features of SYM1 are reduced proximal interphalangeal joint space, symphalangism of the 4th and/or 5th finger. The estimated prevalence of SYM1 is less than 1/1000000 with autosomal dominant inherited pattern. And the first family with ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal joints was reported and named as symphalangism in 1916.\n\n    At present, at least two types of SYM1 have been identified in the clinic. One is proximal symphalangism-1A (SYM1A; OMIM 185800), which was caused by genetic variants in NOG (noggin), another is proximal symphalangism-1B (SYM1B; OMIM 615298), which resulted from GDF5 (growth differentiation factor 5) mutations. However, due to the extensive pleiotropy, several other diseases may be also related to NOG, such as tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome, multiple synostoses syndrome, and brachydactyly, etc.. Hence, detection the genetic lesion of the patients with SYM1 may further confirm the clinical diagnosis and help us to understand the development of bone.\n\n    In the present study, we enrolled a family with SYM1 from central south region of China. The aim of the present study was to detect the genetic lesion of the affected individuals by employing whole exome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.",
        "Methods": "    The proband (Figure 1A, III:2) was a 6-year-old boy from a non-consanguineous Chinese family. According to the family history investigation, mother (II:4) and grandfather (I:1) of proband also had the phenotype of limited fingers bilaterally, they may be patients with SYM1. We found the fourth to fifth fingers bilaterally of his mother were limited after preliminary diagnosis. Unfortunately, the proband's mother refused further diagnosis and treatment and grandfather has already passed away. The photographs showed the second to fifth fingers and toes bilaterally of the proband were limited and cannot make a fist (Figure 1B). The radiographs indicated the reduced proximal interphalangeal joint space and further confirmed the clinical diagnosis (Figure 1C). No other significant phenotypes were found, such as hearing loss.\n\n    The Review Board of the Xiangya Hospital of the Central South University approved the present study. Given the proband is too young, written consent forms were signed by his parents as guardians.\n\n    Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood of the patients and other all participants using a DNeasy Blood &Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of all family members by using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.) following the manufacturer's instruction. The central part of the whole exome sequencing was provided by the Novogene Bioinformatics Institute (Beijing, China). The exomes were captured using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kits, and high-throughput sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq X-10. The necessary bioinformatics analyses, including reads, mapping, variant detection, filtering, and annotation, were also endowed by Novogene Bioinformatics Institute.\n\n    The strategies of data filtering refer to our previous study: (a) variants within intergenic, intronic, and UTR regions as well as synonymous mutations were excluded for later analysis; (b) variants with MAF>0.01 in the 1000 Genomes project, dbSNP132 were excluded; (c) variants with MAF>0.01 in genome aggregation database (gnomAD) (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) were further precluded; (d) SIFT, Polyphen-2 and MutationTaster were utilized to predict the possible impacts of variants. (e) Co-segregation analysis was conducted in the family.",
        "Results": "    The WES raw data had a mean depth of 125.66 on target, target region coverage of 98.05%, target region coverage (at least 10x) of 97.27%, indicating the high sequencing quality. After data filtering, only 16 variants were included in Table 1. We then further performed bioinformatic analysis including Inheritance pattern and OMIM clinical phenotypes analysis (https://www.omim.org/), ToppGene gene function analysis (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/) and The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification, we highly suspected the unknown variant (NM_005450, c.635_636insG, p.Q213Pfs*57) of NOG, belonging to PM1, PM2, PM4, PP1, PP3, and PP4 (likely pathogenic) in ACMG guidelines, was the genetic lesion of the family (Figure 2A). The result of co-segregation analysis showed the same unknown variant exist in mother of proband but not in his father. The unknown variant, which led to alteration of amino acid residues after position 212 and a prolonged protein (Figure 2B), was predicted as \"Disease Causing\" (0.99) by MutationTaster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/) and not found on the 1000 Genome Browser, the gnomAD Browser and the Exome Variant Server, and was not presented in 200 control cohorts. Multiple alignment of noggin orthologs in other animal species showed that amino acid sequence after position 212 was highly conserved (Figure 2C).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In the present study, we enrolled a family with SYM1 from China. By employing whole exome sequencing, we identified an unknown frameshift variant (c.635_636insG, p.Q213Pfs*57) in the affected members. The variant resulted in the extension of noggin protein which may affect the function of the protein. Bioinformatics analysis further predicted this variant as disease-causing variant. Our study is consistent with previous studies which indicated that variants in NOG gene may lead to SYM1 and other bone diseases.\n\n    The human NOG gene encoding noggin protein is located on chromosome 17q22, and it consists of one exon, spanning approximately 1.9 kilobases (kb). Noggin, the first identified BMP antagonist, is posttranslationally modified and secreted as a disulfide-bonded homodimer. BMPs play essential roles in skeletogenesis including recruiting mesenchymal cells, promoting mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation into chondroblasts and osteoblasts, and inducing apoptosis to form joints. Noggin can bind to BMPs and inhibit the interactions of BMPs and BMP-specific recptors, and therefore negatively regulates BMP-induces osteogenesis. In the present study, the unknown variant was not located at the interface between the two molecules in noggin-BMP7 complex (SWISS-MODEL Template Library, ID: 1m4u.1), and no templates of sufficient quality to build a homology model were found for the changed sequence (Figure 2B). Whereas, according to the complex model and the prolonged sequence, we suspected the variant presumably affected the binding of noggin homodimer and further disrupt the structure of noggin-BMP7 complex, which actived the BMP signal pathway and lead to bone diseases. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\n    On the basis of reported papers, multiple bone diseases are associated with NOG mutations. For example, at present, over 50 mutations of NOG involved in wide variety of bone development anomalies, including tarsal/carpal coalition syndrome, brachydactyly, multiple synostoses syndrome, stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs and toes, have been reported. Even the same variants of NOG can lead to different phenotypes between different families or different affected members of the same family, see Table 2. Meanwhile, the variant was the sixth unknown variant reported in Chinese population, which indicated there were still a lot of unknown variants to be discovered in Chinese population. Here, we summarized the reported NOG mutations in Table 2, which may make us to understand the function of noggin better.\n\n    In additional to major bone diseases, patients with NOG mutations are often accompanied by other phenotypes, such as conductive hearing loss and hyperopia. In Table 2, we can find that these phenotypes are not always present in the same mutations or in different mutations at the same sites. Besides, in some papers, hearing loss do not exist in all affected members of same families. These results seem to indicate that conductive hearing loss and hyperopia may appear randomly in patients with NOG mutations; whereas, in contrast with most NOG mutations that have been reported in kindreds with SYM1 and SYNS1, the mutations observed in families with stapes ankylosis without SYM1 are predicted to disrupt the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. In short, the relationship between NOG and these phenotypes is still unclear, further research is needed to understand that. Some patients with NOG mutations can also have nasal bone, elbow, shoulder, and spine anomalies except for hands and feet, suggested noggin protein plays an essential and extensive role in bone development.\n\n    In summary, we investigated a Chinese family with SYM1 and an unknown frameshift variant (c.635_636insG, p.Q213Pfs*57) was detected by whole exome sequencing. According to ACMG standards and guidelines, this variant was categorized as likely pathogenic (PM1, PM2, PM4, PP1, PP3 and PP4) and identified as the genetic lesion of the family. Our study expanded the spectrum of NOG mutations and contributed to genetic counseling and diagnosis of patients with SYM1.",

        "Title": "    Long-term prognosis of 35 patients with methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency based on newborn screening in China",
        "Abstract": "    Methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency (MATD) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by mono- or biallelic MAT1A mutations that are not yet well understood. Of the 4,065,644 neonates screened between November 2010 and December 2021, 35 individuals have been diagnosed with an estimated incidence of 1: 116,161 by a cutoff value of methionine 82.7 mumol/L and follow-up over 11 years. MATD patients with autosomal recessive (AR) type had higher clinical and genetic heterogeneity than those with autosomal dominant (AD) type. Fifteen unrelated AD patients harbored one well-known dominant variant, c.791 G>A or c.776 C>T, and were clinically unaffected with a mean plasma methionine (Met) value <300 mumol/L. Twenty AR cases have unique genotypes and presented a wide range of clinical abnormalities from asymptomatic to white matter lesions. Of them, 10 AR patients displayed severe manifestations, such as verbal difficulty, motor delay, development delay, and white matter lesions, with mean Met >500 mumol/L and thereby were treated with a methionine-restricted diet alone or in combination with betaine, folate, or vitamin B6, and were healthy finally. Neurological abnormalities were evidenced in two patients (P16 and P27) with Met values >800 mumol/L by MRI scan. Neurological abnormalities were reversed here by liver transplantation or by the determination of S-adenosylmethionine supplementation. Additionally, 38 variants of MAT1A were distributed within patients and carriers, of which 24 were novel and mostly predicted to be damaged. Our findings with an extensive clinical and genetic dataset provided new insights into its diagnosis and treatment and will be helpful for its optimal management in the future.",
        "Introduction": "    Methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency (MATD, #250850) is a rare metabolic disorder resulting in methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) deficiency, with isolated hypermethioninemia and a low level of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). MATD can be transmitted either as autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) traits in which mono- or biallelic MAT1A variants have been identified, respectively. Although the majority of patients are described as mild or asymptomatic, some cases present with malodorous breath, acrodermatitis enteropathica, or even neurological deficits. To date, MATD has been recommended as a secondary condition in the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). However, it is still unclear whether MATD is a benign genetic disorder. Chien and colleagues found that half of their samples of MATD patients developed neurological symptoms later in life. To advance the understanding of MAT deficiency, scientists and physicians have promoted diagnostic strategies, delineated manifestations and genotypes, and evaluated treatments for MATD worldwide. Nevertheless, the long-term prognosis of MATD, as well as clinical and genetic characteristics, is still limited and incompletely understood. Based on a total of 4,065,644 neonates screened on the NBS program between November 2010 and December 2021, 35 patients with MATD were retrospectively analyzed for clinical symptoms, genotypes, treatment and outcomes of MATD to provide new insight to improve the understanding of MATD and optimal management.",
        "Methods": "    All patients with a diagnosis of MATD and carriers based on newborn screening (NBS) program, genetic testing, and follow-up between November 2010 and December 2021 in Zhejiang Neonatal Screening Center, in which a total of 4,065,644 neonates were screened covering 364 maternity units in 90 counties. All procedures followed were in accordance with approval from the Research Ethics Committees, the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Patient information was tabulated without individual identifiers.\n\n    Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used to detect the concentrations of amino acids and acylcarnitine with dry-spot-blood samples in our NBS center. The reference value of methionine (Met) is 7.18-41.35 mumol/L and the reference range of Phenylalanine (Phe) was 23.3-100 mumol/L. Based on NBS screening data, the cut-off value for Met was set to 82.7 mumol/L, an upper limit of normal values in the 99.9th centile healthy newborns. The cut-off value for the ratio of Met/Phe was 1.1. Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) was considered to be elevated at a concentration above 15 mumol/L. Newborns were recalled due to a higher Met concentration of more than 82.7 mumol/L alone or due to a higher ratio of Met/Phe. If the second test was also positive (Met >82.7 mumol/L or Met/Phe >1.1), the newborn was referred for a gene test. Cases associated with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, tyrosinemia type I, or severe liver diseases were excluded from this study. No other positive results of blood physiological indicators for IEME were detected in MATD patients.\n\n    Next-generation sequencing was carried out by BGI (Shenzheng, China) or by MyGenostics (Beijing, China) during 2010-2015. Other samples were analyzed with a targeted gene panel by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in our Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory at the Children's Hospital as previously described and contained 166 genes involved in an inborn error of metabolism (IEMD, including causative genes associated with MATD (MAT1A, GNMT, and AHCY) and Met-related IEMD, such as homocystinuria (CBS, MTHFR, ABCD4, LMBRD1, MMACHC, MMADHC, CD320, MLYCD, etc.). Sanger sequencing was performed to verify variants detected in the panel. Novel missense variants were evaluated with several automatic tools (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster, CADD, etc.). Variants leading to truncated protein were classified as pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).\n\n    All positive cases were followed up by specialists at the Department of Genetics and Metabolism. Regular intervals ranged from every 1-3 months, depending on the severity of manifestations, and were followed for cases at 1 year and every 3-6 months for cases beyond 1 year. Data from profiles of serum amino acids (including methionine), tHcy, and routine blood tests for the functions of the liver and kidney were monitored regularly during the follow-up. Other indicators, such as blood gases and electrolytes, serum glucose, and lactic acid, were collected irregularly. Bayley Scales of Infant Development, or the Ages-Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) or Gesell Developmental Schedule were used to assess the developmental status of MATD patients. Length/height-for-age and weight-for-age standards were according to China growth standards (0-3 years old) and WHO Child Growth Standards (>3 years old). Some special patients with severe clinical abnormalities or with extreme elevation of plasma Met (>800 mumol/L) were referred to undergo a brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. If suspected cases harbored an unreported variant of MAT1A, the Met value and the ratio of Met/Phe from one parent carrying the same variant were detected.\n\n    Interventions were considered when plasma Met was >500 micromol/Lin infants. A low-methionine formula is usually used. Vitamin B6 and betaine were considered when tHcy increased slightly twice or exceeded 30 mumol/L. One patient was given oral SAMe. One patient underwent liver transplantation.\n\n    Met values were illustrated using GraphPad Prism 8.0. A 2-tail paired or unpaired Student's t-test or ordinary one-way ANOVA was performed for comparisons. p < .05 was considered significant.",
        "Results": "    A total of 4,065,644 neonates were screened and 35 positive cases were diagnosed with MATD, which led to an estimated incidence of 1/116,161 in the MATD cohort of Zhejiang Province, a comparable incidence to that reported in Japanese. Simultaneously, 31 carriers were identified and underwent follow-up who harbored novel heterozygous variants. A statistically significant difference existed in the initial Met concentrations between carriers and patients (p < .001, Figure 1A), of which patients ranged from 60 to 332 mumol/L with a mean value of 145 mumol/L, while carriers ranged from 42 to 98 mumol/L with a mean value of 73 mumol/L. Compared to AD patients, AR patients have more severe phenotypes, such as development delay, verbal difficulty, motor delay, and white matter lesions, and harbor various genotypes (Table 1). All reported variants in MATD were reviewed and are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n    There were 15 unrelated MATD patients (6 male and 9 female patients) diagnosed with a monoallelic variant of MAT1A, of which 11 individuals (P5-P15) carried c.791G>A/p. R264H and four individuals carried c.776C>T/p. A259V. Patient 1 (P1) and patient 9 (P9) were born prematurely, while their mothers' pregnancies were uneventful to that point. Consistent with previous reports, variants c.791G>A and c.776C>T are common in the AD type, with frequencies of 73% (11/15) and 27% (4/15) respectively. Patients harboring c. 776C>T had an initial Met range of 86-132 mumol/L, with a Met/Phe ratio of 1.13-1.85 and normal tHcy. Patients harboring c.791G>A had an initial Met range of 67-339 mumol/L, with a Met/Phe ratio of .92-3.02. However, slight elevations in plasma tHcy were detected among five patients harboring c.791G>A. Patients 1-15 were followed up for 4-111 months with Met levels fluctuating from 36 to 441 mumol/L without significant clinical symptoms. Each of them had normal growth and development without drug treatment during follow-up, while a transient decrease in serum zinc was observed in P7 at 2 years old and P10 at 6 months old. The mean initial Met of these 15 patients was 129 mumol/L, and the mean plasma Met during follow-up was 147 mumol/L (Figure 1B). All AD patients were healthy and had no clinical sequelae.\n\n    Twenty cases (17 male and 3 female patients) of AR-type MATD were diagnosed with persistently high plasma Met concentrations and compound heterozygous or homozygous variants of MAT1A without other pathogenic genes in this metabolic disorder. All patients were full-term infants. Compared to AD patients, AR patients have more complicated phenotypes and genotypes. The initial Met concentrations in 20 AR cases ranged from 60 to 332 mumol/L, with a mean value of 157 mumol/L (Table 1). No significant difference was exhibited in the initial Met concentrations between the AD and AR groups. However, the plasma Met values, during follow-up, had a wider range from 41 to 1408 mumol/L with a mean value of 479 mumol/L (Figure 1B), which was higher than that of Met in either AD type (147 mumol/L) or carriers (80 mumol/L). During follow-up, increased Met levels were usually paralleled with elevated Met/Phe ratio (.94-44.7) and tHcy (13.0-65.5 mumol/L). Ten patients had plasma Met levels exceeding 800 mumol/L at least once during follow-up (Figure 1C) and then intervened with low-Met formula, diets appropriate for their ages without an excess of proteins, or drug administration. According to their latest evaluation, they had normal growth and development. A wider range of phenotypes were presented in these 10 patients, such as increased liver enzymes, verbal difficulty, motor delay, advanced bone age, developmental delay, and white matter lesions (Table 1). All these clinical symptoms were temporarily observed. Additionally, acidosis, hyperammonemia, or hypoglycemia were absent during follow-up, irrespective of infection. However, we also found asymptomatic cases harboring biallelic MAT1A variants. For example, P34, harboring novel compound heterozygous variants c.547C>G/p. Q183E and c.242G>A/p. R81Q had an initial Met 60 mumol/L that was below the cut-off value (81.7 mumol/L), a negative result according to biochemical indicators in NBS.\n\n    As MATD is a rare metabolic disorder with a limited population, detailed records of patients with neurological abnormalities are important evidence for better management of other cases in the future. Here, five patients with a Met value >800 mumol presented as follows: patients P16, P25, P27, and P31 had neurological abnormalities, and P35 carried 3 alleles with the same allele (c.695C>T/p. P232L) in P16.\n\n    Patient 16 clinically best fits with the autosomal recessive biallelic population that only one de novo variant c.695 C>T/p. P232L identified. Further evaluation of the intronic allele is needed. He had an initial Met 257 mumol/L, a high ratio of Met/Phe 4.58, and elevated plasma tHcy (59 mumol/L) with persistent hypermethioninaemia during follow-up. The recall Met was increased to 1283 mumol/L in the first month of life. Immediately, a diet with restricted protein and vitamin B6 was prescribed. At 2 months of age, the low-Met formula was added at a ratio of 5:1 to ordinary infant milk powder. The plasma Met levels during treatment were maintained at 403-599 mumol/L with a slight elevation of tHcy 17.6-19.0 mumol/L. At 20 months old, he had an intelligence score of 82 and an action score of 92 according to the Bailey Scale of Infant Development (BSID). Due to difficulties in persisting in a low-met restriction diet when grown, Met levels fluctuated within 1110-1165 mumol/L after 3 years of age. At age 7 years 9 m, brain MRI examination revealed a large range of abnormally high intensity in T2-weighted images with a reduced diffusion of white matter (Figure 2A), which has been observed in patients with phenylketonuria and glutaric aciduria type I. We then were told that he had liver transplantation at the age of 8 years 1 m in another hospital. After transplantation, he picked up the normal diet and had a plasma Met of 74.2 mumol/L, 78.5 mumol/L, and 109.6 mumol/L at ages 8 years 4 m, 8 years 7 m, and 10 years 11 m, respectively. The mean plasma Met dramatically dropped from 844.1 mumol/L to 96.9 mumol/L (Figure 2B). Strikingly, the white matter lesions were gradually reversed to normal after the operation.\n\n    Patient 25 was homozygous for a novel variant c.875G>T/p. R292L with transient verbal difficulty and weakness in the right foot when walking. She had a remarkable increase in Met levels of 921 mumol/L when recalled for confirmation and then started on a mixture of low-Met formula and breastfeeding with betaine and folate. The Met value dropped to 599 mumol/L at 8 m of age. However, she could not adhere to the Met-restricted diet after 1 year of age. Fluctuated Met (628-850 mumol/L) values were observed with intermittent interventions. However, her development status was normal on the ASQ test, and both height and weight were P75 at follow-up at the age of 42 m.\n\n    Patient 27 was homozygous for a reported variant c.769G>A/p. G257R with persistent hypermethioninaemia. During the first 3 months of life, his Met values were persistent at 1069, 1097, and 1408 mumol/L, respectively, with a low-Met formula diet. At the age of 10 m, he had a motor delay with a gross motor score of 10 and a fine motor score of five on the ASQ evaluation. After SAMe supplementation and rehabilitation training, his ASQ score climbed to normal at 48 m of age, with a gross motor score of 60 and a body weight of P50. However, MRI showed mild hyperintense T2-weighted images in the white matter of cerebral hemispheres and widened bilateral frontotemporal extracerebral space (Figure 2C) at 4 years 11 m of age with a Met level of 839 mumol/L.\n\n    Patient 31 had compound heterozygous variants, c.769G>A/p. G257R and c.875G>T/p. R292L. With a Met-restricted diet, his Met was decreased from 977 mumol/L at age 1 m to 159 mumol/L at age 5 m and then manifested <500 mol/L. A transient development delay was observed at age 2 years, with a developmental quotient of 68 by the Gesell system, but disappeared at follow-up with a P50 score in both his height and weight at 5 years 10 m.\n\n    Patient 35 harbored three alleles, a paternal c.695C>T/p. P232L variant and two novel maternal variants c.608T>A/p. I203N and c.922G>C/p. A308P, with an initial Met of 183 mol/L. his Met value was 600 mumol/L and then increased to 808 mumol/L at the age of 2 m. Given low Met intake and betaine treatment, the Met fluctuated between 543-595 mumol/L until the age of 13 m, with normal growth and development. However, his Met increased up to 713-982 mumol/L after the protein restriction diet was discontinuous. Both his height and weight were P75 as of follow-up at the age of 108 m.\n\n    Genetic characteristics in the AR type were more heterogeneous than the dominant type. Biallelic variants were genotyped in 18 patients, and three alleles occurred in P35. Sixteen patients harbored compound heterozygotes, while only 3 patients carried homozygotes, homozygous c.1070C>T/p. R357L in P22, homozygous c.875G>T/p. R292L in P25, and homozygous c.769G>A/p. G257R in P27 (Table 1). Surprisingly, each patient had a unique genotype. A total of 26 variants were identified, including 24 missense variants and two truncating variants (c.38dupT/p. L13Lfs*15 and c.765_768del CCAG/p. P255Pfs*35) and distributed randomly in genes and protein domains, except in exons 2 and 9 (Figure 3A). Notably, 17 novel variants in patients were found and predicted by automatic tools (Supplementary Table S2), of which c.242G>A/p. R81Q occurred in two asymptomatic individuals (P33 and P34), indicating a benign protein function as prediction in silico. However, the novel truncating variants were postulated to be pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) according to ACMG recommendations. Most variants had high conservation in mammals (Figure 3B). Variants distributed in patients as c.188G>T/p. G63V in five individuals, c.895C>T/p. R299G in four individuals, c.769G>A, c.875G>T, and c.242G>A in two individuals each, and others appeared once.\n\n    Thirty-one carriers (21 females and 10 males) were detected by the cutoff index in NBS, as shown in Table 2. Three carriers, C2, C14, and C25, were born prematurely. As shown in Figure 1, the initial Met values of each carrier were <100 mumol/L, ranging from 45 to 95 mumol/L with a mean value of 73 mumol/L. Six previously reported variants occurred in 18 individuals, distributed as c.1070C>T in eight individuals, c.769G>A in five individuals, c.773A>G in two individuals, and c.188G>T, c.271G>C and c.964A>G each in one child. Intriguingly, 8 novel variants were detected in 13 individuals, including one splicing and eight missense variants, of which c.181A>C/p.K61Q appeared in both carrier (C6) and patient (P20) as a recessive variant (Supplementary Table S2). As it is difficult to distinguish whether the novel variants were pathogenic in the dominant type or not, parents were advised to perform gene testing and Met assays to check whether parents harboring the same novel variant have a normal Met value. As shown in Table 2, parents' Met values harboring novel variants ranged from 19-50 mumol/L with a low ratio of Met/Phe (<1.1) and were healthy, indicating those 6 novel variants, c.67G>A, c.181A>C, c.251G>C, c.292 + 5G>A, c.748T>C, c.748T>C, and c.855G>C, were transmitted as recessive type. Unfortunately, the parents harboring c.179G>A/p. C60Y or c.180C>G/p. C60W did not consent to the test. Cautiously, to avoid missing any AD cases, all carriers were followed up until the Met value was <50 mumol/L, or the Met value decreased continuously at the next three tests after NBS. Interestingly, most of the carriers had normal Met values <50 mumol/L by the age of 10 m, and their growth and development statuses were normal and healthy.",

        "Discussion": "    In this retrospective study, we described the phenotypes, genotypes, and long-term prognosis of 35 patients with MATD based on newborn screening, with an estimated incidence of 1:116,161, consistent with previous reports in Asia. Newborn screening is non-substitutable to identify patients with severe MATD, which should be considered a routine metabolic disorder in the screening system in our country. The Met value is the best primary marker for both diagnosis and prognosis, though initial Met values in MATD patients are somewhat overlapped with carriers. Patients with plasma Met levels >800 mumol/L should be treated in a timely manner. However, no excessive intervention will be needed for patients with plasma Met levels <500 mumol/L during follow-up, while the careful follow-up to monitor the Met value and Met/Phe ratio regularly was the main parameter for optimal care. Our data also showed that AR patients had higher phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity than AD patients. Twenty AR cases have unique genotypes and presented a wide range of clinical abnormalities from asymptomatic to white matter lesions. Neurological abnormalities were reversed here by liver transplantation or by the determination of SAMe. Moreover, 24 novel variants were identified in patients and carriers, including two truncating alleles (c.38dupT/p.L13Lfs*15, c.765_768delCCAG/p.P255Pfs*35) and a benign one (c.242G>A/p.R81Q).\n\n    Nevertheless, the Met value is still the best primary marker for both diagnosis and prognosis. The initial value of the Met and Met/Phe ratio is not correlated with neurological abnormalities in this MATD cohort. However, a significant difference was found in the initial Met levels between patients and carriers. Similarly, significant differences were presented in mean plasma Met values during follow-up among AD-type patients (147 mumol/L), AR-type patients (479 mumol/L), and carriers (80 mumol/L). The high level of plasma Met is correlated with the severity of the disease to a certain extent. Patients with plasma Met values >800 mumol/L had neurological abnormalities as shown in P16 and P27 as elsewhere. Additionally, 24 patients with a mean value <300 mumol/L were clinically unaffected. Retrospectively, 10 individuals with interventions had higher fluctuations in plasma Met, as illustrated in Figure 1C. To limit the effect of treatment on the plasma Met value, we reappraised the mean Met values among patients and carriers based on the first 3 records by 4 months of age for comparison. The mean Met values in 10 therapeutic patients (795 mumol/L) were significantly different from those in the other 25 patients (Figure 4), indicating that the baseline value of Met for treatment was approximately 500 mumol/L. Patients P16 and P27 with white matter lesions had the highest mean plasma Met values of 1038 and 1191 mumol/L, respectively.\n\n    Methionine restriction was most useful for managing plasma Met values in our patients as well as SAMe supplementation. The Met-restricted diet was considered when plasma Met >500 mumol/L and was effective to decrease the plasma Met levels in AR patients here. Moreover, the Met value fluctuated to more than 800 mumol/L again when the protein restriction diet was discontinuous in patients P16, P25, and P35. Specifically, P27 was substantially unresponsive to a Met-restricted diet with persistent hypermethioninaemia and high Met levels >800 mumol/L by the age of 10 m. SAMe administration thereby was taken with a 400 mg/d dose and improved the development delay, with the gross motor score climbing from five at age 12 m to 60 at age 48 m. Although P27 was normal in physical and mental development, a mild hyperintense of T2-weighted images in white matter was still visualized in the brain MRI. Similar phenotypes were described in some older children with previous diagnoses of MATD. In this study, transplantation dramatically reversed the leukodystrophy situation, with a sheer decrease in mean plasma Met without dietary restriction from 844.1 mumol/L to 96.9 mumol/L in P16.\n\n    AR patients here had higher phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity than AD patients. The heterozygosity c.776C>T or c.791G>A surely caused no adverse long-range clinical effects on its patients. However, AR patients present a wide range of clinical symptoms, from asymptomatic to white matter lesions, which may partly be due to the complexity of genetic aetiology. More than 80 variants (Supplementary Table S1) have been reported according to available worldwide data since the molecular basis of the disease was established. In the present study, we identified 38 variants distributed within patients and carriers, of which 24 were novel and predicted to be mostly damaged to protein function, except variant c.242G>A/p.R81Q, which has been previously classified as a variant of uncertain significance (variant reference 431706 In ClinVar). Two patients, P33 and P34, harboring the c.242G>A variant are asymptomatic, indicating that c.242G>A is benign. As each of the AR patients had unique genotypes, it was challenging to predict the relationship between clinical phenotype and genotype. P22 with a homozygous genotype [c.1070 C>T]; [c.1070 C>T] was clinically unaffected, implying that c.1070 C>T is benign. Alleles c.695C>T, c.875G>T, and c.769 G>A were supposed to be deleterious on protein function as patients P16, P25, P27, and P31 harbored one or two of them had neurological abnormalities. Patients (P19 and P32) carrying truncating variants had plasma Met >800 mumol/L more than once during follow-up. However, more cases were needed to evaluate the relationship between genotype and phenotype.\n\n    Here, our long-term prognostic data will be helpful for better understanding the natural history of MATD and optimal management for cases in the future. However, there were some limitations: 1) the detection of SAMe levels in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients was not performed; 2) whether the dose of the SAMe was dependent on weight or Met values was not clear; 3) limited by the small number of MATD patients and higher genetic heterogeneity, the relationship between phenotype and genotype is mostly undefined.",

        "Title": "    A Multicenter Study Evaluating the Discontinuation of Eculizumab Therapy in Children with Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Background: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which has been treated successfully with eculizumab. The optimal duration of eculizumab in treating patients with aHUS remains poorly defined. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study in the Arabian Gulf region for children of less than 18 years of age who were diagnosed with aHUS and who discontinued eculizumab between June 2013 and June 2021 to assess the rate and risk factors of aHUS recurrence. Results: We analyzed 28 patients with a clinical diagnosis of aHUS who had discontinued eculizumab. The most common reason for the discontinuation of eculizumab was renal and hematological remission (71.4%), followed by negative genetic testing (28.6%). During a median follow-up period of 24 months after discontinuation, 8 patients (28.5%) experienced HUS relapse. The risk factors of recurrence were positive genetic mutations (p = 0.020). On the other hand, there was no significant relationship between the relapse and age of presentation, the need for acute dialysis, the duration of eculizumab therapy before discontinuation, or the timing of eculizumab after the presentation. Regarding the renal outcomes after discontinuation, 23 patients were in remission with normal renal function, while 4 patients had chronic kidney disease (CKD) (three of them had pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) before discontinuation, and one case developed a new CKD after discontinuation) and one patient underwent transplantation. Conclusions: The discontinuation of eculizumab in patients with aHUS is not without risk; it can result in HUS recurrence. Eculizumab discontinuation can be performed with close monitoring of the patients. It is essential to assess risk the factors for relapse before eculizumab discontinuation, in particular in children with a positive complement variant and any degree of residual CKD, as HUS relapse may lead to additional loss of kidney function. Resuming eculizumab promptly after relapse is effective in most patients.",
        "Introduction": "    Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, life-threatening form of TMA that is caused by uncontrolled complement activation in the alternative pathway (AP). It is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and evidence of endothelial cell destruction, which result in ischemic end-organ damage. Genetic defects in complement-related factors or acquired autoantibodies to complement factors have been found in 50 to 60% of patients. The initial therapy for aHUS is supportive, focusing on managing acute kidney injury and systemic complications. Plasma exchange and eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, offer specific forms of treatment. Eculizumab, the first approved treatment for patients with aHUS, is a humanized monoclonal complement inhibitor that binds to C5, preventing its cleavage to C5a and C5b and the subsequent activation of the complement terminal pathway (TP) and membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. Eculizumab has profoundly changed the outcomes for patients with aHUS compared with other traditional options, such as plasma therapy. The necessary duration of eculizumab treatment in aHUS is unknown. The European Commission's Summary of Product Characteristics and the Food and Drug Administration's Full Prescribing Information, both released in 2014, do not take a stance on the treatment duration. The reasons for discontinuing eculizumab therapy reported in the literature are the protection of patients from the risk of the potentially devastating side effects of meningococcal infection, the requirement for repeated infusions, and the high cost of treatment. There is a substantial risk of relapse when stopping eculizumab in patients with aHUS. Selected groups of patients appear to discontinue eculizumab and remain relapse-free for several years. This study aims to report the rate and risk factors for the relapse and renal outcome of the patients after discontinuation",
        "Methods": "    A retrospective multicenter study for the period from June 2013 to June 2021 was carried out across five countries in the Arabian Gulf region, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (5 centers) and the United Arab Emirates (2 centers), and in one center in each of Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. Patients were included in the study if they were under 18 years of age, were diagnosed with aHUS (first episode or relapse), received at least two months of eculizumab treatment before discontinuation, and had at least six months of follow-up after the initial eculizumab discontinuation unless HUS recurred sooner. Patients on chronic dialysis (defined as three months' of dialysis) at the time of discontinuation and patients with other causes of thrombotic microangiopathy, including infection with Shiga-toxin-producing bacteria; a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) deficiency; and conditions associated with secondary HUS (malignancy, malignant hypertension, the use of drugs, autoimmune diseases, infections, cobalamin C deficiency, transplantation, and pregnancy) were excluded. Primary aHUS was defined by at least two of the following criteria: (i) thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000 9/L); (ii) mechanical hemolytic anemia (Hb < 10 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum level > upper limit of normal, low haptoglobin, and the presence of schistocytes on blood smear); (iii) acute kidney injury (serum creatinine upper limit of normal for age or increased >25% compared to baseline).\n\n    The diagnosis of relapse was based on the criteria of the initial diagnosis of aHUS. Remission (at the time of eculizumab discontinuation) was defined as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) < 1.5 upper limit of normal, the absence of hemolysis (hemoglobin started to increase or returned to baseline), platelet count > 150,000 9/L, and serum creatinine decreased by 25% compared with baseline. The data collected were on the demographic information, clinical history, laboratory investigations (hemoglobin, platelets, reticulocytes count, blood smear, LDH, haptoglobin, serum creatinine, C3, C4, complement factor H, I, B, CH50/AHA50 level, blood culture, urine culture, urine for protein/creatinine ratio), renal biopsy findings, genetic studies, the timing of eculizumab (after presentation), requirement of acute dialysis before eculizumab therapy, the duration of eculizumab before discontinuation, reason for the discontinuation of eculizumab therapy, follow-up time after discontinuation, laboratory results at the time of the discontinuation of eculizumab and thereafter, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the last visit after discontinuation, relapse after discontinuation, possible trigger for new HUS recurrence episode, timing of starting eculizumab after relapse, trial of discontinuation after treatment relapse episode, and outcome after discontinuation. The CKD was defined based on the KDIGO definition 2012.\n\n    The data were saved in a password-protected Excel folder, with only the investigators having access to the data. The patient information remained confidential, with all identifiers removed from the stored data. IRB approval was obtained from all contributing centers.\n\n    All data analyses were performed using Statistical Packages for Software Sciences (SPSS) version 21 (Armonk, New York, NY, USA, IBM Corporation). The descriptive statistics are presented using counts and proportions (%). A p-value cutoff point of 0.05 at 95% CI was used to determine the statistical significance. The research team performed the statistical association and calculation process; special software may have been used during the analysis. To compare patients with vs. without relapse, continuous variables were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and categorical variables were tested using Fisher's exact test. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival was performed",
        "Results": "    Twenty-eight patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 3.47 years (SD +- 2.96), with the majority being males (70.4%). Eleven patients (39.2%) had a positive family history of the disease, while twenty (71.4%) patients had positive consanguinity. The mean values for the presentation of hemoglobin, platelets, and LDH were 8.1 g/dL, 84.5 109/L, and 2106 U/L, respectively. Almost 50% of patients received eculizumab during the first four days of presentation, while 35.7% of patients received eculizumab after four days. Acute dialysis was required in 64.3% of the children before the initiation of eculizumab. After receiving eculizumab, 82.1% (n = 23) showed complete remission. The median duration of eculizumab treatment before discontinuation was 12 months. Seven (25%) patients had received eculizumab therapy for 12 to 24 months, while 6 (21.4%) patients had received eculizumab for 24-48 months and the same percentage had received eculizumab for >3-6 months. The remaining patients had variable durations (Table 1).\n\n    The most common reason for the discontinuation of eculizumab therapy was that the patient was in remission (71.4%), followed by negative genetic testing (28.6%). Other reasons included family preference (10.7%), DGKE mutation (10.7%), and loss to follow-up (7.4%). The median follow-up after discontinuation was 24 months.\n\n    Of the 28 patients, sixteen (57.2%) showed positive genetic testing results. Eleven (39.2%) patients showed no genetic mutation, and one (3.6%) had no genetic testing done (Table 2).\n\n    CFHR1 and CFHR3 mutations were reported in 5 patients (17.8%). Only one of them relapsed after 12 months of discontinuation. Three patients (10.7%) had DGKE mutations, and one of them relapsed after 12 months of discontinuation. Two patients (7.1%) had combined mutations, one of them had combined MCP/CD46 and CFHR1, CFHR3 mutations, the other patient had CFI and CFB mutations; both relapsed after 3 months of discontinuation. MCP/CD46 mutations were reported in two patients (7.1%); one experienced a relapse after 15 months of eculizumab discontinuation. CFH mutations were reported in two patients (7.1%); one had a relapse after 2 months of discontinuation. The only patient with a C3 mutation (3.5%) relapsed after 3 months of discontinuation. Eleven patients (39.2%) had no detected mutations; one of them had a relapse after 2 months of discontinuation. One patient underwent no genetic testing without a history of relapse (Figure 1)\n\n    Eight (28.5%) patients experienced HUS relapse after the discontinuation of eculizumab. Seven of them (25%) had a detected gene mutation. During a median follow-up period of 24 months after discontinuation, most of the patients (75%) restarted eculizumab within 24-48 h. The median time to HUS relapse after discontinuation was 3 months. We observed that 5 patients experienced a relapse within 1 to 3 months, with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) being the most common triggering factor. None of the patients required dialysis at the time of relapse. All of the patient's hematological and renal functions returned to pre-cessation values following the resumption of eculizumab after HUS relapse. The prevalence of no relapse was significantly more common among those with no mutation (p = 0.020). On the other hand, there was no significant relationship between relapse and the need for acute dialysis (p value 0.669), the duration of eculizumab therapy before discontinuation (p value 0.230), the timing of eculizumab after the presentation (p value 0.252), the GFR (p value 0.43), the protein/creatinine ratio (p value 0.700), or the C3 level at the time of discontinuation (p value 0.678) (Table 3).\n\n    There were no significant differences in the rates of relapse according to the types of gene mutations (p > 0.05) (Table 4).\n\n    Additionally, there were no significant differences in the relapse times between males and females (mean relapse time for males was 7.84 months, compared to 8.50 months for females). The overall mean time to relapse was 8.04 months. According to the log-rank, it was revealed that X2 = 0.143, p = 0.705 (Figure 2).\n\n    Following discontinuation, all patients who relapsed achieved remission after resuming eculizumab, and none of them progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Table 5).\n\n    Five patients showed HUS recurrence episodes once, and 2 patients were subjected to another trial of discontinuation after the relapse episodes were treated. Regarding the renal outcomes, 23 patients were in remission with normal renal function (including 12 (52%) patients who underwent a positive genetic study, and 10 (43.7%) patients with no detected gene mutation), 4 patients had chronic kidney disease (CKD) (three patients had pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) before discontinuation, and one had a DKGE mutation and developed a new CKD after discontinuation), while one patient underwent transplantation",
        "Conclusion": "    Our study supports the possibility of discontinuing eculizumab treatment in children with aHUS, but this decision may depend on identified gene mutations. The majority of children in our cohort remained in remission after the discontinuation of eculizumab.\n\n    A full assessment of the risk factors before the decision to discontinue eculizumab is essential, with parents being involved in the decision. Resuming eculizumab immediately after relapse is crucial and effective in most patients. In this study, although relapses happened, resuming eculizumab therapy was effective in controlling the disease.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    Our study describes one of the largest pediatric aHUS populations. The majority of previously published aHUS studies included both adult and pediatric patients and focused mainly on eculizumab therapy rather than its discontinuation with the consideration of its association with gene mutations at the same time. Eculizumab is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for patients with aHUS. It has been reported that eculizumab discontinuation is possible and safe in children with aHUS. Several factors reported in the literature should be considered, as they might be associated with the risk of disease progression after discontinuation, such as the age at first presentation, previous TMA manifestations, the prevalence of extrarenal manifestations, and the post-transplantation setting. We did not find in our study an association between the previous factors and risks for disease progression after eculizumab discontinuation.\n\n    The reasons for treatment discontinuation include both medical and economical concerns as well as patient requests. In our study, the most common reason for the discontinuation of eculizumab therapy was that patients experienced remission and their conditions were stable or they were negative for genetic mutations.\n\n    Sixteen (57.2%) patients in this study showed positive genetic testing results, possibly reflected in the high consanguinity percentage (71.4%). The risk of aHUS relapse following eculizumab discontinuation is mainly determined by the presence or absence of gene mutations. Similarly, in our study, seven (87.5%) of the 8 relapsed patients had a detected gene mutation, while patients with no relapse were more likely to have no genetic mutation. Some reports suggest a potential relationship between the type of complement mutation identified and the risk of subsequent clinical manifestations of HUS. Patients with CFH and MCP/CD46 variant mutations appear to be at higher risk of recurrence. Patients with CFH or THBD/CD141 mutations had the earliest onset of aHUS and the highest mortality rates, whereas patients with MCP/CD46 mutations were associated with the least severe outcomes, but there was no significant relationship that could be identified between the type of mutation and the risk of HUS relapse in our study, which may be related to the differences in the background genetics of our population.\n\n    However, the time to recurrence was longer in this study (median of 3 months) than in the study by Ardissino et al. (<6 weeks) and equal to that in the study by Macia et al., but it was shorter than that in the study by Ariceta et al. (median of 5 months). The current literature reports that the rates of HUS recurrence after eculizumab discontinuation are between 22% and 31%, while in our study, eight patients (28.5%) experienced HUS relapse after discontinuation, making the identification of at-risk patients essential. Contrary to other studies, where patients experiencing HUS recurrence had a shorter duration of treatment, the durations of eculizumab therapy in our study were similar between patients who did and did not suffer HUS recurrence.\n\n    When HUS occurs after discontinuation, restarting eculizumab can prevent further HUS manifestations. Vilalta et al. reported HUS manifesting eight weeks after missing a single eculizumab dose. The rates of eculizumab discontinuation and re-initiation have also been reported for 296 patients receiving eculizumab in the global aHUS Registry. In patients aged <18 years, 28 (24%) discontinued treatment, of whom 7 (25%) restarted eculizumab treatment. Similarly, in our study, of all eight patients who relapsed, eculizumab was restarted within 24-48 h in the majority of them. Most of the patients who relapsed achieved remission after resuming eculizumab. However, it has been reported that the restart of eculizumab could not prevent the deterioration of renal function, HUS recurrence, or subsequent ESKD. We observed that 5 patients had a relapse within 1-3 months, with upper respiratory tract infection being the most common triggering factor for a new recurrence. It remains a debate between researchers about the safety and feasibility of the discontinuation of eculizumab therapy. In a selected group of patients, a trial of gradual discontinuation by lengthening the dosing interval of eculizumab seems to be a reasonable and safe alternative to the indefinite continuation of the drug. In this study, eleven of our patients underwent eculizumab dose spacing prior to complete discontinuation. We emphasize the importance of the previously suggested recommendation by other studies that in the case of discontinuation, patient education regarding early HUS symptoms should be ensured, along with regular urine dipsticks to monitor hematuria and proteinuria. Additionally, if possible, regular blood tests to monitor hemoglobin, platelet, serum creatinine, and LDH levels are crucial. If HUS recurrence is suspected, eculizumab should be rapidly reinitiated.\n\n    The outcome after discontinuation in this study was fairly good, with the majority of children remaining in remission with normal kidney function, which is better than a previous report by Ariceta et al., as 8.0% of their patients progressed to ESKD. This study had limitations that should be noted, including the retrospective nature of the study and the varying observation intervals. However, we have reported on the whole pediatric aHUS population in the Arabian Gulf region spanning over 9 years, and to the best of our knowledge this is one of the largest studies in a pediatric population.",

        "Title": "    Functional Classification of TP53 Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations of the TP53 gene occur in a subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and confer an exceedingly adverse prognosis. However, whether different types of TP53 mutations exert a uniformly poor outcome has not been investigated yet. Here, we addressed this issue by analyzing data of 1537 patients intensively treated within protocols of the German-Austrian AML study group. We classified TP53 mutations depending on their impact on protein structure and according to the evolutionary action (EAp53) score and the relative fitness score (RFS). In 98/1537 (6.4%) patients, 108 TP53 mutations were detected. While the discrimination depending on the protein structure and the EAp53 score did not show a survival difference, patients with low-risk and high-risk AML-specific RFS showed a different overall survival (OS; median, 12.9 versus 5.5 months, p = 0.017) and event-free survival (EFS; median, 7.3 versus 5.2 months, p = 0.054). In multivariable analyses adjusting for age, gender, white blood cell count, cytogenetic risk, type of AML, and TP53 variant allele frequency, these differences were statistically significant for both OS (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.15-4.0; p = 0.017) and EFS (HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.06-3.69; p = 0.033). We conclude that the AML-specific RFS is of prognostic value in patients with TP53-mutated AML and a useful tool for therapeutic decision-making.",
        "Introduction": "    Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous aggressive malignancy occurring de novo, secondary to antecedent hematological disorders, or following cytotoxic treatments for a primary disease. It is the most common acute leukemia in adults with an annual age-adjusted incidence rate of 3.5/100,000 men and women rising to 15-20/100,000 above the age of 60 years. Extensive work over the last decade employing next generation sequencing technologies has decoded the AML genome. The pathogenesis of AML represents a multistep process involving mutagenesis, epigenetic dysregulation, and formation of copy number aberrations. Thereby, initial genetic aberrations transform hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into preleukemic stem cells (preLSCs) that retain their capability to differentiate into normal blood cells. While preLSCs do not generate leukemia in vivo, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) representing a distinct population with self-renewal capacity are capable to induce and perpetuate leukemia. Importantly, in the vast majority of AMLs, multiple and diverse genetic subclones are observed.\n\n    Although novel targeted treatment approaches have been developed for patients with AML, their prognosis is still dismal with 5-year-survival rates of 40%-45% in patients below the age of 65 years and less than 20% in patients aged 65 years or older. Relapsed disease as a consequence of diverse molecular aberrations affecting dormant LSCs is the main reason for this dismal outcome. In AML, parameters influencing treatment decisions as well as outcome include both patient-specific characteristics and leukemia-specific aberrations. Among the former, patient s age and comorbidities are important variables; among the latter, the type of leukemia, white blood cell count, and genetic aberrations significantly influence response to induction therapy, type of consolidation treatment, and survival. An AML risk classification scheme based on cytogenetic abnormalities was proposed as early as in 1998. In the updated 2017 risk stratification of the European Leukemia Net (ELN), mutational aberrations play an increasingly important role. Mutated NPM1 as well as bi-allelic CEBPA mutations constitute favorable-risk parameters. Furthermore, the allelic burden of FLT3-internal tandem duplications was included as a prognostic parameter as assessed in a semi-quantitative manner. Importantly, mutations in the TP53, RUNX1 and ASXL1 genes, respectively, arose as novel, adverse risk factors.\n\n    Encoded by the tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene on chromosome 17p13.1, p53 is an essential cellular protein with response to cellular stress being one of its main functions. It is expressed in HSPCs modulating quiescence and self-renewal thereby contributing to a constant lifelong pool of blood cells. Aberrations of TP53 are encountered in more than 50% of human malignancies. Thereby, the contribution of this gene towards tumorigenesis encompasses loss of wild type alleles and/or TP53 mutations with certain mutant alleles exerting either dominant-negative or novel \"gain-of-function\" properties distinct from the null genotype. Germline TP53 mutations characterize the Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndromes conveying familial cancer predisposition with autosomal-dominant inheritance. We described deleterious germline TP53 mutations in patients with AML, preferably in therapy-related subtypes developing after ionizing irradiation. In AML, somatically acquired TP53 mutations constitute early events characterizing preLSCs. They have been demonstrated to occur at a frequency of up to 10% in de novo cases, more than 20% in therapy-related myeloid leukemias, and up to 90% in erythroleukemias. The majority of TP53 aberrations represent missense mutations, in a number of cases accompanied by loss of the wild type allele. Most importantly, AML patients with TP53 mutations show resistance to intensive treatment strategies, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with 3-year overall survival rates between 0% and 15%. Recently, a dismal outcome has also been described when TP53 mutations occur in leukemic subclones with a variant allele frequency (VAF) of less than 20%.\n\n    However, it is largely unknown whether different types of TP53 mutations:missense, nonsense, splice site mutations, as well as small insertions and deletions:exert a uniformly poor outcome in patients with AML. In this study, we investigated the prognostic impact of different TP53 mutations using four TP53-specific functional scoring systems in a large cohort of intensively treated patients of the German-Austrian AML study group (AMLSG). We demonstrate that the AML-specific \"Relative Fitness Score\" (RFS) is capable of discriminating patients showing a significantly different overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS), thereby serving as a novel tool for therapeutic decision-making.",
        "Methods": "    The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany (vote number 148/10) and registered under \"ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00146120\". It was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, all the patients gave written informed consent. A list of study investigators and centers is provided in the Supplementary Material.\n\n    The AMLSG cohort analyzed consisted of 1537 patients with newly diagnosed AML (de novo AML, n = 1408; secondary AML, n = 61; therapy-related AML, n = 68) who received intensive treatments, including allogeneic HSCT within three multicenter clinical trials. Treatment protocols, patient characteristics, and outcome data have been reported previously. Briefly, in trial AML-HD98A, 627 patients aged 18 to 65 years received induction therapy with idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide (ICE). High-risk subjects were offered allogeneic HSCT, intermediate-risk subjects:either allogeneic HSCT from a suitable related donor or, alternatively, intensive chemotherapy, and low-risk subjects received intensive chemotherapy. Trial AMLSG 07-04 had a similar design to AML-HD98A and included 737 patients aged 18 to 61 years who were randomized to induction therapy with ICE or ICE/all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Trial AML-HD98B included 173 patients aged 58 to 84 years who were randomized to ICE or ICE/ATRA induction therapy with further treatment based on response.\n\n    Diagnostic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) specimens were collected at the University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany, at study entry and processed by the Ficoll density gradient centrifugation to enrich for mononuclear cells (BM, n = 579; PB, n = 800; unknown, n = 158). In this respect, it is important to emphasize that the mutational landscape is conserved in PB specimens of patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndromes at diagnosis and during treatment, respectively. Genomic DNA was analyzed by a targeted sequencing approach focusing on 111 genes associated with myeloid neoplasms as described previously. With respect to TP53, all coding exons and flanking exon-intron boundaries were sequenced. The median coverage for TP53 was 157x, and the lower limit of detection was set at 5% mutant allele reads. Sequencing results were deposited in the European Genome-Phenome Archive (, accession number EGAS0000100275).\n\n    To assess the functional impact of TP53 mutations in AML, we investigated four different TP53-specific scoring systems. First, we compared the impact of missense TP53 mutations versus all other types of mutations:nonsense and splice site mutations, as well as small insertions and deletions. This classification is based on the fact that novel gain-of-function properties may predominantly be associated with missense mutations. Next, we analyzed whether the location of a particular TP53 mutation and the amino acid alteration is of prognostic value in our AML cohort, as this had previously been demonstrated for patients with solid tumors. Therefore, \"disruptive mutations\" were classified as DNA sequence alterations that introduce a STOP sequence resulting in disruption of p53 protein production or DNA sequence alterations that occur within the L2 or L3 binding domains (codons 163-195 or 236-251) and replace an amino acid from one polarity/charge category with an amino acid from another category (Table 4). \"Non-disruptive mutations\" were classified as any mutation occurring outside the L2 or L3 binding domain (except stop mutations) or mutations within the L2 or L3 binding domains that result in replacement of an amino acid with another one from the same polarity/charge category.\n\n    We then investigated the evolutionary action score (EAp53) that focuses on missense TP53 mutations and was designed and validated in patients with head and neck cancers. This algorithm takes evolutionary sensitivity to sequence variation and amino acid conservation into account and scores mutations from 0 to 100 with wild type TP53 sequences having a score of 0. We extracted the EAp53 score of those AMLSG patients showing missense mutations from the respective server  and used the threshold of 75 from the initial publication to discriminate between low-risk (<75) and high-risk groups (>=75). Finally, we assessed the relative fitness score (RFS) recently developed for TP53 mutations located within the DBD of the gene as another indicator of their functional impact. In that work, a catalogue of 9833 unique DNA sequence variants was generated in human p53-null cells, and their selective growth was assessed in in vitro cultures. Thereby, RFS represents the logarithm (base 2) of the median of the relative enrichment or depletion of a particular TP53 variant assessed at three time points. A high RFS indicates preferential expansion in culture representing higher fitness of the variant, whereas a low RFS pinpoints preferential depletion. We extracted the RFS for the DBD TP53 mutations of the AMLSG cohort using an online data resource (GSE115072) and classified patients into high-risk (RFS > -1) and low-risk (<=-1) groups. This threshold was based on data from individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome showing a statistically significant association between RFS and age at primary tumor detection.\n\n    For each TP53 functional score, we assessed its impact on OS and EFS as defined by the European Leukemia Net. Thereby, OS is measured from trial entry until the date of death from any cause or last follow-up, EFS:from trial entry until the date of refractory disease, relapse from complete remission, death, or last follow-up. Survival times were compared between different functional TP53-mutated groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. Wild type TP53 patients are shown in the plots as a reference but were not considered when assessing group differences. We estimated median survival rates along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from these analyses. Furthermore, we performed Cox regression analyses determining hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for each of the TP53 functional scores and assessed the influence of age, gender, white blood cell count, cytogenetic risk, type of AML (de novo, secondary, therapy-related), and TP53 VAF on OS and EFS. In the eight patients with multiple TP53 mutations, only that mutation with the severest predicted impact was used for each of the respective scoring systems as depicted in Table 1.\n\n    Since the threshold for the RFS was determined in a cohort of patients with different types of cancer, we performed a ROC analysis to determine the optimal threshold for patients with AML. Given that only 6/98 (6.1%) TP53-mutated patients survived the whole observation time, we considered 1-year mortality as the outcome. We determined the best threshold using the Youden's index that weights sensitivity and specificity equally. The EAp53 score was not considered for this analysis as the boxplots showed similar scores for survivors and non-survivors after one year as shown in Figure S4 and Table S4. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.5.3.",
        "Results": "    108 TP53 mutations were detected in 98 of the 1537 patients investigated:88 (81.4%) missense, eight (7.4%) nonsense, and six (5.6%) splice site mutations, as well as six (5.6%) small insertions and deletions. In seven patients, we found two TP53 mutations, and in one patient:four mutations (Table 1). According to the cytogenetic analysis, a sufficient number of metaphases was obtained in 84/98 (86%) patients showing a complex karyotype in 77 (92%) of them. The median VAF of the 108 TP53 mutations detected in this cohort was 48.7% (range, 4.7% to 97%); concurrent gene mutations were reported previously. The median follow-up of patients with wild type TP53 AML (n = 1439) was 895 days, and of patients showing TP53 mutations:195 days, respectively.\n\n    Patients with a wild type TP53 status showed a significantly better outcome than those with TP53 mutations (median OS, 33.6 months versus 6.5 months; median EFS, 16.5 months versus 5.7 months) as described previously by our group and being in accordance with further reports. The TP53-specific scoring systems applied in this study are described in detail in the \"Materials and Methods\" section. When comparing the impact of TP53 missense mutations versus truncating mutations, we found 84 patients in the former group and 14 patients in the latter group, respectively. However, we did not find a significant difference with respect to OS and EFS using this scoring system. Next, we classified mutations into \"disruptive\" and \"non-disruptive\", and identified 42 patients with at least one disruptive mutation and 56 with only non-disruptive mutations in the AMLSG cohort. Again, no significant difference in the outcome parameters analyzed was observed. We then investigated the EAp53 score focusing on patients with missense TP53 mutations and found 49 patients in the high-risk and 35 patients in the low-risk group. Using this functional scoring system, we did not detect a significant survival difference between the two groups, either (Figure 1, Table 1 and Table 2, Figure S1, and Tables S1-S3).\n\n    The RFS was extracted for those 83 patients with TP53 mutations located in the DNA-binding domain (DBD); 76 patients were classified as high-risk (RFS > -1), and seven patients:as low-risk (<=-1). Notably, patients with a low-risk RFS showed a significantly better OS (median, 13.4 versus 6.3 months; p = 0.019) and EFS (median, 11.7 versus 5.3 months; p = 0.024) (Table 1 and Table S1, Figure S2). These parameters remained borderline significant in multivariable analyses adjusting for age, gender, white blood cell count, cytogenetic risk, type of AML and TP53 VAF, indicating a potential prognostic value of this score (Table 3). In a subsequent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimal RFS cut-off value for AML patients was -0.135 (Figure S3) resulting in 25 low-risk and 58 high-risk patients, respectively. Using this leukemia-specific threshold, we found a significantly better OS (median, 12.9 versus 5.5 months, p = 0.017) and a trend towards improved EFS (median, 7.3 versus 5.2 months, p = 0.054) for patients with a low-risk RFS (Figure 1, Tables S2 and S3, Figure S1). In multivariable regression analyses including the established AML risk factors, the difference revealed statistically significance for both OS (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.15-4.0; p = 0.017) and EFS (HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.06-3.69; p = 0.033) (Table 3).",
        "Conclusion": "    In this study, four different TP53-specific scores were evaluated for their prognostic impact in patients with TP53-mutated AML. The AML-specific relative fitness score was capable of identifying patients with a significantly better prognosis. We conclude that:in addition to clinical parameters:this score should be incorporated into the therapeutic decision algorithm of patients with such a malignancy.",
        "Discussion": "    In patients with AML, TP53 mutations confer an exceedingly adverse prognosis. Here, we applied four different TP53-specifc functional scoring systems to test whether particular mutations are associated with a better therapeutic outcome. Comparing missense TP53 mutations with truncating aberrations did not show a difference with respect to OS and EFS of intensively treated AML patients. Our results, therefore, suggest that gain-of-function properties postulated for at least some of missense TP53 mutations are not the predominant mechanism of therapeutic resistance in that cohort. They are in accordance with recently published data indicating a dominant-negative effect of missense TP53 mutations rather than acquisition of novel oncogenic properties in myeloid malignancies based on in vitro and in vivo analyses, as well as clinical data. Discrimination of TP53 mutations into disruptive and non-disruptive ones showed a statistically significant impact on survival in patients with head and neck cancers. Furthermore, the EAp53 score was successfully used to predict outcome in patients with larynx cancer. However, both TP53 functional scoring systems did not show a survival difference in the AML patients investigated here. This points to the fact that the cellular context of TP53 aberrations plays a pivotal role with respect to biology as well as therapeutic resistance.\n\n    Treatment of patients with TP53-mutated AML remains challenging. Non-intensive therapies with hypomethylating agents:azacitidine and decitabine:are frequently offered, especially to elderly patients. These drugs show acceptable response rates and favorable toxicity profiles. However, they represent a non-curative treatment, and patients usually succumb to leukemic progression within months. Recently, experimental approaches targeting TP53 mutations in myeloid disorders have reached the clinical stage of development. APR-246 is a small molecule designed to shift mutant p53 towards a wild type confirmation, thus inducing apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Synergistic effects of this drug and azacitidine have been demonstrated in vitro using cells from patients with TP53-mutated AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In a multiphase 1b/2 trial, APR-246 was given in combination with azacitidine to patients with TP53-mutated MDS and oligoblastic AML with preliminary results showing encouraging response rates of 85%. Nevertheless, to date, intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative approach for AML and MDS patients with TP53 aberrations. Facing different therapeutic options, it is, therefore, of importance to develop tools supporting proper therapeutic decision-making in this cohort of patients. In a recently published article, clinical parameters:preferably performance status and achievement of a complete remission following induction therapy:have been shown to be of prognostic relevance in patients with TP53-mutated AML. Analyzing a large cohort of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy and HSCT here, we were able to show that the AML-specific RFS enables discrimination of a low-risk group with a median OS of 12.9 months and a high-risk group with a median OS of only 5.5 months. We, therefore, conclude that in addition to clinical parameters, the AML-specific RFS may be a useful tool to identify those patients with TP53 mutations who still benefit from intensive treatment approaches.",

        "Title": "    Ancient Sturgeons Possess Effective DNA Repair Mechanisms: Influence of Model Genotoxicants on Embryo Development of Sterlet, Acipenser ruthenus",
        "Abstract": "    DNA damage caused by exogenous or endogenous factors is a common challenge for developing fish embryos. DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways help organisms minimize adverse effects of DNA alterations. In terms of DNA repair mechanisms, sturgeons represent a particularly interesting model due to their exceptional genome plasticity. Sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) is a relatively small species of sturgeon. The goal of this study was to assess the sensitivity of sterlet embryos to model genotoxicants (camptothecin, etoposide, and benzo[a]pyrene), and to assess DDR responses. We assessed the effects of genotoxicants on embryo survival, hatching rate, DNA fragmentation, gene expression, and phosphorylation of H2AX and ATM kinase. Exposure of sterlet embryos to 1 microM benzo[a]pyrene induced low levels of DNA damage accompanied by ATM phosphorylation and xpc gene expression. Conversely, 20 microM etoposide exposure induced DNA damage without activation of known DDR pathways. Effects of 10 nM camptothecin on embryo development were stage-specific, with early stages, before gastrulation, being most sensitive. Overall, this study provides foundational information for future investigation of sterlet DDR pathways.",
        "Introduction": "    DNA is subject to constant damage from endogenously produced reactive oxygen species that affect replication and transcription and can alter its structure. Further, exogenous factors, such as radiation or pollutants, induce DNA damage via oxidation, DNA adduct formation, and single- or double-strand breaks (SSB or DSB, respectively). Cellular mechanisms for repair of DNA damage are highly conserved among vertebrates; however, species-specificity in processes and targets of DNA damage repair (DDR) are noted. Previous studies of fish describe primary DDR pathways: base and nucleotide excision repair (BER and NER), homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).\n\n    Cells initiate damage recognition and assembly of response complexes in response to DNA damage. An initial signal for DDR response is the phosphorylation of the histone H2A subtype, termed H2AX, at Ser139. Phosphorylated H2AX is termed gamma-H2AX. Several phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinases are essential for activating cell cycle checkpoints following DNA damage, such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase. Briefly, ATM is activated by autophosphorylation at Ser1981 which leads to dissociation of inactive ATM dimers into single protein molecules with increased kinase activity. ATM initiates phosphorylation of numerous substrates, including H2AX, and 53BP1, as well as checkpoint proteins. These processes stop progression through the cell cycle and activate proteins responsible for DDR. The 53BP1 protein is used as a marker of DNA damage in fish. This protein is a key component of DDR and mediates activation of DSB repair. The protein also exhibits interaction surfaces for numerous DSB-responsive proteins.\n\n    Genotoxicants are compounds that alter the chemical structure of DNA and induce different types of DNA damage. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and a ubiquitous contaminant generated from incomplete combustion of organic material. The chemical is also among the most studied contaminants in ecotoxicology. BaP can alter DNA methylation state and displays teratogenic effects on zebrafish embryos with and EC50 0.52 microM at three days post-fertilization. BaP metabolites form DNA adducts that promote carcinogenesis. Another well-studied group of model genotoxicants are inhibitors of topoisomerases that are often used in cancer therapy. DNA topoisomerases regulate the topological state of DNA by creating short breaks in the DNA double-helix. Inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I (e.g., camptothecin, CPT) and II (etoposide) are effective antitumor drugs. Effect of these inhibitors on fish embryo development was previously studied in zebrafish. One study in sterlet evaluated effect of genotoxic PCB on embryo survival and morphometric alterations. However, little information is currently available about genotoxicant impacts on sterlet embryo development.\n\n    Sturgeons (belonging to the family Acipenserids) are an attractive model for studying DDR. They display one of the highest numbers of chromosomes, ~120 to ~360, among vertebrates as a result of multiple rounds of lineage-specific whole-genome duplication. Sturgeons are often referred to as \"living fossils.\" The group likely evolved approximately 200 million years ago making them evolutionarily highly successful. Further, sturgeons have extraordinary genomic plasticity demonstrated through intraspecific hybridization of individuals with different chromosome numbers. Intriguingly, hybridization between intermediate hybrids and pure species gives not only viable progeny but even fertile fish. Sturgeons are also prone to spontaneous polyploidization. The basis of this evolutionary success and mechanisms of genome plasticity are still poorly understood; however, such plasticity would require highly effective DNA repair.\n\n    Embryonic stages are the most sensitive to DNA damage since DNA replication rate is high, cell proliferation is rapid, and the cell cycle is much shorter compared to adult cells. The integrity of the genome is thus at greater risk, and efficient DNA repair is of significant importance. Sturgeon embryogenesis is described by several authors; however, nothing is known about DDR capacity in developing sturgeon embryos. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of genotoxicants, (BaP, camptothecin (CPT), and etoposide) on developing embryos of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) at different embryonic stages. We evaluated DNA damage caused by these compounds and their adverse effects on sturgeon hatching success and embryonic development. Further, we assessed responses to DNA damage induced by genotoxicants in embryos.",
        "Methods": "    Gametes were collected from sterlet during the natural spawning period. During broodstock handling, fish were anesthetized using 0.07 mL-1 of clove oil. All experiments were performed on fish embryos before reaching an independently feeding larval form, no special approval of the local ethical committee was needed according to the law to protect animals against maltreatment (no. 246/1992 Collection of Laws).\n\n    The sterlet (BW, 0.5-2 kg; 12 females, 9 males) were reared in the aquaculture facility of the Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology at the University of South Bohemia, Vodnany, Czech Republic. In order to induce ovulation, female fish were injected with carp pituitary extract powder dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution at an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight. The second injection with carp pituitary powder (4.5 mg/kg of body weight) was performed 12 h after the first injection. Oocytes were collected 18-20 h after the second injection through a minimally invasive incision of the oviduct. Sperm production in males was induced with an intramuscular injection of carp pituitary extract powder (4.0 mg/kg of body weight) dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution. After 48 h post-injection, sperm was collected from the urogenital papilla with a catheter. Sperm was stored at 4  C in separate cell culture containers (250 mL) until use. Eggs were fertilized with sperm activated in dechlorinated tap water at 15  C for 2 min, and the stickiness of fertilized eggs was removed by 3x washings with 0.1% tannic acid solution for 1 min. Identification of early developmental stages was based on studies of Acipenser baerii and Acipenser guldenstadti. Embryos were incubated in Petri dishes with dechlorinated tap water at 16  C, and each Petri dish contained approximately 50 embryos.\n\n    Etoposide (inhibitor of topoisomerase II) (CAS Number 33419-42-0), benzo[a]pyrene (CAS Number: 50-32-8), and camptothecin (inhibitor of topoisomerase I) (CAS Number: 7689-03-4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St Louis, MO, USA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies [9F3] to gamma H2A.X (phospho S139), mouse monoclonal antibodies to phospho-ATM (S1981), and polyclonal 53BP1antibodies produced in rabbits were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).\n\n    Concentrations of compounds were selected based on available literature data and preliminary experiments. We analyzed the effects of BaP on sterlet embryo development over a concentration range of 0.5-5 microM (Table S1). One micromolar was chosen as the highest tested concentration soluble in water. CPT showed high toxicity to sterlet embryos in preliminary experiments (5-100 nM: Table S1). Ten nanomolars CPT was selected as the lowest dose that showed an effect on embryo development.\n\n    All compounds were dissolved in DMSO as stock solutions. Immediately before the treatment, stock solutions were diluted 100x as working solutions. Working solutions were added to the embryo culture medium (dechlorinated tap water) at a 1:1000 ratio to produce required concentrations in medium and 0.1% DMSO (v/v). Working solutions were prepared daily. The same amount of DMSO (0.1% in embryo culture medium) was used as solvent control.\n\n    For each treatment, a group of 50 fertilized embryos at the 2-cell stage was transferred to a Petri dish. Each dish contained either vehicle control or a tested compound in a total of 30 mL of dechlorinated tap water. Embryos were exposed to 1 microM BaP or 20 microM etoposide continuously from 2-cell stage until hatching, or to 10 nM CPT for 24 h during one of three stages: (1) from 2 to 24 hpf (2-24 hpf; blastula); (2) from 24 to 48 hpf (gastrulation); (3) from 48 to 72 hpf (neurulation). CPT was replaced with fresh water after 24 h. Embryos were held in separate Petri dishes in dechlorinated tap water with 0.1% DMSO before exposure. Water was changed daily, and dead embryos were continuously removed. Each experiment was repeated six times.\n\n    embryonic viability, % [number of dead embryos/number of fertilized eggs x 100];\n\n    hatching rate, % [number of hatched larvae/number of fertilized eggs x 100];\n\n    occurrence of malformations.\n\n    Embryos were examined daily under a stereomicroscope (NSZ-608T, Nanjing Jiangnan Novel Optics Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) and counted until hatching (8 dpf). Throughout embryogenic development, the following parameters were analyzed:\n\n    The embryo phenotypes were observed under a microscope (NSZ-608T, Nanjing Jiangnan Novel Optics Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) and imaged at x2.5 magnification. A minimum of 150 embryos were analyzed per treatment.\n\n    Glass microcapillaries were drawn on a needle puller (PC-10; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), and solution of 20 microM etoposide, 0.2 M KCl, and 1% Rhodamine dextran (MW 10,000) was Microinjected into embryos. Rhodamine was used for visual control of the delivery of solution during injection via the appearance of red color under the stereomicroscope and again during sorting under a fluorescence stereomicroscope. Microcapillaries loaded with solution were mounted on a micromanipulator (MN-153, Narishige, Japan) attached to a pneumatic injector (FemtoJet  4x, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Non-dechorionated embryos were placed in a Petri dish coated with 1% agar. Tips of the microcapillaries were carefully broken with forceps. The duration and pressure of injection pulses were determined using the oil droplet method and kept constant over the experiment while ~10 nL was injected into the animal pole of each embryo.\n\n    DNA integrity was assessed using alkaline comet assays, or single-cell gel electrophoresis assays, following previously described methods with minor modifications. Briefly, embryos at different stages were transferred into 1.5 mL tubes (3-4 embryos in each) with 1x PBS on ice. Embryos were mechanically disintegrated and centrifuged at 1000x g for 3 min. The pellets containing embryonic cells were washed with 1 mL of PBS, centrifuged at 1000x g for 3 min, and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS.\n\n    Microscope slides (OxiSelectST; Cell Biloabs, INC., San Diego, CA, USA) used for the assay were prepared as follows: resuspended samples (200 microL) were mixed with 700 microL 0.7% NuSieve GTG low melting point agarose (OxiSelectST; Cell Biloabs, INC., San Diego, CA, USA). Forty microliters of this mixture was placed on the slide, and the agarose was allowed to solidify at 4  C. Further, slides were immersed in lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO, pH 10) and incubated overnight at 4  C. After cells lysis, the buffer was removed, and slides were placed in a horizontal gel tank filled with freshly prepared electrophoresis buffer (90 mM Tris Base, 90 mM Boric acid, 2.5 mM EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed for 20 min at 35 V and 170 mA. Following electrophoresis, slides were washed three times with pre-chilled DIH2O for 2 min. Washed slides were dehydrated with 70% ethanol, and air-dried for storage at 4  C. Before the analysis, 50 microL of PBS containing DAPI/Antifade Staining Solution (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) was added to the slides for agarose rehydration and DNA staining. Slides were analyzed using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope at 20x magnification (Figure 10). At least 30 cells were scored for each sample. The images were analyzed with CometScore image analysis software (TriTek Corporation, Sumerduck, VA, USA). Tail length (measured from the middle of the head to the end of the comet tail) and % Tail DNA (the content of DNA in comet tails) were measured. The per cent DNA in the tail was calculated using the following formula:\n\n    Embryos at different stages of development were dechorionated with forceps and mechanically dissociated in protein extraction buffer (8 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 100 mM dithiothreitol) containing phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM EDTA, 1 mM okadaic acid) and protease inhibitors (100 mM PMSF, 1 mg/mL pepstatin A, 5 mg/mL leupeptin). Proteins were extracted from at least four embryos per condition. The analysis was repeated three times for each experimental condition. Bradford assay was used to determine protein concentrations in each sample. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured with Biobase-EL10A microplate reader (Biobase, Shandong, China).\n\n    For SDS-PAGE, proteins were mixed with sample buffer containing 65 mM Tris, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) beta-mercaptoethanol, and 1% bromophenol blue. Those samples were then heated for 3 min at 95  C. Proteins were separated on a 10% acrylamide gel using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN vertical electrophoresis system; 25 microg of protein was loaded into each lane.\n\n    Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrically transferred from gels to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Total protein content (loaded and transferred) was controlled before immunodetection by staining the membrane with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in isopropanol. After staining, membranes were scanned with imaging system Fusion Solo 7S Edge (Vilber Lourmat, Collegien, France). After imaging, membranes were destained in acetic acid/ethanol/water (1:7:2). Destained membranes were washed with PBST (0.1% v/v Tween-20, PBS) three times at 20  C. Membranes were blocked by incubation with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST for 1 h at 20  C, then incubated for 16 h at 4  C with antibodies to either gamma H2A.X (phospho S139), phospho-ATM (S1981) or 53BP1 diluted 1:3000 in 5% w/v BSA in PBST. Membranes were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 in 3% w/v BSA-PBST) for 1 h at 20  C. Reacted proteins were detected with ECL-plus (GE Healthcare, Danderyd, Sweden) using Fusion Solo 7S Edge (Vilber Lourmat, France). The intensity of each band was measured using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and normalized against total protein content in each sample. Total protein staining was used as a loading control (Figure S1).\n\n    The genes studied were previously reported to be expressed in developing fish embryos, and Table 1 shows primers used for RT-qPCR. Primers were designed with Primer3 software  based on nucleotide sequences from sterlet transcriptomes (NCBI, Table 1).\n\n    Embryos for RT-qPCR were collected and immediately transferred to a -80  C freezer. Total RNA extraction used 1 mL of Trizol (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's protocol, then precipitated with LiCl. Total RNA concentration was determined with a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE, USA), and the quality of RNA was assessed using a fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical).\n\n    After extraction, 1 microg of isolated total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript III Reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). We prepared a mixture of RNA with 0.5 microL of oligo-dT and random hexamers (mixture 1:1, 50 microM each), 0.5 microL of dNTPs (10 mM each), 0.5 microL of the spike (TATAA Universal RNA Spike, TATAA Biocenter, Goteborg, Sweden), and water to a total volume of 6.5 microL. This mixture was incubated for 5 min at 75  C, 20 s at 25  C, and 4  C for 1 min. After incubation, we added 100 U of SuperScript III enzyme, 20 U of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.5 microL of DTT, and 2 microL of 5x first-strand synthesis buffer to a final volume of 10 microL. The mixture was then incubated at 25  C for 5 min, 50  C for 60 min, 55  C for 15 min, and 75  C for 15 min. After incubation, 90 microL of distilled H2O were added, and cDNA was stored at -20  C. qPCR mix was composed of 5 microL of TATAA SYBR  GrandMaster Mix (TATAA Biocenter), 0.5 microL of forward and reverse primers mix (mixture 1:1, 10 microM each), 2 microL of cDNA and distilled H2O. The final volume of qPCR mix was 10 microL. qPCR was performed on a CFX384 cycler system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The following PCR conditions were used: initial denaturation at 95  C for 2 min, 40 repeats of denaturation at 95  C for 15 s, annealing at 60  C for 20 s, and elongation at 72  C for 20 s. Melting curve analysis was performed to test the specificity of amplification. Total RNA concentration was used for normalization in RT-qPCR. Data were analyzed using Excel and delta Cq approach.\n\n    Embryos at hatching (7 dpf) were fixed with ice-cold 100% ethanol and stored at -20  C. Ethanol was removed for DNA staining, and embryos were rehydrated with successive washing in 75, 50, 25, and 0% ethanol in PBS. Subsequently, samples were incubated in PBST containing 3% BSA for 1 h at 20  C on a shaker. Embryos were stained with 1 microg/mL SYBR Green in PBST for 1-2 h at 20  C on a shaker. Finally, embryos were washed twice with PBS, mixed with 1% melted agarose dissolved in PBS, and transferred to a glass slide. The DNA aberrations were imaged using a fluorescent microscope, Olympus BX50, at 10x magnification.\n\n    Normality and homogeneity of variance of all data were first assessed with Kolmogorov and Bartlett tests, respectively. Values for comet assay are expressed as means +- SEM. Statistical comparison was made by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test (significance level of 0.05). Values for viability, hatching rate, Western blots, and RT-qPCR are expressed as means +- SEM and analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Analyses of viability, hatching rate, and the comet assay were performed using a significance threshold of 0.05. In contrast, analysis of RT-qPCR and Western blotting was performed using a significance threshold of 0.1 with STATISTICA 13.0 software for Windows.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Results": "    We exposed sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus) embryos to 1 microM BaP, 20 microM etoposide, and 10 nM CPT to assess impacts on viability and hatching rate. Sterlet embryos were exposed to BaP and etoposide continuously from the 2-cell stage until 8 days post-fertilization (dpf), and to CPT for 24 h at different stages of development. Preliminary results showed that short-term exposure to BaP and etoposide at different stages had no effect on embryo viability or hatching rate. Long-term exposure to BaP, but not etoposide, significantly increased embryo mortality. Embryo viability was 57 +- 3%, compared to etoposide-exposed (74 +- 2.8%) and control (75 +- 8%) embryos at 8 dpf (Figure 1A). Conversely, exposure to CPT for 24 h during early developmental stages induced 100% mortality (Figure 1B). Exposure at 24-48 h post-fertilization (hpf) (gastrulation) significantly decreased embryo viability to 34 +- 5% at 8 dpf. In contrast, exposure to CPT at neurulation stage (48-72 hpf) did not significantly affect viability.\n\n    Differences in mortality between topoisomerase I and II inhibitors could be attributed to different penetration through the embryo chorion. Therefore, to ensure the proper delivery of etoposide, we microinjected it directly into embryo animal poles. However, no changes were observed in mortality compared to controls (Figure 1C).\n\n    Exposure to etoposide and CPT at neurulation (48-72 hpf) did not affect the hatching rate at 8 dpf (Figure 2). Initial hatching occurred at 5 dpf in control embryos but was delayed to 6 dpf in treated embryos. Exposure to BaP and CPT at 24-48 hpf significantly decreased hatching success to 45 +- 5% and 13 +- 1.5%, respectively, at 8 dpf.\n\n    Hatched embryos did not show malformations following exposure to BaP and etoposide (Figure 3A-C). However, embryos exposed to CPT at 24-48 or 48-72 hpf exhibited skeletal malformations and a phenotype similar to developmental delay (Figure 3D,E).\n\n    We used comet assays to analyze the effects of BaP and topoisomerase inhibitors on DNA integrity in sterlet embryos at different stages. DNA damage increased even in control embryos during development from 3.5 +- 0.1% Tail DNA at 1 dpf to 11 +- 1.9% Tail DNA at 3 dpf (Figure 4). However, DNA integrity was partially recovered to 5 +- 0.6% Tail DNA at 8 dpf. Similarly, an increase in DNA fragmentation was observed at 2-3 dpf in BaP and etoposide treated embryos, followed by recovery at 7 and 8 dpf (Figure 4A). Exposure to 20 microM etoposide induced significantly more DNA damage at 2 and 3 dpf compared to the controls (p < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA)). Interestingly, DNA fragmentation level at 8 dpf was lower in embryos exposed to BaP (0.4% +- 0.1%) and etoposide (0.5% +- 0.1%) than in control embryos.\n\n    Exposure of sterlet embryos to 10 nM CPT from 2-24 hpf induced a significant increase in DNA damage (19 +- 5% Tail DNA) at 24 hpf (Figure 4B). The level of DNA fragmentation further increased at 2 dpf, reaching 27 +- 4%. Embryos did not survive this level of damage (Figure 1B). Conversely, exposure to the same concentration of CPT at later stages (24-48 and 48-72 hpf) did not induce similar levels of DNA fragmentation (Figure 4B). Embryos exposed to CPT during gastrulation (24-48 hpf) showed significantly higher DNA damage only after 5 dpf (14 +- 2.9%) compared to the control (7 +- 1.3%) and this DNA fragmentation was partially repaired by 7 dpf (9 +- 1.2%). Comet assays did not detect significant differences in DNA integrity between control embryos and embryos treated with CPT at neurulation (48-72 hpf). This finding is consistent with survival and hatching of embryos exposed to CPT at 48-72 hpf (Figure 1B and Figure 2).\n\n    We stained total DNA in sterlet embryos fixed after control and CPT treatments (Figure 5). Images present part of the fin from hatchling larvae. Control embryos showed well-aligned nuclei of constant size and tightly packed nuclear DNA (Figure 5). DNA bridges and micronuclei were observed in embryos exposed to CPT at 24-48 hpf, in agreement with the results of the comet assay; embryos exposed to CPT at neuralization (48-72 hpf) were similar to controls.\n\n    Exposure to genotoxic compounds induced DNA damage in embryos with subsequent activation of DNA damage response pathways, as assessed with Western blotting and RT-qPCR (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9). Initially, we analyzed phosphorylation levels of H2AX (gamma-H2AX) in 3- and 8-dpf embryos exposed to CPT, BaP, and etoposide (Figure 6A). The two time points were chosen since results of comet assays indicate that differences among treated and control embryos peak at these time points. Western blotting showed increased levels of gamma-H2AX in 3-dpf embryos exposed to CPT at the gastrula stage. A significant increase of gamma-H2AX was also observed in embryos exposed to CPT at neurulation (48-72 hpf). Further, continuous treatment with BaP or etoposide increased levels of gamma-H2AX in 3-dpf embryos; however, these increases were not significant compared to control (p > 0.1, Figure 6B). Embryos collected at 8 dpf showed no differences in H2AX phosphorylation between control and treated embryos (Figure 6C).\n\n    We also analyzed another marker of DNA damage, 53BP1 (Figure 7A). Like gamma-H2AX, 53BP1 expression was increased in 3-dpf embryos exposed to CPT compared to control (Figure 7B). Further, slightly elevated levels of the protein were observed in embryos exposed to BaP or etoposide (p > 0.1). 53BP1 decreased in CPT-treated embryos at 8 dpf compared to control (Figure 7C), in contrast to gamma-H2AX results.\n\n    ATM kinase is a primary component of DNA damage response and checkpoint activation. Level of autophosphorylation of ATM at S1981 significantly decreased in CPT-treated (48-72 hpf) embryos at 3 dpf (Figure 8A,B). However, embryos exposed to BaP showed a significant increase in phospho-ATM (S1981) (Figure 8B). After 8 days of development, embryos treated with CPT from 24-48 hpf displayed significantly increased ATM phosphorylation (Figure 8C). Levels of phospho-ATM (S1981) in embryos following CPT treatment from 48-72 hpf, and BaP, and etoposide treatments was like in control embryos.\n\n    Overall, the involvement of different DNA damage responses depends on the type of genotoxic insult. Interestingly, no DNA damage response was detected in embryos exposed to etoposide.\n\n    Further, we analyzed the expression of several genes involved in different pathways of DNA damage response and repair (Table 1; Figure 9). Gene expression was significantly reduced in embryos exposed to CPT which may indicate a delay in development. Expression of rad51, dpolb, and msh2 was significantly downregulated in embryos treated with CPT at gastrulation (24-48 hpf). In contrast, levels of p53, xpc, ercc3, ogg1 were like controls in all CPT-treated embryos. Exposure to CPT at neurulation led to significant downregulation of atm, pcna, apex1, ercc1. In BaP-treated embryos, the level of xpc mRNA was significantly increased (p < 0.1, Kruskal-Wallis test), whereas mRNA expression of other genes was similar to control. Etoposide did not induce changes in mRNA expression of selected genes.",
        "Conclusion": "    This study presents the first screening of DNA damage response pathways utilized by sterlet embryos. These embryos are generally more resistant to genotoxicants than embryos of zebrafish. Further, early stages of development (before neurulation) are more susceptible to genotoxic stress than later stages. It could be due to prolonged cell cycle at later stages, as well as reduced cell proliferation and DNA replication. The presented pieces of evidence suggest that sterlet embryos could be used as an alternative or complementary model for studies on DNA damage responses in fish.\n\n    The current study confirms our hypothesis that mechanisms of DDR are highly effective in sterlet embryos. They can recover from BaP-induced toxicity, possibly through the NER pathway. Embryo viability and hatching seem to be unaffected by etoposide exposure; however, it is possible that etoposide induces the formation of DSB-Top2 complexes, which are not recognized by DDR pathways. Besides, sterlet embryos can recover from as much as 15% DNA fragmentation following CPT exposure. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to elucidate the spatial-temporal distribution of DDR proteins in developing sterlet embryos and their deployment during normal embryonic development.\n\n    Notably, only a few DDR-related antibodies have been tested in fish; and the current study is the first report on phospho-ATM (S1981) in sterlet. We observed some differences between phospho-ATM (S1981) and gamma-H2AX levels in response to genotoxicants. Thus, other PIKKs, such as ATR, might be involved in DNA damage response in sterlet embryos.",
        "Discussion": "    We present the first report on DNA damage and DNA repair induced in sterlet embryos by model genotoxicants. Genotoxicity in sterlet embryos was confirmed by the comet assay, DNA staining, and Western blotting with gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 antibodies. DDR activity was evaluated by means of RT-qPCR and Western blotting with phospho-ATM antibody.\n\n    All tested compounds (BaP, etoposide, and CPT) induce DNA damage in sterlet embryos. However, the level of DNA damage and its effect on embryo survival and hatching rate varied. DNA damage induced by BaP and etoposide did not exceed 10% Tail DNA and was mostly repaired by 8 dpf. Conversely, exposure to 10 nM CPT before gastrulation (2-24 hpf) caused DNA fragmentation to reach 27% Tail DNA, which was lethal to the embryos. Lesser effects of BaP and etoposide could be attributed to differences in penetration through the embryo chorion. However, when etoposide was injected directly into the animal pole, it did not affect embryo survival. In contrast, we observed a significantly increased level of DNA fragmentation following embryo exposure to etoposide compared to the control. This fact indicates that etoposide can penetrate embryo chorion and induce DNA damage following simple exposure.\n\n    Interestingly, the control embryos also showed an increased level of DNA fragmentation at 2-3 dpf followed by gradual DNA repair at 5-8 dpf. A similar increase in DNA fragmentation in normally developing embryos was previously reported in zebrafish and attributed to the activity of topoisomerase II (Top2) cleavage complexes. However, these authors did not evaluate levels of DNA damage at later stages of development and did not observe recovery of embryonic DNA. High levels of DNA fragmentation at early stages of embryo development could be related to rapid cell division. After gastrulation, the cell cycle slows, cells acquire checkpoint activity and are effectively able to repair damaged DNA.\n\n    This study aimed to assess the sensitivity of sterlet embryos toward different types of genotoxicity and to analyze DDR pathways activated in early stages of embryo development. Continuous exposure to BaP slightly increased DNA fragmentation and reduced survival and hatching rate of sterlet embryos. Further, BaP exposure was associated with increased ATM phosphorylation at 3 dpf and elevated xpc expression at 8 dpf. These results agree with previous studies that show teratogenic effects of BaP exposure on fish embryo development. However, in contrast to model fish (zebrafish and medaka), sterlet embryos did not show a higher incidence of malformation following BaP exposure and effectively repaired DNA damage by 8 dpf. Prolongation of the cell cycle and increased checkpoint activity could assist with repair. Thus, sterlet embryos might repair altered DNA more effectively than fish species with more rapid embryo development. Further, reduced hatching rate could be due to the delay in development associated with checkpoint activation and DDR.\n\n    Overall, BaP does not appear to induce major DNA strand breaks in developing sterlet embryos, since no significant increase in % Tail DNA was recorded. However, it may form DNA adducts, in a manner similar to BaP-induced toxicity in human lung cancer. A previous study on zebrafish embryos did not detect BaP-induced DNA damage with the comet assay; however, persistent DNA alterations were observed with qRAPD and AFLP techniques. DNA adducts are further repaired by the NER pathway in human cell lines. Similarly, we observed increased xpc gene expression and decreased DNA fragmentation at 8 dpf in sterlet embryos exposed to BaP. The protein encoded by xpc gene is a key component of the XPC complex that is vital in the early steps of global genome NER. Thus, in sterlet embryos, BaP induces the formation of DNA adducts, and increased ATM phosphorylation is followed by activation of the NER pathway.\n\n    Exposure to etoposide (Top2 inhibitor) did not affect embryo survival and hatching rate, though DNA fragmentation was significantly increased at 2-3 dpf. This result is consistent with previous studies on fish embryos. Top2 inhibitors can induce DNA damage without affecting embryo survival in zebrafish. Interestingly, we did not observe significant changes in H2AX, ATM phosphorylation, or mRNA expression levels. However, the level of 53BP1 was slightly increased compared to control at 3 dpf (p > 0.1, Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, Muslimovic et al. showed that only a small fraction of all etoposide-induced DSBs activate H2AX phosphorylation and induce toxicity in human cell lines. Ninety percent of DSBs produced by etoposide are held in a Top2-linked complex that is not recognized by ATM or other DNA damage recognition systems. This feature of etoposide action explains the increased level of DNA fragmentation without an increase of gamma-H2AX and ATM phosphorylation. However, the effects of formation of DSB-Top2 complexes on embryo development are not clear. Further studies are needed to elucidate the consequences of DNA damage induced by etoposide. Our results indicate that at later stages of development etoposide exposure does not induce DNA fragmentation. This finding might be attributed to changing expression patterns of Top2 at different stages of development.\n\n    Inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) with CPT was lethal for sterlet embryos in early stages of development (before gastrulation). Similarly, previous studies demonstrate that Top1 inhibition is detrimental to post-MBT zebrafish embryos at the same developmental stage. In fish embryos, gastrulation is a critical phase, when cells acquire the ability to enter apoptosis. Treatment with CPT before gastrulation causes zebrafish embryo death at the end of gastrulation (10 hpf). During the gastrula stage, authors observed that CPT treatment caused arrest of proliferation, followed by apoptosis in some fraction of cells. If a sufficiently high fraction of embryonic cells were postmitotic at the time of treatment, embryos survived for hours. In our study, embryos that have been exposed to CPT during gastrulation and neurulation showed high survival and hatching rate. Thus, both Top1 and Top2 inhibitors showed time-dependent effects in fish embryos. However, in contrast with etoposide, the stage-dependent effect of CPT is attributed to differences in cell cycle and cell proliferation at different stages, rather than changes in the pattern of topoisomerase expression.\n\n    In contrast to zebrafish embryos, which survive only several hours following exposure to CPT, sterlet embryos, exposed to CPT at gastrulation or neurulation, survived up to several days and showed signs of recovery. Activation of DDR pathways was indicated by increased levels of gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 at 3 dpf. Interestingly, levels of phospho-ATM (S1981) decreased at the same time point. H2AX can also be phosphorylated by other phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase. Therefore, in sterlet embryos treated with CPT at gastrulation and neurulation, H2AX phosphorylation was mediated by kinases other than ATM. However, further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of H2AX phosphorylation in response to CPT exposure.\n\n    At 8 dpf, the level of gamma-H2AX was the same as in control, but phospho-ATM (S1981) increased, and 53BP1 decreased in embryos exposed to CPT at gastrulation (24-48 hpf). Exposure to CPT at neurulation (48-72 hpt) did not alter levels of gamma-H2AX, phospho-ATM (S1981), and 53BP1 compared to control. This observation correlates with DNA integrity, viability, and hatching rate. However, we observed decreased mRNA expression of several genes related to DNA repair. The amount of mRNA extracted from extracted from CPT 24-48 embryos was lower than in controls. Therefore, it can be suggested that embryos were delayed and, hence, the level of transcription and protein expression (53BP1) was also lower. Previous results that showed checkpoint activation in fish embryos treated with CPT are consistent with our finding. Furthermore, checkpoint activation is typically associated with increased ATM activity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm that checkpoint activity in sterlet embryos is involved in CPT-induced responses.",

        "Title": "    Toward a Phage Cocktail for Tuberculosis: Susceptibility and Tuberculocidal Action of Mycobacteriophages against Diverse Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains",
        "Abstract": "    The global health burden of human tuberculosis (TB) and the widespread antibiotic resistance of its causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis warrant new strategies for TB control. The successful use of a bacteriophage cocktail to treat a Mycobacterium abscessus infection suggests that phages could play a role in tuberculosis therapy. To assemble a phage cocktail with optimal therapeutic potential for tuberculosis, we have explored mycobacteriophage diversity to identify phages that demonstrate tuberculocidal activity and determined the phage infection profiles for a diverse set of strains spanning the major lineages of human-adapted strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Using a combination of genome engineering and bacteriophage genetics, we have assembled a five-phage cocktail that minimizes the emergence of phage resistance and cross-resistance to multiple phages, and which efficiently kills the M. tuberculosis strains tested. Furthermore, these phages function without antagonizing antibiotic effectiveness, and infect both isoniazid-resistant and -sensitive strains.",
        "Introduction": "    Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis, has plagued humanity for nearly 9,000 years, with the earliest written records of the disease going back more than 3,000 years in India and China. With the advent of antibiotics such as streptomycin and isoniazid, the end of tuberculosis has been heralded since the late 1950s and early 1960s. Unfortunately, since the 1990s there has been a resurgence of tuberculosis worldwide and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and totally drug-resistant (TDR) strains of M. tuberculosis. The lengthy treatment duration, combined with adverse side effects and the relative high cost in developing countries, has resulted in poor compliance with treatment regimens, further fueling the emergence of drug-resistant strains. New antibiotics, including bedaquiline, have been developed, but the need for new therapeutic strategies is clear.\n\n    Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacterial hosts and are the most abundant organisms on the planet. They are genetically diverse with large proportions of genes having no close relatives in extant GenBank entries. More than 2,000 individual mycobacteriophages, viruses that infect Mycobacterium spp. have been isolated and sequenced (https://phagesdb.org), mostly within the Science Education Alliance Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) program. These phages have been organized according to their overall sequence relationships into 29 genomic groups designated clusters A through Z and AA to AC. Some clusters are sufficiently diverse to warrant division into subclusters; for example, cluster A contains 20 subclusters (A1 to A20). In addition, there are currently nine \"singleton\" (sin) mycobacteriophages, each with no close relative.\n\n    Bacteriophages infecting M. tuberculosis were first isolated in the 1950s and have been used to type clinical isolates. Four major subtypes of M. tuberculosis (A, B, C, and I) have been described, each of which differs in their phage susceptibility profiles. These early typing studies noted the association of M. tuberculosis phage types with particular human populations and geographical origins, and reported that different phage types exhibit various levels of virulence. However, little was known about the genetic relationships of these typing phages and many are now lost or unavailable. Taking advantage of a larger mycobacteriophage collection, genomic information, and host range analyses of 220 mycobacteriophages showed a close relationship between cluster designation and host range. Specifically, subcluster A2, A3, K1, K2, K3, K4, and G1 phages are able to infect M. tuberculosis mc27000, an avirulent derivative of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. However, this phage collection has expanded considerably since these analyses were reported in 2012.\n\n    The M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) includes Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium canettii, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, Mycobacterium orygis, Mycobacterium caprae, Mycobacterium pinnipedii, Mycobacterium suricattae, and Mycobacterium mungi, in addition to M. tuberculosis. These are obligate pathogens that cause tuberculosis and tuberculosis-like infections in humans and animals and likely diverged from a common ancestor in Africa during the Neolithic age. The human-adapted strains can be grouped into nine distinct lineages found in different parts of the world. Lineages L1, L2, L3, L4, and L7 are M. tuberculosis sensu stricto, and L5, L6, and L9 are M. africanum. Lineages L2 and L4 are widespread, with L2 predominating in Asia and L4 being the most common lineage found in Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Lineages L1 and L3 are found in South Asia and Africa near the Indian Ocean and L7 is restricted to Ethiopia. The M. africanum lineages L5 and L6 are only found in western Africa, and account for as many as 50% of the cases of tuberculosis in that region. Lineages L8 and L9 have been recently described and are very rare. L8 is thought to have diverged early from the common ancestor of the human-adapted M. tuberculosis complex; L9 (also M. africanum) is closely related to L6, but is only found in eastern Africa. Epidemiological studies suggest that lineages 2 and 4 may be more virulent than lineages 1 and 3, and lineage 2 strains are commonly drug resistant. Additionally, lineages 2 and 4 may be readily transmissible, although the molecular bases are unclear.\n\n    Bacteriophages have been used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, notably in the former Soviet Union and its successor states. The first successful use of phages to treat a mycobacterial infection was in a 15-year-old with cystic fibrosis with a disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus infection after a bilateral lung transplant; a three-phage cocktail was administered intravenously without the emergence of phage resistance. The phages were identified by screening M. smegmatis phages for the small subset with host ranges that include M. abscessus, as few phages have been isolated using M. abscessus directly. However, most mycobacteriophages are temperate and two of the phages needed to be engineered to ensure lytic growth and efficient antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, there is substantial variation in phage susceptibility among clinical isolates of M. abscessus, and the cocktail used successfully in the one patient is not suitable for other patients. The complex and highly variable plasmid and prophage content may influence the phage infection profiles by expressing viral defense systems. Nonetheless, the success of this intervention lends weight to the concept that there may be a role for phages in tuberculosis control. Prophylactic prevention of M. tuberculosis growth following phage aerosolization in mice offers further support.\n\n    The therapeutic potential of phages for treating tuberculosis has not been thoroughly explored, in part because relatively few phages are available. Thus, little is known about variation in susceptibility and killing of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates in different lineages, mechanisms of phage resistance, or interactions between phages and antibiotics. Moreover, the virulence, slow growth (24 h doubling time), and propensity for cellular clumping present substantial challenges to detailed phage investigations using M. tuberculosis. Here, we screened an expanded panel for new phages that infect M. tuberculosis, enhanced potentially useful phages by genome engineering and host range manipulation, and defined variations in phage infection in a suite of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. By defining patterns and mechanisms of phage resistance and interactions with antibiotics, we have assembled a five-phage cocktail that efficiently kills all of the tested M. tuberculosis strains and which can be used to evaluate phage therapy for human tuberculosis.",
        "Methods": "    M. smegmatis mc2155 is a laboratory stock strain and was grown as previously described. M. tuberculosis strains were obtained from Sebastien Gagneux Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute. Liquid cultures were grown by inoculating isolated colonies in 10 ml Middlebrook 7H9 media with oleic albumin dextrose catalase (OADC) (Becton, Dickinson) and 0.05% Tween 80 until visibly dispersed (10 days to 3 weeks) at 37 C with shaking. Lineage 5 and 6 strains were further supplemented with 40 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Strains were grown on solid Middlebrook 7H11 agar (Difco, Remel) supplemented with OADC and 1 mM CaCl2 for 2 to 6 weeks at 37 C .\n\n    Phage lysates were 10-fold serially diluted and 3 mul were spotted onto top agar overlays containing 0.5 to 1 ml of M. smegmatis mc2155 or an M. tuberculosis strain using Middlebrook 7H11 with 0.7% agar for M. tuberculosis and Middlebrook 7H10 with 0.35% agar for M. smegmatis. Plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 to 48 h for M. smegmatis or 2 to 8 weeks for M. tuberculosis, until visible lawns were obtained. Plates were photographed and analyzed for plaque formation.\n\n    Lysates were made from plaques forming on M. tuberculosis strains. Lysates on M. smegmatis were amplified under BSL3 conditions and were filtered twice using 0.2-mum filters. Aliquots of lysates (1 ml) were serially diluted and plated onto agar lawns for isolated plaques. Isolated plaques (n = 8 to16) were picked using a 0.2 to 10 mul micropipette tip into 50 mul of phage buffer in 0.2-ml PCR strip tubes. An aliquot of 5 mul containing phage particles picked from agar was used as the template for PCR utilizing Muddy gp24-specific primers (Table S2) along with Q5 master mix (New England BioLabs) following PCR according to the manufacturer's enzyme conditions. Amplicons were verified by gel electrophoresis and were sequenced (Genewiz).\n\n    Fred313_cpmDelta33 was constructed using bacteriophage recombineering of electroporated DNA (BRED) as described previously using a 500-bp gBlock substrate containing 250 bp of homology upstream and downstream of gene 33. Approximately 400 ng of substrate and 250 ng of Fred313_cpm DNA were electroporated into competent recombineering M. smegmatis mc2155 cells induced with acetamide. Primary and secondary plaques were screened using PCR with flanking primers yielding either a 1,634-bp or 536-bp product wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively. A homogenous mutant was purified, amplified, and sequenced. All oligonucleotides are provided in Table S2.\n\n    To assess killing of individual phages at 107 PFU, phage titers were normalized to 1 x 109 PFU per milliliter (PFU/ml). In a 96-well plate (Falcon), 20 mul of each phage (one per row) was added to a total volume of 200 mul consisting of Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with OADC and 1 mM CaCl2, and the bacterial strain, grown until visibly dispersed (OD600 of >=0.1) and 10-fold serially diluted to 10-1 to 10-4. The bottom row of each 96-well plate contained bacteria and no phage. To assess killing of 104 PFU, the phage lysate was normalized to 105 PFU and then the same procedure was followed as detailed above. The plates were sealed and incubated without shaking at 37 C for 96 h. Each well was mixed by pipetting and then 3 mul was spotted onto Middlebrook 7H11 plates containing 1 mM CaCl2 and OADC and the plates incubated for 3 weeks at 37 C before imaging.\n\n    Phage titers were normalized to 1 x 108 PFU/ml and 20 mul of each phage were combined into a cocktail. Liquid bacterial cultures were grown and aliquoted into 96-well plates as described above; the cocktail was serially diluted such that each row contained from 107 to 103 PFU total phage. Approximately 20 mul of serially diluted M. tuberculosis (~5 x 108 CFU/ml) from undiluted to a 10-4 dilution was added to each plate column. Plates were sealed and incubated standing at 37 C. At 24, 48, and 96 h and 1 week of time, the 96-well plates were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 2 min to remove condensation from the sealing film using a bio-liner swing bucket rotor (Thermo). Cultures were resuspended using a multichannel pipet and 3 mul aliquots were spotted onto Middlebrook 7H11 plates supplemented with OADC and 1 mM CaCl2 and incubated for 3 to 4 weeks at 37 C.\n\n    Approximately 100 mul of bacterial cultures at OD of ~0.1 to 0.2 was added to tubes containing 1 ml of 7H9 supplemented with OADC and 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 x 107 to 1 x 108 PFU of phage. After incubation with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 C for 1 week, cells were pelleted at 5,000 x g for 10 min, resuspended in 100 mul 7H9 OADC, and spread onto 7H11 plates containing OADC. Plates were incubated for 4 to 8 weeks and surviving colonies restreaked onto 7H11 OADC plates. Colonies that grew without evidence of lysis were inoculated into liquid culture and tested for phage sensitivity.\n\n    Approximately 3 mul of phage lysates (109 to 1011 PFU/ml) were spotted onto lawns of phage-resistant mutants and individual plaques picked and replated on the resistant mutant and M. smegmatis mc2155 to determine the EOP. Plaques were picked from the M. smegmatis mc2155 lawn and replated on the M. tuberculosis resistant mutant. True-breeding escape mutants were amplified and sequenced.\n\n    Middlebrook 7H11 plates were prepared to contain rifampin (Sigma; 0.1 mug/ml) or 0.2 mug/ml isoniazid (Sigma; 0.2 mug/ml). Phage lysate diluted to 105 PFU in 0.1 ml was spread onto 7H11 plates with or without antibiotics and allowed to dry in a laminar flow biosafety cabinet; 0.1 ml of an M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture was then spread into plates and incubated for 6 weeks at 37 C.\n\n    Extraction of M. tuberculosis and phage DNAs was as described previously. Bacterial and phage genomes were sequenced using Illumina technology as described previously, and details of the sequenced strains are shown in Table S3. Sequence reads of mutants were aligned to parent sequences in CLC Genomics Workbench 11 (Qiagen), and variants were detected using CLC's Basic Variant Detection module and confirmed in Consed version 29.\n\n    GenBank accession numbers for M. tuberculosis phage-resistant isolates CG20 to CG25 are available in Table S3.\n\n    This article is a direct contribution from Graham F.

Toward a phage cocktail for tuberculosis: susceptibility and tuberculocidal action of mycobacteriophages against diverse Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. mBio 12:e00973-21. https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00973-21.",
        "Results": "    Many sequenced mycobacteriophage isolates were shown previously to efficiently infect M. tuberculosis mc27000 (an avirulent derivative of H37Rv), but they belong to a few clusters/subclusters (specifically A2, A3, G, K1, K2, and K3). Although phage BPs (cluster G1) does not efficiently infect mc27000, host range mutants containing single amino acid substitutions in the tail gene (gene 22) can be readily isolated. Seven of twelve phages used previously in M. tuberculosis typing studies have recently been sequenced, four (DNA III, Clark, Sedge, and Legendre) are cluster G phages based on BLAST analysis of the published genomes; two (BK1 and GS4E) are in subclusters A1 and A2, respectively, and the seventh is the singleton M. tuberculosis-specific phage DS6A (Table S1 in the supplemental material). The report that phage BK1 (subcluster A1) infects M. tuberculosis H37Rv is in sharp contrast to the finding that 24 subcluster A1 phages tested previously do not.\n\n    To further analyze the phage susceptibility of M. tuberculosis, we screened representatives of M. smegmatis clusters/subclusters identified since 2012 (Table 1) for their efficiency of plaquing (EOP) on virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv relative to M. smegmatis mc2155, on which they were isolated (Fig. 1). We also included engineered lytic derivatives from temperate phages reported previously to infect M. tuberculosis, in which the repressor gene is removed (Fig. 1); for some of these (e.g., AdephagiaDelta41Delta43 and FionnbharthDelta45Delta47) (Table 1) the integrase gene is also deleted. As reported previously, DS6A, a singleton, infects M. tuberculosis H37Rv but not M. smegmatis, but none of the other singleton M. smegmatis phages infect H37Rv (Fig. 1). However, phage Muddy (cluster AB) efficiently infects M. tuberculosis H37Rv and forms large clear plaques. Settecandela and Phrappuccino (both cluster AA) also infect H37Rv but are temperate and form extremely turbid plaques reflecting high lysogenization frequencies (Fig. 1); clear plaque variants of these phages have not yet been isolated. None of the other newly isolated phages (representatives of clusters T, M, W, X, Y, Z, and AC, subclusters A10, A11, A15, A16, and A19, and three singletons) efficiently infect M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 1). AdephagiaDelta41Delta43, ZoeJDelta45, and FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 (subclusters K1, K2, and K4, respectively), D29 (A2), two host range mutants of BPs (BPsDelta33HTH_HRMH37Rv-1 and BPsDelta33HTH_HRMH37Rv-2, subcluster G1; Table 1), and both subcluster A3 phages (Isca_cpm and Fred313_cpmDelta33, see below) also efficiently infect M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 1). The temperate phage Isca (A3) was originally isolated on M. abscessus strain GD01, and here we use Isca_cpm, a naturally occurring lytic derivative in which the repressor gene is defective.\n\n    Screening of M. smegmatis phages for those that infect M. abscessus GD01 identified phages Itos and Gabriela (both in subcluster L2) as potentially having a broad host range. However, subcluster L2 phages also vary greatly in their response to prophage-mediated defense systems. We therefore selected a set of 12 different L2 phages to screen against M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 1). Most show no infection, although Gabriela infects at a reduced EOP (10-3). This is consistent with the report that the subcluster L2 phage Celfi infects M. tuberculosis mc26230, a derivative of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The genomic basis for these differences is unclear, as subcluster L2 genomes are very closely related to each other. Taken together, these data show that one or more phages within clusters/subclusters A2, A3, G1, K1, K2, K4, L2, AA, and AB and the singleton DS6A are able to infect M. tuberculosis H37Rv and are candidates for having therapeutic potential. It is striking that, with the exception of Muddy, all of these are temperate or lytic derivatives of temperate phages.\n\n    Unfortunately, the relationship between the historic phage types of M. tuberculosis and the contemporary genomic lineages is not known, although some assumptions could be made based on their geographical origin because MTBC members are highly sympatric. To explore phage susceptibility profiles of extant M. tuberculosis isolates, we obtained a set of reference strains with several representatives of lineages L1 to L6 (Table 2); all but one are part of the human MTBC reference set. Strain N0153 (L1), also known as T83, differs from its relative N0157 in its methylation pattern and lacks the prophage-like element phiRv2. Sixteen strains were successfully propagated and together with M. tuberculosis H37Rv (L4) were tested for sensitivity to phages that infect M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 2, Table 3). These include at least three strains in lineages L1, L2, L3, and L4 belonging to M. tuberculosis sensu stricto and three members of M. africanum lineages L5/L6 (Table 2, Table 3), spanning the sublineage designations where known (Table 2).\n\n    The phage infection patterns of these strains have several notable features (Fig. 2, Table 3). First, most of the strains are infected by multiple phages, with the notable exception of N0031 (L2), which is only infected efficiently by FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 (Fig. 2, Table 3). Second, some phages discriminate between strains, including Fred313_cpmDelta33, which does not efficiently infect N0031 (L2), N1063 (L5), or lineage 6 strains, and Muddy, which does not efficiently infect any L1, L3, L5, or L6 strains, N0031 (L2), or lineage 4 strains N0136 and N1283 (Fig. 2, Table 3); on some strains (e.g., N0145), Muddy plaques are noticeably more turbid than on H37Rv (Fig. 2), reflecting the phenotype observed on M. smegmatis. In addition, the BPs host range mutants (HRMs; BPsDelta33HTH_HRMH37Rv-1, and BPsDelta33HTH_HRMH37Rv-2) are strictly restricted to H37Rv infection, and do not efficiently infect any other strain (Fig. 2, Table 3).\n\n    Although Muddy poorly infects some M. tuberculosis strains, plaques were observed on several of these strains when high titers were plated. Plaques were picked from plating of Muddy on N0157 (L1) and N0052 (L2; from noticeably clear plaques at high titer), recovered on M. smegmatis, and further characterized. DNA sequence analysis (see below) showed the Muddy lysate derived from N0157 was a mixture of two phages carrying different mutations, which were separated and purified. Following purification, the three host range mutants (HRMs) were designated Muddy_HRMN0157-1, Muddy_HRMN0157-2, and Muddy_HRMN0052-1 (Table 1). All three mutants retain the ability to infect M. smegmatis, and lysates prepared on M. smegmatis efficiently infect the M. tuberculosis strain they were isolated on. Complete genome sequencing showed that all three derivatives have distinct single base changes in the putative tail gene 24 (G21064T, A21427G, and G21643A), conferring amino acid substitutions G487W, T608A, and E680K, respectively, all within a predicted extended beta-sheet at the C terminus of the gp24 protein (Fig. 3A). All three HRMs infect all M. tuberculosis strains tested with an EOP of one relative to M. smegmatis, with the exception of Muddy_HRMN0052-1, which has a slight EOP reduction (~10-1) on strains N0004 (L3), N0145 (L2), and N0136 (L4) (Fig. 3B, Table 3). The host range expansion conferred by these substitutions is impressive in broadening their infection to all of the other L1 to L4 strains tested (Fig. 3, Table 3), including infection of strain N0031 by Muddy_HRMN0052-1, which was otherwise only infected by FionnbharthDelta45Delta47.\n\n    Targeted PCR screening and sequencing of additional Muddy plaques picked from strains L0072 (L1), N0004 (L3), and N1283 (L4) showed that each had one of the same three substitutions in gp24. Plaques derived from strains N0072 and N0004 have the T608A and G487W substitutions, respectively, and plaques derived from N1283 had both the G487W and E680K mutations. Interestingly, although wild-type (WT) Muddy infects strain N1216 relatively well (Table 3), and without the turbidity observed for the L2 strains (e.g., N0145, Fig. 3), one out of eight plaques screened also had the E680K mutation. These three substitutions thus appear to be the primary changes capable of expanding the host range of Muddy to include all of the M. tuberculosis L1 to L4 strains tested here. For strain N1063 (L5), all three mutations confer some improvement in infection, but for strain N1202, WT Muddy and the mutants infect at similarly reduced efficiencies (Table 3).\n\n    Little is known about mycobacteriophage receptors and the frequency or mechanisms of phage resistance. Prior studies have shown that overexpression of the M. smegmatis mpr (multiple-phage-resistance) locus confers resistance of M. smegmatis to phages D29 and L5, and interruptions in glycopeptidolipid (GPL) synthesis confer M. smegmatis resistance to phage I3. To determine the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive phage infections, ~107 CFU of each strain were challenged with phages at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 to 10 in liquid culture, incubated for 1 week, and then plated on solid medium for bacterial growth. This analysis included H37Rv and a representative strain from lineages L1 to L4, with five phages from those identified above that infect these strains efficiently (Fig. 4A).\n\n    For many strain-phage combinations, the killing efficiency is impressive, and few, if any, survivors are recovered (Fig. 4A). The notable exceptions are the survivors seen on D29 infection of N0052 (L2) and N1274 (L3), and the Fred313_cpm infection of N1283 (L4) and H37Rv (L4) (Fig. 4A). We estimate that the survivor frequencies are <10-5 in each instance. Surviving colonies were picked wherever possible, restreaked, grown in liquid cultures and tested for resistance. Although phage Muddy_HRMN0052-1 (gp24 E680K) efficiently kills all of the tested strains with nearly no survivors, a few very small colonies were observed, although these could not be further propagated and retested. We were similarly unable to recover genetically stable D29-resistant mutants (colonies either did not grow or retested as being D29 susceptible). In contrast, two resistant strains to AdephagiaDelta41Delta43 (from H37Rv and N1283), a Fionnbharth-resistant mutant of H37Rv, and three Fred313_cpm-resistant mutants (two in H37Rv and one in N1283) were isolated (Fig. 5A).\n\n    Sequencing of the resistant mutants and their sensitive parent strains identified mutations likely responsible for resistance to Adephagia and Fionnbharth (Table 2). The H37Rv Adephagia-resistant mutant CG20 has a single base deletion (C1939970Delta) in gene Rv1712 (cmk) coding for a cytidylate kinase, and the frameshift (at codon 132) likely inactivates Rv1712, although it could also be polar on the downstream gene Rv1713 coding for EngA. The H37Rv Fionnbharth-resistant mutant CG21 has a T1166874C mutation in a short, highly expressed noncoding region immediately upstream of Rv1043C, a putative serine protease. It is unclear if this region codes for a small regulatory RNA product or a small leader peptide, but it suggests an intriguing resistance mechanism. Multiple nucleotide changes were observed in the CG22 mutant and the cause of the resistant phenotype could not be readily determined. It is unclear whether these mutants indirectly alter the cell surface and prevent efficient phage adsorption, or if they influence phage metabolism after DNA injection.\n\n    Finally, sequencing of the Fred313_cpm-resistant mutants CG23, CG24, and CG25 showed that all three have complex and scrambled arrangements of Fred313_cpm DNA segments integrated at the attB site. At least for CG23 and CG24, we could not identify any mutations elsewhere, suggesting that these integrated prophage fragments are responsible for the resistance phenotype. The integrated phage fragments presumably lack lytic or inhibitory activity but could be associated with the resistant phenotype. At the time of this experiment, the integrase-deleted strain of Fred313_cpm had not been constructed. This is an important finding, as it strongly indicates that if lytic derivatives of temperate phages are to be used therapeutically, it would be prudent to delete not only the repressor gene, but also the integrase gene. We thus constructed the integrase-defective derivative Fred313_cpmDelta33 using BRED engineering (Fig. 4B) and this derivative was used in all other experiments reported here. Although further analysis of the numbers and types of resistance mechanisms is warranted, these observations enable examination of cross-resistance patterns, which are critical for defining compositions of phage cocktails.\n\n    The six resistant mutants (CG20 to CG25) were propagated and tested for sensitivity to other M. tuberculosis phages (Fig. 5). In general, there are few examples of cross-resistance and they mostly occur between closely related phages (in either the same cluster or subcluster). For example, in testing CG20 and CG21 (resistant to Adephagia and Fionnbharth, respectively) for sensitivity against a panel of potentially useful phages, CG21 is resistant to Adephagia (subcluster K1) as well as Fionnbharth (subcluster K4) (Fig. 5A). However, the pattern is nonreciprocal, as CG20 remains largely sensitivity to Fionnbharth, albeit with a reduced EOP (Fig. 5A); the Adephagia-resistant mutant derived from N1283 (Table 2) also remains sensitive to Fionnbharth (Fig. 5B). All of these mutants are sensitive to ZoeJ (subcluster K2). Thus, cross-resistance within a cluster can be observed, but phages in different subclusters can have distinct sensitivities to the resistant mutants. Similarly, all three of the Fred313_cpm (subcluster A3) resistant mutants are also resistant to Isca (subcluster A3), and the N1283-derived mutant CG25 is also resistant to D29 (subcluster A2; Fig. 5B and C). In a relatively uncommon incidence of trans-cluster resistance, CG20 is also resistant to Gabriella (subcluster L2) (Fig. 5A). We note that all of the mutants tested are sensitive to DS6A, ZoeJDelta45, and Muddy_HRMN0052-1; Fig. 5C).\n\n    Using the information gained from the cross-resistance studies, we examined the tuberculocidal activity of both individual phages and a cocktail of phages. Cultures of representative M. tuberculosis strains were grown until visibly turbid (optical density [OD] of ~0.1), serially diluted, and incubated with individual phages in liquid medium for 96 h. These were then plated onto solid medium for growth of survivors (Fig. 6A). Most of the individual phages killed the strains quite efficiently, even with a relatively modest input concentration of phage (107 PFU, although killing was often incomplete at the highest input bacterial concentration). For strain N0004, growth was only observed for the least dilute sample of the control, and the killing efficiency is less clear. Muddy WT did not kill any strain well, and the Muddy host range mutants did not efficiently kill N0145 (Fig. 6A).\n\n    We then tested the tuberculocidal activity of a cocktail of five phages, AdephagiaDelta41Delta43, D29, FionnbharthDelta45Delta47, Fred313_cpmDelta33, and Muddy_HRMN0157-2, the phages used above to test for resistance (but substituting Fred313_cpmDelta33 for Fred313_cpm; Fig. 4). This combination of phages maximizes the proportion of strains that are infected and killed by more than one phage and thus minimizes the risks of resistance emerging (Table 3). M. tuberculosis H37Rv and representative strains of lineages L1 to L4 (N0153, N0145, N0004, and N0136) were incubated with the phage cocktail at a range of 107 to103 total PFU for 7 days and then plated on solid medium for bacterial growth (Fig. 6B). Very strong killing and little or no survival at any concentration of phage or bacteria was observed, with the exception of the lowest phage concentration with strain N0136 (Fig. 6B). We also tested a similar cocktail (substituting Muddy HRMN0157-1 for Muddy HRMN0052-1) with strains N0052 (L4), N0054 (L4), and N1283 (L4) with similar results, and as few as 105 PFU input phage gave substantial killing within 24 h (Fig. S1). Although the cocktail likely could be further enhanced with other phage combinations, the tuberculolcidal activity is impressive and is strongly encouraging for therapeutic use.\n\n    Potential therapeutic use of phages for tuberculosis is likely to be accompanied by antibiotic treatment. It is therefore important that antibiotics, especially the commonly used isoniazid and rifampin, do not antagonize phage growth and killing. To test this, H37Rv was plated on solid medium with sub-MICs of either isoniazid or rifampin alone, or each of the drugs together with 105 PFU FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 (Fig. 7). In all antibiotic-phage combinations, similar levels of killing were observed, and there was no evidence of antagonism, reflecting what has been reported in M. smegmatis. Under these conditions, it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about synergistic or additive effects of antibiotic and phage, but we note that the few surviving colonies with the FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 challenge are not observed when rifampin is included, suggesting the effects are at least additive. Similarly, fewer surviving colonies are recovered after challenge with both isoniazid and FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 than with either alone. In this instance, the lack of antagonism between phage and antibiotics is particularly encouraging, as it suggests that adjunctive phage therapy with ongoing antibiotic treatment is unlikely to cause a poor outcome due to antibiotic interference.\n\n    It is also important that therapeutically useful phages are able to infect antibiotic-resistant as well as antibiotic-sensitive strains. Because isoniazid inhibits cell wall mycolic acid synthesis and isoniazid resistance is common via loss of KatG function, we compared the phage susceptibility of a katG (del 371g) isoniazid-resistant strain (mc24977) with H37Rv (Fig. 8). Only small differences in phage susceptibility were observed, including a slight difference in the infection with Fred313_cpmDelta33 (Fig. 8). Interestingly, the parent BPsDelta33HTH phage, which does not infect H37Rv well, appears to infect mc24977 quite efficiently (Fig. 8). Because drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains accumulate individual target gene mutations rather than defects in single-locus drug exporters, it is relatively unlikely that other drug-resistant strains will have markedly different phage infection profiles.\n\n    Because phage resistance is a concern in any clinical phage application, we determined if phage derivatives can be isolated that escape resistance (Fig. 9). When plating FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 on CG21 (a Fionnbharth-resistant mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv), we observed two healthy growing plaques (from ~108 PFU input phage). These were purified, retested, and shown to be escape mutants (CG-REM-1 and CG-REM-2) that infect the resistant strain as efficiently as the parent H37Rv strain (Fig. 9C). Whole-genome sequencing showed that both mutants have nonsynonymous base changes (G21203A and G21202C in CG-REM-1 and CG-REM-2, respectively) conferring G93R and G93D substitutions in the minor tail protein, gp26 (Fig. 9B).The minor tail protein gp26 is highly conserved in cluster K phages, including Adephagia gp25 and ZoeJ gp21 (Fig. 9A), and there are related proteins in many other mycobacteriophages. Interestingly, although CG21 is resistant to both Fionnbharth and Adephagia, it remains sensitive to ZoeJ (Fig. 5A). The isolation of resistant escape mutants presents a potentially powerful response to the emergence of phage resistance.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    There is considerable clinical potential for using mycobacteriophages in tuberculosis control, as diagnostic reporter phages, for prophylactic interruption of TB transmission, or for therapeutic treatment of infections. All of these are advanced by identification of particular phage candidates, elucidating mechanisms of resistance and cross-resistance, and determining variations in infection for different strains and genetic lineages. The potential for therapeutic use of phages for controlling TB infections directly is unclear because of the complexities of the infections in which the pathogen lives intracellularly in macrophages, and within inaccessible granulomas. Nonetheless, at late stages of infection there are often substantial numbers of extracellular bacteria that should be phage-accessible, and the successful therapy of an M. abscessus infection provides substantial encouragement. Nonetheless, the phage infection profiles in an infected person may not directly correlate with the in vitro susceptibilities reported here. However, resolving this question will likely require clinical trials, compassionate use interventions, or evaluation in nonhuman primates. In addition, future studies will be needed to more fully explore phage-antibiotic interactions with an expanded repertoire of phages, drugs, and M. tuberculosis strains.\n\n    One potential advantage of phage control of M. tuberculosis is that there is relatively little variation among clinical isolates in terms of phage susceptibility compared to other pathogens such as M. abscessus. The early phage typing studies showed that some phages infect a broad range of M. tuberculosis isolates, although other phages discriminate between some strains. Here, we have expanded this in the context of genomically defined phages and broadened the available phages through a combination of engineering and genetics. These studies suggest that a cocktail containing as few as five phages, as shown here, might be suitable for use in clinical trials for phage efficacy and safety. Moreover, the phage cocktail could be deployed with minimal concerns of failure due to resistance, and without the need to prescreen patient isolates for phage susceptibility, a process that would be technically and logistically challenging with such slow-growing bacteria. Having confidence in the ability of a five-phage cocktail to kill a very high proportion of strains offers a substantial advantage over almost every other pathogen for which phage therapy is contemplated.\n\n    The five-phage cocktail tested here is likely to undergo further refinement prior to clinical evaluation. For example, ZoeJDelta45 could substitute for Adephagia, as it showed no cross-resistance to Fionnbharth, and one of the FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 resistance escape mutants (e.g., CG21) could replace FionnbharthDelta45Delta47 as a means of further reducing resistance. A case can also be made for inclusion of DS6A, which broadly infects and kills the tested strains. Two potential caveats are that DS6A processes an integration cassette, which should be removed, and that it needs to be amplified and propagated on a slow-growing MTBC strain, which is time-consuming and challenging at large scale. There is also potential for additional phages to be developed, including lytic variants of Gabriela and Settecandela, although in general these cluster AA phages did not perform as well as others. It is surprising that the BPsDelta33HTH_HRM mutants that infect H37Rv do not infect other M. tuberculosis strains, but it may be possible to isolate new host range mutants that expand the utility of BPs derivatives.\n\n    Although the phages and the cocktail tested here killed most of the tested strains, the exception is lineage 6, for which one of the tested strains was susceptible (N0091) but not the other (N1202) (Table 3). However, L6 strains are found in limited geographical regions and represent only a small minority of all tuberculosis infections; however, early clinical trials may need to avoid the regions where L6 strains are prevalent. There are additional lineages we have not yet tested, including L7, L8, and L9, although L7 is also rare and is restricted to Ethiopia, and both L8 and L9 have been reported from very few individual patients. It would also be helpful to examine a much broader set of clinical isolates and more drug-resistant strains, especially those in lineages L2, and L4, which are more diverse, more virulent, and more likely to become drug resistant. Nonetheless, the broad coverage provided by these phages, especially among the diverse L2 and L4 strains, encourages us to consider it unlikely there will be large swaths of M. tuberculosis strains that that are not infected and killed by at least a subset of the cocktail phages.\n\n    Of the phages described here, only Muddy is a naturally lytic phage. All of the others are either naturally occurring or engineered lytic derivatives of temperate parent phages; all are siphoviral. Thus, the available phage \"space\" available for tuberculosis therapy is quite distinct from many other bacterial pathogens, for which lytic myoviruses and podoviruses have been widely used. This does appear to be an impediment, and engineering strategies can be used to convert the temperate phages into lytic phages through removal of the repressor gene. However, our finding that survivors of a Fred313_cpm challenge carry integrated phage genome segments suggests it is advisable to also remove the integrase genes. Fortunately, recombineering tools applied in the BRED and newer CRISPY-BRED methods provides simple and effective ways of doing so.\n\n    With the identification of a set of phages that efficiently infect and kill a broad range of M. tuberculosis strains with seemingly low resistance frequencies, infrequent cross-resistance, and that work together with antibiotics and infect antibiotic-resistant strains, there are now few impediments to clinical evaluation of bacteriophages for relief of tuberculosis. Whether such therapy might be broadly applicable or restricted to a narrow spectrum of disease states is not clear, but with the excellent safety profile of phages in humans, these questions now can be addressed.",

        "Title": "    Clinical, molecular and glycophenotype insights in SLC39A8-CDG",
        "Abstract": "    SLC39A8, a gene located on chromosome 4q24, encodes for the manganese (Mn) transporter ZIP8 and its detrimental variants cause a type 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). The common SLC39A8 missense variant A391T is associated with increased risk for multiple neurological and systemic disorders and with decreased serum Mn. Patients with SLC39A8-CDG present with different clinical and neuroradiological features linked to variable transferrin glycosylation profile. Galactose and Mn supplementation therapy results in the biochemical and clinical amelioration of treated patients.\n\n    Here, we report clinical manifestations, neuroradiological features and glycophenotypes associated with novel SLC39A8 variants (c.1048G > A; p.Gly350Arg and c.131C > G; p.Ser44Trp) in two siblings of the same Italian family. Furthermore, we describe a third patient with overlapping clinical features harbouring the homozygous missense variant A391T. The clinical phenotype of the three patients was characterized by severe developmental disability, dystonic postural pattern and dyskinesia with a more severe progression of the disease in the two affected siblings. Neuroimaging showed a Leigh syndrome-like pattern involving the basal ganglia, thalami and white matter. In the two siblings, atrophic cerebral and cerebellum changes consistent with SLC39A8-CDG were detected as well. Serum transferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF) yielded variable results with slight increase of trisialotransferrin isoforms or even normal pattern. MALDI-MS showed the presence of hypogalactosylated transferrin N-glycans, spontaneously decreasing during the disease course, only in one affected sibling. Total serum N-glycome depicted a distinct pattern for the three patients, with increased levels of undergalactosylated and undersialylated precursors of fully sialylated biantennary glycans, including the monosialo-monogalacto-biantennary species A2G1S1.\n\n    Clinical, MRI and glycosylation features of patients are consistent with SLC39A8-CDG. We document two novel variants associated with Leigh syndrome-like disease presentation of SLC39A8-CDG. We show, for the first time, a severe neurological phenotype overlapping with that described for SLC39A8-CDG in association with the homozygous A391T missense variant. We observed a spontaneous amelioration of transferrin N-glycome, highlighting the efficacy of MS-based serum glycomics as auxiliary tool for the diagnosis and clinical management of therapy response in patients with SLC39A8-CDG. Further studies are needed to analyse more in depth the influence of SLC39A8 variants, including the common missense variant, on the expression and function of ZIP8 protein, and their impact on clinical, biochemical and neuroradiological features.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13023-021-01941-y.",
        "Introduction": "    SLC39A8, a gene located on chromosome 4q24, encodes for the manganese (Mn) transporter ZIP8, which plays a major role in regulating Mn homeostasis in blood and tissues. Mn is an essential trace element and has a major role as cofactor for various enzymes (e.g. pyruvate carboxylase, arginase, superoxide dismutase-2, glutamine synthase and glycosyltransferases) .\n\n    Since Mn is a cofactor for beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, SLC39A8 variants are associated with a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), characterized by deficient galactosylation of glycan chains of glycoproteins. Moreover, the common SLC39A8 variant rs13107325 (C   T) in exon 8 (A391T), is associated with increased risk for other neurological and systemic disorders, and with decreased serum Mn.\n\n    CDG are inborn errors of metabolism characterized by improper glycosylation of glycoconjugates. Protein glycosylation defects are caused by genetic variants in the N- and/or O-glycosylation pathways. Serum transferrin isoelectric focusing (IEF) and capillary electrophoresis (CDT) are the conventional laboratory tests for the N-glycosylation defects associated with sialic acid deficiency. These blood measurements enable to distinguish between CDG-I (cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum defects of N-glycan assembly) and CDG-II (Golgi processing defects). So far fourteen subjects with SLC39A8-CDG have been reported. Most patients exhibited a serum Tf IEF type 2 pattern and/or low to undetectable blood Mn levels and elevated Mn urine levels, consistent with renal wasting. The variability in Mn blood levels among the affected patients is likely due to partial compensation by other transporters, to different effects of SLC39A8 variants on Mn homeostasis and to variations of Mn levels as result of the dietary intake.\n\n    SLC39A8-CDG presents with developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, seizures, and cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy. Dystonia and basal ganglia T2-hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also part of the neurological spectrum. SLC39A8-CDG features have been related to both Mn deficiency and hypoglycosylation. In particular, SLC39A8-CDG may present with the clinical, biochemical and neuroradiological features of Leigh syndrome-like mitochondrial disease, probably due to reduced activity of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD), a reactive species scavenger in mitochondria. Since hypoglycosylation in SLC39A8 deficiency is secondary to a defect of galactosylation, galactose supplementation (in combination with uridine) was reported to improve transferrin glycosylation. More recently, Mn-II-sulfate supplementation was found to ameliorate both biochemical (e.g., improvement of glycosylation of serum transferrin and normalization of blood and urinary Mn levels) and clinical features (e.g. improved motor abilities, ataxia, muscle strength, postural control, frequency and severity of epilepsy, vision, hearing and swallowing). Appropriate Mn supplementation was not associated with clinical or neuroradiological signs of manganism (e.g. psychiatric symptoms or Mn deposition in basal ganglia with associated dystonia); however, close monitoring of the patients is recommended. Transferrin glycosylation analyses may represent a useful marker to establish the therapeutic dose of Mn.\n\n    Due to the paucity of studies on clinical, glycosylation and molecular correlates of SLC39A8-CDG, further insights are warranted to better characterize this disorder, also in light of possible therapeutic interventions.\n\n    We describe clinical and neuroradiological features, and the glycophenotypes associated with novel SLC39A8 variants (Family 1, Patient-1 and Patient-2) and with the already known SLC39A8 homozygous missense variant p.Ala391Thr (Family 2, Patient-3).",
        "Methods": "    The study was based solely on information and investigations that were carried out as part of the routine clinical care of CDG patients. Informed consent was signed by the parents.\n\n    Next Generation sequence (NGS) analyses were undertaken in study patients to elucidate underlying mechanisms of severe generalized dystonia and global developmental delay.\n\n    Array-CGH analysis was performed on an Agilent 60 K platform with a resolution of 100 kb. Mitochondrial gene analyses (e.g. MTDN1, MTDN2, MTDN3, MTDN4L, MTDN4, MTDN5, MTDN6, ECHS1) (Patient-1) were performed by use of PCR-amplification and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA. Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing (Patient-3) was performed by massive parallel sequencing using NexteraXT technology (Illumina, San Diego, CA). CDG panel analysis (Patient-1) was performed by massive parallel sequencing covering all exons and their flanking intronic regions (+- 20 bp) for 79 genes associated with CDG-I or CDG-II and for a few genes related to congenital muscular dystrophies. PLA2G6 and ECHS1 gene sequence analysis was obtained by using PCR amplification and Direct Sequencing through the automated DNA sequencer 3100 Genetic Analyzer ABI Prism). Comprehensive analysis of the NGS panel for 35 genes associated with dystonia (Patient-1) was performed by using NGS Sequencer Illumina MiSeq. Genome wide analysis (Patient-2) was performed through Proton Ion Torrent chips. DNA library preparation was performed according to the Ion AmpliSeq Exome Kit. Data analysis was conducted with variant Caller version 5.2.0.34 plugin from Ion Torrent Suite software (v.5.2.0), which requires a minimal minor allele frequency of 0.1 and a minimal coverage of 20 x.\n\n    SLC39A8 variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in all three patients.\n\n    N-glycosylation analyses were undertaken in all study patients in the context of the metabolic diagnostic procedure for dystonia and subsequently to endorse the glycophenotype associated with studied SLC39A8-CDG variants.\n\n    Glycosylation analyses were performed by quantitation of intact transferrin isoforms through isoelectric focusing (IEF) and/or capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) using the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) test. Transferrin isoforms percentage was compared with internal reference values. In-depth transferrin and total serum N-glycan structural analyses were conducted by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). In this case, transferrin was isolated from serum by immunoaffinity depletion on IgY microbead spin columns (Seppro  GenWay Biotech, San Diego, CA) and deglycosylated using PNGase F. Transferrin N-glycans from the patient and age-matched controls' sera were analyzed after sample permethylation. Total N-glycan profiling was obtained by using 10 muL of serum as previously described. Briefly, proteins were denatured with RapiGest  SF surfactant, reduced and alkylated with DTT and IAA respectively, then deglycosylated by PNGase F. Released N-glycans were permethylated prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, performed in reflector mode and in positive polarity on a 4800 Proteomic Analyzer (AB Sciex). Total N-glycans spectra from age-matched control sera were used for comparison.\n\n    Data are available upon requests to the corresponding author.\n\n    The research was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and local laws.\n\n    Written informed consent for publication was obtained.",
        "Results": "    Patient-1 and -2 were sibs, born to healthy unrelated Italian parents.\n\n    Patient-1 is a male born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Length and weight at birth were within the normal range. Parental concerns were initially raised at 4 months of age when, after a post-vaccine febrile event, the patient presented with recurrent episodes of post-meal vomiting with poor weight and length gain. Medical evaluation at our department was carried out at 5 months of age. Global delay, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), generalized hypotonia with dystonia movements and stiffening of lower limbs were noted. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow activity in the posterior areas.\n\n    Due to severe and persistent GER with feeding difficulties and poor weight gain, gastrostomy and fundoplication were performed at the age of 11 months.\n\n    Since serum CKs were constantly very high (> 1000 U/L), a muscular biopsy was performed and a reduction of respiratory chain complex I activity was found. Electromyography (EMG) was normal, while motor and sensitive nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were characterized by reduced amplitude in all sensory nerves studied. A slight increase of acetoacetic, fumaric and ketoglutaric acids was also identified in urine. A possible mitochondrial disease was investigated and excluded through the analysis of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Furthermore, no pathological changes were found on skin biopsy. MRI was repeated when the patient was 15 months of age, showing a multifocal encephalopathy in the basal ganglia, the thalami, and the periventricular and subcortical white matter. Proton spectroscopy showed an increased lactate peak.\n\n    Over the years, the patient remained globally delayed and he developed scoliosis. He suffered multiple infectious episodes of the upper airways that needed to be treated with antibiotics.\n\n    Due to a clinical worsening characterized by increased dystonic postures, dyskinetic movements in the oral region, eye rolling, back-arching and involuntary stiffening of lower limbs, brain MRI was repeated again at 4 years of age. In addition to the already known neuroradiological pattern, a new lesion in the superior portion of the cerebellar vermis was detected. The same MRI feature was previously observed in Patient-1's older sister (Patient-2). Serial MRIs documented a progressive cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1). Since the age of 5, the child had focal and generalized clonic seizures and atypical absence epilepsy, non-responsive to conventional anti-epileptic drugs. PLA2G6 and ECHS1 gene sequence analysis was performed to rule out infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) and bilateral striatal necrosis, respectively. Biotinidase activity in dried blood spot was normal. Serum transferrin IEF glycosylation pattern showed a type 2 pattern: an increase of trisialotransferrin, which indicated the lack of one sialic acid unit from the normal tetrasialo-isoform. This finding was explained by the increase of truncated monosialo-biantennary glycans as revealed by MALDI MS analyses. However, no mutations were found in the CDG panel covering 79 genes associated with CDG-I or CDG-II and few genes related to congenital muscular dystrophies.\n\n    The last neurological examination showed postural hypotonia, dystonic-dyskinetic movements, drug-resistant epilepsy, and severe intellectual disability. He passed away at age of 10, during an intercurrent infection.\n\n    Patient-2 is the older sister of Patient-1. She suffered from a neurodegenerative disease characterized by hypopostural tetraplegia, movement disorder with dystonia and choreoathetosis, and mental disability. Onset of symptoms was at 5 months of age. Brain MRI documented progressive cerebellar atrophy and signal alterations in basal ganglia. Muscle biopsy (electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis) and analysis of mitochondrial genome yielded normal results. Transferrin glycosylation analyses showed a mild sialylation defect consisting of a slight increase of the trisialo-component. This alteration of sialylation processes was confirmed by a moderate enhancement of the monosialo-biantennary glycoform and its core fucosylated counterpart by MALDI MS analysis in negative polarity of underivatized transferrin-released glycans (data not shown). Unfortunately, she passed away at the age of 9 years before a definitive diagnosis was reached.\n\n    Patient-3 is the first-born to unrelated Romanian parents. He was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. Immediately after the delivery, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for dyspnoea, desaturation, and myoclonic fits without electroencephalographic correlation. He was discharged in good health.\n\n    Parental concerns were raised in the third month of age when he displayed a scaphocephalic skull, floppiness, global delay and stunted growth. Brain MRI, performed at various ages, showed white matter thinning in the temporo-parieto-occipital region, thinning of the genu of the corpus callosum and bilateral reduction of thalamic volume (Fig. 2). Spinal MRI was normal. No genomic rearrangement was identified by array-CGH analysis. In the following years, a more comprehensive neurometabolic screening was carried out. A reduction of methionine was found in plasma, urine, and liquor samples. Urinary oligosaccharides and organic acids, plasmatic homocysteine, serum very-long fatty acids and ceruloplasmin were all within the normal range as were neurotransmitter levels in the liquor. Beta-galactocerebrosidase activity on dried blood spot and alpha-fucosidase, alpha-mannosidase and alpha-hexosaminidase assay in leukocytes were all normal. Serum transferrin IEF was normal. Plasma lactic acid was slightly increased. Brainstem evoked potentials and visual evoked potential suggested impaired auditory and visual conduction. Nerve conduction velocity was normal. EEG showed slow activity and sharp waves in the frontal and centro-temporal areas, bilaterally. A muscular biopsy was performed for a suspected mitochondrial disease. Respiratory chain enzymes in skeletal muscle showed a decreased activity of complex I + III and an elevated activity of citrate synthase. However, analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial diseases ruled out a primary mitochondrial disorder. Whole exome sequencing (WES) did not detect any significant pathogenic variant. Due to poor weight gain and severe feeding difficulties, gastrostomy and fundoplication were performed when the patient was 4.\n\n    Medical evaluation was carried out by our Department when the patient was 5 years-old. Postural hypotonia with poor head control, dystonia, dyskinetic movements in the oral district, eye rolling, pyramidal signs (positive Babinski sign, clonus and hyperelicitable osteotendinous reflexes), divergent strabismus of the right eye and cranial asymmetry were observed. EEG and brain MRI confirmed previous findings. Since the history and the clinical presentation of this patient were very similar, even if less severe, to that of Patient-1, sialotransferrin glycosylation analysis was repeated by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) when the patient was 5. A slight increase of the trisialotransferrin isoform was detected.\n\n    In Patient-1, the analysis of a gene panel associated with dystonia revealed two novel compound heterozygous variants in the SLC39A8 gene (ZIP8, OMIM #608732), c.1048G > A (p. Gly350Arg) and c.131C > G (p.Ser44Trp), inherited from the mother and the father, respectively. A similar clinical and neuroradiological picture associated with the same serum transferrin glycan pattern suggested the same diagnosis also for the sister (Patient-2). In this patient, genetic investigations, performed on the DNA obtained from fibroblasts, acquired before death, confirmed the diagnosis. Family-l SLC39A8 missense variants have not been reported and are not yet annotated on the ClinVar database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/); the c.131C > G has been reported in dbSNP with rs772391167. Their extremely low allele frequency, along with the compound heterozygosity, suggest a likely detrimental effect on protein function. The p.Gly350Arg variant is characterized by a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) 34 (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/snv). The silico prediction sites (Mutation taster, PolyPhen2.0, Provean) investigated consider p.Gly350Arg pathological; only the SIFT website supports it as tolerated but with scores at the limit. This variant is absent in gnomAD (genome aggregation database). This variant is located at the position-1 on the 5' splice site in exon 7. Therefore, it most likely modifies the splicing of this region inducing exon skipping or, with less probability, intron retention. The p.Ser44Trp variant is located in exon 2 and has a CADD score of 28.6; investigated silico prediction sites consider it pathological. The variant p.Ser44Trp is absent in gnomAD.\n\n    As to Family-2, the consistency between the clinical suspicion and the biochemical data, led to a re-evaluation of the exome sequencing, focusing on CDG associated genes. The SLC39A8 common missense variant c.1171G > A (p.Ala391Thr) was found in homozygosity. The unaffected parents were both carriers of the same variant. Although in Family-2 the variant p.Ala391Thr (in exon 8) (rs13107325) has a total allele frequency of 0,04 according to GnomAD database, with a CADD of 34, and is predicted to be likely damaging by 3 out of 6 prediction tools, it affects a highly conserved amino acid residue and it has been previously associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia and other neurological or systemic disorders, modified MRI signal in certain brain regions such as basal ganglia and decreased blood manganese levels in both homozygous and heterozygous carriers (18% and 10% respectively).\n\n    Transferrin is an abundant serum glycoprotein with two N-glycosylation sites occupied by biantennary disialylated N-glycans. In CDG-I, monoglycosylated (disialo-) and aglycosylated (asialo-) transferrin isoforms increase due to the lack of the N-glycan moiety in one or both protein glycosylation sites. In CDG-II, the typical transferrin glycosylation defect is due to the presence at the glyco-sites of aberrant N-glycan structures lacking terminal sialic acids with increase of undersialylated (tri-, di-, mono- and asialo-) isoforms. In Patient -1 and -3, repeated serum transferrin analyses by IEF and/or CE showed an increase of trisialo- (8-15%; n.v. <= 5,5) and decrease of tetrasialo-transferrin (75-82%, n.v. >= 84%) indicating a CDG type 2 pattern (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).\n\n    Detailed glycosylation analyses both on total serum and on serum transferrin were performed in Patient-1 by MALDI MS analyses at age 3 (during the diagnostic work-up) and at the age of 7 (after the detection of SLC39A8 variants). The whole serum N-glycosylation analysis was also performed on a blood sample from his affected sister (Patient-2) at the age of 4. The same comprehensive N-glycan analyses of Patient-1 were performed on Patient-3 when he was 5.\n\n    In SLC39A8-CDG, galactosylation deficiency is caused by impaired Mn-dependent beta1,4-galactosyltransferase (B4GALT) enzyme activity. In human serum glycoproteins reduced B4GALT enzymes activity mainly results in decreased galactosylation of the biantennary asialo, agalacto N-glycans (A2, FA2) to form the corresponding, asialo monogalactosylated structures (A2G1, FA2G1), which, in turn, are further extended to form biantennary monosialo, monogalacto N-glycans (A2G1S1, FA2G1S1). Then, B4GALT adds a second galactose to form the biantennary, digalactosylated monosialo structures (A2G2S1, FA2G2S1) that in turn are elongated to the mature, disialo biantennary N-glycans (A2G2S2, FA2G2S2). Compared to controls (see Fig. 3a as representative control spectrum), MALDI MS analyses of the whole serum N-glycans conducted on the three patients showed common features of defective glycosylation, consisting of an increased amount of hyposialylated biantennary and triantennary structures, and an overall increase in fucosylation (Fig. 3b-d). Notably, the presence of the precursor glycan A2G1S1 (at ~ m/z 2227, underlined mass peaks Fig. 3b-d) not detected in the reference controls, was observed in the three patients (Fig. 3a). This glycoform, corresponding to the biantennary truncated N-glycan NeuAc1Gal1Man3GlcNAc4 lacking one terminal NeuAc-Gal epitope, has been explicitly addressed to a distinctive serum N-glycome signature for B4GALT deficiency in SLC39A8-CDG patients.\n\n    Conversely, serum transferrin N-glycan analyses, performed in Patient-1 and -3, did not show a typical pattern. The transferrin glycosylation analysis performed in Patient-3 showed only very slight unspecific glycosylation changes, such as minor increases in hyposialylation and fucosylation (Additional file 2: Fig. S2), whereas the transferrin N-glycan analysis, performed in Patient-1 at 3 years of age, revealed a deeply altered glycosylation profile, with a three-fold increase of the monosialo- biantennary glycoform (A2G2S1) at m/z 2431.2 compared to the control (Fig. 4a) and the occurrence of an intense peak at 2227.1 (about 25% of the biantennary disialylated base-peak at 2792.4) corresponding to the aforementioned hypogalactosylated glyco-biomarker A2G1S1. Moreover, traces of truncated hyposialylated and/or hypogalactosylated glycoforms were detected at m/z 2070.1 (A2G2), at m/z 1865.9 (A2G1), at m/z 1661.9 (A2G0), together with traces of the hybrid glycan species at m/z 1982.0, the latter lacking the whole NeuAc-Gal-GlcNAc trisaccharide terminal branch. Unexpectedly, Patient-1's transferrin glycosylation profile showed significant improvements over the years (Fig. 4c). In fact, a second serum transferrin analysis by MALDI-MS at 7 years of age, revealed a drastic reduction of the A2G1S1 N-glycan species, now present in trace amounts. Furthermore, the hypogalactosylated/hybrid species at m/z 1661.9, 1865.9 and 1982.0 were completely missing, supporting an age-related modification of serum transferrin glycosylation.",
        "Conclusion": "    The present study reports novel insights into the clinical, molecular and glycosylation features of SLC39A8-CDG. We document two novel variants associated with Leigh syndrome-like disease presentation of SLC39A8-CDG and we show, for the first time, a severe neurological phenotype in association with the already known homozygous A391T missense variant. We also found a spontaneous amelioration of transferrin N-glycome during the disease course and a distinct pattern of total serum N-glycome. This highlights the efficacy of MS-based serum glycomics for the diagnosis and clinical management of therapy response in patients with SLC39A8-CDG.",
        "Discussion": "    Here, we report the identification of novel SCL39A8 variants and homozygosity for a common missense variant associated with clinical, neuroradiological and glycosylation findings consistent with SLC39A8-CDG. So far, a paucity of SLC39A8-CDG studies have been reported, including 14 patients with different clinical and neuroradiological characteristics and variable transferrin glycosylation changes (Table 1). Common clinical features of SLC39A8-CDG patients are hypotonia, poor postural control, increased peripheral tone, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and failure to thrive. Strabismus is a recurring feature, also in this study (Patient-2). Hearing impairment was described in only one patient. Dysmorphic features (broad forehead, hirsutism, anteverted nostrils, thin lips, smooth philtrum) were reported in a few subjects, including one infant with disproportionate dwarfism and craniosynostosis. Microcephaly was reported in one instance and cranial asymmetry was observed in Patient-2. Some patients affected by SLC39A8-CDG presented with scoliosis, as observed in the Patient-1, or with additional skeletal abnormalities. In the present study, all patients were affected by dystonia and they also presented episodes of eye rolling and dyskinetic movements of the oral region. Due to feeding difficulties and poor weight gain, gastrostomy and fundoplication were performed in two study patients. Consistently, previous studies described patients with SLC39A8-CDG and prominent dystonic postural pattern who underwent gastrostomy. According to what has been observed in the patients of this study and in others reported previously, SLC39A8-CDG should be considered among CDG presenting with major hyperkinetic movement disorders such as global and segmental dystonia and dyskinesia, particularly at the orofacial region, accompanied by dysphagia. Epilepsy is another common feature in SLC39-A8-CDG and it is often refractory to most anticonvulsant drugs. Differently from Patient-1, who displayed atypical absences and clonic seizures, spasms with hypsarrhythmia, tonic and myoclonic seizures have been reported.\n\n    Brain MRI patterns are highly variable in documented cases of SLC39A8-CDG (Table 1). Our patients presented two different distributions of lesions. Brain MRI in Patient-1 was characterized by a Leigh syndrome-like pattern with bilateral symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensities and multiple focal signal alterations in subcortical white matter; a similar pattern was identified in the older sister as well (Patient-2) and in four other patients with SLC39A8-CDG irrespective of the underlying genetic variants. However, differently from previously described patients with deep grey matter lesions, Patient-1 and -2 also presented progressive cerebellar atrophy. Cerebellar atrophy is typical of several CDG and it was also found in seven of the eight cases reported by Boycott and colleagues and in a patient described by Park and colleagues. Interestingly, in Patient-1, MRS showed a lactate peak similar to that described in a patient with progressive atrophy of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres. Cerebellar involvement was not found in Patient-3, whose brain MRI documented thalamic volume loss, subcortical nonspecific alterations of signal, thinning of the corpus callosum and thickening of the anterior commissure but adequate progression of myelinisation and absence of cortical atrophy. Park and colleagues also described a CDG patient without cerebellar atrophy; however, differently from Patient-3, in that case the neuroimaging was also characterized by brain asymmetry with cerebral atrophy of the left hemisphere and enlarged ventricles, especially on the left side of the brain. So, judging from our cases and those already documented in literature, cerebral atrophy, cerebellar atrophy and a Leigh syndrome-like pattern are common features in SLC39A8-CDG and they can be present alone or in different combinations. However, no MRI finding can be considered pathognomonic of this CDG.\n\n    Muscular biopsies were performed in both Patient-1 and -3 for a suspected mitochondrial disorder, suggested by their clinical and radiological presentation. In Patient-1 a reduction of respiratory chain complex I activity was found, while respiratory chain enzymes in Patient-3's skeletal muscle were suggestive of a low activity of complex I + III and an elevated activity of citrate synthetases. However, in both patients, the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear genome did not show any variant related to mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondrial involvement in SLC39A8-CDG has not been systematically investigated by respiratory chain enzymology so far. However, low muscle complex IV and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and low liver complexes IV and II + III were identified in a reported patient with Leigh syndrome-like presentation. Thus SCL39A8-CDG should be sought in patients with features of Leigh syndrome-like mitochondrial disease that remain without a genetic diagnosis.\n\n    Extensive research on inducible global Slc39a8-knockout mice and Slc39a8 liver-specific-knockout mice unequivocally showed that the hepatocyte ZIP8 transporter reclaims Mn from the bile, decreasing Mn biliary excretion and preserving Mn homeostatic levels in blood and tissues. Disease-associated SLC39A8 mutations caused retention of the ZIP8 transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum thus explaining the inability to localize at the plasma membrane and to transport Mn into cells. Previous studies have investigated the reasons behind the reductions in respiratory chain complex activity in manganese-deficient conditions and have demonstrated that manganese deficiency leads to reduced activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger in mitochondria, MnSOD, manganese being its cofactor and hence to increased levels of superoxide. A direct study, however, demonstrated that SLC39A8 disease-mutations reduced Mn levels in the mitochondria and, in turn, reduced mitochondrial MnSOD activity as well as mitochondrial function. Moreover, SLC39A8 directly promotes the expression of several respiratory chain proteins and ATP production whereas SLC39A8 mutations abolish these functions and enhance ROS generation. ROS could damage mtDNA which encodes some subunits of complex I, III, IV and V of the respiratory chain, and could directly impair the activity of enzymes containing Fe-S clusters, as complex I, II and III.\n\n    Out of 14 patients with SLC39A8-CDG currently known, transferrin glycoforms analyses by IEF, CE or HPLC showed a CDG type 2 pattern in six and normal patterns in two thus indicating that SLC39A8-CDG diagnosis may be missed by standard transferrin glycosylation analyses. In the patients of this study the sialotransferrin glycosylation patterns were characterized by variable and inconstant increases of trisialotransferrins and mild reductions of tetrasialotransferrins, consistent with the CDG type 2 pattern. We show for the first time in SLC39A8-CDG, age-related transferrin glycosylation changes documented by MALDI-MS in Patient-1. Having monitored transferrin glycosylation along the disease course we found an amelioration of hypoglycosylation in a 4-year period with spontaneous decrease of truncated glycans such as the hypogalactosylated form A2G1S1 at m/z 2227. Spontaneous amelioration of glycosylated biomarkers including transferrin has been reported in some other CDG such as PMM2-CDG and SLC35A2-CDG. Nevertheless, the findings of the present study should be taken into account when using transferrin hypoglycosylation changes to monitor the effectiveness of galactose and/or Mn supplementation therapy in patients with SLC39A8-CDG. Although transferrin glycosylation may only slightly abnormal (Patient-2 and Patient-3) or even normal in patients with SLC39A8-CDG, serum N-glycome analyses by MALDI-MS showed a distinct pattern in some previously studied patients (n:4) and in the patients here reported. In particular, total plasma N-glycome profiles are characterized by an increase of undergalactosylated and undersialylated precursors of fully sialylated biantennary glycans, especially the monosialo-monogalacto-biantennary glycan (A2G1S1, m/z 2227). In sum, comprehensive clinical, neuroradiological and glycosylation features are consistent with SLC39A8-CDG, supporting pathogenicity of the SLC39A8 variants in our patients. In Family-1 we identified compound heterozygous Chr4(GRCh37): c.1048G > A (p.Gly350Arg) and c.131C > G (p.Ser44Trp) variants in SLC39A8 that are not yet annotated in ClinVar. The p.Gly350Arg variant most likely modifies the splicing of on the 5' splice site in exon 7. The p.Ser44Trp variant in exon 2 is located in the same position as the detrimental variant p.Ser44Leu according to GnomAD. Sanger sequencing confirmed the SLC39A8 variants in both affected children and heterozygous in both parents. We here show, for the first time, that the clinical and glycophenotype of a homozygous A391T carrier (Patient-3) are consistent with SLC39A8-CDG. Taking into account the high allele frequency of the A391T (p.Ala391Thr) variant we can thus postulate a spectrum with a wide clinical variability among the variant carriers, ranging from undetectable asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic cases to more severe phenotypes likely due to a compound effect of modulator genes on a homozygous state.\n\n    The analysis of plasma protein N-glycosylation showed some degree of dysglycosylation in A391T (p.Ala391Thr) carriers, consistent with a significant increase of biantennary, and decrease of larger triantennary N-glycans and a trend towards less sialylated species than controls. An increase of A2G1S1 monosialo-monogalacto biantennary N-glycan (m/z 2227), consistently found in SLC39A8-CDG, was also observed in A391T homozygous carriers, although a complete clinical information on these subjects was not reported . The rs13107325 (C   T), was found to affect SLC39A8 transcript levels in various tissues and may affect RNA levels in the brain. The A391T mutation is predicted to be disruptive to transporter function, though its precise location is unknown.\n\n    To date there is little information about mutations related to SLC39A8-CDG (Table 1). Out of fourteen patients, SLC39A8 variant (c.112G > C, p.Gly38Arg) homozygosity was found in nine individuals from three unrelated Hutterite families which establishes p.G38R as a pathogenic founder variant in the Hutterite population. Evolutionary alignment of SCL39A8 amino-acid sequence showed a strict conservation of Gly38 amino-acid in the protein. Several SLC39A8 mutations such as G38R were found to affect the sequence motifs that control subcellular localization and were associated with retention of the ZIP8 transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum explaining the inability to localize at the plasma membrane and transport Mn into cells.",

        "Title": "    Clustering of Genetic Anomalies of Cilia Outer Dynein Arm and Central Apparatus in Patients with Transposition of the Great Arteries",
        "Abstract": "    Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a congenital heart defect with a complex pathogenesis that has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in isolated TGA-diagnosed patients and analyzed genes of motile and non-motile cilia ciliogenesis and ciliary trafficking, as well as genes previously associated with this heart malformation. Deleterious missense and splicing variants of genes DNAH9, DNAH11, and ODAD4 of cilia outer dynein arm and central apparatus, HYDIN, were found in our TGA patients. Remarkable, there is a clustering of deleterious genetic variants in cilia genes, suggesting it could be an oligogenic disease. Our data evidence the genetic diversity and etiological complexity of TGA and point out that population allele determination and genetic aggregation studies are required to improve genetic counseling.",
        "Introduction": "    Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a severe congenital heart disease (CHD) characterized by concordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordant connections in situs solitus. Although several monogenic syndromes have been associated with this defect, including Kabuki, Carpenter, and MRFACD, the etiology in its isolated and sporadic form is still a matter of debate. Knockout mouse models of genes involved in left-right (LR) establishment have helped link TGA pathogenesis to an abnormal NODAL/GDF1-DAND5 developmental pathway (NGD).\n\n    NGD signaling depends on fluid flow gradients, with beating cilia being relevant to establishing LR asymmetry. Besides this, cilia have been associated with laterality establishment and heart development in other ways: the bending of primary cilia by hydrodynamic forces, the position of ciliary cells in the organizer, and the ciliary cell polarization in the posterior region of the embryo for LR establishment. This evidence suggests that cilia function could be relevant in TGA pathogenesis.\n\n    In this regard, several cilia genes have been associated with this abnormal LR establishment and CHD. Abnormalities in the OFD1 gene, which is involved in ciliogenesis and the function of motile and non-motile cilia, have been associated with abnormal node development and the establishment of LR. In motile cilia, alterations in heavy chain dyneins such as DNAH9 and DNAH11 have been associated with abnormal cilia beating and linked to congenitally corrected TGA. Similarly, abnormalities in the intermediate strand DNAI1, required for cilia motility, have also been reported in patients with TGA. In addition to these functions, primary cilia modulate several signaling pathways involved in cardiogenesis, such as TGF beta and Sonic Hedgehog, whose alterations are related to outflow tract defects.\n\n    In general, congenital heart diseases, including TGA, have been linked with ciliopathies, such as Ellis van Creveld and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. However, a massive WES analysis recently suggested that cilia genetic anomalies could be relevant to TGA etiology. Furthermore, the interaction and clustering of several deleterious genetic variants could lead to a predisposition with the transposition of the great arteries, as has been previously suggested for other CHD, such as the tetralogy of Fallot. This study shows a high throughput analysis of genes previously linked with TGA (NODAL-GDF1-DAND5 signaling pathway) and motile (inner, outer dynein arms, and central apparatus) and non-motile cilia genes, which providence evidence for the identification of the etiology underlying this congenital heart disease.",
        "Methods": "    Eleven patients, from newborn to 16 years, with transposition of the great arteries, were recruited from Pediatric and Cardiology Hospitals from National Medical Center XXI century, Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), Mexico. Clinical data relevant to this study were obtained from medical records. Given the presence of clinical manifestations suggestive of congenital heart disease, the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries was made by pediatric cardiologists and described by ICD categorization. The patients were also evaluated by clinical geneticists to rule out the presence of other phenotypic alterations that would make it possible to integrate the diagnosis of various syndromic entities that may involve this type of congenital heart disease. Patients with congenital anomalies suggestive of syndromic entities were excluded from the study. The Research Ethics Board of the Mexican Social Security Institute, Mexico, approved this study (R-2018-785-047). Prior to conducting this study, the parents of the affected children were informed and asked to give their consent via a signed written consent before the beginning of the study. Children eight years old and older signed an assent/consent document.\n\n    Blood samples were collected from 11 subjects diagnosed with TGA for WES. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit I (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA concentration and purity were measured using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), while integrity was established by capillary electrophoresis using the TapeStation4200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\n\n    A total of 50 ng of genomic DNA per sample was used for DNA library preparation. DNA libraries were prepared by fragmentation using a Nextera DNA Exome sample prep kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA; Cat N. 20020616), involving end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation, as instructed by the manufacturer. Libraries were quantified using Qubit (dsDNA HS assays, ThemoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat.N. Q33230), pooled in equimolar amounts, and subjected to exome capture using XGen Research Panel version 1.0 (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT, Coralville, IA, USA), with blocking adapters (xGen Blockers, IDT, Coralville, IA, USA), designed to match the Nextera library constructs following the manufacturer's instructions. The libraries were diluted for sequencing on an Illumina Nextseq 500 platform using 2 x 146 paired-end cycles. BCL2 data were transformed to fastq through Bcl2fastq software, for further analysis, and the read quality of fastq files per sample was carried out using FAST-QC v0.11.9 under default parameters.\n\n    After WES, a DRAGEN Germline Pipeline (v3.2.8, Illumina, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was used to align the remaining high-quality sequencing reads to the reference human genome (hg19), and Germline Variant Small Hard Filtering (Illumina, Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) was used to annotate the identified single-nucleotide variants and InDels. The variant interpretation was performed with the Variant Interpreter software (Illumina Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). In the previously related genes, all non-synonymous variants were studied, whereas only VUS, pathogenic, or possibly pathogenic cilia genes were analyzed.\n\n    Nonsynonymous variants were then evaluated, determining their deleteriousness by SIFT, PolyPhen2, and a Mutation Assessor medium or high score. For splicing, nonsense, and indel variants, a LoF-Tool or CADD PHRED score was determined; a >=20 value indicates that a variant is among the top 1% of damaging variants in the genome. Variant Effect Predictor was used to identify the effect on the canonic transcript.\n\n    To predict interactions, the STRING database was used (V11.5). First, a Markov Clustering Algorithm was employed to determine the global gene aggregation. Secondly, an interaction enrichment analysis was performed (EPv), where a p-value less than 0.05 was interpreted as indicative of a functional connection between proteins. Protein domains were determined using Uniprot. Variants were subsetted to the GnomAD V2.1.1 to describe the Latin allele population frequency. As genetic variants presence interpretation is challenging, deleteriousness was defined using several algorithms. In silico analysis can predict whether a genetic anomaly will result in protein abnormalities that could lead to a malfunction or even its absence. The presence of deleterious variants may elevate the individual's susceptibility or predisposition to the disease. Concerning missense variants, deleteriousness was determined by the presence of two abnormalities by SIFT, PolyPhen2, and Mutation Assessor, or the presence of one abnormality if a new variant was described. Although WES analysis is focused on exons, we analyzed proximal splicing variants when possible. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM  McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD, USA), (06-01-2022) was used to determine gene relevance in a clinical context. URL:  (accessed on 30 November 2021). A list of the analyzed genes and their general relationship with motile and non-motile cilia, ciliogenesis, and ciliary trafficking can be found in Table S1.\n\n    Probabilistic binomial analysis was performed to determine the probability of two or more variants in our cohort using the Minitab statistical software (Minitab19, Minitab LLC, State College, PA, USA). The variant expected population probability used in this analysis was obtained from frequency data from GnomAD. To compare the allele frequency between sexes, Exact Fisher Test was employed.",
        "Results": "    We examined 11 unrelated probands with sporadic TGA, levocardia, and situs solitus. After WES analysis, a median of 160k variants per patient was obtained, and missense, nonsense, indels, or altered splicing regions were identified. A flow chart of the genetic analysis performed is presented in Figure 1.\n\n    First, genes previously associated with TGA in syndromic entities were analyzed (Table 1: Abnormalities in genes previously related to TGA). Genetic anomalies associated with Kabuki syndrome were found in three probands: the first one carries a KDM6A hemizygous variant c.232C>T (p.R78C) OMIM Gene (OMIM-G) 300128, which was classified as non-deleterious (Table S2: Complete gene abnormalities of ciliary genes in TGA). The two remaining probands carry the autosomic KMT2D (OMIM-G 602113) deleterious variants c.547C>T (p.P183S) and c.15686G>A (p.R5229H). The first variant is in PHD finger 1 (PHD1), a module involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression via the recruitment of chromatin regulators and transcription factors. The second variant is related to the FYR-C terminal domain of KMT2D, characterized by phenylalanine/tyrosine-rich regions found in various chromatin-associated proteins. The p.P183S is a newly described variant, while KMT2D p.R5229H is infrequently found in Latin American populations. It is worth noting that none of the patients displayed phenotypical characteristics of Kabuki syndrome.\n\n    On the other hand, variants of MEGF8 (OMIM-G 604267), a gene related to TGA in Carpenter syndrome, were found in two patients. The first one carries the p.R439W (c.1315C>T) deleterious variant, while the second one carries the p.R782W non-deleterious variant, which is rare in the Latin American population (Table 1). However, both patients have heterozygous anomalies, whereas this entity is a recessive inheritance disorder.\n\n    Next, TGA syndromic genes were analyzed, namely those related to LR establishment CHD (NODAL, GDF1, and ACVR2B) (Table 1). Several algorithms found two missense variants of the FOXH1 and GDF1 genes, which were classified as non-deleterious. Concerning ciliary genes previously associated with TGA, deleterious DNAI1 and DISC1 in T181101 and SLC4A1 and CLASP1 in T181201 variants were identified (Table 1). Since both patients were heterozygous carriers, we presume that different heterozygous deleterious anomalies in ciliary genes could have a summative effect, supporting an oligogenic etiology.\n\n    To ascertain whether ciliary genes could be related to this CHD, we examined genes previously implicated with either functional or structural functions of motile cilia, non-motile cilia, and ciliary trafficking. Several variants, including missense, nonsense codon, frameshift, and splicing alterations, were identified in DNAH9, OFD1, BBS7, and other genes (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table S2). Most ciliary deleterious genetic variants were found in heterozygous probands, except for homozygous probands for HYDIN and PIBF1 and a hemizygous proband for OFD1. Only deleterious and possibly pathogenic variants were analyzed.\n\n    The most common anomalies were within the profile of the motile cilia (Table 2: Anomalies in motile ciliary genes in TGA patients), where patients displayed abnormalities in the outer dynein arm and central pair proteins. Deleterious variants of DNAH9 and DNAH11 genes were found in outer dynein arms genes. Four DNAH9 variants were identified in three patients: a p.Y1017C and a p.G2384R variant; a splice donor splicing variant c.5151+1G>A and two missense changes in c.3050A>G. Although two patients displayed the same variant, the presence of 2 out of 22 alleles c.3050A>G in our sample has a probability of 0.2184, according to binomial probability calculation. Interestingly, the T180401 proband carries both missense and splicing variants that could have a summative effect in these patients. The latter variant was described as deleterious; as a result, the patient was compound heterozygous for the DNAH9 gene. On the other hand, T180201 presented a DNAH11 nonsense heterozygous variant located in the C terminal domain, after the AAA6 region, in an area likely associated with a deleterious effect. As the allele presents a frequency of 2.897 x 10-5 in the Latin American population, a relationship with TGA is plausible in this case.\n\n    Additional deleterious genetic variants of outer dynein arms genes were found (Table 2). Two patients were hemizygous with deleterious variants in OFD1, a gene associated with Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome type 1 (OMIM Phenotype 311200), which has a sex-linked inheritance. A female proband carried an OFD1 c.2610G>C (p.Q870H) variant, and a male proband had a c.1819C>T variant (p.F828V). Although p.Q870H has been observed in a male subject, the variant does not present a population difference between the sexes (exact Fisher test, p = 0.520), suggesting a lesser effect on a lethal cardiovascular phenotype. On the other side, the OFD1 p.Q870H is a newly reported deleterious anomaly; however, it has been found in a female, so the effect of its probable deleteriousness could be masked. Finally, the presence of a novel homozygous HYDIN c.3332C>T (p.P1111L) deleterious variant in a T180401 proband was revealed by algorithm analysis.\n\n    Regarding non-motile cilia genes (Table 3: Genetic anomalies in non-motile cilia genes in TGA), a subject presented several abnormalities in genes related to this organelle as INPPP5E and IQCE, which are related to the modulation of Hedgehog signaling that could be relevant to outflow tract development. On the other hand, a previously described pathogenic variant of the PIBF1 gene was identified in three patients; two homozygous probands and a single heterozygous proband for c.1214G>A (p.R405Q) (Table 3). This gene has been associated with Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy not associated with abnormal organ disposition (OMIM-P 617767). It is worth mentioning that finding 5 out of 22 alleles with a p < 0.05 according to binomial probability calculation with data of GnomAD for the Latin American population suggests that this is not a stochastic finding and could be associated with this disease.\n\n    Concerning ciliogenesis and cilia trafficking gene analysis (Table 4, genetic anomalies in ciliogenesis and ciliary trafficking in TGA patients), the patients presented several anomalies related to these processes. In addition to the presence of previously described OFD1 and PIBF1 genetic variants, IFT46 anomalies were also observed. This gene is part of the IFT subcomplex B that is required for retrograde transport in the cilia but is also related to ciliogenesis. In particular, Ift46 KO mouse embryos displayed randomization of the embryo heart looping, a hallmark of defective lateralization; this effect has been associated with a lack of cilia in node cells. The absence of nodal flow, which can be caused by the loss of nodal cilia and abnormal LR patterning, as seen in Ift46 embryos, has been consistently related to TGA.\n\n    Apart from DNAH9 and HYDIN variants found in some patients, most of the genetic variants were observed in genes related to autosomic recessive diseases. Thus, we hypothesized that clustering and interaction analyses might uncover an abnormal cilia function genotype by presenting several risk variants (Figure 2, genetic abnormality aggregation in patients with transposition of the great arteries). The interactions described by STRING software include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations, using knowledge transfer between organisms, and cluster interactions from other databases. An interactive protein network was obtained in 29 out of 44 genes (65.9%) with deleterious variants (Figure 2a). Markov Clustering Algorithm displayed the presence of 7 different clusters, suggesting that dynamic protein complexes favor aggregation in static gene interactions (Figure 2a and Table S3). Further, to determine the cluster relevance, STRING interaction enrichment analysis was performed (EPV); a p-value of less than 0.05 was interpreted as indicative of a functional connection between proteins. Using the EPV comprehensive analysis, a clustering includes deleterious variants of BBS7, TRAF3IP1, OFD1, and PIBF1 as part of primary cilia development (WP4536, STRING False Discovery Rate: 3.57 x 10-8). Interestingly, a cluster formed by 12 elements, including WDR63, DNAH3, DNAI1, TTC18, SPAG17, TTC25, and CCDC113, was found to be a cluster related to primary ciliary dyskinesia and COPI-independent Golgi-to-ER (Cluster 10689, STRING False Discovery Rate: 1.0-12) (Figure S1).\n\n    We next examined deleterious variants of TGA genes using an individual in silico functional interaction analysis. In 6 out of 11 analyzed probands (54.5%), clustering and interaction of anomalies were observed (Figure 2b). Abnormalities of DNAH9 and HYDIN interact in proband T180401, suggesting an oligogenic context in this patient. To T180701, several pairs of clustering anomalies, including CFAP43 and WDR63; CCDC36 and MORN3; TRAF3IP1 and IFT46. Studies using the single-celled model Chlamydomonas showed that the complex CFAP43/CFAP44 could regulate IDAF/I1(IC140), an orthologue of WDR63, hence, modulating the cilia beating. Despite this, abnormalities of these genes have been implicated in nervous system malformations and infertility but not in heart defects, suggesting a poor association with TGA.\n\n    Further, the interaction between OFD1 and PIBF1 was observed for proband T180801. Both genes have previously been implicated congenital defects in related syndromic entities OMIM Phenotype 311,200 and 617,767, respectively; thus, their implication in TGA requires further analysis. A complex interaction among DNAH9, DNAH3, WDR63, and CFAP70/TTC18 gene variants was revealed for the T180901 proband, suggesting a deleterious aggregation integration. Among them, DNHA9 had been associated with motile cilia function and abnormal heart defects; therefore, this interaction could be relevant to the pathogenesis of TGA in this patient. Regarding the T181001, a weak association between DNAH11 and OFD1 gene variants was found. Finally, DNAI1 and SPAG17 variants were biologically associated with the T181101 proband. DNAI1 anomalies have been previously associated with TGA, while the central pair associated protein SPAG17 has been associated only with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Finally, the relationship between gene anomalies related to motile and non-motile cilia can be observed in Figure 3. Several genes could be related to motility or signaling in primary cilia in general; others are related to ciliogenesis, and signaling can be found in both types of cilia. This evidence is relevant and suggest that a single type of cilia cannot rule the etiopathogenesis of the transposition of the great arteries.\n\n    Finally, the effect of cilia functions on the described genes can be found in Table 5; in general, deletion models displayed several effects on cilia function or organization; despite DNAH9 defects, IFT46 and OFD1 anomalies have been associated with node cilia defects in embryo development. Other motile cilia found in this study have been associated with abnormal beating, a process that could be related to laterality and eventually to heart defects.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our study provides evidence that the clustering of anomalies in cilia genes involved in motile and non-motile cilia could underlie TGA pathogenesis, suggesting a complex and heterogeneous genetic architecture and underpinning the genetic interaction analyses as part of the genetic counseling strategy.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    The transposition of the great arteries is a complex genetic disease whose pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Although this disease has been associated with genetic anomalies related to the laterality establishment, its relevance in subjects with situs solitus is still a matter of discussion. The presence of several genetic anomalies in our patients provides the context for a change in the paradigm in the genetic counseling of TGA.\n\n    Firstly, we observed gene anomalies related to Joubert and Kabuki syndromes. The presence of KMT2D deleterious variants suggests that epigenetic alterations could be relevant to TGA pathogenesis, as has previously been suggested for other genetic syndromes, such as MRFACD (OMIM-P 608771). To support this notion, it is necessary to analyze the presence of KMT2D variants in TGA patients:even those lacking the distinctive phenotype. With respect to the Joubert (Jb) syndrome-related gene, PIBF1, the fact that a deleterious variant c.1214G>A (p.R405Q) was found in two heterozygous patients (p = 6.02 x 10-3) suggests its relevance in TGA etiology. Although this variant is likely-pathogenic and associated with Joubert syndrome in ClinVar, it has been reported in a heterozygous compound context with a genomic deletion encompassing PIBF1 coding regions.\n\n    Despite the consistent implication of NODAL-GDF1-DAND5 genetic anomalies in TGA etiology, none of our patients displayed genetic defects in this developmental pathway. Since genetic clustering analyses suggest that the etiology of CHD disorders is extended beyond a single-gene alteration, we analyzed cilia anomalies aggregation in our probands. In general, cilia dysfunction triggers defects in the left-right animal plan patterning, leading to the development of CHD; moreover, genes encoding cilia proteins could have non-ciliary functions that might also be significant to CHD, as has previously been revealed in the modulation of outflow tract signaling pathways.\n\n    Interestingly, mutations in primary cilia genes have been linked to motile dysfunction. For instance, WDR35 heterozygous mutations, a gene involved in retrograde ciliary transport, ciliogenesis, and ciliary protein trafficking, caused motile cilia dysfunction in Sensenbrenner syndrome. In this regard, we found a deleterious variant of HYDIN; this central apparatus protein is related to Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (OMIM-P 608647, Ciliary Dyskinesia, Primary 5) but not to the randomization of the left-right body or CHD. Thus, the biological relevance of this variant should be interpreted in combination with the DNAH9 missense and splicing variants found in the same proband.\n\n    On the other hand, outer dynein arm anomalies are the most common cause of PCD, a disorder related to TGA patients with abnormal LRA organ disposition. DNAH9 and DNAH11 are required for the assembly and function of distal outer dynein arms; in fact, DNAH11 mutations could result in abnormal ciliary ultrastructure and hyperkinetic ciliary beating associated with congenitally corrected TGA (ccTGA), while DNAH9 genetic anomalies are linked to either laterality defects, subtle respiratory ciliary-beating defects, and ccTGA. Intriguingly, the situs solitus T180401 proband, which carries both a heterozygous compound DNAH9 variant and a HYDIN homozygous variant, did not display any observable clinical manifestation of a ciliopathy.\n\n    We also found some anomalies in other genes related to motile ciliary function. A heterozygous nonsense variant was found in the DNAH11, which was linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia 7 (CILD7; OMIM-P 611884). Furthermore, a heterozygous variant was found in the CILD35-associated gene, ODAD4/TTC25 (OMIM-P 617092). It is worth noting that defective TTC25 has been associated with immotile nodal cilia and missing leftward flow via particle image velocimetry, lack of ODAs, and the ODA docking complex. Therefore, this variant might affect cilia function somehow, and further investigation is required to determine the mechanism. The physical interaction of abnormal genetic variants suggested needs validation using assays such as a yeast two-hybrid one-on-one screening, as was previously described for DNAH9 anomalies. Parallelly, the clustering biological relevance requires further study using molecular dissection in models such as Paramecium, Chlamydomonas, or engineered retinal pigment epithelial tissue, which have been shown to be relevant for deciphering ciliary beating mechanisms, structures, and anchoring and ciliogenesis; and these could be valuable tools to validate candidate genes for ciliopathies. Examples of this dissection are the identification of the cilia localization of ARMC9 and CEP104 or the role of CFAP43 and CFAP70 in cilia, both using the single-celled models, and the use of techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 to mimic the genetic variants to identify their roles in cilia function.\n\n    Furthermore, the PIBF1 aggregation in the cohort is interesting. PIBF1 had been associated with non-motile cilia assembly, and its absence has been associated with a diminished number of ciliary cells. The presence of a deleterious PIBF1 variant could be suggestive of the role of cilia in TGA downstream of the early laterality establishment. In the heart, primary cilia regulate cardiogenesis via the modulation of several signaling pathways, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (Pdgfra). Pdgfra and its absence has been related to this CHD.\n\n    Despite this, a central role for cilia in TGA pathogenesis was previously suggested by clinical studies where ciliary dysfunction was a predominant feature in patients. Consistent with this hypothesis, a TGA exome-based analysis unveiled the enrichment of cilia-related pathways. Although apparent stochastic findings and interaction were reported in half of our patients, globally we found no enrichment of any ciliary processes shared between subjects, neither in terms of motile or non-motile cilia, ciliogenesis, ciliary compartmentalization, or ciliary trafficking, that could be consistently related to TGA. Although a couple of patients displayed interactions between ciliary genes, other cilia-associated anomalies, such as airway dysfunction, were not evaluated; hence, its functional relevance requires more analysis.\n\n    Intriguingly, a recent WGS analysis showed that abnormalities in cilia-related genes were similar between TGA patients and controls; in this context, the clustering of several variants in cilia genes could be relevant to identifying susceptibility genotypes that could increase the familiar risk related to cilia defects. Interestingly, a recent report described familial co-segregation of ccTGA and dextro-TGA. ccTGA has been consistently associated with laterality defects, and these findings suggest a common pathogenic pathway involving laterality genes in both defects. This pathway could be related to other CHD, such as atrial/ventricular septal defects. Furthermore, a genetic anomalies integration analysis in each patient is required to determine the relevance in a personalized way as other cilia abnormalities could be relevant to diagnosis and the patient's prognosis. As a result, in isolated and sporadic TGA, the pathogenesis could be more closely associated with an intrinsic abnormal heart development than a cilia-related abnormality.\n\n    In general, it is essential to state that it is widely accepted that variant findings require Sanger sequencing validation despite the constant improving accuracy of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Despite this, it has been suggested that high-quality reads in NGS permit a high concordance of the findings with Sanger analysis, which can be as high as 100%. This concordance is essential as the translational impact of NGS variant findings could be earlier, faster, and cheaper as strict NGS quality controls standards are set.\n\n    Even though this study has limitations, the evidence presented suggests that genetic anomalies clustering is more of a risk-influencing genetic factor for non-syndromic CHD than a causative one in the transposition of the great arteries. Therefore, TGA-associated heterozygous genetic anomalies in cilia genes might cause only subtle alterations that may predispose one to the appearance of the TGA. However, these findings require confirmation and further analysis in situs solitus patients and patients with isomerism features.",

        "Title": "    Whole exome sequencing of high-risk neuroblastoma identifies novel non-synonymous variants",
        "Abstract": "    Neuroblastoma (NBL), one of the main death-causing cancers in children, is known for its remarkable genetic heterogeneity and varied patient outcome spanning from spontaneous regression to widespread disease. Specific copy number variations and single gene rearrangements have been proven to be associated with biological behavior and prognosis; however, there is still an unmet need to enlarge the existing armamentarium of prognostic and therapeutic targets. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of samples from 18 primary tumors and six relapse samples originating from 18 NBL patients. Our cohort consists of 16 high-risk, one intermediate, and one very low risk patient. The obtained results confirmed known mutational hotspots in ALK and revealed other non-synonymous variants of NBL-related genes (TP53, DMD, ROS, LMO3, PRUNE2, ERBB3, and PHOX2B) and of genes cardinal for other cancers (KRAS, PIK3CA, and FLT3). Beyond, GOSeq analysis determined genes involved in biological adhesion, neurological cell-cell adhesion, JNK cascade, and immune response of cell surface signaling pathways. We were able to identify novel coding variants present in more than one patient in nine biologically relevant genes for NBL, including TMEM14B, TTN, FLG, RHBG, SHROOM3, UTRN, HLA-DRB1, OR6C68, and XIRP2. Our results may provide novel information about genes and signaling pathways relevant for the pathogenesis and clinical course in high-risk NBL.",
        "Introduction": "    Neuroblastoma (NBL) presents a major challenge in paediatric oncology due to its highly variable clinical appearance and extreme genetic heterogeneity. It is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in children, originating from immature precursors of sympathic ganglionic cells during embryonic and fetal life. The disease accounts for 7-8% of all childhood malignancies and 15% of all paediatric malignant deaths.\n\n    NBL is diagnosed according to the histopathological criteria defined in the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification. To assess the prognosis of individual patients, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) has developed a pre-treatment risk scheme built on clinical, pathological, and genetic factors like age, histologic category, grade of tumor differentiation, MYCN oncogene and chromosome 11q copy number variations (CNVs), and DNA ploidy. Patients with risk factors like age >18 months, high tumor stage, MYCN amplification (MNA), segmental chromosomal aberrations, and/or unfavourable histology fall into the high-risk group with poor prognosis. High-risk NBLs often infiltrate adjacent organs and metastasize to regional lymph nodes, bone marrow (BM), bone, or soft tissue. About 40-50% of NBLs present metastatic disease at diagnosis; however, in a subgroup of infants, spontaneous regression without any treatment might occur.\n\n    Numerical chromosomal changes are present in low- and intermediate-risk NBLs, whereas structural chromosomal alterations are strongly associated with more aggressive high-risk disease. Chromosomal instability causes CNVs throughout the genome which, together with MNA, presents the most prominent clinically relevant features in the biologic and genomic landscape of NBL. Segmental CNVs frequently comprise losses of chromosomes 1p, 3p, 4p, 11q and gains of 1q, 2p, 17q, but other loci may also be affected. A rare but small group of familial NBL exists, being estimated to cover around 1-2% of all cases. So far, mutations of only two genes have been identified as disease-causing in hereditary NBL: the paired-like homeobox 2B gene (PHOX2B), a key enzyme in early sympathic neurogenesis and a tumor suppressor in NBL metastasis, and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, playing a role in both familial and sporadic NBLs. ALK codes for a tyrosine kinase and appears as a promising therapeutic target. Apart from the activating mutations of ALK and the inactivating mutations in the alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) gene are recurrent mutations infrequent in primary NBL. Additionally, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene rearrangements constitute a frequent genetic failure in NBLs being associated with poor outcome in high-risk patients. The TP53 gene is involved in many cellular processes and is mutated in over 50% of all human cancers. In NBL, the TP53 mutation rate is only about 2%; however, protein accumulation is a frequent phenomenon both in NBL tumors and cell lines. One study reported p53 as a direct transcriptional target of MYCN in NBL. Furthermore, mutations in genes involved in the TP53 pathway may be biomarkers for a subgroup of NBLs with very high-risk within the larger group of high-risk tumors characterized by either classical (MYCN/TERT) or alternative (ATRX) telomere maintenance mechanisms.\n\n    A number of research projects have explored the clinical potential of high-throughput sequencing technologies in adult cancers. However, childhood cancers significantly diverge from adult cancers in terms of clinical behaviour, frequency, histopathology, genetic subtypes, and tumor biology. The extreme heterogeneous nature of NBL is challenging. Many studies have utilized sequencing technology to enhance the knowledge about NBL. The presence of ALK mutations, as the most frequent among primary NBLs, has already been proven; however, other studies revealed novel alterations developed in relapsed NBLs, associated with activation of the ALK-RAS-MAPK pathway or mesenchymal transition.\n\n    In this study, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on paired tumor-normal samples from 18 Norwegian NBL patients: 16 high-risk, one intermediate (IR), and one very low risk (VLR), to investigate their mutational profile and to identify possible novel somatic variants. In addition, for six patients, WES on paired normal:relapse tumor samples was performed. Variants of genes known to be important for NBL development and aggressiveness were detected with a mean number of non-synonymous variants of 28 (range 3-346). Hotspot mutations in the ALK gene were identified in tumor samples from five of these high-risk NBL patients. Mutations in genes previously reported playing a role in NBL disease development were found, including PHOX2B, TP53, DMD, ROS, LMO3, PRUNE2, and ERBB3, members of the MAPK family and ABCA2 genes. Our patient samples revealed few recurrent mutations; however, in addition to the ALK gene, variants in nine biologically relevant genes were identified being mutated in more than one patient i.e. TMEM14B, TTN, FLG, RHBG, SHROOM3, UTRN, HLA-DRB1, OR6C68, and XIRP2. Some potentially important genes were detected by pathway analysis and we hypothesize that further studies of their functional role in the origin and progression of NBL could lead to the discovery of new potential biomarkers.",
        "Methods": "    The study protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK nr: 2014/2010/REK Sor-Ost C). For all patients, written informed consents have been signed and approved by the patient or the parents of the patient, depending of the age at time of diagnosis (below/above 16 years) (REK nr: 2014/2010/REK Sor-Ost C). The parents made a voluntary and deliberate decision regarding their child's participation in the study, based on what is best for their child, their child's opinion, as well as their own perspectives. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations enacted by the Genomics and Bioinformatics Core Facility, Oslo University Hospital, the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and the University of Oslo.\n\n    Primary and relapse tumor samples were collected for diagnostic purpose at the Department of Pathology at Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway. According to the INRG pre-treatment risk classification 16 patients included in the study were primarily diagnosed with high-risk NBL, one with intermediate risk, and one with very low risk disease. Patients have been treated individually but all following the HR-NBL1/SIOPEN protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT01704716) or non-HR NBL protocols when diagnosed with intermediate- or very low risk (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT01728155). All high-risk cases received high dose treatment. The relapsed patients did not follow defined protocols. Blood or BM from included patients, were used as normal control material for WES analysis.\n\n    For DNA extraction different extraction kits were used, depending on the origin of the material: for fresh frozen primary tumor samples the Qiagen Allprep kit or QIAamp DNA mini kit was applied (Qiagen), for bone marrow cells the QIAamp DNA mini kit was used, and for blood the Qiagen EZ1 DNA blood kit was utilized (all Qiagen). For the majority of the samples, an additional cleaning step was applied using the Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator TM10 (Zymo Research). DNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen).\n\n    The library preparation was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V5 following the default protocol and sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2500 using SBS chemistry V3 and paired end-sequencing (2x100bp).\n\n    The raw reads from each sample, in FastQC format, were mapped (lane-wise) using BWA MEM to the human reference genome (build b37 with an added decoy contig, obtained from the GATK resource bundle). Sample-wise sorting and duplicate marking was performed on the initial alignments with Picard tools (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). GATK tools were subsequently used for two-step local realignment around indels, with matching samples (i.e., primary tumor and its corresponding normal) being processed together. Each sample's pair-end read information was checked for inconsistencies with Picard, and base-quality recalibration was performed by GATK. Somatic variant calling on the matching paired samples was done by using the intersection of MuTect and Strelka. Block substitutions were defined as somatic mutations at consecutive positions, where the variant allelic frequency of each was within 5% of the average allelic frequency of the two variants. GATK tools were used for computing coverage statistics based on the recalibrated alignment files. Details of the variant calling pipeline have been described elsewhere.\n\n    Functional annotation of somatic variants were detected using the PCGR. The detected variants were categorized into Tier 1 (strong clinical significance), Tier 2 (potential clinical significance), Tier 3 (uncertain clinical significance), or Tier 4 (other non-synonymous). The VCF files from the variant calling pipeline were compressed and indexed using bgzip and tabix, respectively, as recommended by PCGR. The PCGR script, pcgr.toml, was modified to turn off VCF validation and configured with specific parameters (Peripheral_Nervous_System_Cancer_NOS) for this analysis, as NBL falls inside this main category. The PCGR provided a list of variants in each of our 18 patients. In the PCGR, every somatic variant presented to the program is classified either as Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, or synonymous variant. Tier 1 variants are variants known to be of strong clinical significance for the cancer type specified by the user, in our case NBL. Tier 2 variants are described as variants with potential clinical significance: either strong evidence that the variant has a clinical significance in another cancer type or weak evidence that the variant has clinical significance in the cancer type specified by the user. Tier 1 and Tier 2 variants have to be classified in the CIViC database or the Cancer Biomarkers Database. Tier 3 variants are variants of uncertain clinical significance, which are unspecified non-synonymous variants located within a known tumor suppressor gene or proto-oncogene. All other non-synonymous variants are classified into Tier 4.\n\n    The PCGR uses mutation effect predictors to estimate the biological effect of the non-synonymous variants. In this study, the mutation effect predictor MutationAssessor was chosen to identify biologically relevant variants. When MutationAssessor predicts a variant with damaging effect, the amino acid change caused by that variant is predicted to cause damage to the protein product that impacts the function of the protein. If the variant is predicted to be tolerated, this means that the resulting amino acid change in the protein is predicted to have no functional impact. In this study, we use this definition for a variant to be: predicted to be damaging or predicted to be tolerated. Variant annotation was performed in this study by using the MutationAssessor with high sensitivity as a variant effect predictor. This choice was necessary to avoid losing data of possible interest. Therefore, there might be some false positives (variants that are not damaging) amongst the variants that we classify as biologically relevant, hence the functional importance of candidate genes and variants should be validated.\n\n    The other feature of PCGR utilized in this study is Oncoscore. This is a score between 0 and 1 expressing the frequency of whether a gene has been reported in relation to cancer in the scientific literature. A low score represents a low association, while a high score represents high association. If a variant is classified into Tier 4, Oncoscore can help identify its potential as a target for further investigation.\n\n    Data analyses after utilizing PCGR, including frequency analysis, statistics, and plotting, were performed using the programming language R in the integrated development environment RStudio. Various statistical algorithms for analysis of sequencing data were tested and evaluated. Genes were ranked based on their average amount of mutations across patients (G), their average amount of mutations normalised by gene length (nG), and the total number of patients with mutations in the genes (B).\n\n    To identify pathways impacted by the identified mutated variants GOSeq analysis was performed. The analysis was carried out separately for each sample and all genes with at least one somatic mutation (Tier 1:Tier 4) based on the PCGR analysis were included. We looked at mutations in the coding region. The output of this analysis was a ranking of the Gene Ontology (GO) categories according to the number of samples for which the GO category was significant (p<0.05).",
        "Results": "    A total of 16 primary and four relapse tumor samples of patients diagnosed with high-risk NBL were investigated by WES. Two additional samples of patients not fulfilling the clinical INRG high-risk disease criteria were also included in the study: patient 7 was diagnosed with a localized tumor without MYCN amplification but with an 11q deletion (intermediate risk) and experienced two relapses at different time points, and patient 15 was classified as stage MS with very low risk (no MNA, no 11q deletion), but displayed two segmental aberrations (+2p and +17q). For patient 23, a sample collected at time of diagnosis was not available. All tissue samples were taken prior to therapy, except the primary tumor of patient 14, which was collected after initial chemotherapy treatment had started. The median age at time of diagnosis was 44 months (range 1.5-192 months). Five patients were under the age of 18 months at the time of diagnosis and one of them was MYCN amplified. Among 18 patients at the age of >=18 months, four were MYCN amplified and eight showed an 11q deletion (Table 1). Eight patients relapsed between 10 months and 3 years after diagnosis; seven patients died from the disease. They all belonged to the group of >=18 months.\n\n    The total number of detected variants in the primary tumor samples revealed extreme variations between individual patients, ranging from 12 variants in patient 2 to 1687 variants detected in patient 12. The average number of variants for patients of >=18 months is 237, while for those below 18 months was 14 variants. The mean and median numbers of total variants were 190 and 54, respectively. The mean and median numbers of all detected non-synonymous variants were 28 and 5, ranging from 1 to 346. The total numbers of variants detected in both, primary and relapse tumor samples, were classified into different Tiers (Fig 1A and 1B and S1 and S2 Tables). For the relapsed samples, the mean and median numbers of all detected non-synonymous variants were 66 and 27, ranging from 1 to 424. Numbers of variants detected in relapse samples were higher compared to the corresponding primary tumor samples (S3 Table). The average tumor cell percentage in all samples was 79 (60-90) (S6 Table). For all detected variants, the tumor allele frequency (TAF) is provided (S7 Table).\n\n    No Tier 1 variants with strong clinical significance for the user-specified cancer type have been identified in our study. Tier 2 variants were found in primary and relapse samples and included six variants in four genes, three in ALK, one in the FLT3, one in KRAS, and one in PIK3CA (Table 2). The PIK3CA gene was not mutated in the primary tumor of patient 17. For patient 23, no material from the primary tumor was available.\n\n    Based on the Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR) report, we were able to identify ALK mutations in five patients. Three were classified as being clinically significant (Table 2), while the remaining ones had an uncertain clinical impact (Tier 3) for patient 9 (p.Phe1174Val, c.3520T>G) and patient 20 (p.Phe1174Leu, c.3522C>G). These four different missense variants of the ALK gene are all detected at positions (F1174 and R1275), known as hotspots in NBL.\n\n    Tier 3 includes 108 variants in 101 different genes classified as tumor suppressors and proto-oncogenes in the primary tumor samples of 12 patients (11 patients were >= 18 months) and 77 variants in 71 genes in six relapsed samples (Table 3A and 3B). Several of these variants have previously been reported to play a potential role in NBL disease development, including TP53, DMD, ROS, LMO3, PRUNE2, and ERBB3, members of the MAPK family (MAP2K4 and MAP2K7) and ABCA2 genes. Additionally, two variants in the PHOX2B gene were found (classified as Tier 4): one intron variant in patient 12 and one missense variant in patient 6.\n\n    To evaluate the cancer-associations of certain detected variants, the MutationAssessor predictor algorithm was applied. This sequence-based tool uses the impact of mutations to rank genes according to their significance for cancer. Taking into account the functional impact of amino-acid substitutions on proteins, it gives a functional impact score (FIS) for every non-synonymous mutation. If the FIS is >2.00, the mutation is considered to have a damaging effect. The PHLPP1 gene was mutated in two of the patients with the prediction of a damaged protein variant c.4856G>A in patient 9 and tolerated c.2791G>A variant in patient 12. Beside the observed PHLPP1 mutations, additional genes related to the RET signaling pathway were detected and classified into Tier 3, both in primary and relapse tumor samples: ERBB3, MET, PDGFB, RET, IRS2, DUSP10, AKT1, RIT1, MAPK7, NFKB1, MAP2K7, MAP2K4, MEF2C, and MMP9.\n\n    Variants classified into Tier 3 were grouped into mutations detected only in the primary tumor, shared by the primary and relapse tumor, or unique for relapse samples. Only patient 1 revealed shared variants in nine genes, with TAFs ranging from 14 to 83% (S7 Table); however, additional 20 and 31 gene variants were found to be unique for the primary and relapse, respectively (Table 4). The other three patients with both the primary and relapse tumor samples did not share gene variants classified into Tier 3. We observed shared mutated variants of DUSP10, NR1H4, and MED12 genes between two relapses of patient 7 (Table 5). RET gene variants were detected in two of the relapse samples, patient 1 and 17; however, at different positions (c.2081G>A; c.395T>C).\n\n    Patient samples 2, 6, 8, and 15 exhibited a general lower mutation burden of 12, 96, 12, and 24 detected variants; and neither Tier 2 nor 3 variants were detected. Oncoscore was applied to investigate further potential targets in Tier 4 classified variants in these patients. In patient 2, a total of 12 mutations were found, whereof six were classified as Tier 4 with the highest reported Oncoscore value at ~0.26 in a non-synonymous variant of the NCKAP5 gene, predicted to cause alterations of the resulting protein. All other identified non-synonymous mutations exhibited an Oncoscore below ~0.27. In patient 6, 31 out of a total of 96 mutations were classified as Tier 4. A non-synonymous variant was detected for the TNIK gene, predicted to produce a damaged protein, revealing an Oncoscore of ~0.624. Additionally, mutated variants of PHOX2B gene were detected with Oncoscore ~0.26 (p.Glu129Ter c.385G>T). Unfortunately, MutationAssessor does not provide prediction assessment for this variant. In the tumor sample of patient 8, a total of 12 mutations were determined, of which three were classified into Tier 4. A non-synonymous variant of the PSMC3 gene was found and reported as predicted to produce a malformed protein but with a low Oncoscore of ~0.27. In patient 15, 24 mutations were detected, seven of them being classified as Tier 4. One variant found in the AHNAK2 gene was previously reported as being destructive resulting in a changed protein with an Oncoscore of ~0.60 (S5 Table).\n\n    WES analysis of all samples included in this study revealed a total of 3426 variants. To select a dataset of more biologically relevant variations, filtering was performed using the MutationAssessor results from PCGR. This filtering step reduced the total number of events to 320 potential pathogenic variants. Among these variants, only so far unreported genes mutated in more than one patient are presented (thus, known hotspot genes like ALK were excluded).\n\n    Based on the filtering described above, 17 biologically relevant variants in nine biologically relevant genes were identified in nine patients: TMEM14B, HLA-DRB1, OR6C68, TTN, FLG, RHBG, SHROOM3, UTRN, and XIRP2. Two genes with identical variants were present in two patients (TMEM14B and HLA-DRB1) with a TAF ranging from 44 to 58%, and seven genes with different variants were identified (Tables 6 and S7). Two patients (7 and 12) with mutations of the OR6C68 gene at 12q13.2 showed copy number gains of the corresponding part of 12q (unpublished data). We observed a tendency to obtain mutated variants more frequently in the primary tumor samples of patient 1 and 12.\n\n    Gene ontology analysis (GOseq) for non-synonymous variants revealed several pathways with potential biological impact on NBL, including neuron cell-cell adhesion, biological adhesion, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, immune response-regulating cell surface receptors, or innate immune response activating cell surface receptors (Table 7). In these pathways, the RET, PIK3CA, PHLPP1, KRAS, NFKB1, MUC5B, and MUC6 genes were found to be mutated in at least two patients (Table 5). Further signaling pathways with potential biological significance in NBL and details of the analysis are presented in S5 Table.\n\n    In all of the investigated samples, a total of 2722 out of 20805 genes of the human reference genome 37 (grch37) revealed at least one mutation. To identify cardinal genes of NBL and to evaluate the identified mutated genes, different ranking rules were applied. First, genes were ranked according to the average number of mutations, resulting in a tendency to rank long genes higher. Next, ranking by average divided by gene length was performed and finally, genes were ranked by the total number of observations with mutations in the gene (Table 8). The TTN gene was reported among the top 10 under two different applied ranking rules. Besides TTN, there were no predominant findings detected except two genes listed (TRIM9, PKHD1) in top 10, previously reported in the context of NBL.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Different research groups have used sequencing and CNVs analysis in various efforts to explore the nature of NBL and to find novel strategies for prognostic assessment and therapeutic stratification of NBL with variable results. However, the remarkable heterogeneity of the disease makes it difficult to discover novel candidate genes, relevant for biological behaviour or targeted treatment. Moreover, this heterogeneity may increase under the treatment, and influence clinical interpretation of genetic findings and treatment strategy as pointed out recently. In our study, we identified novel coding variants of genes possibly contributing to the understanding of these processes. Beside the confirmation of known mutations in ALK, we identified changes in genes of the RET signalling pathway, the RAS-MAPK and p53 signalling pathway, immune response genes, and other previously described NBL-related genes. We also detected specific features of the relapse tumor samples, several over-represented genes, and novel non-synonymous variants of genes occurring in more than one patient sample. Presumably, an increased allelic frequency correlates with the oncogenic potential of identified gene variants. In our study, the average TAF for all detected variants is higher than 48%, supporting the assumption that the detected mutations could influence the NBL progression.\n\n    ALK activating mutations were identified in five patients, all at hotspot positions, that might be candidates for using ALK-targeted inhibitors. Three of the patients carrying these mutations were above the age of 18 months at the time of diagnosis and one was exactly at the critical age of 18 months. In patient 9, an ALK mutation was found in addition to a mutated variant of the PHLPP1 gene. PHLPP1 is related to the RET signalling pathway and known for the promotion of tumor progression. The RET gene is involved in neural crest development and ontogenesis of the enteric nervous system. Besides, RET is commonly expressed in NBL. The PHLPP1- and additional genes of the RET signalling pathway were detected in six other primary and relapse tumor samples included in the study (Table 3). All of these patients were 18 months of age or older at time of diagnosis. Additionally, five out of seven patients presented an 11q deletion, one was MNA and for one there was no clinically relevant genomic changes detected. Our analysis detected two different variants of the RET gene in the relapsed samples of patient 1 and patient 17; however, they were classified by MutationAssessor as predicted to be tolerated. Moreover, in six patients GOSeq analysis identified neuron cell-cell adhesion and biological adhesion pathways, both pathways include the RET gene (Table 7).\n\n    Mutations in the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway in patients with NBL are associated with poor prognosis. An example for this statement is patient 16, where all clinical characteristics typically indicate an unfavourable outcome of the disease: MNA, age >18 months at diagnosis, metastasis to skeleton, lymph nodes, and BM. This patient relapsed and died 7 months after diagnosis. So far, KRAS mutations have been linked mostly to relapses, while WES results for patient 16 detected a KRAS variant in the primary tumor sample classified into Tier 2. Parallel to ALK as being an activator of RAS-MAPK pathway, there are other genes promoting its oncogenic function in NBL, like PHOX2B or DMD. Both of these genes show mutated variants in a relapse sample of patient 6 and primary tumor samples of patient 1 and 12; all three patients present an 11q deletion and were above 18 months at the time of diagnosis.\n\n    Poor prognosis in NBL patients is also associated with mutations in genes of the p53 signalling pathway, e.g. CREBBP. A mutated variant in the CREBBP gene (c.7126G>A) was detected in the primary tuomr of patient 1, presenting an 11q deletion and relapse disease.\n\n    Additional mutations were detected in genes, previously reported to play a potential role in NBL disease development, including TP53, DMD, ROS, LMO3, PRUNE2, and ERBB3, members of the MAPK family (MAP2K4 and MAP2K7) and the ABCA2 gene. In three patients with MYCN amplification mutated variants of NFKB1, ALK, and SULF2 were detected. There is evidence that SULF2 is over-expressed in MNA NBL cell lines. All three patients were older than 18 months at the time of diagnosis.\n\n    Immunotherapy with the anti-GD2 antibody is an important step of standard treatment protocol for high-risk NBL patients. It is based on inducing immune responses, e.g. by infusing monoclonal antibodies against the tumor-associated disialoganglioside GD2, combined with for example granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-2. Yet, 40% of NBL patients relapse. Following GOSeq results, we identified mutations in genes involved in immune response-regulating cell surface receptor signalling pathways, e.g. mucines (MUC5B, MUC6, and MUC16), KRAS, PIK3CA, and NFKB1 genes. All changes were found in the relapse samples, except the KRAS variant. Mutations in immune-response related genes detected in relapse tumor, followed by specific functional studies, could provide an important answer what differs in responders and non-responders of immunotherapy and why it is still not that effective. There is no reported association of genes of the MUC gene family with NBL, but these genes are known to play a role in cancer cells differentiation and proliferation, interacting, and regulating tumor microenvironment.\n\n    The relapsed samples examined in our study exhibited more mutated variants in comparison to the primary tumor (both non-synonymous and synonymous), confirming previous findings. This leads to genetic instability and diversity being a major obstacle in the research on prognostic markers and successful treatment in NBL. Five out of six patients who experienced a relapse presented an 11q deletion and one was MNA. All these patients died from the disease. Genes found mutated in relapse of patient 1, such as LMO3 or RET, are associated with unfavourable outcome of the disease and tumor progression. The TAFs of these genes were 83 and 56%, respectively (S7 Table). Based on our findings, the clinical outcome of the patient and the published literature, we speculate that the detected mutations may have rendered these genes to become oncogenic drivers contributing to an unfavourable prognosis and disease development.\n\n    Recent studies suggest that AKT is a critical prognostic factor for NBL and that its expression is correlated with poor prognosis of the disease. Additionally, we observed recurrent mutations in DUSP10 in relapse samples of patient 7. DUSP10 is a member of regulators of neuronal cell growth and differentiation. Taking into account that the TAF of DUSP10 amounted to 48%, and the tumor cell infiltration was 80%, indicates the possibilities of a driver oncogene in this relapse.\n\n    The purposes of this study were to discover novel mutations crucial for the origin, progression, or treatment on high-risk NBL. To this end, we asked whether certain mutations were over-represented in our samples. Despite the relatively low number of patients, we were able to find novel candidates. Due to the high diversity in the mutated genes, different ranking rules were applied in various analytic attempts. Of the top 10 candidates in the various lists, only the TRIM9 and PKHD1 genes have been previously reported in the context of NBL.\n\n    The biological relevance of non-synonymous variants of genes occurring in more than one patient and predicted to cause protein changes were analysed by the mutation effect predictor MutationAssessor algorithm. Here, we describe some interesting candidates detected in this group: TMEM14B, OR6C68, TTN, SHROOM3, and UTRN.\n\n    There is no record of TMEM14B being linked to NBL and the association of TMEM14B to cancer is not clear; however, other members of the TMEM protein family have been found in some NBL samples. There is no clinical pattern between patients with mutated variant of TMEM14B, but one of two presents 11q deletion together with an age above 18 months at the time of diagnosis.\n\n    A possible association of OR6C68 to cancer has so far not been described, but the expression of other members of the odorant receptor family genes is documented in olfactorial NBL, a central nerve-derived neoplasm, which does not belong to the family of sympathic peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNTs). In our study, both patients with a detected variant of OR6C68 have in addition important risk factors as an 11q deletion and age above or equal to 18 months at the time of diagnosis.\n\n    Titin (TTN) is one of the longest genes in the human genome and therefore exposed to a higher risk of random mutations. Nevertheless, this pure statistical statement does not exclude the possibility of biologically relevant mutations in this gene. Mutations in TTN have been previously observed in NBL and olfactorial NBL; however, no obvious conclusion of its biological function was described.\n\n    We observe mutated variants of SHROOM3 in patients presenting an 11q deletion with additional detected mutations in DMD, PRUNE2, and RHGB genes. There is no established relation between SHROOM3 and NBL, but SHROOM3 has been identified as a strong candidate involved in the pathogenesis of craniofacial microsomia, which is a disease believed to be partially caused by disturbances of neural crest cells during embryogenesis. NBL arise like other PNTs of sympathic origin from neural crest-derived cells. Thus, sequence variations of SHROOM3 might occur, and a possible impact of NBL development is not unlikely. Mutations in SHROOM3 have also been observed in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n\n    Different non-synonymous variants for UTRN located on chromosome 6q were detected in two of the patients (1 and 4). We observed different variants of EIF3A gene in the primary tumor of patient 4 and the relapse sample of patient 1. The 6q24 region is commonly deleted in several types of cancers. Mutations in this region have previously been observed in NBL. However, none of our patients with detected variants showed CNVs in that region (unpublished data).\n\n    Our findings demonstrate a remarkable divergence in both clinical and molecular characteristics of NBL, highlighting again the registered enormous heterogeneity observed in this disease.\n\n    In summary, we were able to confirm an unfavourable effect of mutations in RAS-MAPK, RET, or p53 signalling pathway genes. Moreover, some reported variants correlated with the occurrence of relapses and fatal outcome of the disease. In addition, we detected mutated variants of immune-response genes in the majority of relapse tumor samples. Primary refractory or relapsing disease significantly limits the survival of high-risk NBL patients.\n\n    Comparing primary versus relapse tumor samples, only nine shared genes identified in patient 1 may have a driver gene potential for tumor evolution. Concerning the other patients, no such shared genes were classified into Tier 3, suggesting that these genes are more likely passenger-genes, or alternatively, that the relapse is a rare de novo tumor. However, dividing driver- versus passenger-genes is challenging and should be addressed in larger cohorts or functional studies.\n\n    Genetic diversity complicates our understanding of treatment failure. Hopefully, our study will complement to the existing knowledge in the field and aid to select genes which in subsequent functional studies might prove to act as potent future biomarkers in NBL.",

        "Title": "    Gene Screening for Non-Syndromic Deafness in Hainanese Patients",
        "Abstract": "    Hainan Province is the southernmost island in China, far from the mainland, and the resident population changes little. In order to understand the mutation spectrum in Hainan and provide effective genetic counseling for deaf people, we carried out genetic analysis on the non-comprehensive hearing impairment in this population. Therefore, in this study, 183 children with moderate sensorineural deafness in the northeast of Hainan were analyzed with susceptibility gene carrying and gene mutation, providing some reference for hainan to guide the prevention and treatment of deafness.\n\n    Complete clinical evaluations were performed on 183 unrelated patients with a non-syndromic hearing impairment from Hainan Province. Each subject was screened for common mutations using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, including GJB2 c.35delG,c.235delC,c.299_300del AT,c.176_191del16,c.167delT; GJB3 c.538 C>T,c.547G >A;SLC26A4 IVS7-2 A>G,c.2168 A>G,c.1174A>T,c.1229 C>T,c.1226G>A,c.1975G>C,c.2027T>A,c.2162C>T,c.281C>T,c.589G>A,IVS15+5G>A; and mtRNA 1494 C>T,1555 A>G.\n\n    Genetic analysis showed that GJB2, SLC26A4, and mitochondrial M. 1555A > G mutations accounted for 7.10%, 8.74%, and 0.55% of the etiology of non-syndromic hearing impairment, respectively. Common mutations include GJB2 C. 235delC, SLC26A4 c.I vs7-2a  G, C. 2168A G, and mitochondrial M. 1555A > G. The total mutation rate in Hainan was 16.39%.\n\n    Our study is the first one to carry out genetic analysis on non-syndromic hearing impairment in Hainan. The results show that in the cases of non-syndromic hearing impairment in these areas, there is a clear genetic cause accounted for 16.39%, and the mutation hot spots are mainly GJB2 and SLC26A4, and SLC26A4 is the most common mutation site. This study provides useful and targeted information for genetic counseling of deafness in people with non-syndromic hearing impairment in Hainan.",
        "Introduction": "    The common pathogenic genes of deafness in China were GJB2, SLC26A4, and mitochondrial DNA. The most common deafness gene is GJB2.\n\n    In this study, the mutation rate of deafness gene in Hainan was the highest in SLC26A4 not GJB2. The detection rate of deafness genes is generally lower than that in other parts of China.\n\n    Special geographical location and small population movement may be associated with a low mutation rate of deafness gene.\n\n    At present, there are about 360 million deafness patients in the world, more than half of which are caused by genetic factors, among which GJB2, SLC26A4, mitochondrial 12S rRNA, and GJB3 are the common deaf-causing genes. According to the second National Sampling survey of persons with disabilities, in 2006, there were 21 million people with hearing disabilities in China, accounting for 33.51% of the total number of persons with disabilities, and about 30 000 new deaf children are born every year, of which about 50%-60% are caused by genetic factors. A large number of epidemiological studies in China have shown that the common pathogenic genes of inherited deafness in China are GJB2, SLC26A4, mitochondrial 12S rRNA, and GJB3. The types and frequencies of deafness gene mutations are different in different regions and ethnic groups.\n\n    Common pathogenic genes for non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) are the same in different regions and ethnic groups. Regional and ethnic factors play an important role in the clinical diagnosis of non-syndromic hearing impairment. For example, in 2007, P Dai et al tested the deafness gene of 3004 patients with a non-syndromic hearing impairment from 26 regions in China and found that GJB2 gene mutations were the most common account for the etiology of patients with hearing loss. However, due to a large number of deaf populations and regional and ethnic differences, these results do not explain the spectrum of mutations in each region. For example, Yuan et al reported in 2012 that common molecular causes are rare in non-syndromic Tibetan hearing impairment. No GJB2 and SLC26A4 gene mutations were found in 114 patients of Tibetan ethnicity, and 1.75% of hearing loss was related to mitochondrial 12S rRNA mutations.\n\n    Therefore, in the research and consultation of deafness genes, it is necessary to fully consider the differences between regional and ethnic backgrounds and establish specific mutation databases for different populations in different regions. At present, there is a deafness gene mutation spectrum in northern China, central China, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Yunnan.\n\n    Hainan is China's southernmost island (Figure 1), far from the mainland, and its permanent population does not change much. At present, there is no research report on deafness gene of deaf patients in Hainan area. Therefore, in order to understand the genetic mutation spectrum of deaf people in Hainan and provide effective genetic counseling for deaf people, we conducted a genetic analysis of incomplete hearing impairment in this population.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 183 patients with moderate or above sensorineural hearing loss in Hainan province were recruited, including 106 males and 73 females. Age ranged from July to 18 years, with a mean age of 9.5 years. Approved by the Ethics Committee of Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University (Approval No:Med-Eth-Re[2022] 342), this study all of the patients after informed consent signed by the guardian, collected by a professional Aurist, including general information of patients, the condition of the hearing-impaired time causes, such as family history, deafness and establish the medical records archive, to perfect the relevant examination and imaging examination, and hearing. Patients with all kinds of syndromic hereditary deafness and acute and chronic otitis media, Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma, meningitis, and traumatic deafness were excluded. All patients were local residents of Hainan for more than 2 generations and all were of Han nationality. There were 130 patients (76 males and 54 females) with extremely severe hearing loss, 36 patients (21 males and 15 females) with severe hearing loss, and 17 patients (9 males and 8 females) with moderate hearing loss. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVA) according to temporal CT examination.\n\n    All subjects underwent audiological examination at a professional audiology center. The examination contents included behavioral audiometry, pure-tone audiometry (RWM MICRO INC, TinniTest, Sichuan), acoustic resistance (Interacoustics A/S, AD235H, Denmark), auditory brainstem response (ABR) (Intelligent Hearing Systems, SmartEP, USA), and auditory steady-state response (ASSR) (Intelligent Hearing Systems, SmartEP, USA). The mean thresholds of binaural air conductance of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz were calculated according to the hearing examination results of the subjects. According to the classification standard of hearing loss degree of WHO International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Disablement, the degree of hearing loss of subjects over 5 years old was classified as normal hearing: <=25 dB HL; mild hearing loss: 26-40 dB HL; moderate hearing loss: 41-60 dB HL; severe hearing loss: 61-80 dB HL; and extremely severe hearing loss: >=81 dB HL. The diagnosis and degree of hearing loss under 5 years old were classified mainly by reference to the ABR response threshold. The ABR wave V response threshold <=30 dBnHL was taken as the normal standard of response threshold between 2 kHz and 4 kHz, and the diagnosis of hearing loss greater than 30 dBnHL was classified as follows: mild 31-50 dBnHL, moderate 51-70 dBnHL, severe 71-90 dBnHL, and extremely severe >=91 dBnHL. In the same person, hearing loss in both ears shall be judged on the less severe side.\n\n    Peripheral venous blood was collected from the subjects and used the Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry, MALDI-TOF-MS (Huada Clinical Laboratory Center, Shenzhen, China) to detect common deafness genes, including 4 deafness genes and 20 common hot spot mutations, including C.35DELg, C.235DELC, C.299_300del AT, C.176_191DEL16, and C.167DELT in GJB2 gene.C.538 C>T, C.547G > A mutation of GJB3 gene; SLC26A4 gene ivS7-2A >G, C.2168 A>G, C.1174A > T, C.1229C>T, C.1226G > A, C.1975G > C, C.2027T > A, C.2162C >T, C.281C >T, C.589G > A, IVS15+5G > A mutation; and 1494 C>T and 1555 A>G mutations of mitochondrial 12S rRNA.\n\n    Then we set up an Excel database and used Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 19.0 (IBM SPSS Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA) statistical software for analysis and carried out a descriptive analysis of the situation of genetic testing.",
        "Results": "    In this study, 183 patients with hearing impairment were mainly distributed in the eastern, northern, and northwestern regions of Hainan province. All patients had preverbal deafness, with hearing loss ranging from moderate to very severe, ranging in age from 7 months to 18 years. Common deafness gene mutations were detected in 30 of 183 patients (16.39%, 30/183); 13 cases of GJB2 gene mutation (7.10%); and 16 cases of SLC26A4 gene mutation (8.74%) were detected among 30 cases of deafness gene mutation. Mitochondrial DNA mutation was detected in 1 case (0.55%). No GJB3 gene mutation was detected.\n\n    GJB2 coding region sequencing identified 10 known pathogenic mutations (c.11G > A, c.35delG, c.109G > A, c.176-191del16, c.235delC, c.257C > G, c.299-300delAT, c.427C > T, c.512insAACG, and c.605ins46), 2 unclassified variants (c.187G > T, c.368C > A), and 5 polymorphisms (c.79G > A, c.341A > G, c.186C > T, c.558G > A and c.608 T > C). All GJB2 mutations identified in this cohort were recessive. The dominant mutation was absent in this cohort.\n\n    Of these 183 patients, 13 (7.10%, 13/183) carried homozygous or complex heterozygous GJB2 pathogenic mutations; there were 9 (4.92%, 9/183) 235delC homozygous mutations, 3 (1.64%, 3/183) 235delC heterozygous mutations, and 1 235delC heterozygous mutation; 299_300delAT heterozygous mutation) (0.55%, 1/183) (see Table 1 and Figure 2). The mutation sites of GJB2 in Hainan were 235delC, 299_300delAT was rare, and other mutations of GJB2 could not be detected.\n\n    Through genetic screening, we detected 16 (8.74%, 16/183) of 183 patients carrying SLC26A4 CIVS.7-2A > G or C. 2168A > G allele. Temporal computed tomography (CT) examination of the temporal bone in 14 of these 16 patients indicated that the large vestibular aqueduct and CT examination of 2 temporal bones showed no abnormality. Among these 183 patients, CT examination of temporal bone indicated the large vestibular aqueduct in 2 patients, but no SLC26A4 gene was detected. The SLC26A4 gene is the highest detection rate in patients with non-syndromic deafness in Hainan (see Table 2 and Figure 3).\n\n    Low Frequency of Mitochondrial DNA 1555A > G Mutation,   GJB3   Gene Mutations Are Rare\n\n    One homozygous M. 1555A > G mutation (0.55%, 1/183) was detected in the 183 patients with non-syndromic deafness, but the GJB3 mutation was not detected. These results suggest that m.1555A > G mutation and GJB3 mutation are relatively rare in Hainan.\n\n    There were 20 cases of moderate sensorineural hearing loss, 33 cases of severe sensorineural hearing loss, and 130 cases of very severe sensorineural hearing loss. Among the 30 mutations detected, 23 cases had very severe sensorineural hearing loss, 5 cases had severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, and 2 cases had moderate sensorineural hearing loss (all were 235delC homozygous mutations). The greater the hearing loss, the greater the detection rate of the mutation. The more severe the hearing loss, the higher the detection rate of GJB2, SLC26A4 gene mutation (see Table 3).\n\n    Of 183 cases, 14 had a family history, among the 14 cases, 8 cases were brothers (sisters/siblings), but only 1 of the 4 pairs of brothers (sisters/siblings) detected GJB2 235 delC homozygous mutation, and the other 3 pairs did not detect common deafness gene mutation sites. Blood samples from parents were collected for high-throughput gene testing to determine whether there were new deafness gene mutation sites. There was 1 homogenous mutation of mtRNA1555A > G and 1 homozygous mutation of GJB2 235 delC in the remaining 6 patients with family history. There were no common mutations in the remaining 4 patients.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The main causes of sensorineural deafness are genetic factors. According to epidemiological investigation, the common pathogenic genes of deafness in China are GJB2, SLC26A4, and mitochondrial DNA. The most common deafness gene is GJB2, which is carried by 19.41% of deafness patients. The common mutant genotype of GJB2 in Chinese deafness patients is as follows: among the 3 genotypes, 235delC, 176-191DEL16, and 299-300DELAT, 235delC has the highest carrying frequency. The detection rate of SLC26A4 gene responsible for large EVA in deaf people is more than 15%.,12 However, the carrying rate of mitochondrial DNA 1555A>G mutation site was 3.43%.\n\n    In this study, the deafness gene was detected in 30 cases (16.39%, 30/183) of 183 deafness patients. The detection rate of GJB2 gene mutation was 7.10% (13/183), SLC26A4 gene mutation was 8.74% (16/183), and mtRNA gene mutation was 0.55% (1/183). The results were generally lower than those reported in other studies in China. This may be due to the small number of subjects and the limited number of subjects (moderate-to-severe hearing impairment). At the same time, the gene detection method adopted in this paper is Kappe diversion hybridization DNA detection, which has few detection sites, which may also be the possible reason for the low detection rate of pathogenic genes. In addition, the sensitivity of the kit, the operation of the gene tester, and the extraction of DNA may also affect the detection rate.\n\n    Our country is a multinational country with a vast, large population, different regions, different nationalities in the long historical process, long time may be more fusion, increase the difficulty of abnormal gene research, to a certain extent, affected the stability and accuracy of the objective data, test results may also is not the same in each region. Hainan province is an island province. Due to the barrier of the Strait and inconvenient transportation, Hainan has been relatively close to some extent in the long history, with little communication with the inland and slower population flow and change than other provinces. As a result, the genetic test results in Hainan are different from those in mainland of China.\n\n    In this paper, 13 mutation loci of 4 common deafness-related genes were detected in 183 deaf patients from 6 cities and counties in the northeast of Hainan Province. The results showed that the detection rate of SLC26A4 gene mutation was higher than that of GJB2 gene mutation, which was inconsistent with other reports in China. On the one hand, it may be due to the insufficient number of cases detected. On the other hand, it may be due to the small population flow caused by the special geographical position of Hainan Island. The results showed that IVS-2A>G was the most common mutation in SLC26A4 gene, and 235delC was the most common mutation in GJB2 gene, which was basically consistent with domestic literature reports. The detection rate of mitochondrial DNA gene mutation was much lower than that reported in China. In the future, we will continue to expand the screening scope, carry out the full sequence detection of related genes for those with family history but no common deafness gene mutation, clarify the characteristics of deafness gene mutation in Hainan area, improve the deafness gene map, and provide a reference for prevention and treatment of deafness in Hainan area.\n\n    We conducted screening and genetic analysis of common deafness genes in patients with non-syndromic deafness in Hainan for the first time. Compared with the common deafness gene mutations in other regions of mainland China, GJB2 and SLC26A4 were the main mutation hotspots in patients with deafness in Hainan, and SLC26A4 was the most common mutation site. It provides useful and targeted information for genetic counseling of deafness in Hainan population with non-syndromic hearing impairment.\n\n    Ethics Committee Approval: This study was approved by Ethics Committee of Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University (Approval No: Med-Eth-Re[2022] 342).\n\n    Informed Consent: Informed consent was obtained from the patients' guardians who agreed to take part in the study.\n\n    Peer-review: Externally peer-reviewed.\n\n    Author Contributions: Concept - Z.Z., Y.F.; Design - J.Z., Y.F.; Supervision - Z.

        "Title": "    Genetic investigation of Nordic patients with complement-mediated kidney diseases",
        "Abstract": "    Complement activation in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), C3 glomerulonephropathy (C3G) and immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) may be associated with rare genetic variants. Here we describe gene variants in the Swedish and Norwegian populations.\n\n    Patients with these diagnoses (N=141) were referred for genetic screening. Sanger or next-generation sequencing were performed to identify genetic variants in 16 genes associated with these conditions. Nonsynonymous genetic variants are described when they have a minor allele frequency of <1% or were previously reported as being disease-associated.\n\n    In patients with aHUS (n=94, one also had IC-MPGN) 68 different genetic variants or deletions were identified in 60 patients, of which 18 were novel. Thirty-two patients had more than one genetic variant. In patients with C3G (n=40) 29 genetic variants, deletions or duplications were identified in 15 patients, of which 9 were novel. Eight patients had more than one variant. In patients with IC-MPGN (n=7) five genetic variants were identified in five patients. Factor H variants were the most frequent in aHUS and C3 variants in C3G. Seventeen variants occurred in more than one condition.\n\n    Genetic screening of patients with aHUS, C3G and IC-MPGN is of paramount importance for diagnostics and treatment. In this study, we describe genetic assessment of Nordic patients in which 26 novel variants were found.",
        "Introduction": "    Rare genetic variants have been associated with the ultra-rare complement-mediated kidney diseases atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) as well as the rare kidney disease immune complex-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN). HUS is characterized by the simultaneous development of acute kidney injury, non-immune hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The most common cause of HUS is gastrointestinal infection with Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). A less common form is aHUS, associated with overactivation of the alternative pathway of complement due to heterozygous variants or the presence of circulating auto-antibodies.\n\n    In aHUS overactivation of complement has been associated with gain-of-function mutations in complement components such as C3 and factor B or loss-of-function mutations in complement regulators such as factor H, factor I, and membrane-cofactor protein (MCP or CD46). Rare genetic variants have also been described in factor H-related 5, the terminal complement pathway regulator clusterin, thrombomodulin, diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGKE), often associated with development of HUS in infancy, and the fibrinolytic factor plasminogen. Variants affecting components of the classical pathway of complement, such as C2 and C4 binding-protein, have also been described. In addition to specific genetic variants, alone or in combination, certain haplotypes in factor H and MCP have been described as being risk-associated for the development of disease. Some patients have antibodies to factor H which may occur in combination with deletions or hybrid genes in factor H-related proteins.\n\n    aHUS is associated with both familial and sporadic cases. The presence of a heterozygous mutation is not necessarily associated with disease. In addition to an underlying genetic variant, found in about 60-70% of cases, a trigger, such as infection or pregnancy, can contribute to the development of aHUS. Disease recurrences are common, and the natural course of disease is characterized by the development of end-stage kidney disease which may also recur after transplantation.\n\n    C3G is a chronic form of glomerulonephritis that can lead to end-stage kidney disease and is further subdivided into C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and Dense Deposit Disease (DDD) based on ultramorphology. Complement activation via the alternative pathway occurs primarily in the fluid phase either due to mutations or auto-antibodies. This leads to increased C3 consumption, low serum C3 and increased complement deposition in glomeruli. Immunofluorescence of kidney biopsies shows predominant C3 deposition and little or no immunoglobulin deposits. Patients with C3G carry mutations in C3 and complement factor B (CFB), as well as in complement factor H (CFH), complement factor I (CFI) and complement factor H-related 5 (CFHR5). C3 nephritic factors are auto-antibodies that bind the C3 convertase prolonging its half-life and are found in in many patients. Some patients with C3G may have an underlying monoclonal gammopathy.\n\n    IC-MPGN is also a chronic form of glomerulonephritis that can progress to end-stage renal disease. It cannot be differentiated from C3GN based on renal symptoms and ultramorphology but immunofluorescence exhibits deposits of immunoglobulins as well as complement. Although IC-MPGN can be associated with infections, such as viral hepatitis, or monoclonal gammopathy, cluster analysis revealed that some patients have excessive complement activation via the alternative pathway, properdin-dependent C3 nephritic factors as well as genetic variants in complement. This suggests an overlapping spectrum of disease between C3G and IC-MPGN with regard to etiology and clinical course.\n\n    Genetic variants have been found in these complement-mediated kidney diseases in several population studies. The aim of this paper is to describe genetic variants associated with aHUS, C3G and IC-MPGN in patients from Sweden and Norway. Sequencing encompassed the genes encoding complement factor H, C3, factor I, factor B, MCP, C5, factor H-related proteins 1-5, clusterin, DGKE, thrombomodulin, plasminogen, and properdin. Twenty-six novel genetic variants were found, and certain variants were found in more than one condition.",
        "Methods": "    Patients with suspected complement-mediated renal diseases or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are referred to the Dept of Pediatrics, Lund University, for genetic analysis. In this study patients with suspected TTP were not included. A total of 141 patients, both children and adults, living in Sweden or Norway, were included, 94 patients with a clinical diagnosis of aHUS, 40 patients with C3G and 8 patients with IC-MPGN. One patient had both aHUS and IC-MPGN. The diagnosis of aHUS was made by the referring physician based on the simultaneous presentation of non-immune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury as well as negative testing for enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Patients with documented defects in cobalamin metabolism were excluded. The diagnosis of C3G and IC-MPGN was based on kidney biopsy results. Patient data consisted of age of disease debut, laboratory data (such as complement levels and the presence of auto-antibodies), course of disease including kidney failure and familial cases. Data regarding treatment was not uniformly available as most samples were collected upon initial diagnosis. Patient data are presented in  Table 1 . Informed consent was obtained for diagnostic genetic analysis and the project was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority, approval no. 2021-04438. The Swedish Ethical Review Authority waived the requirement for written consent from patients included retrospectively in this study. All patients included after October 2021 gave informed written consent.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed by Sanger sequencing until the end of 2016. These samples were assayed for variants in genes encoding factor H, factor I, membrane cofactor protein CD46, C3 and factor B. From 2017 samples were assayed by next generation sequencing first using whole exome sequencing and from 2020 by whole genome sequencing. A panel of 17 genes was assayed including complement factor H (CFH), factor I (CFI), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), C3, factor B (CFB), properdin (CFP), clusterin (CLU), factor H-related proteins 1-5 (CFHR1-CFHR5), ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), thrombomodulin (THBD), DGKE, C5 and plasminogen (PLG). In this study variants in ADAMTS13 were not included.\n\n    For Sanger sequencing genomic DNA was combined with DNA polymerase, primers and nucleotides. The PCR product was sequenced bidirectionally using fluorescent chain-terminating nucleotides from Big dye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems DNA Analyzer, model 3730.\n\n    Next generation sequencing was performed in collaboration with the Center for Molecular Diagnostics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, using either whole exome or whole genome sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) libraries were generated using Agilent SureSelect Clinical Research Exome v2. Whole-genome sequencing libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq PCR-Free. Sequencing was done on either Next Seq 500 (WES) or Novaseq (WES and NGS), with 2 x 150 bp paired end reads and a target depth of at least 30x. Resulting reads were analyzed using the Broad Institute best practices (https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/best-practices) as implemented in the Sentieon software suite (https://www.sentieon.com/). Briefly, reads were mapped to the human genome (build hg19) with BWA MEM and variants were identified using DNAscope as implemented in Sentieon. Structural variants were detected with CNVnator and Manta for WGS, and with CNVkit for WES. Variants were annotated using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP, https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/) and filtered for the following genes: CFH, CFHR1-5, CFI, MCP, CFB, C3, C5, CFP, DGKE, PLG, THBD and CLU. All relevant variants were verified in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv). Interpretation of variants was performed using Scout software (Similarities from COntinUous Traits https://clinical-genomics.github.io/scout) and prediction was performed using Mastermind (mastermind.genomenon.com). Certain DNA samples were also sequenced at Centogene, Rostock Germany.\n\n    Sequencing data included nucleotide shift and amino acid alterations as well as zygosity. This information was analyzed using databases describing mutations and polymorphisms in the included genes such as www.complement-db.org,  and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp for variant calling. Minor allele frequency was defined by the frequency of the second most common allele. Minor allele frequency less than 1% was defined as a possible mutation. Variants that were previously described as associated with disease were included even if the minor allele frequency was > 1%. Variants were considered novel if not previously published in the medical literature. Variants that were previously reported in the ClinVar database in association with complement-mediated diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, aHUS or C3G are mentioned.\n\n    C3 was analyzed by nephelometry and C3d by double-decker rocket immunoelectrophoresis according to hospital routines. Low and high levels were defined as below or above the laboratory reference values. Antibodies against factor H and C3 or C4 nephritic factor were detected at the Department of Clinical Immunology, Skane University Hospital in Lund as per hospital routines. Factor H antibodies were detected as previously described with minor modifications. C3 nephritic factor was detected using three methods, by ELISA, by hemolytic assay and by crossed immunoelectrophoresis and. If any of these assays were positive the patient was defined as having C3 nephritic factor. C4 nephritic factor was detected as previously described with minor modifications.",
        "Results": "    Of all 141 patients with aHUS, C3G and IC-MPGN 80 patients were found to have genetic variants. Of 94 aHUS patients, 60 patients had genetic variants. Of these 32 patients had more than one variant and a total of 68 different aHUS-related variants were identified, considering deletions in CFHR1 and CFHR3 as one variant, as these genes are adjacent to each other. The genetic variants in aHUS patients are summarized in  Table 2  and  Supplementary Table 1 . Deletions in CFHR1 and CFHR3 are only reported when homozygous except for one patient with antibodies to factor H (patient 17). Eighteen variants were novel to this study and have not been described before. Two of these was previously reported in ClinVar in association with complement-mediated disease. The association between the genetic variants and kidney function, if known, is summarized in  Supplementary Table 1 .\n\n    In 40 C3G patients 15 patients were found to have 29 genetic variants which could be associated with disease (considering homozygous deletions in CFHR1 and CFHR3 as one variant). Of these 8 patients had more than one variant. Nine variants in C3G were novel to this study and have not been described before (two of these were previously reported in ClinVar in association with complement-mediated diseases). The genetic variants are summarized in  Table 3 . The association between the genetic variants and kidney function, if known, is summarized in  Supplementary Table 2 .\n\n    Eight patients with IC-MPGN were investigated but one of these also had aHUS (patient 254 in  Supplementary Tables 1 ,  3 ). In the remaining seven patients, four patients had five genetic variants. The genetic variants are summarized in  Table 4 . The association between the genetic variants and kidney function, if known, is summarized in  Supplementary Table 3 .\n\n    The number of variants found in patients whose DNA underwent Sanger sequencing but did not undergo next generation sequencing may represent an underestimation as only five genes were sequenced encoding CFH, C3, CFI, MCP and CFB.\n\n    The number of genetic variants detected in patients with aHUS and C3G is summarized in  Tables 5 ,  6 , respectively. For patients with IC-MPGN only five variants were detected. In aHUS most variants were detected in the gene encoding CFH followed by C3 and in C3G the reverse was found.\n\n    The location of all genetic variants detected is presented in  Figure 1  which also depicts which variants are novel and which were found in more than one condition. Most variants were heterozygous, however, homozygous variants were found in CFH (P621T), CFI (S326P), CD46 (c.97 + 1G>A), CFHR5 (V110A), DGKE (Y326* and S485F), in patients with aHUS (the patient with the homozygous CFH variant P621T also had IC-MPGN). In both aHUS and C3G homozygous deletions in CFHR1 and CFHR3 were detected.\n\n    Certain variants were found in both aHUS and C3G or IC-MPGN patients. These included CFH (P621T in the same patient, D693N, Q950H, N1050Y (the latter with MAF>1%) and S1209T), C3 (K155Q and W1631*), CFI (G328R, c.1534 + 5G>T), CD46 (A353V, MAF >1%), CFHR5 (E163Kfs*10, E226DFS*7, Y279N), THBD (P501L), PLG (R89K and R261H) and homozygous deletions of CFHR1 and CFHR3. Of these CFHR5 E226DFS*7 was novel and found in both aHUS and C3G patients.\n\n    Upon referral for genetic testing, we had access to clinical information describing the course of disease in most patients. When these data were available, we correlated the genetic findings to the presence of kidney failure, as presented in  Supplementary Tables 1 - 3 . The genetic variants were correlated to levels of C3, C3d and the presence of antibodies to factor H in aHUS ( Supplementary Table 1 ) or nephritic factors in C3G or IC-MPGN ( Supplementary Tables 2 ,  3 ).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In complement-mediated kidney diseases aHUS, C3G, and IC-MPGN understanding a patient's genotype and its correlation to disease phenotype is of paramount importance for diagnostics and choice of treatment. Genetic investigation is also crucial for determining the risk of disease recurrence, the suitability of kidney transplantation and the choice of donor, as well as evaluation of the risk of disease development in family members bearing the same variant, including family members considered as kidney donors. This study investigated the genotype of a large cohort of patients with these diseases using a panel of disease-associated genes. In aHUS 68 different variants were identified and in C3G 29 different variants were identified, most variants were heterozygous and 26 were novel. Importantly, 40 patients with aHUS and C3G had more than one genetic variant, exemplifying the complexity of interpreting disease heredity.\n\n    Seventeen genetic variants, novel as well as previously reported, had a dual disease phenotype occurring in both patients with aHUS and C3G. The presence of a disease-associated genetic variant is not tantamount to the development of symptoms, as it is known that disease penetrance is incomplete and we show here that identical genetic alterations may be associated with different disease phenotypes. This suggests that disease expression may be related to additional genetic factors (complement genes as well as others), the exposome such as triggering factors and, as yet, undefined environmental, lifestyle or epigenetic factors.\n\n    In aHUS and C3G genetic variants were previously identified in complement components and complement regulatory proteins. The variants may cause a loss-of-function in regulators or a gain-of-function in complement factors. Variants in CFH have been shown to lead to a loss-of-function by reducing cofactor activity, as shown for Q950H and V1168E, impairing C3b binding, demonstrated for S1191L, or by deficiency associated with decreased protein secretion, as shown for P621T. Additionally, variant S1191L exhibited impaired ability to regulate complement activation on cell surfaces. Genetic variants in factor I can lead to quantitative deficiency or functional defects in protease activity rendering the enzyme incapable of inactivating C3b. This was, however, not specifically demonstrated for the variants presented herein, as, for example, the aHUS-associated variant G261D did not exhibit complement dysregulation. CD46 variants may also cause loss-of-function by reduced expression on cell surfaces, as shown for c.286 + 2T>G and S201L, decreased cofactor activity, or affect C3b/C4b binding capacity. Likewise, thrombomodulin inhibits complement activation by promoting C3b inactivation and mutated variants have exhibited less C3b inactivation to iC3b on cell surfaces, as shown for the P501L variant.\n\n    C3 and CFB variants may exhibit gain-of-function properties in the respective encoded proteins. The variant V1658A in C3 results in increased C3 convertase formation and K155Q confers increased hemolytic activity. Additionally, the C3 variant K65Q is associated with reduced binding to factor H, and variant R592W exhibits impaired binding to the complement regulator CD46/MCP. CFB variants may increase the affinity to C3b, thus stabilizing the convertase, as shown for variant D371G and by increased resistance to factor H-mediated decay. However, not all variants show dysfunction in in vitro models, as reported for L433S, I242L and E601K.\n\n    Variants in DGKE cause the development of aHUS in young children, often in combination with proteinuria. It has been suggested that homozygous DGKE variants lead to loss-of-function and consequently a prothrombotic state, however the mechanism by which the variants Y326* and S485F lead to disease has yet to be deciphered. Likewise, plasminogen deficiency or dysfunction is associated with reduced proteolytic activity in growing thrombi which may contribute to a thrombosis.\n\n    Many patients had several variants in more than one gene. In these cases, the individual variants themselves may not lead to disease development, but when combined may result in complement over-activation. As previously described in an anephric aHUS patient, with a CFH disease-associated haplotype as well as CFI and CFB variants, the patient had evidence of complement activation, developed carotid artery stenosis, and was successfully treated with eculizumab. Some genetic variants are distinctly pathological, even without the presence of other variants, such as the C3 mutation V1636A. On the contrary, some variants that in vitro exhibit a dysfunctional protein, may be present in unaffected carriers that remain disease-free, such as the CFH variant V1168E and the CFB variant D371G.\n\n    For the variants presented herein we provide prediction as to their possible pathogenicity, when available. Prediction models can efficiently assess if a genetic alteration is benign or pathogenic, however, they are not always accurate and may require combining various prediction scores, thus interpretation can be challenging. Functional tests, using mutant compared to wild-type proteins, can more accurately demonstrate protein dysfunction. Considering the rarity and complexity of disease expression, we recommend performing mutagenesis to predict the effect of genetic variants on complement activation.\n\n    This study found that 72% of aHUS and 38% of C3G patients had genetic variants, therefore not all patients who develop disease carry variants in the screened genes. In aHUS this may, in part, be due to the presence of antibodies to factor H and in C3G to the presence of nephritic factors which may cause disease. Additionally, 47 patients were sequenced using only the Sanger method. In these patients, all the known disease-related genes were not sequenced and the percentage of patients with genetic variants may be higher. Even though the frequency of variants in this cohort may be underestimated, other cohorts have identified patients with no known cause for both aHUS and C3G. Previous studies show that about 45-60% of aHUS patients and 30-40% of C3G patients carry mutations. Additionally, in C3G and IC-MPGN 50% of patients included herein had C3NeF (or C4NeF) which is comparable to previous reports regarding C3NeF. Clearly, all disease-related mechanisms for aHUS and C3G have not been found and future research may uncover new disease-related genes which are not routinely screened for at present.\n\n    Patient samples included in this study were collected over a 20-year period. Thus, many patients were included before complement-inhibitory therapy with eculizumab was available. A further limitation of the study is that data regarding treatments was not fully available in referrals, mostly because DNA samples were submitted as part of a diagnostic work-up and, in certain cases, before a diagnosis was made and treatment was initiated. For these reasons, this study could not associate specific genetic variants with the need for complement-inhibitory therapy and outcome.\n\n    To conclude, this study presents genetic variants found in Swedish and Norwegian patients with aHUS, C3G and IC-MPGN, 26 of which were novel. Some patients had multiple variants in genes encoding complement proteins. Bearing a genetic variant does not necessarily lead to occurrence of disease as there is incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype. Furthermore, certain variants were found in both aHUS and C3G suggesting that factors additional to genetic composition can dictate the phenotype. Further investigations are required to better understand the impact variants have on protein functionality, and how they lead to disease expression.",

        "Abstract": "    At least 60% of cases of severe hearing loss result from genetic factors. In this study genetic screening was carried out for common genetic deafness in women of childbearing age to prevent deafness and birth defects via providing genetic counseling and follow-up services for high-risk families.\n\n    In total 60,391 pre-pregnancy/early-gestation women who received treatment in second-level or above hospitals in Weihai from February 2017 to December 2019 were selected. Venous or peripheral blood was collected to make dried blood slices on filter paper to extract genomic DNA, and high-throughput sequencing was applied to detect 20 variant sites in 4 common deafness genes (GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA) in the Chinese population. The spouses of women with deafness gene variants were sequenced.\n\n    In total 3,761 carriers with deafness gene variants were detected in 60,391 women of childbearing age, with a carrier rate of 6.2%. Among them, 1,739 women (2.88%) only carried GJB2 pathogenic variants. The carrying rate of c.235delC in GJB2 pathogenic variants was the highest at 2.08%. 1,553 women (2.58%) only carried SLC26A4 pathogenic variants. The carrying rate of c.919-2A>G in SLC26A4 pathogenic variants was the highest at 1.63%. 300 women (0.5%) only carried GJB3 variants, and 125 women (0.2%) carried the mitochondrial drug-sensitive gene variant.\n\n    This screening model will greatly reduce the birth rate of children with hearing disabilities and is an effective way to prevent newborn deafness. In addition, genetic screening provided the related knowledge of hereditary deafness, especially strengthening genetic counseling and the clinical decision making from the genetic screening.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss is a universal auditory dysfunction. Severe hearing loss strongly impacts human daily communication and social activities. Based on the latest WHO data in 2019, there are about 466 million hearing-impaired people worldwide, accounting for 5% of the world's total population. The Second National Sample Survey on Disabilities in 2006 revealed that there were 27.8 million people with hearing disabilities in China, of whom 20.04 million were simply people with hearing disabilities, accounting for 24.2% of the total. Neonatal deafness incidence is 1-3%, that is, about 30,000 deaf children are born every year. The China Birth Defects Prevention Report (2012) pointed out that hearing disabilities have become the second largest birth defect in China. Therefore, preventing hearing disabilities and intervening in birth defects are essential aspects to improve the quality of the Chinese population. Studies have shown that at least 60% of cases of severe hearing loss result from genetic factors. Hereditary hearing loss mainly involves four types: autosomal recessive inheritance (approximately 80%), autosomal dominant inheritance (approximately 15-20%), mitochondrial inheritance (approximately 1%) and sex-linked inheritance (approximately 1%). Based on a molecular epidemiological survey of deafness in China, GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA are the most universal deafness genes in Chinese. The hereditary hearing loss resulting from GJB2 and SLC26A4 follows autosomal recessive inheritance. Carriers of mitochondrial 12S rRNA variants are sensitive to aminoglycoside drugs, belonging to maternal inheritance, whose deafness rate in Chinese with hearing loss is up to 34%. However, survey data reveal that among the normal population in China, about 6% are carriers of common deafness gene variants, and most deaf newborns each year are born to families without a family history of deafness. It can be seen that although deafness gene screening and intervention for people with hearing loss can prevent birth of deaf children by deaf parents to a certain extent, it cannot effectively prevent normal parents from giving birth to children with hereditary hearing loss. Therefore, screening of common deafness genes in the normal population before the marriage check or pregnancy and early gestation, early detection of couples with pathogenic variants in the same gene and corresponding intervention measures are effective means to prevent hearing disabilities.\n\n    In this study, we conducted common deafness gene screening in 60,391 women of childbearing age in Weihai, genetic counseling in high-risk families and corresponding intervention measures, which can effectively prevent these families from giving birth to children with hearing loss, thus reducing the incidence in the region and providing genetic counseling and clinical decision making from the genetic screening.",
        "Methods": "    In total 60,391 pre-pregnancy/early-pregnancy women who received treatment in second-level or above hospitals in Weihai between February 2017 and December 2019 were selected, ranging in age from 18 to 47, and gestational age less than 15 + 6 weeks. Among them, there were in total 53 women with different degrees of hearing loss, and 17 with family history of hearing disabilities. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Weihai Maternal and Child Health Hospital, and all research subjects signed informed consent forms.\n\n    All patients completed the survey by answering questions and filling in the \"deafness questionnaire survey form.\" The details were as follows: (a) basic information: name, gender, date of birth, nationality, marital status, contact information, etc.; (b) morbidity status: age of onset, presence of other associated symptoms (vertigo, tinnitus, etc.), related medical history (infectious diseases, etc.), history of use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, long-term noise exposure, otitis media or traumatic history of the ear, etc.; (c) the development condition of language, whether wearing a hearing aid or cochlea, etc.; and (d) whether other systemic diseases co-existed (eyes, bones, intellectual disability, etc.). Ear examination and audiological evaluations including pure-tone audiometry, immittance testing, auditory brainstem response, and auditory steady-state response were performed for all hearing impaired patients. Physical and neurological examinations were carried out with special attention to renal and ophthalmologic differences to exclude those with syndromic deafness (Figure 1).\n\n    Venous or peripheral blood of our subjects was collected to prepare dry blood slices on filter papers (Whatman 903), each with at least 2 blood spots. An automatic punching machine was used to take a slice of dried blood sample to corresponding 96-well plates complemented with reagents, and it was sealed with aluminium film. The plates were placed on a heater to boil, and cooled for later use. QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used to extract genomic DNA from each blood sample following the manufacturer's instructions, and a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to evaluate the quantity and quality of extracted DNA.\n\n    Twenty common variant sites of GJB2, SLC26A4, and GJB3, as well as mtDNA, were detected by using a deafness diagnostic screening panel (CapitalBio Genomics Co., Ltd., China). Library construction, quality control, and sequencing template preparation were performed according to the instructions of a Blood DNA LQ kit. The PCR method was used to amplify 20 variant sites in GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA genes, then sequencing labels were added and purified to complete library construction.\n\n    Via the high-throughput sequencing method and gene sequencer BGISEQ-500 to detect deafness genes, 20 pathogenic sites in 4 genes were detected, including in GJB2 c.35delG, c.167delT, c.176_191del16, c.235delC and c.299_300delAT, GJB3 gene c.538C>T and c.547G>A, in SLC26A4 c.281C>T, c.589G>A, c.919-2A>G, c.1174A>T, c.1226G>A, c.1229C>T, c.1707+5G>A, c.1975G>C, c.2027T> A, c.2162C>T and c.2168A>G, and in mitochondrial 12S rRNA m.1494C>T and m.1555A>G.\n\n    For women who have been screened for the pathogenic sites in deafness genes, it is recommended that their spouses undergo corresponding gene sequencing, providing medication guidance for women with drug-sensitive gene variants. For couples who carry pathogenic variants in the same gene, genetic counseling was provided and corresponding intervention measures were taken. Postpartum neonatal hearing screening and follow-up for women with deafness gene mutations were done.",
        "Results": "    Among 60,391 pre-pregnancy/early-pregnancy women, in total 3,761 women carried common deafness gene variants, with a total carrier rate of 6.23% (3,761/60,391) (Table I), 1724 (2.85%) carried only one GJB2 variant, 1,534 (2.54%) only carried one SLC26A4 variant, 300 (0.5%) only carried one GJB3 variant, and 125 (0.2%) carried the drug-sensitive gene variant. There were 44 women (0.07%) carrying two deafness gene variants, of whom 38 carried both GJB2 and SLC26A4 variants, accounting for 0.06% of the total screened population, 3 carried both GJB2 and GJB3 variants, and 3 carried SLC26A4 and GJB3 variants at the same time. Additionally, there were 53 women with clinical manifestations of varying degrees of hearing loss, of whom 15 (0.02%) carried 2 pathogenic variants in GJB2 at the same time, 19 (0.03%) carried 2 pathogenic variants in SLC26A4 at the same time, 3 carried gene variants for drug-sensitive deafness, 4 only carried 1 variant in GJB2 or SLC26A4, and 12 did not carry common variants.\n\n    GJB2. In this study, 1,780 women carried the GJB2 variant, with a carrying rate of 2.92% (1,780/60,391). Among them, the carrying rate of c.235delC was the highest at 2.08%; c.299_300delAT was the second with 0.73%; the carrying rate of c.35delG was the lowest at 0.005% (Table II).\n\n    SLC26A4. In total 1,594 women carried the SLC26A4 variant, with a carrying rate of 2.62% (1,594/60,391). Among them, the carrying rate of c.919-2A>G was the highest at 1.63%, followed by c.2168A>G, with a carrying rate of 0.42% (Table III).\n\n    Based on the female test findings, we recommend that the husbands of 3,336 women with GJB2 or SLC26A4 variants undergo corresponding gene sequencing. In total 1,746 women's spouses agreed to be tested. The detection rate was 52.3% (1746/3336) and 139 men carried GJB2 or SLC26A4 variants, with a carrying rate of 7.96% (139/1,746). Among them, 1,146 men were sequenced for GJB2; 77 were carrying known pathogenic variants, and 5 carrying suspected pathogenic variants or variants of unknown clinical significance. In total 600 men were sequenced for SLC26A4; 31 were carrying known pathogenic variants, and 26 carrying suspected variants or variants of unknown clinical significance. From the results, the known pathogenic variants were mainly c.109G>A (2.18%), c.235delC (1.54%), c.299_300delAT (0.52%) and c.919-2A> in SLC26A4 and G (0.98%) in GJB2. At the same time, in SLC26A4 suspected pathogenic variants and variants of unknown clinical significance accounted for a relatively high proportion of 1.49% (Table IV).\n\n    Based on the clinical manifestations and test results of couples, it was finally determined that 99 couples carried known or suspected pathogenic variants in GJB2 or SLC26A4, and their offspring have a 25% risk of disease, which is in line with the prenatal indications for diagnosis. But among these 99 couples, 38 husbands carried the GJB2 c.109G>A variant. At present, although the GJB2 c.109G>A variant is considered to be a pathogenic variant, the hearing phenotype resulting from it is quite different: hearing can be normal or weakened, and it also can be manifested at birth or later, so if the offspring is diagnosed as a GJB2 c.109G>A homozygous variant or compound heterozygous variant before birth, their hearing phenotype after birth cannot be predicted. Finally, after genetic counseling and full informed consent, in total 51 couples underwent prenatal diagnosis, including 6 with the GJB2 c.109G>A variant (Table V), and 7 chose to undergo pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. The results of prenatal diagnosis showed that the offspring of 14 couples inherited deafness gene variants other than GJB2 c.109G>A from their parents. It is most likely that they are hereditary deafness patients, accounting for 27.5%. The offspring of 2 couples were a GJB2 c.235delC/c.109G>A compound heterozygous variant and a c.109G>A/c.299_300delAT compound heterozygous variant. The offspring of 23 couples may carry only one deaf gene variant or they did not inherit variants of their parents, and the predicted risk of the fetus with hereditary deafness is extremely low.\n\n    Among 125 women carrying drug-sensitive gene variants, 97 carried 12S rRNA 1555A>G homogeneous variants, 21 carried 12S rRNA 1555A>G heterogeneous variants, and 7 carried 12S rRNA 1494C>T homogeneous variants (Table I), respectively, accounting for 0.16%, 0.03% and 0.01% of the total people screened. The follow-up of women and their maternal family members revealed 3 women with hearing disability and 1 uncle with hearing disability. Because drug-susceptibility gene mutations follow the maternal inheritance method, we issued medication guide cards to 125 carriers of drug-susceptibility gene mutations, informing them and their maternal family members that they should absolutely avoid using aminoglycoside drugs throughout their lives in case of deafness.\n\n    Our work conducted follow-up of the offspring's hearing of 3,761 female carriers; 21 carriers' children were finally diagnosed with hearing disabilities.\n\n    Among them, 18 children were tested for deafness genes; 12 carried two variants in GJB2 or SLC26A4, and they were clearly children with congenital hereditary hearing loss; 6 did not carry or only carried one variant in GJB2 or SLC26A4 (Table VI).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The GJB2 variant is the first cause of hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) among Chinese. At present, there are more than 100 gene variants in GJB2 that are known to be pathogenic (https://hereditaryhearingloss.org.), and these variants have obvious regional and ethnic differences. There are also differences in common GJB2 variant sites in Chinese from different regions. SLC26A4 is the second most universal variant gene in NSHL patients, and patients of different races also have different gene variant profiles. In China, c.919-2A>G is the most common variant. Based on previous studies, in our hospital the main pathogenic variant of NSHL patients in the Jiaodong area is GJB2 c.235delC, followed by SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G. Among 60,391 women of childbearing age in this study, 1,739 only carried the GJB2 variant, with a carrying rate of 2.88%; 1,553 women only carried the SLC26A4 variant, with a carrying rate of 2.58%. The carrying rates of GJB2 and SLC26A4 variants among Chinese were 3% and 2-3%, respectively, which are basically the same. Among them, GJB2 c.235delC has the highest carrying rate, accounting for 2.08%, followed by SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G, with a carrying rate of 1.63%, which further confirms that common deafness gene variants in Jiaodong are mainly GJB2 c.235delC and SLC26A4 c. 919-2A>G.\n\n    GJB2 encodes a gap junction protein (connexin 26 protein - Cx26). The most common pathogenic variant in GJB2 among Chinese is c.235delC, if which lack its base will result in frameshift variants in the coding region of GJB2, leading to premature termination of translation and the formation of non-functional Cx26, which results in sensorineural hearing loss. The GJB2 c.235delC homozygous variant is mostly manifested as congenital severe-extremely severe hearing loss, and very few cases are delayed moderate post-lingual hearing loss. Chang et al. conducted audiometric phenotype statistics on 100 NSHL patients with the GJB2 c.235delC homozygous variant, finding that patients with deafness caused by the GJB2 c.235delC homozygous variant showed diversity in both ear hearing phenotypes and the degree of hearing loss is mainly extremely severe, severe and moderately severe, whereas mild is the least common. In this study, 6 women were detected as GJB2 c.235delC homozygous variants, and their hearing phenotypes were also heterogeneous, including 4 women with congenital extremely severe hearing loss in both ears, 1 with moderate hearing loss, and 1 with mild hearing loss. This has accumulated original data for us to further exploit the mechanism of different hearing phenotypes of patients carrying the same gene variants, thereby providing a possible basis for treating genes in NSHL patients.\n\n    In 2013, Pu et al. proposed a tertiary prevention strategy for hearing disabilities of birth defects based on genetic screening and diagnosis: First, via drug-induced deafness susceptibility screening, fertility guidance for deaf couples, early-pregnancy general screening, pre-love guidance for young deaf people to achieve primary prevention; second, through prenatal diagnosis and intervention to achieve the secondary prevention; third, through neonatal gene screening to achieve tertiary prevention. At present, the joint screening of neonatal hearing and deafness genes is being widely promoted in China and has produced certain findings. A number of studies have shown that hearing combined with deafness gene screening is an effective means for early detection of late-onset hereditary hearing loss and drug-sensitive individuals. It provides opportunities for early treatment and lingual rehabilitation for children, with important clinical significance.\n\n    In this study, 60,391 women of childbearing age were screened for common deafness genes. With the actual detection rate of spouses being 52.3%, 99 high-risk families were finally identified. After genetic counseling, 7 families opted for preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and 51 families for prenatal diagnosis. The findings of prenatal diagnosis showed that 14 fetuses were most likely to have hearing loss, and the diagnosis rate was 27.5% (14/51). It can be seen that carrying out common deafness genetic screening among women of childbearing age and providing follow-up services such as genetic counseling for high-risk families is essential for reducing birth of children with hearing disabilities.\n\n    In our practice of screening common deafness genes in women of childbearing age in this region, we have summarized the following experiences:\n\n    Common deafness gene screening is highly accepted among women of childbearing age in this region. On average, more than 90% of pre-pregnancy/early-pregnancy women are voluntarily tested each year. In addition to publicity and education, government departments also played an important role in including the testing project in people's livelihood to implement free testing. It can be seen that the government departments provide strong support for preventing and controlling birth defects in terms of policies and funds, which effectively promotes the prevention and control of birth defects in the region.\n\n    The rate of further testing for the spouses of female carriers is low, 52.3%, which is far lower than that of females, especially in SLC26A4 sequencing, only 37.6% (600/1594). After analysis, the first reason is that most families believe that the hearing of both parents is normal, with no family history of hearing disabilities, and that the probability that both couples carry the same type of deaf gene variant is very low. Second, the cost for spouses to receive corresponding gene sequencing is relatively high and needs to be borne by themselves. If these families were highly compliant with our recommendation at that time, through genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis, we could at least predict the hearing status of the offspring in 47.6% (10/21) of families and provide them with the opportunity to choose. Therefore, how to improve the general people's correct understanding of hereditary deafness is a problem that we urgently need to solve.\n\n    Be cautious about genetic counseling of controversial pathogenic variants. The detection rate of the GJB2 c.109G>A variant is relatively high in both normal people and patients with hearing disabilities. Existing research statistics show that c.109G>A is a pathogenic variant, but the hearing phenotypes caused by it are quite different: hearing can be normal or weakened, and the degree of hearing loss can range from mild to severe. This study finally determined that in families where both couples carry known pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene, 38 husbands are carriers of c.109G>A. With full knowledge, 6 families chose prenatal diagnosis, and finally 2 families had fetuses with the c.109G>A compound heterozygous variant (1 case was the c.109G>A/c.299_300delAT compound heterozygous variant; 1 case was the c.235delC/c.109G>A compound heterozygous variant). We followed up the hearing of their offspring, and both families indicated that their offspring had passed the newborn hearing screening. Because the later clinical manifestations of this group of people are unpredictable, we recommend that the two families undergo regular hearing monitoring to accurately assess their hearing level.\n\n    Although hearing impairment is not a serious disability or mortal disease, it will seriously affect the quality of life and inflict a heavy economic and psychological burden on families. In this study, prenatal diagnosis was applied to predict that 14 fetuses were likely to have hearing loss. We learned from follow-up that 12 of them chose to terminate the pregnancy and suggested that these families should give priority to preimplantation genetics if they have reproductive needs, with diagnosis to prevent the occurrence of hereditary deafness. Therefore, with continuously advancing society and generally improved awareness, realizing primary prevention of birth defects of hearing disabilities, that is, to carry out genetic screening for hereditary deafness before pregnancy or even before marriage, and actively adopt corresponding intervention measures, will more effectively avoid various economic and social ethical issues.\n\n    In conclusion, screening for common deafness genes in women of childbearing age and providing follow-up consultation and diagnosis are effective means to prevent birth deafness. Such a screening mode is available to achieve early diagnosis and intervention of hereditary deafness, providing families with an opportunity to make informed choices. It can also warn those carrying drug-sensitive deafness genes to avoid using ototoxic drugs in case of hearing loss. But it is still necessary to further promote the publicity and education of deafness gene screening, popularizing the related knowledge of hereditary deafness, especially to strengthen genetic counseling for high-risk families, so that they have a clearer understanding of hereditary deafness, are more willing to receive deafness gene testing, and further understand the importance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis to prevent hereditary deafness. Additionally, the government's strong support for preventing and controlling birth defects will also encourage more people to receive testing to a certain extent.",

        "Title": "    Variant spectrum of F8 and F9 in hemophilia patients from southern China and 26 novel variants",
        "Abstract": "    Hemophilia, an X-linked recessive disorder, is characterized by spontaneous or trauma-induced prolonged bleeding. It is classified as hemophilia A when caused by variants in the F8 gene, and hemophilia B when caused by F9 variants. Few studies have described hemophilia variants in the Chinese population. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic profiles of 193 hemophilia patients from southern China. Utilizing Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, gap detection, long-range PCR, and multiplex PCR, we identified both F8 and F9 gene variants. Pregnant women with a history of hemophilia A offspring underwent amniocentesis or villus sampling for the variant detection. Variants in F8 and F9 were pinpointed in 183 patients, with 26 being novel discoveries. Notably, genetic testing was absent in the initial evaluation of 133 out of 161 patients, leading to a protracted average definitive diagnosis timeline of 2 years. Remarkably, two hemophilia A cases with anticipated severe phenotypes due to protein-truncating variants presented with only moderate or mild clinical manifestations. Among the 40 fetuses tested, 34 were males, with 17 exhibiting hemizygous variants in the F8 gene. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of F8 and F9 variant spectrum and highlight the underuse of genetic analyses in southern China.",
        "Introduction": "    Hemophilia is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by spontaneous or prolonged bleeding from various tissues and organs. Common bleeding sites include the joints, nose, and brain. Hemophilia can be classified as either hemophilia A (HA) (OMIM: 306700), caused by variants of F8 (Gene ID: 2157), or hemophilia B (HB) (OMIM: 306900), caused by variants of F9 (Gene ID: 2158). The pathogenic variants of F8 and F9 may result in the deficiency of two crucial components of the clotting cascade: coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX), respectively. Distinguishing between HA and HB based on clinical features alone is challenging, despite the accepted notion that HB is less severe than HA. HA and HB can be diagnosed by measuring plasma factor VIII clotting activity (FVIII:C) and factor IX clotting activity (FIX:C) respectively, along with normal and functional von Willebrand factor levels. Depending on FVIII:C and FIX:C levels, hemophilia can be classified as severe (<1%), moderate (1%-5%), or mild (>5-40%). It is important to note that HB may be misdiagnosed in infants under 6 months of age because of their naturally low FIX:C levels. Genetic analysis plays a crucial role in confirming the diagnoses of HA and HB by enabling the identification of hemizygous pathogenic F8 and F9 variants in males respectively. Heterozygous women may also be affected by hemophilia due to skewing inactivation of the X chromosome. A rare condition is observed in women harboring compound heterozygous or homozygous pathogenic variants. Hemophilia treatment typically involves the intravenous infusion of FVIII or FIX concentrate. However, a significant replacement therapy complication is the development of inhibitory antibodies against the therapeutic exogenous factor. Approximately 25%-30% of patients with severe HA and 5%-10% of patients with severe HB develop such inhibitors, with variations influenced by ethnicity and variant type. The likelihood of inhibitor formation is notably higher in patients with large deletions, nonsense variants, small deletions and insertions (indels), and splice site variants. For both HA and HB patients, the formation of inhibitors is predominantly associated with disruptive structural variants such as large deletions. Conversely, missense variants exhibit a lower incidence of inhibitor development. It is worth noting that the nonsense variants occurring in the B domain of F8 are associated with the lower inhibitor because the premature stop codon caused by nonsense variants in the B domain may undergo translational readthrough, resulting in the maintenance of the A3-C2 domain. The existence of the A3-C2 domain has been shown to lessen the immunogenicity of therapeutic FVIII and then decrease the formation of inhibitors. Prenatal testing is crucial for the mothers of affected patients in order to prevent the recurrence of variants in subsequent pregnancies. To date, numerous F8 and F9 variants have been reported in different populations, including Chinese cohorts (https://dbs.eahad.org/). This study aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic features of hemophilia in southern China by recruiting patients with HA and HB and conducting clinical as well as genetic analyses. Our findings are expected to broaden the variant spectrum of F8 and F9, providing valuable data for the management of patients with hemophilia and prenatal diagnosis in affected families.",
        "Methods": "    Between May 2013 and November 2022, a total of 296 participants from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center were recruited for this study. The participants included 161 unrelated patients clinically diagnosed with HA, along with 99 available mothers, as well as 32 unrelated patients clinically diagnosed with HB, along with four available mothers. All participants were of Han Chinese ethnicity from southern China. A genetic analysis was conducted on all 193 patients. When variants were identified, we performed genetic analysis on mothers to determine their origin. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians, following the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    Laboratory examinations included the measurement of FVIII:C, FIX:C, and inhibitor levels. Peripheral blood samples were collected from the patients in 3.8% citrate tubes, followed by centrifugation at 2500 g for 15 min to obtain platelet-poor plasma. Commercial FVIII- and FIX-deficient plasma (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) were used to measure FVIII:C and FIX:C levels via standard one-stage clotting assay, which is based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test. The reagents for FVIII:C and FIX:C testing, are from Diagnostica Stago (Asnieres-sur-Seine, France) and include FVIII or FIX-deficient plasma, calibration plasma, APTT activator reagent (Triniclot aPTT S), calcium, quality control plasma, and dilution buffer. All reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. The coagulometer used for the detection is the STA-R Evolution analyzer (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-sur-Seine, France). The FVIII:C or FIX:C is provided by comparing the measured APTT of the test plasma with those measured in the standard reference plasma, and is expressed as % of normal. The Bethesda assay was used to determine the inhibitor titers, it is a method used to evaluate the capacity of test plasma to inactivate the FVIII or FIX. The test plasma is mixed with an equal volume of a normal plasma pool, the FVIII:C or FIX:C of the mixture is measured and then compared with that of the control plasma. The percentage of residual FVIII:C or FIX:C is calculated, and one Bethesda unit (BU) is defined as the amount of inhibitor that results in 50% residual FVIII:C or FIX:C. The BU/mL in the sample is determined from the theoretical inhibitor graph by interpolating the percentage residual activity against Bethesda units.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of participants using a QIAamp Blood DNA Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to genetic analysis. A long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the intron 22 (IVS 22) inversion in F8 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Yaneng Bioscience, Shenzhen, China). Multiplex PCR was used to detect the intron 1 (IVS 1) inversion in F8. Primers were designed using Oligo6.0 (http://www.oligo.net/downloads.html) in order to amplify all exons and exon-intron boundaries of F8 and F9 via PCR. The PCR products were then sequenced on an ABI 3730XL Automated DNA Sequencer using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The GenBank sequences NM_000132.3 for F8 and NM_000133.3 for F9 were retrieved from the UCSC database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) and were used for comparison of our sequencing results for variant detection. The reference sequences for the encoded proteins of F8 and F9 were NP_000123.1 and NP_000124.1 respectively. Variant nomenclature was adopted, with +1 corresponding to A of the AUG translation initiation codon, according to the Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature. When PCR failed for certain exon(s), Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) was used to detect large deletions of F8 and F9, according to the manufacturer's instructions for the SALSA MLPA probemix P178-B2 F8 and P207-D1 F9 respectively (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Since IVS 22 inversion accounts for approximately 40%-50% of severe HA cases, detection of IVS 22 inversion should be the top priority in patients with severe HA. Sequencing for F8 and detection of IVS 1 inversion were performed sequentially due to the minimum proportion of IVS 1 inversion (1%-5%). Forty pregnant women underwent amniocentesis or villus sampling, and quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction was used to rule out maternal cell contamination. All 40 fetuses were genetically tested for causative variants, regardless of the sex of the fetuses.\n\n    The variants were interpreted in accordance with the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). The framework classifies variants as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variant of uncertain significance (VUS), benign (B), and likely benign (LB). The criteria for classification are based on a level of strength: stand-alone (A), very strong (VS), strong (S), moderate (M), or supporting (PP). Twenty-six criteria can be applied, including 15 pathogenic criteria: 1 very strong (PVS1), 4 strong (PS1-4), 6 moderate (PM1-6), 4 supporting (PP1-4), and 11 benign criteria: 1 stand-alone (BA1), 4 strong (BS1-4), and 6 supporting (BP1-7 except BP6). The applied criteria are then combined to reach a classification according to the scoring rules in the ACMG/AMP recommendations. The criteria used in this study are described below. PVS1 is applicable when a variant is predicted to result in nonsense medicated decay (NMD). Automatic PVS1 interpretation (AutoPVS1) (https://autopvs1.bgi.com/) was used to predict whether PVS1 is applicable or should be used as reduced strength for the nonsense, frameshifts, +-1 or 2 canonical splice sites, and initiation codons variants. For single or multi-exon deletions that cannot be predicted by AutoPVS1, NMD prediction is based on the premature termination codon not occurring in the 3' most exon or the 50 bp in the 3' most penultimate exon. PS4 is applicable when the prevalence of a variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls. For the rare variants of F8 and F9 that do not provide sufficient power to reach statistical significance due to small sample sizes, a modified strength of PS4 is most applicable. The thresholds for \"PS4_Supporting\", \"PS4_Moderate\", \"PS4\", and \"PS4_Very Strong\" have been specified as 1, 2, 4, and 16, respectively, for previously reported cases. We searched the Human Gene Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.org/) and two European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) Coagulation Factor Variant Databases: Factor VIII Gene (F8) Variant Database (https://f8-db.eahad.org/) and Factor IX Gene (F9) Variant Database (https://f9-db.eahad.org/index.php) to determine whether the variants had been reported. When a missense variant is located in a mutational hot spot and/or a critical and well-established functional domain without benign variation, PM1 is applicable. For the missense variants of F8 located in the B domain, PM1 is not applicable as the B domain is partially spliced off the mature protein. The domain data were obtained from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/). If a variant is absent from a large general population, this observation can be considered a moderate piece of evidence for pathogenicity (PM2). The weight of PM2 criteria should be decreased to supporting according to the Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group, as the absence or rarity is given too much weight after substantial analysis and modeling (ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Recommendation for PM2-Version 1.0). We searched the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (http://gnomad-sg.org/) to determine whether the variant is absent from the general population. For the missense variants, we used Rare Exome Variant Ensembl Learner (REVEL) (https://sites.google.com/site/revelgenomics/) to predict the possible effects. The thresholds for the levels of evidence for pathogenicity (PP3) were: >=0.932 for strong, [0.733, 0.932) for moderate, and [0.644, 0.733) for supporting, and for benign, they were: <=0.003 for BP4-very strong, (0.003, 0.016] for BP4-strong, (0.016, 0.183] for BP4-moderate, and (0.183, 0.290] for BP4. To avoid overinterpretation of variants, a moderate strength of PP3 was applied even when the scores were >=0.932. For the noncanonical splice site variant, SpliceAI (https://github.com/Illumina/SpliceAI) was used to predict the splicing effect. PP3 can be applied when the SpliceAI scores are >0.2, and BP7 can be applied when the SpliceAI scores are <0.01. PP4 is applicable when patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology, and PP4 is applied in this study when the FVIII:C or FIX:C is below 40%.",
        "Results": "    Of the 161 unrelated patients clinically diagnosed with HA, 117 were classified as having severe, 16 as having moderate, 19 as having mild, and nine as having disease of unknown severity owing to FVIII:C data not being available (Table 1). Of the 32 unrelated patients diagnosed with HB, 20 had severe, seven had moderate, four had mild disease, and one had disease of unknown severity (Table 1). Finally, 153 HA and 30 HB patients were confirmed via genetic testing. Among these, the mean age of disease onset was 1.7 years (ranging from 1 day to 15 years) for HA and 3.4 years (ranging from 5 days to 11.3 years) for HB, with median values of 9 months and 1.4 years, respectively (Table 2). The diagnosis of hemophilia was typically established at a mean age of 4.3 years (ranging from 14 days to 23 years) for HA and 5.1 years (ranging from 19 days to 12 years) for HB (Table 2). The mean time to a definitive diagnosis was 2.1 years for HA and 1.6 years for HB (Table 2). Notably, genetic testing was offered to only 18% of the HA patients (24/132) and 14% of the HB patients (4/29) during their initial hospital visit, reflecting a lack of awareness regarding F8 and F9 genetic analysis in many parts of southern China. Most patients underwent genetic testing only after being referred to our institute, the major referral center for pediatric patients in the region. The lack of awareness regarding genetic analyses leads to low rates of genetic testing during initial hospital visits for patients with HA and HB. This may result in a delayed diagnosis and inadequate genetic counseling.\n\n    Among the 117 patients with HA who underwent inhibitor testing, 14 (11.9%) developed inhibitors, with only one being mildly affected (Table 1). The incidence of inhibitor development varies across regions, with the highest incidence reported in the American population (30%) and the lowest being in East Asia (11%). The incidence rate in this cohort was similar to that of the overall population in East Asia but higher than that in two other Chinese cohorts. In this cohort, the highest incidence of inhibitors was observed in patients with canonical splice site variants (50%, 1/2), although the limited number of patients may have introduced bias. The incidence rates for other variant types were as follows: gross deletion (33.3%, 2/6), nonsense (21%, 4/19), indel (14.2%, 3/21), and IVS 22 inversion (11.8%, 4/34). These rates were generally consistent with prior findings. A comparable rate of inhibitor development was exhibited among patients with nonsense variants within the B domain (20%, 1/5) and the non-B domain (21%, 3/14). This is different from earlier reports that patients with nonsense variants in the B domain had a lower rate of developing inhibitors than those with non-B domain variants. This may be due to the bias introduced by the limited number of patients. None of the patients with IVS 1 inversion or missense variants developed inhibitors. Further, only two patients with HB harboring gross deletions and nonsense variants (8%, 2/25) developed inhibitors (Table 1).\n\n    Variants in the F8 gene were identified in 153 of the 161 patients with HA, resulting in a variant detection rate of 95% (Table 1). In addition to IVS 22 inversion and IVS 1 inversion, a total of 83 distinct variants were identified, including five large deletions (6%, 5/83), 22 indels (26.5%, 22/83), 36 missense variants (43.4%, 36/83), 18 nonsense variants (21.7%, 18/83), and two canonical splice site variants (2.4%, 2/83) (Table 1). Among these variants, 20 had not been previously reported (Table 1).\n\n    Analysis of the 99 available mothers revealed that 94 of the 99 variants (95%) were inherited (Table 1), indicating a higher carrier rate than reported for another Chinese cohort (79%). The high rate of inherited variants highlights the increased likelihood of variant recurrence in families with HA in southern China. Therefore, it is crucial for mothers and other female family members to undergo genetic testing before planning a pregnancy. The remaining five cases involved de novo variants, including four IVS 22 inversion variants and one small deletion (Table 1). In cases of de novo variants, prenatal diagnosis must be performed during subsequent pregnancies to determine whether the variants are germline mosaicism rather than de novo, as previously reported.\n\n    No detectable variants were noted in eight patients (5%, 8/161), including two severe, one moderate, and five mild cases. However, this does not rule out the diagnosis of HA. It is possible that the variants are located deep within introns or regulatory regions or that unknown causal genes may be involved, resulting in decreased FVIII:C levels. Further investigation of these patients is ongoing.\n\n    A prenatal diagnosis was performed for 40 pregnant women with a family history of F8 variants. Hemizygotes were identified in 42.5% (17/40) of the cases (Table 3). Following genetic counseling, decisions were made regarding pregnancy termination for the affected fetuses. Interestingly, 85% (34/40) of the fetuses were males, yielding a sex ratio of 0.85 (male fetus numbers/total fetus numbers), a deviation from reported sex ratio of 0.502 of all embryos from conception to birth.\n\n    A total of 52 patients (32.2% of all patients and 41.9% of severe patients) had an IVS 22 inversion (Table 1). IVS-1 inversion was found in only four patients, accounting for 2.5% (4/161) of all patients and 2.6% (3/117) of patients with severe disease. These results are comparable to those reported in other populations. Nearly all patients with IVS 22 inversion were classified as severe, except for four cases (HA1-4) (Table 4). Three patients (HA1-3) carried IVS 22 inversion, and one patient carried IVS 1 inversion. In this study, HA1 was a seven-year-old boy who was diagnosed with HA at the age of 2 years, with an FVIII:C level of 10%. After diagnosis, he received two cryoprecipitate injections for treatment. HA2 was a three-year-old boy whose guardian requested genetic testing after being diagnosed with HA, with an FVIII:C level of 6.6% following cerebral infection and bleeding at 2 months of age. FVIII injections were not administered to this patient. HA3 presented with cutaneous ecchymosis at 6 months of age, and FVIII:C testing revealed a level of 2.6%. No further spontaneous bleeding episodes were observed, and treatment was provided only for the injuries. Hospitalization was required because of a sudden oral hemorrhage, and further testing confirmed the presence of inhibitors. HA4, a patient with an IVS 1 inversion, was a 17-year-old boy. His FVIII:C level was 8% at 1 year of age. He occasionally developed petechiae after the trauma, and at present, his knee joint is severely swollen, preventing him from walking. It is generally believed that the presence of IVS 22 inversion and IVS 1 inversion in patients with moderate or mild HA is either due to residual FVIII clotting activity from prior transfusions or inaccurate test methods. In these four patients, FVIII:C testing was conducted before exogenous FVIII therapy. Unfortunately, retesting the patient's peripheral blood using another method was not possible. In addition to the inaccurate measurement of FVIII:C, one possibility is that patients with mild or moderate disease carrying IVS 22 inversion and IVS 1 inversion harbor undetected variants, such as complex rearrangements associated with IVS 22 inversion and IVS 1 inversion, which preserve the F8 reading frame. However, further investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis.\n\n    Forty protein-truncating variants, including 22 indels and 18 nonsense variants, were identified in 49 patients (Table 1). Long poly-A and poly-T runs (at least 6 consecutive adenines or thymine) are hotspots for indels due to slipped mispairing or intragenic recombination, which are mechanisms responsible for indel formation. In this study, four indels recurred at positions c.3637, c.4379, and c.4825 in three, three, and two patients, respectively, all the indels are within the poly-A runs. Approximately 50% of the nonsense variants (7/18) occurred at arginine codons (Table 5). These seven nonsense variants involved a change from the CGA for arginine to the TGA, a premature termination codon, which is consistent with earlier reports that arginine is a hotspot for nonsense variants.. It is commonly believed that patients with protein-truncating variants predicted to produce new stop codons develop severe diseases. However, the two patients (HA 5-6) with such variants in this study were only moderately affected. HA5, who harbored a c.6496C>T (p.Arg2166*) variant, was a one-year-old boy who underwent FVIII:C testing after experiencing bruising and swelling around the eye following a fall. The test revealed an FVIII:C level of 1.2%. Interestingly, another patient with HA and the same c.6496C>T (p.Arg2166*) variant was severely affected (Table 4). This difference highlights the phenotypic variability associated with F8 variants. The mother of HA6 was referred to our clinic for prenatal diagnosis, and her affected son had an FVIII:C level of 2%. Unfortunately, these two patients were not available for follow-up. Although the two variants are expected to result in a null phenotype, functional assays are required to confirm their effects, as some protein-truncating variants may display trace or residual expression and/or functional levels. Similarly, patients with certain protein-truncating variants are moderately or mildly affected.\n\n    Two canonical splice site variants were identified in this cohort, accounting for 1.3% of all patients and 1.7% of the cases classified as severe (Table 1). Canonical splice site variants were the least represented variant type in this study, which may partially result from the limited number of cases.\n\n    Our analysis identified 36 distinct missense variants across the F8 gene in 40 patients, with an exception for exons 1, 6, 8, 18, 20, and 24. We found a c.394G>A (p.Glu132Lys) variant along with the exon 1 deletion in one patient; this variant, located in the A1 domain, is absent from the gnomAD database and previously unreported in HA patients (https://f8-db.eahad.org/). The variant c.2535C>A (p.Asp845Glu) was discovered alongside the known variant c.871G>A (p.Glu291Lys) in one patient. This variant has been implicated in HA patients, and in vitro analyses for this variant did not demonstrate a significant reduction or revealed only a mild decrease in FVIII:C. Notably, this variant is located in exon 14, the region coding for the B domain of FVIII. The B domain is partially spliced off the mature protein and lacks procoagulant activity; it is responsible for FVIII processing and trafficking via its N-linked oligosaccharides. It is well known that variants of the B domain are unlikely to cause severe HA and rarely cause mild HA. One explanation could be that the observed variant(s) in the B domain may have a minor impact on FVIII intracellular processing. Regardless of the two likely benign variants, c.394G>A (p.Glu132Lys) and c.2535C>A (p.Asp845Glu), all the missense variants in this study were located outside the B domain.\n\n    MLPA identified five large deletions within the F8 gene among six patients, with two deletions extending over multiple exons:specifically from exon 5 to 6 and exon 15 to 26. To identify the breaking point of the gross deletion of exon 26, multiple primers were designed around exon 26 to amplify the sequences, and an approximately 1 kb PCR product was amplified with the primers (forward: TGTAATTCAGTTAGTCACAGGAT, reverse: TAAAACAACCTATTCACTACCAC). Sequencing of the PCR product indicated the breakpoint at positions chrX:154083181 upstream and chrX:154053438 downstream of exon 26, resulting in a 29,742 bp deletion. The same deletion was confirmed in the proband's mother, suggesting hereditary transmission. While these exon deletions have been previously reported, this is the first report to delineate the breakpoint for the exon 26 deletion.\n\n    In the F9 gene, 24 unique variants were observed in 30 of 32 male patients with FIX:C levels <40%. These included 16 missense variants, two nonsense variants, one small deletion, two gross deletions, one canonical splice site variant and two noncanonical splice site variants (Table 1). Missense variants were the most prominent variant type in all severities and were distributed across all exons, except exon 1 and 3. The majority of missense variants (9/16) occurred in exons 7 and 8 (Table 6), which encode the serine protease (SP) domain. The c.571C>T (p.Arg191Cys) variant recurred in four patients (4/30) (Table 6), which is consistent with the high frequency described in a previous report, and more than 100 HB patients with variants at p. Arg191 have been reported; there are two variants at p. Arg43 (c.127C>T (p.Arg43Trp) and c.128G>A (p.Arg43Gln)) (Table 6) in this study, but more than 100 HB patients with variants at p. Arg43 have been reported in the EAHAD F9 databases. The prevalent variants observed at positions p. Arg43 and p. Arg191 suggest mutational hotspots, possibly resulting from the inherently mutagenic nature of CpG dinucleotides at these positions. All the nonsense variants, small deletion, gross deletions and canonical splice site variant were predicted to cause protein truncation. The two noncanonical splice site variants were predicted to affect the splicing of the exon in F9. No F9 variants were identified in the two patients with FIX:C levels below 40%, which could be due to naturally low FIX:C levels in these patients, as they were under the age of 6 months.\n\n    Twenty novel variants were identified among the 83 F8 variants detected. These included 11 indels, five missense variants, and four nonsense variants (Table 1), representing a novel variant detection rate of 24%. The low yield of novel variants likely reflects the extensive genetic testing for this disease, particularly in the era of whole-exome sequencing. It remains to be seen which fraction of variants in Chinese patients may be genuinely distinct from those in other ethnic groups. None of the novel variants had been cataloged in the gnomAD and F8 EAHAD databases. Except for c.394G>A (p.Glu132Lys), the other four missense variants, c.976C>G (p.Leu326Val), c.1891A>T (p.Asn631Tyr), c.2099C>G (p.Ser700Trp), and c.6361A>T (p.Ile2121Phe), occurred at conserved sites relative to those in other species (data not shown), affecting the A1, A2, and C1 domains. The remaining 15 novel indel and nonsense variants were predicted introduce premature stop codons and result in C-terminal truncation of the protein (Table 5).\n\n    In the F9 gene, six novel variants were identified among the 24 F9 variants detected, including three missense variants, one noncanonical splice site variant, one small deletion, and one large deletion (Table 1). None of these variants were recorded in the gnomAD and F9 EAHAD databases. Missense variants c.754T>A (p.Cys252Ser), c.992T>A (p.Val331Asp), and c.1115T>A (p.Leu372His) were clustered in the SP domain, and the mutant amino acids were also conserved among species. The variant c.754T>A (p.Cys252Ser) has a novel nucleotide change, but a variant c.755G>C (p.Cys252Ser) with the identical amino acid alteration has been reported in the EAHAD F9 database. Only one novel small deletion, c.252del (p.Thr85Leufs*19), was detected. It resulted in a premature stop codon, causing a truncation of 357 amino acids at the C-terminus of the coding protein. In addition, we identified a deletion in exons 6 and 7 via MLPA. The noncanonical splice site variant c.253-6T>G was the only novel variant of uncertain significance (Table 6).",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, this analysis expands the variant spectrum of F8 and F9 in the southern Chinese population, identifying 26 novel variants and providing insights into the clinical features and prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia. This study contributes to our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease in this population and emphasizes that the effects of F8/F9 variants on FVIII/FIX protein levels and function should be thoroughly analyzed.",

        "Title": "    Novel compound heterozygous mutations in SCN4A as a potential genetic cause contributing to myopathic manifestations: A case report and literature review",
        "Abstract": "    SCN4A mutations account for a diverse array of clinical manifestations, encompassing periodic paralysis, myotonia, and newly recognized symptoms like classical congenital myopathy or congenital myasthenic syndromes. We describe the initial occurrence of myopathic features mimic with recessive classical CM in a Korean infant presenting with novel compound heterozygous SCN4A mutations. The infant exhibited profound hypotonia after birth, thereby expanding the spectrum of SCN4A-related channelopathy.\n\n    The genetic analyses comprised targeted exome sequencing, employing a Celemics G-Mendeliome DES Panel, along with Sanger sequencing.\n\n    Considering the clinical manifestations observed in the proband, SCN4A variants emerged as the primary contenders for autosomal recessive (AR) congenital myopathy 22a, classic (#620351). Sanger sequencing validated the association of SCN4A variants with the phenotype, affirming the AR nature of the compound heterozygous variants in both the carrier mother (c.3533G > T/p.Gly1178Val) and the father (c.4216G > A/p.Ala1406Thr).\n\n    Our report emphasizes the association of novel compound heterozygous mutations in SCN4A with myopathic features resembling CM, as supporting by muscle biopsy. It is essential to note that pathogenic SCN4A LoF mutations are exceedingly rare.

        "Introduction": "    The SCN4A gene, which codes for the alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.4), is situated on chromosome 17q23-25. NaV1.4 assumes a crucial role in muscle-related disorders by governing the initiation and transmission of action potentials. The voltage-gated sodium channel consists of a solitary pore-forming alpha subunit and two separate beta subunits. The alpha subunit, a singular polypeptide chain, undergoes folding into four homologous yet non-identical repeats (repeats I to IV). Each repeat encompasses six transmembrane segments (S1 to S6), S1 to S4 constitute the voltage-sensing domain, while S5-6 form the pore domain. The positively charged S4 segments function as voltage sensors, regulating the opening and closing of the pore. Upon insertion into the membrane, these four repeats create a central pore with segments five and six lining its walls, while S4 serves as the channel's voltage sensor owing to its positively charged amino acids. The loop (P loop) between S5 and S6 in the extracellular domain determines ion selectivity. NaV1.4 rapidly activates (<1 msec) in response to depolarization, allowing a substantial inward Na + current (~5 mA/cm2), leading to the immediate generation of action potentials (~500 mV/msec). Rapid inactivation shortly after the action potential's generation prevents repetitive discharges, ensuring normal skeletal muscle contraction and maintaining the physiological excitability of the sarcolemma.\n\n    Mutations in the SCN4A gene exert a significant influence on skeletal muscle excitability, impacting the inactivation or activation of muscle ion channels. These mutations give rise to a diverse range of clinical manifestations, ranging from periodic paralysis (PP) to myotonia. Recently, they have been linked to classical congenital myopathy (CM, #620351), severe fetal hypokinesia, congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS, #614198), exercise intolerance, myalgia, sudden infant death syndrome, and severe neonatal episodic laryngospasms. Mutations in SCN4A can disrupt muscle hyper-excitability by altering channel kinetics or functions. However, discerning the specific contributions of fast and slow inactivation to the phenotype can be challenging. The influence of abnormal slow inactivation has been noted in non-dystrophic myotonia and periodic paralysis (PP). The gradual activation of NaV1.4 assumes a crucial role in regulating muscle contraction, particularly in fast-twitch muscles characterized by elevated levels of muscle firing. Gain-of-function (GoF) SCN4A mutations elevate the levels of inward Na + current, resulting in conditions such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (hyperPP, OMIM #170500), hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP, #613345), myotonia congenita (MC, #608390), and paramyotonia congenita (PMC, #168300) with autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance. Conversely, loss-of-function (LoF) SCN4A mutations are less common and are linked to autosomal recessive (AR) diseases. These mutations contribute to congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), which are characterized by muscle weakness stemming from impaired transmission of electrical signals at the neuromuscular junction, or hypoPP with AD inheritance. Recently, classical CM has been reported in pediatric patients from various ethnic backgrounds, harboring either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of SCN4A with AR inheritance.\n\n    To date, various small genetic studies and case series have been conducted on Korean patients diagnosed with hypoPP, hyperPP, MC, or PMC, all attributed to mono-allelic SCN4A mutations. In this report, we describe the initial occurrence of myopathic features mimic with recessive classical CM in a Korean infant presenting with novel compound heterozygous SCN4A mutations. The infant exhibited profound hypotonia after birth, thereby expanding the spectrum of SCN4A-related channelopathy.",

        "Discussion": "    CM represent a rare and genetically diverse category of neuromuscular disorders, with an estimated prevalence as indicated by meta-analysis studies, ranging from 0.52 to 50.1 per 100,000 in the pediatric population. These conditions typically manifest with symptoms emerging in the neonatal period. Among these cases, 60%-80% are linked to central nervous system (CNS) involvement, while 12%-34% have a peripheral etiology. Among patients who remain undiagnosed, 82% exhibit symptoms suggestive of muscle diseases. Notably, the onset of symptoms occurs in the neonatal period, affecting approximately 14% of patients with neonatal hypotonia. Muscle weakness in CM patients is typically characterized as static or slowly progressive, often with normal CK levels. In these conditions, the CNS remains unaffected. Although severe hypotonia may be present in early infancy, it generally stabilizes over time or shows improvement with age. Traditionally, neuromuscular diseases were classified based on histopathological features. However, with the identification of causative genes, the classification has evolved to emphasize the involvement of specific genes. Disease-causing genes have been identified in 50%-75% of CM cases, encompassing over 40 associated genes, including ACTA1, DNM2, MTM1, NEB, RYR1, and SEPN1.\n\n    Nav1.4 is the pore-forming subunit of the main sodium channel present in skeletal muscles and related channelopathies that affect skeletal muscle excitability are associated with muscular dysfunctions. In this case, compound heterozygous SCN4A variants can cause abnormal Nav1.4 activity and result in myophatic features including hypotonia, muscle weakness and myopathic morphologies. Both SCN4A variants are suspected to be like pathogenic according to in-silico prediction, analysis of the SCN4A structures, and conservation scores. Efforts to discern various entities within SCN4A-related skeletal muscle channelopathies have focused on pathophysiological analysis, clinical manifestations, and genetic findings. However, similar mutations can lead to comparable effects on membrane hypo- or hyperactivity, and a definitive distinction between GoF and LoF based on SCN4A variants is not fully established. Over the past decade, cellular electrophysiology studies have played a pivotal role in uncovering SCN4A mutations, particularly LoF mutations in NaV1.4, which have been causally linked to muscle weakness in conditions such as hypoPP, CMS, and CM (Fig. 3). Among familial hypoPP cases, missense mutations in SCN4A are more prevalent and result in sustained membrane depolarization. Studies involving mice with bi-allelic null mutations of SCN4A have demonstrated that NaV1.5 does not compensate for NaV1.4 in skeletal muscle at birth, underscoring the critical role of NaV1.4. Utilizing a knockout mouse model, it was shown that an acute reduction in Na + current was necessary to induce myasthenia. The recessively inherited myasthenia or CM conditions suggest a gene-dosage effect and are associated with mutant alleles exhibiting partial LoF or null mutations.\n\n    In 2015, SCN4A was initially associated with an AR inheritance pattern and CMS. Subsequently, several cases of CMS or CM associated with LoF variants were reported. A total of 18 variants, including missense, splicing, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, were identified in 12 probands from 12 families across six studies. These variants segregated with CM or CMS in an additional 14 family members (Table 1). Many patients with these conditions exhibited decreased fetal movements and maternal polyhydramnios. After birth, they presented with a spectrum of muscle weakness, ranging from mild generalized hypotonia to severe weakness that posed survival challenges. Similar to CM, most patients, including our case, showed improvements in motor function over time, with a resolution of respiratory and feeding difficulties. In our case, the variant p.3533.G > T (p.G1178V) is a novel variant, although there are reports that a mutation (c.3539A > T, p.N1180I) in a similar locus has caused myotonia or myopathy. Cross-species comparisons of SCN4A protein sequences indicated high conservation of these mutated regions in vertebrates. Glycine 1178 is conserved across all human voltage-gated sodium channel genes (NaV1.1-NaV1.9), while Alanine 1406 is consistently conserved as either Alanine or Serine across all human Nav channels (Fig. 4). In patients with CMS, a homozygous mutation (c.4252A, p.I1418V) of SCN4A was confirmed, and this locus is near our variant (c.4216G > A, p.Ala1406Thr). These findings provide additional support for the pathogenicity of the proband's variants. Mutations in the SYNE1 gene in the proband can give rise to a range of conditions, including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (AD inheritance), Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AR inheritance), or Spinocerebellar ataxia (AR inheritance). Interestingly, each mutation has been inherited from asymptomatic parents, and clinical manifestations do not appear to be correlated across these different conditions.\n\n    The genotype-phenotype correlations in SCN4A-related myotonia and periodic paralyses remain unclear, as the clinical phenotype in Korean patients carrying SCN4A mutations did not seem to be affected by the mutation's location in the NaV1.4 channel (Fig. 4). LoF of the NaV1.4 channel resulted in reduced action potential and subsequent muscle contraction. In older individuals with hyperPP, some develop chronic progressive myopathy with constant weakness. Reports on AD periodic paralyses and myotonia associated with heterozygous SCN4A mutations in Korean patients have been limited in the literature, typically involving small cohorts and focusing on single clinical subgroups. This report presents the first case of a Korean patient exhibiting recessive myopathic features that mimic CM and provides an overview of molecular and clinical features in a moderate-sized cohort of Korean patients with SCN4A-related channelopathies, based on an extensive literature review. Genotype-phenotype correlations from studies on Korean patients with SCN4A mutations are summarized in Table 2. Our patient showed generalized hypotonia after birth and a clinical improvement during early infancy. EMG testing revealed normal response and muscle biopsy results suggest CM rather than CMS. Treatment with acetazolamide and salbutamol showed limited efficacy, while pyridostigmine therapy was associated with side effects when administered at suboptimal doses to patients with CM and/or CMS caused by SCN4A variants. Our patient also experienced adverse effects, such as nausea and hypersalivation, with acetazolamide. Membrane activity dysfunction has resulted in various myopathic features, and the distinction between GoF and LoF is not clearly defined. We propose that compound heterozygous SCN4A variants can give rise to myopathic features resembling CM, and a more accurate nomenclature would be 'SCN4A-related skeletal muscle channelopathy.\n\n    In conclusion, the clinical phenotype and electrophysiological studies reveal significant overlap between CM and CMS, especially in young infants. Consequently, the diagnosis of SCN4A-related skeletal muscle channelopathy may be more appropriate than attempting to classify it as either CMS or CM. Our report emphasizes the association of novel compound heterozygous mutations in SCN4A with myopathic features resembling CM, as supporting by muscle biopsy. It is essential to note that pathogenic SCN4A LoF mutations are exceedingly rare. This study contributes to our understanding of SCN4A mutations and their role in myopathic features mimic with classical CM. Nonetheless, further research is imperative to unveil the mechanisms behind CMS/CM resulting from SCN4A mutations, including genotype-phenotype correlations and underlying mechanisms, before we can consider the possibility of gene-based therapies.\n\n    This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Catholic University of Korea (Approval number: DC23ZASI0003; Date of approval: January 17, 2023).\n\n    Written informed consent was obtained from the parents on behalf of their child for the clinical and molecular analyses and for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or data included in this study.",

        "Title": "    beta-asarone suppresses HCT116 colon cancer cell proliferation and liver metastasis in part by activating the innate immune system",
        "Abstract": "    Studies have revealed that beta-asarone exerts a powerful inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human cancer cells. The authors' previous study demonstrated that beta-asarone could induce LoVo colon cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, indicating its anticancer properties. The present study aimed to determine the antineoplastic effect of beta-asarone in HCT116 colon cancer cells. An in vitro proliferation assay using a real time cell analyzer demonstrated that beta-asarone effectively decreased HCT116 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes following beta-asarone inhibition were involved in the 'cell cycle', 'cell division', 'cell proliferation' and 'apoptosis'. Subsequently, a xenograft assay evidenced the inhibitory effect of beta-asarone on the growth of HCT116 tumors in vivo. Further detection of immune-associated cytokines and cells suggested that beta-asarone might be involved in the antitumor immune response by stimulating granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and increasing the number of macrophage cells in the spleen. Additionally, a murine model of splenic-transplantation verified the strong suppressive role of beta-asarone in colon cancer liver metastasis in vivo. Taken together, the results of the current study revealed that beta-asarone decreased HCT116 colon cancer cell proliferation and liver metastasis potentially by activating the innate immune system, supporting the multi-system regulation theory and providing a basis for further mechanistic studies on colon cancer.",
        "Introduction": "    Epidemiological statistics have revealed that the morbidity and mortality of patients with colon cancer are both ranked third in the world of all cancer types. Numerous Chinese patients are diagnosed with advanced colon carcinoma due to not receiving colonoscopy and a lack of obvious early symptoms. A large number of patients initially visit their doctor due to the occurrence of blood in their stool, along with symptoms of stomach pain and a change in bowel movements. Although surgical therapy is widely performed, the 5-year relative survival rate of patients with colon cancer was 63.2%, and the overall survival rate was 52% in the Swiss population between 1996 and 2008. It is well-known that aberrant cell proliferation induces tumor initiation, with subsequent metastasis aggravating the deterioration of patients with cancer. Metastasis has been recognized as the most fatal feature of advanced malignancy, leading to 66.7% of deaths caused by solid tumors according to population-based data in Norway between 2005 and 2015.\n\n    Over the past few decades, chemotherapy has been considered one of the most effective therapies for colon cancer except for surgery. Conventionally in China, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) alone or in combination with other anticancer agents (such as irinotecan or oxaliplatin) has been frequently administered and has been shown to improve the survival rate of patients with partial colon cancer. In addition, the anticarcinogenic effect of several traditional Chinese medicines has also been emphasized in colon cancer. The authors' previous study demonstrated that modified Si-Jun-Zi Decoction (SJZ), a Chinese medicinal formula, could inhibit colon cancer liver metastasis by increasing the content of macrophage cells. A second Chinese medicine, acorus calamus, or its bioactive phytochemical beta-asarone, has been widely reported to possess antitumor and chemopreventive activities in multiple carcinomas, including lung cancer, gastric cancer and glioma. The suppressive role of beta-asarone in gastric cancer cell proliferation has also been indicated. A previous study demonstrated that beta-asarone could induce LoVo colon cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its anticancer properties in colon cancer. Furthermore, the study determined that LoVo cell proliferation was reliant on beta-asarone in a time and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, apoptosis could be induced through the mitochondrial/caspase pathway in vitro. Nude mice xenografts with LoVo cells have previously been established to demonstrate growth-suppressing and apoptosis-promoting beta-asarone activity in vivo. However, the functional role of beta-asarone on HCT116 colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo has not yet been elucidated.\n\n    The current study aimed to identify the antineoplastic effect of beta-asarone in HCT116 colon cancer cells using in vitro and in vivo experiments. Nude mice are a group of mutant mice with a T lymphocyte deficiency, but with a healthy and undamaged system of innate immunocyte, including macrophage cells, neutrophile granulocytes and natural killer cells. Therefore, the aim of the study was to focus on the effect of beta-asarone on the innate immune system and perform xenograft tumor and intrasplenic transplantation assays in nude mice. Taken together, the results of the current study further revealed the anticancer effects of beta-asarone in HCT116 colon cancer cells, supporting the possibility of its multi-system regulation, as well as providing supporting information for future beta-asarone-associated research using LoVo colon cancer cells.",
        "Methods": "    beta-asarone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck KGaA; cat. no. 221074; batch no. STBF1732V; purity, 96.7%) and dissolved in DMSO (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) for in vitro assays and edible oil solvent for in vivo assays. In particular, beta-asarone dissolved in edible oil was made into concentrations of 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight, and used for intragastric administration in nude mice. Control mice received the same volume of normal saline by intragastric administration. alpha-asarone and beta-asarone are isomerides. alpha-asarone was also used in the xenograft tumor assay and the intrasplenic implantation model to distinguish if different structures could affect the inhibitory effect of the drug.\n\n    The human colon cancer cell line, HCT116, was purchased from The Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum (both Biological Industries), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 microg/ml) in a water-saturated atmosphere at 37 C with 5% CO2. The Real-Time Cell Analyzer (RTCA; ACEA Bioscience, Inc.; Agilent) was used to determine the effect of beta-asarone on HCT116 cell proliferation according to the instruction manual. HCT-116 cells (~5,000) were seeded in each well of an e-plate (ACEA Bioscience, Inc.; Agilent) and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2. After 24 h, two-fold serial dilutions of beta-asarone ranging from 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31 micromol/l were added to the wells accompanied with blank and DMSO controls. RTCA Software 2.0 (ACEA Bioscience, Inc.; Agilent) was used to evaluate the Cell Index (CI) value, which reflected the cell proliferation profile based on impedance measurement. The CI values were normalized at the time of treatment and continuously monitored for >72 h.\n\n    We obtained the RNA transcriptome sequencing results from LC Sciences LLC , which offers a sequencing service. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified following beta-asarone treatment for 24 and 48 h were analyzed via pathway analysis [including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)] using the edge R package.  implemented in R version 4.0.1. Analysis was performed based on the Wallenius non-central hyper-geometric distribution.\n\n    In total, 88 male Balb/c nu/nu mice aged 4-6 weeks with an average weight of ~22 g were purchased from the Comparative Medicine Centre of Yangzhou University (animal certificate no. 0038475). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at 25 C with a 12 h light-dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. All experimental procedures were approved by The Animal Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (Nanjing, China; approval no. 2018 DW-01-03). Experiments were conducted after a 1-week acclimatization period. For surgical anesthesia, 120 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine were applied intraperitoneally. For euthanasia, an intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (overdose) was administered. After confirming the cessation of murine heartbeats, the tumors were collected for further analysis. The humane endpoints will come when either the maximum diameter of tumor is larger than 2.0 cm or the loss is more than 20% of the beginning body weight.\n\n    HCT116 cancer cells (2 million) were suspended with PBS and subcutaneously transplanted into the right posterior flank of every mouse of 60 nude mice, which were then randomly divided into the following four groups (n=10 mice/group): i) Negative control group; ii) beta-asarone 50 mg/kg group; iii) beta-asarone 100 mg/kg group; and iv) alpha-asarone 50 mg/kg group; v) alpha-asarone 100 mg/kg group and vi) 5-Fu 25 mg/kg group. All treatments were administered from the 3rd day after injection of HCT116 cells. Tumor growth was examined every 4 days, and tumor volumes were calculated using the following equation: Volume=0.5 x longitudinal diameter x latitudinal diameter2. At 4 weeks after treatment, mice were euthanized as aforementioned, subcutaneous tumors were imaged and tumor weights were measured.\n\n    Following euthanasia, the peripheral blood of mice was collected. Blood samples in each mouse were aliquoted for cytokine and flow cytometry analysis. Half the plasma obtained from a single mouse within the same group was used to analyze plasma cytokines using the Mouse Cytokine Array Q5 kit (cat. no. QAM-CYT-5-1; Raybiotech, Inc.) as previously described.\n\n    In addition to samples used in cytokines analysis, the remaining blood samples obtained from each mouse were used for the flow cytometry analysis of macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes. Additionally, spleen and liver cells were obtained from each mouse after sacrifice and used for flow cytometric analysis. Accuri  C6 flow cytometry and BD Accuri  C6 software (version 1.0.264.21) from Becton, Dickinson and Company were used for above flow cytometry analysis. For cell surface marker staining, splenocytes and liver cells from mice were cut into cell suspensions. The cell suspensions were sequentially filtered through 70-microm (cat no. 340635) and 50-microm (cat no. 340592) cell strainers (both BD Biosciences), and the single cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 C. After treatment with 5 microl FcR blocking buffer in 100 microl reaction system for 15 min at 4 C (cat no. 130-092-575; Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.), the cells were immediately prepared for staining. All the cells were incubated 15 min at 4 C with PE-Vio770-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 mAb (cat no. 130-117-529; Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.) for chosen the leukocytes, followed by stained other antibodies for 30 min at 4 C in the dark. Double positive CD11b-APC (cat no. 17-0112-83) and F4/80-PE mAb (cat no. 12-4801-82) (both eBioscience; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) staining was for macrophages and double positive CD11b-APC and Ly-6G-FITC mAb (Biolegend, cat no. 127606) staining was for neutrophiles.\n\n    The fluorescent signals of GFP-HCT116 cells (Nanjing Tran-Medical Inc., ) were confirmed using flow cytometry. Before intrasplenic implantation, the flow cytometry results showed that 95.9% cells were GFP positive. GFP-HCT116 cells were diluted with the complete RPMI-1640 medium to a final concentration of 1x108/ml and intrasplenically transplanted according to the method proposed by Giavazzi et al. An intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine were administered as anesthetic, after which 20 microl cell suspension was injected into the spleen of each nude mouse. Animals were subsequently left to recover on a heating pad after surgery and returned to housing cages. Intrasplenically transplanted nude mice (n=48) were then randomly divided into the following four groups: i) Negative control (n=12); ii) 5-Fu (n=12); iii) alpha-asarone (n=12); and iv) beta-asarone (n=12) groups. The 5-Fu group received a 15 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneal injection twice a week (on the first day and fourth day). The alpha-asarone and beta-asarone group were administered a 100 mg/kg body weight intragastric injection once per day. All treatments were applied for a total of 12 consecutive days, followed by an 8-day break of treatment for two cycles. Following sacrifice as aforementioned, animals that did not exhibit a tumor of the spleen or liver were excluded. Of the included mice, the orthotopic splenic tumors were dissected and weighed.\n\n    A fluorescence optical imaging system was used to examine colon cancer liver metastasis in vivo at the day of sacrifice. Mice were euthanized as aforementioned and dissected to observe the liver metastasis of GFP-HCT116 cells. Fluorescent images were acquired using a fluorescence stereo-microscope (model, NSZ-608T; Nanjing Jiangnan Novel Optics Co., Ltd.) equipped with a D510 long-pass emission filter (Chroma Technology Corporation) and a cooled color charge-coupled device camera (Teledyne Technologies Inc.). Image Pro plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.) was used to process and analyze fluorescent images. HCT116 cells were labeled with GFP, which indicated that green fluorescence on the liver represented metastatic HCT116 cells.\n\n    Data are presented as the mean +- SD. One-way ANOVA, unpaired t-tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze the differences between groups. Dunnett's post hoc tests were used following one-way ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.\n\n    The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.",
        "Results": "    To determine the biological effect of beta-asarone in HCT116 cell malignant behavior, HCT116 cell proliferation was assessed after beta-asarone treatment. As presented in Fig. 1B, human HCT116 colon cancer cells were treated with 31, 62.5, 125, 250 or 500 microM beta-asarone. The results indicated that beta-asarone effectively decreased HCT116 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, cells administered 500 microM beta-asarone exhibited a 50% reduction in cell proliferation compared with the control group (Fig. 1B). The grouped means of the normalized CI following 24, 48 and 72 h beta-asarone treatment are presented in Fig. 1C. The results indicated that only 500 microM beta-asarone was statistically significant compared with the control.\n\n    To investigate the potential target genes and associated pathways involved in HCT116 cell beta-asarone inhibition on an unbiased basis, RNA transcriptome sequencing following beta-asarone treatment for 24 and 48 h was performed. The results identified 100 DEGs at 24 and 48 h treatment (fold-change >2; P<0.05). Among the results obtained at 24 h, 66 genes were significantly upregulated, while 34 genes were downregulated (Fig. S1A). Analogous data were obtained following 48 h treatment; 61 genes were upregulated and 39 genes were downregulated (Fig. S1C). Pathway analysis (Fig. 2) revealed that the 'regulation of transcription', 'cell cycle', 'cell division', 'apoptosis' and 'DNA replication' were prominent pathways involved in the modulatory effects of beta-asarone after treatment for 24 and 48 h, which may be involved in beta-asarone inhibition-mediated HCT116 cell proliferation. The 'IL-17 signaling pathway' was identified as a regulatory pathway involved in beta-asarone treatment for 48 h, but not in treatment for 24 h, indicating that beta-asarone may have only activated the innate immune system in HCT116 cancer cells at a later point in time (Fig. 2D).\n\n    To further investigate whether beta-asarone inhibited HCT116 cell tumorigenesis in vivo, HCT116 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. As presented in Fig. 3B, tumor growth following 100 mg/kg beta-asarone and 25 mg/kg 5-Fu treatment was markedly reduced compared with the control group. The maximum diameter and volume of a single tumor were 19.30 mm and 1,758.71 mm3, respectively. Furthermore, images revealed that the tumors of the treatment groups were generally smaller than those of the control group, particularly in mice treated with 100 mg/kg beta-asarone (Fig. 3A). In addition, the mean tumor weights of the treatment groups were reduced compared with matched control. Moreover, the 100 mg/kg beta-asarone lavage group exhibited a 50% reduction in weight compared with the control (Fig. 3C). alpha-asarone was also used in xenograft model experiment (Fig. S2A). However, the statistical P-value of tumor weight between control and alpha-asarone groups was >0.05, which revealed no statistical significance (Fig. S2B).\n\n    The results of cytokine analysis revealed that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels in the peripheral blood of nude mice were significantly increased after beta-asarone treatment (fold-change, 1.78; P=0.02). Additionally, the results of flow cytometry demonstrated that the number of splenic macrophage cells increased by 50% (from 10 to 15%) after beta-asarone treatment (Fig. 4A and B; P<0.05). However, no significant difference in neutrophil granulocyte levels was observed among the treatment groups in murine livers, spleens and peripheral blood (Fig. S3), indicating that the functional role of beta-asarone in tumor suppression may also depend on splenic immune regulation.\n\n    Green fluorescence indicated that colon cancer tissues were present. As presented in Fig. 5, the fluorescence of tissue following 5-Fu and beta-asarone treatment was markedly reduced in murine livers compared with the original splenic injection site. Tumor fluorescence images revealed no metastatic tumor tissue in the liver following beta-asarone treatment, indicating the strong inhibitory effect of beta-asarone on colon cancer liver metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, metastatic rate dropped from 90.9% (10/11 in the control group) to 41.7% (5/12 in the beta-asarone-treated group; P=0.027), suggesting that beta-asarone exerted a strong inhibitory effect on colon cancer liver metastasis in vivo (Table I). Moreover, orthotopic splenic tumor weights were measured, the results of which revealed that the mean tumor weights of the beta-asarone treatment group were significantly decreased compared with the negative control group (0.19+-0.12 g vs. 0.78+-0.66 g; P=0.022). The results further supported the inhibitory effect of beta-asarone on orthotopic splenic tumors (Table II).",

        "Discussion": "    Several conventional Chinese medicines have been commonly used in clinical practice to treat cancer, including shenqi fuzheng, kanglaite, huachansu and cantharidin sodium injections. These treatments have been demonstrated to reduce tumor metastasis and recurrence, and improve the quality of life and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Both alpha- and beta-asarone, the most studied bioactive phytochemicals of acorus calamus, have been reported to have multiple pharmacological activities such as antidepressant, antianxiety, anti-Alzheimer's, anti-Parkinson's, antiepileptic, anticancer, antihyperlipidemic, antithrombotic, anticholestatic and radioprotective activities through its interaction with multiple molecular targets. alpha-asarone and beta-asarone are isomerides. A large number of clinical studies in China have indicated the effectiveness of alpha-asarone against respiratory disorders and epilepsy; while beta-asarone has been reported to exert biological effects on different human body systems, serving inhibitory functions in numerous human carcinomas. For instance, beta-asarone exerts antifungal and anthelmintic activity, regulates the nervous system and blocks cholesterol synthesis. In addition, previous studies have also highlighted the inhibitory function of beta-asarone on tumor metastasis in glioma, lung cancer and gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, the antiproliferative property of beta-asarone has been reported in gastric cancer and LoVo colon cancer cells in a previous study. Liu et al revealed that beta-asarone could induce senescence in colorectal cancer cells by increasing the expression of Lamin B1. However, its suppressive function on the proliferation of HCT116 colon cancer cells and subsequent liver metastasis is yet to be fully elucidated.\n\n    The current study aimed to determine the antineoplastic role of beta-asarone in HCT116 cells, the results of which revealed that the inhibitory effect of beta-asarone was greater compared with alpha-asarone. The results of the present study demonstrated that beta-asarone effectively repressed HCT116 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequent GO and pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs identified following beta-asarone inhibition were involved in the 'cell cycle', 'cell division', 'cell proliferation' and 'apoptosis'. Furthermore, xenograft tumor assays indicated the inhibitory role of beta-asarone on HCT116 cell tumorigenesis in vivo. In view of that alpha-asarone and beta-asarone are both isomerides, alpha-asarone was also used in xenograft model experiment to distinguish if different structures could affect the inhibitory effectiveness of the drug. However, there was no statistically significant difference. A nude mouse model of HCT116 cell splenic-transplantation was established to assess liver metastasis, which mimicked the pathogenesis of colon cancer.\n\n    Based on ancient Chinese medicinal theory, TCM regulates the human immune system to maintain homeostasis. Trichosanthin, which is extracted from the Chinese medicinal herb Trichosanthes kirilowi, improves antitumor immunity through the interaction between tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 and cytotoxic and regulatory T cells. Chang and Shen determined that linalool stimulates IFN-gamma, IL-13, IL-2, IL-21, IL-21R, IL-4, IL-6sR and TNF-alpha secretion, indicating that it exerts cytotoxic effects in the antitumor immunity process. Additionally, our previous study demonstrated that modified SJZ inhibited colon cancer liver metastasis by activating the innate immune system. It was similarly demonstrated that plasma GM-CSF and macrophage levels are significantly increased following modified SJZ treatment. Nevertheless, the functional role of beta-asarone in colon cancer immunity has not yet been fully elucidated, to the best of our knowledge. The current study assessed the influence of beta-asarone on the innate immune response of HCT116 cells. Cytokine analysis revealed that G-CSF levels in the peripheral blood of nude mice were significantly increased after beta-asarone treatment. G-CSF stimulates the proliferation of neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages. Neutrophil granulocytes are therefore the major effectors of acute inflammation, as they are one of the first responders during the immune response, migrating to inflammation sites to target bacteria or infiltrating cancer tissue. An increase in macrophage numbers could also be used to estimate immune system changes. It is well-known that macrophage cells engulf and digest cellular debris, foreign substances and cancer cells, indicating its vital role in non-specific defense. Therefore, the current study focused on the innate immune system following beta-asarone treatment and verified beta-asarone's anticancer immunoregulation. However, the downstream target genes of beta-asarone and the potential associated mechanisms remain unclear in HCT116 colon cancer cells, which requires further study.\n\n    Previous studies have not provided the evidence for the adverse effect of beta-asarone on normal cells, which could also be a limitation of the present study. Certainly, the possible cytotoxic activity of beta-asarone in normal cells needs to be further explored to improve our understanding of beta-asarone's inhibitory effect on these tumorigenic cells. Additionally, to develop our understanding of tumor growth and metastasis-related biomarkers in tumor tissues/metastases, it would be important to elucidate the mechanisms by which beta-asarone exerts its anti-growth and anti-metastasis activities in vivo. The lack of such investigation is another limitation of the present study, but could be a further area of future research.\n\n    In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that beta-asarone exerted an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and metastasis of HCT116 colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, beta-asarone may be involved in the antitumor immune response by stimulating G-CSF and increasing the number of macrophages in the spleen. Collectively, the current data verified the anticancer effects of beta-asarone, both functionally and immunologically, supporting the possibility of its multi-system regulation and providing a basis for future research into colon cancer.",

        "Title": "    Beyond diagnostic yield: prenatal exome sequencing results in maternal, neonatal, and familial clinical management changes",
        "Abstract": "    Previous studies have reported that prenatal exome sequencing (pES) can detect monogenic diseases in fetuses with congenital anomalies with diagnostic yields ranging from 6% to 81%, but there are few reports of its clinical utility.\n\n    We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who had pES to determine whether results led to clinical management changes.\n\n    Of 20 patients, 8 (40%) received a definitive diagnosis. Seven patients (35%) had medical management changes based on the pES results, including alterations to their delivery plan and neonatal management (such as use of targeted medications, subspecialty referrals, additional imaging and/or procedures). All patients who received a definitive diagnosis and one who received a likely pathogenic variant (n = 9; 45%) received specific counseling about recurrence risk and the medical/developmental prognosis for the baby. In five (25%) cases, the result facilitated a diagnosis in parents and/or siblings.\n\n    pES results can have significant impacts on clinical management, some of which would not be possible if testing is deferred until after birth. To maximize the clinical utility, pES should be prioritized in cases where multiple care options are available and the imaging findings alone are not sufficient to guide parental decision-making, or where postnatal testing will not be feasible.",
        "Introduction": "    Congenital anomalies and genetic conditions are noted in approximately 2-5% of pregnancies and are major causes of fetal demise and infant death. Chromosomal microarray is recommended to evaluate for chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with congenital anomalies, but 60-70% of fetuses remain without a genetic diagnosis after microarray, which can complicate counseling, prenatal management, and parental decision-making.\n\n    With the decreasing cost and turnaround time (TAT) of genomic testing methodologies, broad testing approaches such as exome sequencing (ES) are being used more frequently for prenatal diagnosis of monogenic disorders not detectable by microarray. Current professional society opinions support the use of prenatal ES (pES) in select cases of anomalies suggestive of a genetic disorder with the input of a clinical geneticist. Prior case series have reported highly variable diagnostic yields of pES from 6.2% to 89%, with most reporting yields of 20-40%.\n\n    However, it remains to be determined whether this improved diagnostic yield is meaningful to the patient and family. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics defines the clinical utility of genetic testing as its \"effects on diagnostic or therapeutic management, implications for prognosis, health and psychological benefits to patients and their relatives, and economic impact on health-care systems.\" Most genetics providers believe that pES will have clinical utility. Previous studies of pES indicate that results can impact decision-making about continuation or termination, pre- or postnatal medical management, delivery planning, recurrence risk counseling, reproductive planning, and parental medical management.\n\n    However, there are also risks and limitations of pES that must be considered. Since parents may choose to terminate their pregnancy based on the results, there is a potential for harm if results are ambiguous, unexpected, and/or misunderstood. As in postnatal ES, there is a risk of discovering incidental or secondary findings. The interpretation of variants detected on pES can be also challenging because the prenatal-onset phenotypes of many disorders are poorly characterized and the phenotype information about a fetus is often limited. Additionally, pES requires a rapid TAT if results are to be used for clinical management, which can be labor-intensive for both the clinical and laboratory teams. The cost of pES may pose a significant burden to patients because most US health-care insurance providers do not cover the cost of this test, citing a lack of evidence to support its clinical utility.\n\n    Given the potential limitations, additional studies are needed to establish the clinical utility of pES to justify its use. Here, we examine the clinical utility of pES in a cohort of 20 patients seen at our institution for pregnancies affected by congenital anomalies.",
        "Methods": "    A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients evaluated in our fetal care center who had ES ordered during pregnancy or after a fetal demise or termination of pregnancy (TOP), which were all considered as pES for this study since the indications for testing were prenatally identified congenital anomalies. Our fetal care center is a tertiary referral center that evaluated approximately 1,100 patients from 2018 to 2019 (the timeframe where most of the patients included in this chart review were evaluated) for congenital anomalies and complications of multiple gestations. All patients underwent detailed prenatal phenotyping via ultrasound, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fetal echocardiogram, as well as evaluation by a multidisciplinary team including a clinical geneticist, genetic counselor, maternal fetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, and additional subspecialists as needed based on the fetal anomalies (e.g., fetal/pediatric surgeon, neurologist). Patients were considered eligible for pES if their fetus had congenital anomalies thought to be caused by an underlying genetic disorder but for which multigene panels were not felt to be suitable as determined by the clinical geneticist and genetic counselor. All patients underwent chromosomal microarray testing prior to or concurrently with pES. Some patients had additional testing, such as amniotic fluid viral studies, based on their indications. There were no gestational age restrictions for eligibility. Patients considering TOP, a comfort care approach, or full medical interventions were all eligible. Patients were eligible for this chart review if pES produced a result (i.e., no sample failure) and they were no longer pregnant at the time of chart review.\n\n    Fetal DNA was obtained via chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, or fetal tissue. Blood or saliva was collected from parents for duo or trio analysis. All patients received counseling about pES from a certified genetic counselor and provided written informed consent for the testing. ES was performed by CLIA-approved commercial or academic laboratories selected on a case-by-case basis based on patient-specific factors, such as gestational age, insurance considerations, and eligibility for a pES clinical trial. Variant interpretation and reporting were performed by individual laboratories per standard clinical practice.\n\n    Maternal and neonatal charts were reviewed to describe the prenatal phenotype, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (when applicable), pES results, and clinical utility of the results. Clinical utility was defined as changes to prenatal management (e.g., decisions about prenatal surgical interventions, decision about pregnancy termination or perinatal palliative care), delivery management (e.g., change in location, mode, and/or timing of delivery), neonatal management (e.g., initiation of gene- or pathway-specific medication, subspecialist referrals), family planning (e.g., specific recurrence risk counseling, pursuit of preimplantation or prenatal genetic testing for future pregnancies), family medical care (e.g., diagnosis of a genetic disorder in parents and/or siblings), and other aspects of care (e.g., psychosocial interventions).",
        "Results": "    Twenty patients from March 2015 to October 2019 were identified who met the inclusion criteria (Table 1). One additional patient was excluded since exome was ordered based on the autopsy findings and was therefore not considered a prenatal exome. Most had pES in 2018 (n = 9) or 2019 (n = 9). Nineteen were completed as trios and one was a maternal/fetal duo as the father was unavailable.\n\n    Fourteen (70%) were ordered during an ongoing pregnancy, 3 (15%) after fetal demise, and 3 (15%) after TOP. The average gestational age for the pES order during an ongoing pregnancy was 28 4/7 weeks gestation. For the eight patients who received results during their pregnancy, the average TAT was 19.3 days and the average gestational age at the time of the result was 30 5/7 weeks. For the remaining 12 patients, the average TAT was 56.8 days.\n\n    Eight patients (40%) received a diagnostic result from pES (Table 1). Of these diagnoses, three (cases 1, 3, and 6) were autosomal recessive disorders and one (case 8) was an autosomal dominant disorder inherited from a previously undiagnosed mother. The remaining four were de novo autosomal dominant (cases 4, 5, and 7) and somatic mosaic (case 2) disorders. Seven additional patients (35%) received an inconclusive result due to variants of uncertain clinical significance. In two cases (cases 1 and 16), variants in novel genes were reported. Of the five patients who received negative pES results, two received postnatal diagnoses of nongenetic disorders (cases 16 and 18).\n\n    Nine patients (45%) had clinical management changes made based on the pES result, including all eight who received a diagnosis and one who received an inconclusive result (Table 2).\n\n    Multiple brain malformations, hydrops, small chest, hepatomegaly, decreased muscle mass, small kidneys, and oligohydramnios detected by ultrasound at 20 5/7 weeks gestation\n\n    pES detected compound heterozygous likely pathogenic variants in NMNAT2, a novel gene with no established human phenotype. The parents had previously decided on palliative care based on the poor prognosis associated with the imaging findings (Fig. 1a). Phenotypes reported in animal studies of NMNAT2 were consistent with the fetal anomalies. The clinical team believed this was likely the diagnosis for the fetus, which facilitated counseling about a recurrence risk of 25% and prompted the parents to pursue preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) resulting in a healthy child. They later had another pregnancy affected by similar anomalies and underwent targeted prenatal diagnostic testing that confirmed the same NMNAT2 variants in this fetus. Functional studies established that these variants impair NMNAT2 function and supported this gene's association with fetal akinesia deformation sequence.\n\n    Megalencephaly, neuronal migration anomalies, enlarged globes, thickened chin soft tissue, and ambiguous genitalia detected by ultrasound at 23 2/7 weeks gestation\n\n    pES detected a pathogenic variant in AKT1 consistent with a diagnosis of Proteus syndrome (OMIM 176920). Based on the grave prognosis of Proteus syndrome in the context of the fetal anomalies (Fig. 1b), the parents enrolled in perinatal palliative care. At 35 weeks gestation, the fetal head circumference was greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. Due to concerns that continued overgrowth of the head was likely and could result in maternal morbidity during delivery, her delivery timing was changed from 37 to 35 weeks gestation to reduce the risk of maternal morbidity and she delivered by an uncomplicated cesarean section with a low-transverse incision. After birth, the baby received a full-body MRI to screen for additional Proteus syndrome-related overgrowth. Her known diagnosis and enrollment in palliative care allowed her medical team to minimize the duration of her hospital stay and she was discharged at 10 days of life. She later developed seizures requiring polypharmacy, including the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus to target the AKT1 biochemical pathway. Unfortunately, she died of respiratory failure at 6 months. The parents were counseled about the negligible recurrence risk for future pregnancies due to the sporadic nature of Proteus syndrome. The parents reported psychosocial utility of the result as it facilitated their connection to Proteus syndrome support groups.\n\n    Arthrogryposis and hydrops detected by ultrasound at 25 2/7 weeks gestation\n\n    Since the parents had a previous female child with arthrogryposis who died as a neonate and remained undiagnosed after a multigene panel for fetal akinesia, pES was felt to be the best test to identify a diagnosis in this fetus. The patient delivered shortly after pES was ordered and the baby died prior to the availability of results. pES detected compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in SCN4A associated with congenital myopathy, which confirmed the 25% recurrence risk and a diagnosis for their previous child. To our knowledge, the parents are investigating options for PGT to prevent further recurrence.\n\n    Hypoplastic nose, micrognathia, hypogenesis of the corpus callosum, and pelvocaliectasis detected by ultrasound at 18 0/7 weeks gestation, with cystic hygroma detected at 11 3/7 weeks gestation\n\n    pES was recommended to guide the parental decision-making about neonatal management options due to the wide range outcomes associated with the fetal anomalies (Fig. 1c) and detected a de novo pathogenic variant in KANSL1 consistent with a diagnosis of Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS; OMIM 610443). The parents opted for full intervention after receiving the genetic diagnosis. After birth, the baby received a screening electroencephalogram (EEG) and early placement of a gastrostomy tube due to the known risks for seizures and feeding problems associated with KdVS. He developed worsening respiratory distress and received a tracheostomy at 6 weeks of life. His postnatal X-rays demonstrated epiphyseal stippling in addition to his severely hypoplastic nose, consistent with chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP). His ES data were reanalyzed and a multigene deletion/duplication panel was ordered, but neither identified a genetic etiology for CDP. It remains unknown whether CDP represents an unrecognized phenotype of KdVS or if there is another etiology for this phenotype.\n\n    Microphthalmia, micrognathia, pectus excavatum, horseshoe kidney, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and polyhydramnios detected by ultrasound at 21 1/7 weeks gestation\n\n    pES was recommended to guide parental decision-making about whether to pursue neonatal surgical intervention for hypoplastic left heart syndrome in the context of multiple congenital anomalies, but the results were not available until 18 days after birth due to difficulties obtaining a maternal DNA sample. The mother had opted for full neonatal intervention prior to receiving the pES results of a presumed de novo pathogenic variant in KMT2D consistent with a diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920). Due to the risk for immunodeficiency associated with Kabuki syndrome, an immunology evaluation was performed at 3 weeks of life which demonstrated lymphopenia. At 18 months, he developed hypogammaglobulinemia requiring intravenous immunoglobulin. The diagnosis improved counseling about the long-term medical and developmental prognosis for this baby to inform future medical management decisions, as well as counseling about the likely low recurrence risk due to the presumed de novo nature of the variant.\n\n    Arthrogryposis, deficient muscle mass, scoliosis, micrognathia, frontal bossing, soft tissue edema, ventricular septal defect, and polyhydramnios detected by ultrasound at 20 0/7 weeks gestation\n\n    Due to the anomalies visualized with prenatal imaging (Fig. 1d), the parents were counseled that their baby would likely need an ex utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT) delivery and a prolonged hospital. Therefore, pES was recommended to guide parental decision-making. pES detected compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in NEB consistent with nemaline myopathy 2 (OMIM 256030). After receiving the pES results, the prenatal care team recommended against performing an EXIT delivery due to the poor long-term prognosis of this condition and the increased risk of maternal complications associated with EXIT delivery. Instead, the care team and mother elected for a C-section delivery with attempt to intubate the infant while still on placental support. They also referred the parents to a perinatal palliative care team. Given the likely respiratory distress and lifelong need for mechanical ventilation, the parents requested intubation and a trial of mechanical ventilation after delivery but declined chest compressions and tracheostomy placement. The delivery and intubation were successful, and the baby ultimately remained ventilator dependent. His parents took time for valuable psychosocial interventions including memory-making activities and baptism prior to removal of his breathing tube. The diagnosis also allowed for counseling about the 25% recurrence risk.\n\n    Short limbs, micrognathia, bell-shaped chest, edema, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome detected by ultrasound at 16 2/7 weeks gestation\n\n    The imaging findings of a complex heart defect and suspected pulmonary hypoplasia due to a bell-shaped chest (Fig. 1e) suggested a poor prognosis, so the parents sought a genetic diagnosis to inform their prenatal and neonatal decision-making. pES detected a de novo pathogenic variant in COL2A1 associated with skeletal dysplasia. While COL2A1 is known to be associated with multiple types of skeletal dysplasia, it had not been previously associated with heart defects. Therefore, it is uncertain whether this case expands the phenotype of COL2A1-related skeletal dysplasia or if the heart defect had a separate etiology. The prenatal genetic diagnosis supported the decision to pursue palliative care and facilitated counseling about the low recurrence risk for the skeletal dysplasia due to the de novo nature of the variant. pES also identified two variants in PIEZO1, a gene associated with autosomal dominant iron overload, splenomegaly, and gallstones (OMIM 194380), and autosomal recessive lymphedema (OMIM 616843). The father reported a personal history of splenomegaly and a family history of gallstones, so he was counseled that he likely has the autosomal dominant PIEZO1-related disorder, which has a 50% recurrence risk.\n\n    Hydrops, short nasal bone, mild ventriculomegaly, and pelvocaliectasis detected by ultrasound at 18 4/7 weeks gestation, with cystic hygroma detected at 13 4/7 weeks gestation\n\n    pES performed after fetal demise identified a maternally inherited pathogenic variant in PTPN11 consistent with Noonan syndrome (OMIM 163950). The mother was referred to a RASopathy-specific genetics clinic where she was noted to have short stature, mitral valve regurgitation, and a bleeding tendency including easy bruising, heavy periods, gum bleeding, and significant bleeding after a previous surgery. It was recommended that her care include continued follow-up with this clinic, regular echocardiograms due to the increased risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hematology screening for platelet anomalies. The diagnosis also facilitated accurate counseling of a 50% recurrence risk and the parents have expressed an interest in PGT.\n\n    Severe micrognathia, midface hypoplasia, short ribs, pulmonary hypoplasia, and polyhydramnios detected by ultrasound at 24 5/7 weeks gestation, with cystic hygroma detected at 13 weeks gestation\n\n    pES was recommended to guide delivery planning as the severe fetal micrognathia (Fig. 1f) would likely necessitate an EXIT delivery to establish an airway, increasing the risk of maternal morbidity. The patient declined amniocentesis solely for genetic testing, so pES was sent at 36 weeks gestation when she required an amnioreduction due to polyhydramnios. The results were not available for delivery planning and she delivered by EXIT-to-tracheostomy due to severe fetal micrognathia (jaw index measured less than 5th percentile at 34 weeks gestation) and glossoptosis. She continues to be dependent on mechanical ventilation by tracheostomy at 2 years of life. pES results were reported 17 days after delivery and did not identify a conclusive primary diagnosis. However, it identified a paternally inherited likely pathogenic variant in ALPL thought to be consistent with a later-onset autosomal dominant form of hypophosphatasia (HPP; OMIM 146300). The baby had very poor bone mineralization, low alkaline phosphatase activity, and elevated vitamin B6, so she was treated with asfotase alfa, an HPP-targeted medication. This result also led to a paternal diagnosis of HPP and informed counseling about a 50% recurrence risk for HPP.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In our cohort, 40% of patients with severe and/or multiple fetal anomalies received a diagnosis from pES, which is comparable to the diagnostic yields previously reported for fetuses with similar presentations. In fetuses with multiple anomalies and/or suspected Mendelian disorders, the incremental diagnostic yield of pES over microarray is at least comparable to, if not better than, the 5-10% incremental diagnostic yield of microarray over karyotype. Thus, the value of pES in diagnosing genetic conditions should no longer be questioned. However, the clinical utility of pES still needs to be established.\n\n    In our cohort, pES led to clinical management changes in 45% of patients, most often related to family planning (45%) and neonatal medical management (25%), as well as diagnoses in family members (25%). Previously, two studies from the Netherlands reported that clinical management was directly impacted by pES results in 70% of their patients, where results were used to make decisions about pregnancy termination and pre- and postnatal medical management. Notably, half of the patients in these studies with negative results had clinical management changes, primarily related to supporting their decision to continue their pregnancy and/or pursue intervention for the fetal anomalies, which further underscores the difference between diagnostic yield and clinical utility.\n\n    Surveys of clinicians and parents have reported that most believe that pES will have clinical utility related to diagnosing genetic conditions, impacting pregnancy management, facilitating decisions about pregnancy termination, preparing for childhood-onset conditions, and informing reproductive planning. In stark contrast, a study of 14 US health-care insurance payers reported that none believed that decisions about TOP, withdrawal of intensive care, provision of palliative care, family planning, or directing families to disease-specific resources (e.g., support groups, research) were aspects of clinical utility of pES, and only a minority agreed that referral to a tertiary center for specialized care was an aspect of clinical utility. Therefore, it will be challenging to reconcile the different perspectives of the various pES stakeholders to establish its clinical utility.\n\n    One argument against pES is that, given the availability of rapid postnatal ES, pES adds no value until in utero interventions for fetal genetic disorders are clinically available. However, the fetus is not the sole patient of concern in the prenatal period; the mother should also be considered since results can directly impact her health, as demonstrated by cases 2 and 6 where the genetic diagnosis led to modifications of the delivery plans to reduce maternal morbidity. These decisions would not have been possible if testing had been deferred to the postnatal period. Thus, it is imperative to consider maternal health outcomes as part of the clinical utility of pES.\n\n    The claim that rapid neonatal ES obviates the need for pES also overlooks the importance of perinatal medical management decisions for the baby, such as planning for optimal delivery room resuscitation and timely initiation of diagnosis-specific treatment. Kingsmore et al. recently reviewed studies of rapid ES and reported median TAT ranging from 9 to 23 days. Given that some genetic conditions have targeted therapies available, such as cases 2 and 9 as well as 27% of Kingsmore's cohort, treatment could be delayed for days to weeks while awaiting rapid neonatal results. As intensive neonatal care and targeted therapies are not available at all hospitals, prenatal genetic diagnosis can facilitate referrals to institutions that are able to provide the appropriate therapies without delay. A prenatal genetic diagnosis may also limit expensive or invasive diagnostic testing that may be performed while postnatal testing is pending.\n\n    Furthermore, the notion that in utero or neonatal treatments are the only clinically useful interventions ignores the value of perinatal palliative care, which empowers parents to consider their values and hopes for their child's quality of life while ensuring that their physical and psychosocial needs are met. With earlier referrals to palliative care services, families form stronger bonds with their health-care team and have a healthier grieving process. While families may choose to redirect to a palliative care approach after learning of a life-limiting diagnosis in their newborn, deciding to withdraw care that has already begun is often more difficult for families than avoiding invasive and painful care in the first place. Indeed, the diagnoses in cases 2 and 6 facilitated prenatal enrollment in a perinatal palliative care program, allowing these families to request avoidance of futile, painful procedures such as chest compressions; decrease the baby's inpatient hospital stay to maximize family bonding at home; and plan meaningful rituals, such as baptism and memory-making, prior to the baby's death. Therefore, while it is not always possible to improve a baby's long-term outcome, prenatal diagnosis can improve the baby's quality of life and the overall experience of the family.\n\n    Another significant difference between pre- and postnatal genetic testing is that TOP may be considered during an ongoing pregnancy, but prenatal imaging findings may not be sufficient to guide this decision without knowledge of the underlying etiology. For example, parents of a baby with an isolated heart defect detected on ultrasound are more likely to terminate their pregnancy if an underlying genetic condition is identified. As this decision is restricted to the prenatal period, access to prenatal genetic testing including pES is imperative for parents to make informed decisions about their pregnancy.\n\n    Certainly, there are important limitations of pES that must be considered. Due to the broad nature of the testing, there is the possibility of receiving variants of uncertain clinical significance, as seen in 35% of our cohort. Since parents may make irreversible decisions, such as pursuing pregnancy termination or declining intensive interventions, it is imperative that uncertain results are fully explained in both pre- and post-test counseling to limit the risk of harm. Additionally, since there is an inherent timeframe in which prenatal and delivery management decisions can be made, the TAT for pES results needs to be optimized.\n\n    In our cohort, the decision to perform pES was at the discretion of the multidisciplinary clinical team that included a clinical geneticist and was based on a high suspicion of a Mendelian genetic disorder. As a result, the diagnostic yield and rate at which clinical management changes occurred in our study are likely higher than cohorts of all prenatally diagnosed congenital anomalies. However, the data presented here may be representative of yields expected in actual clinical practice. Additionally, our cohort represents the patients with health insurance carriers who approved pES, personal financial resources to pay for the testing, or who qualified for free testing by other means, and thus excludes patients who lacked the financial ability to access this testing.\n\n    The retrospective nature of our study limited identification of clinical management changes to those explicitly documented in the patients' medical records. While we made every effort possible to only report clinical management changes that specifically resulted from the pES results, including speaking with the clinical staff when the patients' charts were unclear, it is possible that some decisions may have been influenced by other factors (e.g., progression of imaging findings). We did not identify any cases where clinical management changes were made based on the lack of a genetic diagnosis from an inconclusive or negative result, which may be in part because pregnancy termination is not common in our clinic's population. Additionally, for our patients who had pES during an ongoing pregnancy, it was ordered in the late second to late third trimesters; we therefore cannot comment on the clinical utility of pES results in the first or early second trimesters. Future prospective studies should be performed to better evaluate and maximize the impact of positive, inconclusive, and negative pES results on clinical decision-making throughout pregnancy.\n\n    In conclusion, results from pES can have significant impacts on the clinical management of the mother, neonate, and other family members, such as reducing risks of maternal morbidity during delivery, planning for optimal neonatal resuscitation, early initiation of diagnosis-targeted treatments, avoiding futile neonatal interventions, diagnosing other family members, and facilitating informed reproductive decision-making. As some of these decisions are only possible in the prenatal period, deferring genetic testing to the postnatal period is not always ideal. In cases where a genetic etiology is suspected and parents are pursuing TOP or where intrauterine fetal demise is likely, pES may be the only feasible opportunity to establish a genetic diagnosis to guide future reproductive planning. Additionally, pES may have clinical utility in cases where multiple care options are available, such as intensive in utero or neonatal intervention, TOP, and palliative care, but where the imaging findings alone are not sufficient to guide parental decision-making.\n\n    Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

        "Title": "    Cell-microsphere based living microhybrids for osteogenesis regulating to boosting biomineralization",
        "Abstract": "    Biomineralization-based cell-material living composites ex vivo showed great potential for living materials construction and cell regulation. However, cells in scaffolds with unconnected pores usually induce confined nutrient transfer and cell-cell communications, affecting the transformation of osteoblasts into osteocytes and the mineralization process. Herein, the osteoblast-materials living hybrids were constructed with porous PLLA microspheres using a rational design, in which cell-based living materials presented an improved osteoblast differentiation and mineralization model using rationally designed cell-microsphere composites. The results indicated that the microfluidic-based technique provided an efficient and highly controllable approach for producing on-demand PLLA microspheres with tiny pores (<5 mum), medium pores (5-15 mum) and large pores (>15 mum), as well as further drug delivery. Furthermore, the simvastatin (SIM)-loaded porous PLLA microsphere with epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-PL) modification was used for osteoblast (MC3T3-E1) implantation, achieving the cell-material living microhybrids, and the results demonstrated the epsilon-PL surface modification and SIM could improve osteoblast behavior regulation, including cell adhesion, proliferation, as well as the antibacterial effects. Both in vitro and in vivo results significantly demonstrated further cell proliferation, differentiation and cascade mineralization regulation. Then, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction or histological staining of typical markers, including collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2 and bone morphogenetic protein 2, as well as the calcium mineral deposition staining in situ, reconfirmed the transformation of osteoblasts into osteocytes. These achievements revealed a promising boost in osteogenesis toward mineralization at the microtissue level by cell-microsphere integration, suggesting an alternative strategy for materials-based ex vivo tissue construction and cell regulation, further demonstrating excellent application prospects in the field of biomineralization-based tissue regeneration.",
        "Introduction": "    Biomineralization is the primary process for skeleton regeneration, which integrates osteoblast infiltration and proliferation within implanted materials, initiating osteoblast differentiation to osteocytes and driving mineralization subsequently. When we consider osteoblast-osteocyte differentiation and mineralization in vivo, it generally includes the cell migration into the prosperous area and differentiation to mineralization induced by the microenvironment and active biomolecules. Inspired by this, the implanted scaffolds, such as Poly (lactic acid) (PLA), demonstrated high biocompatibility for osteoblast infiltration and proliferation during bone regeneration. However, during mineralization engineering, scaffolds with limited porosity and unconnected pores usually induce confined nutrient transfer and cell-cell communications within implanted materials, which inhibits osteoblast viability and information exchange, affecting the mineralization process.\n\n    Currently, the materials-assisted cell hybrid presents a novel insight into regulating cell behavior and function, demonstrating outstanding potential for regenerative medicine. More importantly, cell-material-based living materials provided ex vivo techniques to improve the comprehensive understanding by mimicking the way of cell regulation by implanted material in vivo, which provided a facile strategy to detect cell behavior and biomineralization regulation dynamically. Cell-material complexes need further careful consideration of permeability to achieve living and regulating functions. Recently, the porous microspheres with large specific surface areas have demonstrated great potential for cell proliferation, and their highly interconnected pore structure facilitates cell viability and sustained drug release. Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA), a typical PLA biomaterial, has demonstrated great potential for skeleton repair due to its flexible mechanical properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility. When used as microspheres, their confined pore size and unconnected inner structure limited their further osteocyte regulation, presenting a critical challenge for osteoblast regulation and mineralization. It was suggested that regulating osteocyte differentiation and mineralization by porous microspheres in situ might be preferred. It should be noted that porous microspheres with 100-500 mum in diameter supported fluent nutrient exchange for cell proliferation and communications. Moreover, a pore size of ~20 mum and its inner connection within the microspheres could improve cell infiltration and accommodation. Inspired by these, it followed a promising strategy for constructing osteocyte-based living materials by porous PLLA microspheres.\n\n    Herein, the rationally designed porous PLLA microspheres were achieved by microfluidics. To achieve cell regulation, simvastatin (SIM), a typical inducer for osteoblast differentiation, was introduced facilely into microspheres using one-step preparation followed by epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-PL) surface modification (Figure 1). These achievements presented a novel alternative strategy for porous PLLA microspheres, demonstrating the success of osteoblast hybrids, which provided a comprehensive biomimetic mineralization process involving osteocyte differentiation and mineralization in situ, further indicating the success of cell-based living materials construction at microtissue levels.",
        "Methods": "    PLLA (Mw = 60 kDa) was purchased from (Daigang, China). alpha-Minimum essential medium (alpha-MEM) was obtained from Cytiva. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was obtained from Gibco. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Ozfan. Calcein and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were purchased from Aladdin. SIM, ammonium bicarbonate and epsilon-PL were purchased from Macklin (Shanghai, China). The BCA protein assay kit, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) kit, Alizarin Red Staining kit, BCIP/NBT ALP kit, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), cell viability kit, cell counting kit-8, actin-tracker green-488 and 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride were supplied by Beyotime Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Some elements in graphical abstract, scheme and other figures have permission from the BioRender.\n\n    In this study, we prepared porous PLLA microspheres using microfluidic technology and compared different ammonium bicarbonate concentrations, homogenization rates, W/O solution ratios and PLLA concentrations. The steps were as follows: PLLA powder was dissolved in methylene chloride to form the oil phase, while ammonium bicarbonate and PVA were each dissolved in ultrapure water to form the aqueous phase. Next, the oil and ammonium bicarbonate phases were thoroughly mixed and homogenized for 2 min to ensure the formation of a primary emulsion with homogeneous water and oil phases. Afterward, this primary emulsion was used as the dispersed phase in a microfluidic device with a 1% (w/v) aqueous solution of PVA for both the continuous phase and the collection bath. Porous microspheres were prepared using a coaxial needle equipped with an 18-G outer needle and a 25-G inner needle at a 2-ml/min flow rate for the continuous phase and 0.1 ml/min for the dispersed phase. After droplet formation, the droplets were stirred overnight by mechanical stirring at 220 rpm/min to ensure complete volatilization of dichloromethane. The decomposition of ammonium bicarbonate produced ammonia and carbon dioxide, which formed highly interconnected pore structures inside and on the surface of the microspheres. Finally, the microspheres were washed three times with ultrapure water to remove PVA, and these porous PLLA microspheres (PPM) were preserved by freeze-drying. In this study, PLLA membranes were prepared for water contact angle measurements. The PLLA solution in 2.5% (w/v) DCM was uniformly coated on circular slides (Phi = 40 mm) and the DCM was allowed to evaporate for 12 h at room temperature.\n\n    Drug-loaded microspheres (PPM-SIM) were prepared by introducing the SIM into the PLLA solution directly during preparation. For the typical preparation of PPM-SIM, the preparation method was as follows: 0.2 g of PLLA powder, 8 mg~24 mg of SIM was dissolved in 8 ml of DCM, 3 ml of the above solution was taken, 1 ml of 1% (w/v) aqueous ammonium bicarbonate was added, and homogenization was carried out at a low rate of 5000 rpm for 2 min to obtain the W/O emulsion to be used as the dispersed phase, and the subsequent steps were the same as PPM.\n\n    To prepare epsilon-PL coated microspheres, PPM was immersed in 0.1 M NaOH for 3 min, rinsed and treated with epsilon-PL solutions of 1, 3 or 5 mg/ml overnight under mechanical stirring (100 rpm). The groups mentioned above, designated PPM-epsilon-PL(1), PPM-epsilon-PL(3) and PPM-epsilon-PL(5), respectively, were then rinsed and freeze-dried. Then, the optimal epsilon-PL concentration was employed to coat PPM-SIM microspheres, forming the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL microspheres.\n\n    The stereoscope (NSZ-608T, China), microscope (Leica, Germany) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Zeiss, USA), as well as EDS elemental mapping (Carl Zeiss ultra 55, Germany), were used to characterize the morphology of various samples, and the particle and pore sizes of the microspheres were measured by Nano Measure (n = 100). Confocal microscopy (Nikon, Japan) was used to characterize the microstructure inside the microspheres. The chemical composition of samples was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EscaLab 250Xi, Thermo Fisher, USA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (IS 50, Thermo Electron Scientific Corporation, USA). The crystal structure of the samples was determined using a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument (Bruker AXS GMBH, USA). The thermal behavior of the samples was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (HS-101, Heson, China). PLLA films were prepared as a substitution for the water contact angle test (JC2000D2, China). The surface potentials of the samples were analyzed using a solid surface zeta potential analyzer (SurPASS 3, ATU).\n\n    To measure the loading and encapsulation efficiency of SIM, groups of microspheres were dissolved in dichloromethane and diluted to a concentration of 100 mug/ml. The diluted samples were detected using a UV spectrophotometer at 240 nm. The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were determined:\n\n    Ten milligrams of SIM-loaded microspheres were added to a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 000 Da and immersed in a centrifuge tube containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS solution (20 ml, pH = 7.4). Then, they were placed in an oscillating incubator (120 rpm, 37 C). Approximately 3 ml of release medium was removed at specific time points (2 h ~ 14 days) and replaced with 3 ml of fresh release medium. The SIM characteristic peak was detected at 239 nm using a UV spectrophotometer.\n\n    Five milligrams of each group microspheres (PPM, PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL) were immersed in 10 ml of PBS and incubated at 37 C with gentle shaking. After 10, 20 and 30 days, the microspheres were washed, dried and weighed (Wt). The residue percentage was calculated using the formula (Wt/W0) x 100%, where W0 represents the initial weight of the microspheres. This process was performed in triplicate for each time point.\n\n    The antimicrobial properties were detected by co-culturing with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) with PPM, PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL microspheres for 4, 8 and 12 h, respectively. Briefly, 10 mg of PPM, PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL microspheres were taken into 24-well plates, and 1 ml E. coli (ATCC 25922) and S. aureus (ATCC 25923) suspensions were diluted to 1.0 x 104 CFU/ml and added into each well. The untreated bacteria were used as a blank control, and the bacterial co-culture suspensions were incubated at 37 C for 4, 8 and 12 h. The OD bacterial suspension was separated and measured at 600 nm, and the viability of the bacteria in each group was calculated by the formula: D sample/D controlx100%. D sample and D control denote the absorbance values of the samples and the control.\n\n    The biocompatibility of PPM was investigated using the CCK8 method. To assess the cytotoxicity of each group of microspheres, the microspheres were sterilized for 2 h by UV disinfection. Then, 20 mg microspheres were immersed in 5 ml of culture medium (10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and placed into an incubator (37 C, 5% CO2) for 24 h. Subsequently, the microsphere supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-mum filter in two rounds. The microsphere extract was diluted to five concentration gradients of 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 mg/ml. L929 and MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded into a 96-well at a density of 2.0 x 104 cells/ml and incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 100 mul of microsphere extract for each group and continued for 24 h incubation. Ten microliters of CCK8 were added to each well, and after 1 h of incubation, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a microplate reader.\n\n    The PPM was soaked in 75% alcohol for 30 min, and the microspheres were washed with PBS 3 times, then MC3T3-E1 cells (1 x 106 cell/well) and microspheres (20/well) were added into 5 ml centrifuge tubes treated with an anti-adhesion solution. The tubes were blown sufficiently using a pipette to make the cells and microspheres in full contact. Then, the centrifuge tubes were incubated in an incubator for 2 h (37 C, 5% CO2), and 70 mum filters were used to remove the unattached cells. The cell-microsphere complexes were transferred to 24-well plates for further incubation, and the medium was changed every two days. The cell microsphere complexes were stained by Live/Dead Kit after 1, 3 and 5 days of incubation and were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Furthermore, MC3T3-E1 cell-laden microspheres were suspended in a 2-ml culture medium and transferred into a 24-well plate for continued culture. Cell migration and proliferation from microspheres to the plate were observed using an optical microscope at indicated intervals. ImageJ software was used to quantify the cell area percentage at each time point.\n\n    MC3T3-E1 cells were implanted into the microspheres and cultured in alpha-MEM for 5 days before replacing the original medium with an osteogenic medium consisting of alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% double antibody, 50 mug/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mM sodium beta-glycerophosphate and 10 nM dexamethasone.\n\n    According to the instruction manual of the ALP assay kit, after lysis and centrifugation of the cell microsphere complex, 50 mul of sample and 50 mul of chromogenic substrate were added into 96-well plates and mixed thoroughly. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 mul termination solution to each well after incubation for 30 min at 37 C. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. A BCA protein concentration assay kit was used to quantify the protein concentration in the supernatant.\n\n    Three sets of cell microsphere complexes after 14 days of co-culture were transferred into 24-well plates. After discarding the culture medium, the plates were washed twice with PBS solution. Next, 4% paraformaldehyde was added to the 24-well plate and fixed for 10 min. After discarding the fixation solution, it was washed three times with ultrapure water. Then, the plates were stained at room temperature for 12 h using the BCIP/NBT ALP chromogenic kit and photographed.\n\n    Following 14 days of culture in an osteogenic induction medium, the three groups of cell-material complexes were collected, and total RNA was extracted using a Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher, USA). Expression of four osteogenesis-related genes (collagen type I [Col I], ALP, Runt-related transcription factor 2 [Runx2] and bone morphogenetic protein 2 [BMP2]) was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a CFX384 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA). Gene expression was analyzed using the DeltaDeltaCT method by being normalized with GAPDH. The primers used in this study are listed in Table S1.\n\n    Three sets of cell microsphere complexes were transferred into 24-well plates after 14 and 21 days of co-culture. After discarding the culture medium, they were washed twice with PBS solution. Next, 4% paraformaldehyde was added to the 24-well plates and fixed for 10 min. After discarding the fixation solution, it was washed three times with ultrapure water. Then, Alizarin Red Staining solution was added to the 24-well plates, stained at 37 C for 30 min, and washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, 10% cetylpyridinium chloride was added to 24-well plates and incubated at 25 C for 2 h. Finally, 90 mul of supernatant from each well was transferred to 96-well plates individually, and absorbance was measured at 562 nm. As for calcium mineralization mineral staining, the cell microsphere complexes, co-cultured for 14 days, were incubated with 10 muM calcium dye for 5 min and imaged using confocal microscopy. For Von Kossa staining, samples were fixed after being co-cultured for 21 days, incubated in 5% silver nitrate solution under UV light for 30 min, rinsed and treated with 5% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min. Calcium deposits appeared black or dark brown under microscope examination.\n\n    MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded onto the three groups of microspheres (PPM, PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL) at a density of 1 x 106 cells per 10 mg of microspheres. The cell-laden microspheres were cultured in a growth medium for 24 h to allow cell attachment. Subsequently, 10 mg of each type of cell-laden microsphere was mixed with 0.2 ml of Matrigel (Corning, USA) and subcutaneously injected into the dorsal region of 6-week-old nude mice. The Matrigel alone (Matrigel group) and Matrigel/cell integrated treatments (Matrigel+cell group) served as controls. Animal experiments were conducted under the approval of the ethical review committees of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University (approval number: 20240725-01).\n\n    The mice were euthanized 4-week post-implantation, and the implants were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (~4 mum thick) were prepared for histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to evaluate general tissue morphology and cell distribution. Masson's trichrome staining was used to assess collagen deposition and tissue organization. Alizarin Red S staining was conducted to visualize calcium deposition and mineralization. For immunohistochemical analysis, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to antigen retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies against Col I (1:400, Cell Signaling) and Runx2 (1:600, Affinity) overnight at 4 C. The sections were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using a 3,3'-diaminobenzidine substrate. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. All stained sections were scanned and imaged using a scanner (KFBio KF-PRO-120, China).\n\n    The results are expressed as mean+-SD and the significance of differences was analyzed by t-test. Differences were statistically significant at *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001. Statistical analyses and plots were performed using OriginPro or GraphPad Prism.",
        "Results": "    Particularly, open porous microspheres with the size of the microspheres at a range of 400 ~ 500 microm with pore size at ~20 microm, maintaining the exchange of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites, have a significant impact on cell proliferation and differentiation. To improve the inner connection, the ammonium bicarbonate was used as pore former typically, and it should be noted that variations in parameters, including ammonium bicarbonate concentration, homogenization rate, PLLA concentration, water-to-oil (W/O) ratio, could influence microspheres morphology, which were further investigated (Table S2).\n\n    To achieve the interconnectivity within PPM, ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) was introduced into the preparation system, and the results demonstrated that 1% NH4HCO3 could induce the uniform PPM with the average porous pore size at ~12 microm compared with 5% NH4HCO3 and 10% NH4HCO3 with the average porous pore size at ~9 and 8 microm, respectively (Figure S2A). Higher NH4HCO3 concentrations were associated with significant PPM inhomogeneity, as confirmed by SEM analysis (Figure 2A). We hypothesize that this inhomogeneity is due to reduced droplet viscosity at higher NH4HCO3 concentrations, which facilitates droplet coalescence during dichloromethane volatilization. Furthermore, an increased homogenization rate led to a decreased pore size of microspheres (Figure S1), this inverse relationship can be attributed to the enhanced shear forces at higher homogenization speeds, which effectively disperse the aqueous ammonium bicarbonate solution into progressively smaller droplets. These diminutive emulsion droplets subsequently give rise to constrained internal spatial structures within the microspheres. Notably, a homogenization rate of 5000 rpm for 2 min yielded microspheres with an average pore size of ~19 microm (Figure S2B). In addition, PLLA microsphere size decreased to ~205 microm at a PLLA concentration of 1% (Figure 2B), and the particle size of microspheres was similar both in 2.5% PLLA and 4% PLLA, but with a pore size at ~15 and ~9 microm, respectively (Figure S2C). The reduction in pore size may be attributed to the formation of a rapidly curing outer layer on the surface of the microspheres by the high concentration of PLLA. This outer layer restricts the diffusion of gases, allowing them to escape only from specific weak points. As for the water-to-oil (W/O) ratio, compared with the 1:2 and 1:4 groups with a decrease in pore size, the 1:3 group showed reproducible pore size (Figure 2C and Figure S2D). Such results revealed synthesis conditions in detail for producing the on-demand microspheres with tiny pores (<5 mum), medium pores (5-15 mum) and large pores (>15 mum) (Figure S3). Furthermore, the optimized conditions, a 1% NH4HCO3 concentration, a homogenization rate of 5000 rpm and a 2.5% PLLA with a 1:3 water-oil ratio, were used to prepare microspheres (pore size >15 microm) for subsequent studies including drug loading, in vitro and in vivo biomineralization regulation. Besides, FTIR analysis confirmed that the microfluidic process showed an ignorable influence on the PLLA material's chemical properties (Figure 2D). Notably, XRD analysis (Figure 2E) showed an improved crystal phase due to the volatilization-based crystallization, subsequently inducing improved thermal stability (Figure 2F), which was in accordance with the previous results.\n\n    To access the microstructure within PPM, the DiI was used to label PLLA for further CLSM characterization (Figure 3A), and the results exhibited an apparent porous structure within PPM with the average pore size at ~36 mum, which would be suitable for the following cell infiltration and proliferation. The 3D z-stack results further confirmed the highly interconnected microstructure within microspheres (Figure 3B), which further suggested the advantages of ammonium bicarbonate-based decomposition strategy for interconnected pore construction. These results indicated comprehensive conditions for porous PLLA microsphere preparations and the influences of the material's properties. It should be noted that no ingredient or chemical modification was introduced into the PLLA, further presenting a successful and facile strategy for reaching PPM.\n\n    To achieve cell microsphere composites for cell regulation, the PPM microspheres loaded with SIM or alone were modified by epsilon-PL using a NaOH-based hydrolysis approach. The influence of epsilon-PL concentrations (1, 3 and 5 mg/ml) on microsphere surface properties was investigated (Figure S4). To achieve an optimal balance between efficacy and cost-effectiveness, 3 mg/ml epsilon-PL (PPM-epsilon-PL(3)) was selected as the optimal formulation for subsequent experiments. Morphological characterization revealed that the epsilon-PL coating had almost negligible influence on the microspheres (PPM-epsilon-PL) compared with the PPM (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the SIM-loaded microspheres (PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL) depicted a similar morphology with PPM-epsilon-PL microspheres and PPM, and the average particle size and pore size at 454 and 17.27 mum (PPM), 444 and 16.66 mum (PPM-epsilon-PL), 441 and 17.51 mum (PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL), respectively (Figure 4A-C), indicating the SIM loading and epsilon-PL surface modification showed almost no influences to the preparation of microspheres. The IR spectra of PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL show an additional characteristic peak at 1560 cm-1, which belongs to the amide II (-NH-) band of epsilon-PL (Figure S5), demonstrating a successful modification of epsilon-PL onto PPM and PPM-SIM. A solid surface potential of PPM-epsilon-PL treated by different concentrations of epsilon-PL (1, 3 and 5 mg/ml) revealed that the average surface potentials were -40.1 mV for PPM, -31.0 mV for PPM-epsilon-PL(1), -26.5 mV for PPM-epsilon-PL(3) and -24.6 mV for PPM-epsilon-PL(5) (Figure S4), further confirming the successful adhesion of epsilon-PL to microsphere surfaces (PPM-epsilon-PL). To further verify the successful coating of epsilon-PL, elemental mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis were conducted on the microspheres (Figure 4D and E). Elemental mapping revealed a uniform distribution of nitrogen (N) elements within PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL samples, which was absent in unmodified PPM. At the same time, XPS analysis further corroborated these findings by exhibiting distinct N1s peaks in the spectra of PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL but not in PPM, reconfirming the success of epsilon-PL modification. In addition, the contact angle shifts from ~80  of PPM to ~65  of PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL (Figure 4F), indicating that the epsilon-PL modification could improve the material hydrophilia, which was essential for cell seeding and adhesion. Moreover, the microfluidic process presented a typical approach for SIM loading both at low (1 mg/ml) and high concentration (3 mg/ml), and the results revealed that even under a high concentration, it still maintained a high encapsulation efficiency at ~83.02% with the loading efficiency at ~8.89% (Figure 4G, PPM-SIM, 3 mg/ml). When loaded with a high concentration of SIM (3 mg/ml), there is a significant structure collapse of the microspheres (Figure S6). Therefore, the 1-mg/ml loaded microspheres would be used for following drug release tests and living materials construction. Besides, the epsilon-PL modification process almost showed ignorable influences for the loading and encapsulation efficiency (Figure 4G, PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL), and it exhibited a controlled drug-released pattern (Figure 4H). In addition, a 30-day degradation study was performed to evaluate the long-term stability of the microspheres (Figure 4I). All three microspheres showed gradual degradation over time, with PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL showing significantly higher degradation rates than PPM at day 30 (residual weights ~80% vs ~90%). The enhanced degradation of epsilon-PL coated microspheres can be attributed to the increased hydrophilicity, inducing a high water penetration and accelerating PLLA hydrolysis. Notably, the incorporation of SIM did not significantly alter the degradation profile. These results indicate the controlled degradation of the microspheres, suggesting their potential suitability for long-term sustained-release applications.\n\n    The antimicrobial properties of microspheres were evaluated against S. aureus and E. coli over 12 h (Figure S7). It demonstrated that the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL showed significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus with an inhibition rate of ~40% at 12 h. In contrast, PPM-epsilon-PL exhibited slight antibacterial effects with inhibition to ~10% at 12 h, and the PPM alone had insignificant antibacterial efficacy. These results indicate that the incorporation of SIM conferred effective activity against S. aureus, suggesting that the microsphere system demonstrated great potential for antibacterial.\n\n    Given the success of functional modification of PPM, osteoblast-osteocyte shift-based biomineralization was used as the typical model for PPM-based living materials construction and cell regulation. Briefly, to achieve the cell-microsphere living composites, the 5-ml centrifuge tubes and 24-well plates were treated with an anti-adhesive solution, and subsequently, microspheres were added into the tube followed by adding MC3T3-E1 suspension (5 x 106 cells/ml), and the mix was continued for 2 h incubation (37 C, 5% CO2). Then, the unattached cells were removed using a 70-mum filter, and the cell-material composites were transferred to 24-well plates for further cultivation (Figure 5A). Viewed from the SEM, the cells in the PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL groups exhibited normal spreading compared with the cells in the PPM group (Figure S8), indicating the advantage of epsilon-PL modification for cell adhesion. Moreover, the viability of cells within microsphere groups was evaluated using live/dead staining at 1, 3 and 5 days. The results indicated that the PPM-epsilon-PL and PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL groups showed significant cell proliferation compared with the PPM alone group (Figure 5B; Figures S9 and S10). Besides, the cell viability at ~95% under microsphere extracts further confirmed the biocompatibility of all microspheres (Figure 5C and D). These results indicated a brief method of implanting cells into microspheres, inducing cell adhesion and proliferation, and then achieving osteoblast-based living materials.\n\n    Building the connection with the surrounding microenvironment was the typical feature of the living materials. To gain further insight into the proliferative behavior of MC3T3-E1 cells, cell-microsphere complexes were cultured in 24-well plates, with cell migration and proliferation monitored via microscopy. Microscopy and confocal imaging confirmed similar initial cell attachment across all microsphere groups (Figure S11). Through timed monitoring, osteoblasts spreading from the microspheres to the surrounding area were observed, involving cell proliferation and migration. It should be noted that cell-microsphere complexes were firmly fixed on the seeding location by the cell migration and proliferation-induced connection between the microspheres and the petri dish (Figure 6A). Quantitative analysis revealed that the area occupied by cells on the dish in the epsilon-PL modified microsphere group reached 29.96% at 24 h and 78.87% at 48 h, compared with only 6.69% and 33.1% in the PPM group at the same time points, respectively (Figure 6B). This rapid cell spreading provided a living and quick connection between the microspheres and surrounding microenvironments (Figure 6C). These results suggest that the epsilon-PL modification enhances cell proliferation and the ability of cells to spread from the microspheres, facilitating connections with the surrounding environment. This behavior indicates that these cell-microsphere complexes can be considered dynamic living materials capable of rapid environmental interactions.\n\n    Given the success of living materials construction, the regulation of MC3T3-E1 within living materials was further detected. At a 5-day culture of the osteoblast-microsphere complexes, the osteogenic medium was used for a substitutional culture, followed by the investigation of cell differentiation and mineralization. The ALP, a key indicator of early osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, was assessed at day 14, and the results revealed that the ALP expression within the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group increased significantly than that of the PPM and PPM-epsilon-PL group (Figure 7A and B). Moreover, regarding the influences of culture duration on osteogenic differentiation, we further extended culture time to 21 days to assess late osteogenic mineralization. Alizarin Red S staining at 14 and 21 days revealed a time-dependent increase in mineralization, and the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group exhibited noticeable calcium deposition levels at both times, with higher improvements by day 21 (Figure 7C and D; Figure S12). Additionally, Von Kossa staining performed on day 21 further reconfirmed the extensive mineralization in the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group (Figure S13).\n\n    To further elucidate the mechanism during the osteogenic differentiation, the expression of osteogenesis-related genes (Col I, ALP, Runx2 and BMP2) of the cell-microsphere complexes in groups was examined by quantitative PCR. After 14 days of osteogenic induction, compared with PPM and PPM-epsilon-PL groups, the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group exhibited significantly higher expression levels of all four genes, indicating a robust enhancement of osteogenic differentiation (Figure 7E). Moreover, the PPM-epsilon-PL group demonstrated significantly elevated expression levels relative to the PPM group, suggesting a positive effect of the epsilon-PL coating on osteogenic gene expression. These findings corroborated the potent promoting effect of SIM on osteogenic differentiation, further presenting synergistic osteogenic effects of epsilon-PL. The increased osteogenic markers demonstrated an improved MC3T3-E1 regulation via PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL, indicating the success of osteogenic differentiation at a molecular level.\n\n    After 14 days of co-culture, compared with PPM and PPM-epsilon-PL groups, the deep purple of H&E results within the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group indicated a significantly increased mineralization density (Figure 8A). Moreover, SEM and Ca element analysis demonstrated the typical cell matrix mineralization (Figure 8B-D), similar to the process in vivo, presenting a mimicry way of regulating osteocyte mineralization ex vivo. Furthermore, the presence of calcium phosphate deposition in the SIM-loaded composites was confirmed by the peaks spitting at 564 and 604 cm-1 in the infrared spectra (Figure S14A and B) and material weight loss rate in the TGA (Figure S14C). Then, calcein, as a typical fluorescent dye binding to calcium mineral, was utilized to evaluate density mineralization, and the fluorescence intensity of calcium within PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL microspheres improved significantly than that of the other two groups (Figure 8E, Figure S15), which was consistent with the Alizarin Red Staining (Figure 7C). These achievements accelerated the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL for MC3T3-E1 proliferation and functional regulation by releasing SIM, indicating the success of osteoblast-osteocyte shift regulation and mineralization at a microtissue level, presenting a promising boost osteoblast mineralization model by cell-microspheres integration, which would be of great potential for further bone regeneration.\n\n    To verify that PPM had application potential in minimally invasive injection and bone repair, subcutaneous injection and assessment of osteogenic ability were performed (Figure 9A). Four-week post-injection, the implantation sites were examined optically (Figure 9B). All groups have no visible inflammatory responses, indicating the biocompatibility of microsphere complexes. Moreover, histological and immunohistochemical analyses of the implants further revealed cell differentiation and ossification (Figure 9C). H&E staining showed that the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group had the most abundant cell proliferation and tissue formation compared with the PPM and PPM-epsilon-PL groups. Masson's trichrome staining demonstrated markedly enhanced collagen deposition in the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group, indicative of advanced extracellular matrix formation. Further, the calcium mineralization by Alizarin Red S staining revealed its great potential for osteogenesis of the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group, reconfirming its robust mineralization regulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of Col I and Runx2 further corroborated these findings. The PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL group exhibited more Col I and Runx2 expression, typically demonstrating a boosted mineralization process. The incorporation of SIM demonstrated a crucial role in promoting osteogenesis, while the epsilon-PL coating alone did not confer significant additional benefits over uncoated PLLA microspheres in this subcutaneous model. Collectively, these results indicated that the PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL microspheres possess superior osteogenic potential in vivo, significantly enhancing ossification compared with other groups.",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, microfluidic technology was employed to develop porous PLLA microspheres, and the impact of diverse preparation parameters on the microspheres' morphology was meticulously examined. Subsequently, 1% NH4HCO3 concentration with a homogenization rate of 5000 rpm and 2.5% PLLA with a 1:3 water-oil ratio was conducted on large-pore microspheres (>15 mum). The rationally designed porous PLLA microspheres were subsequently employed to culture MC3T3-E1 cells. This facilitated enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation and further regulated their biomineralization process in vitro and in vivo, forming the cell-material living composites. More importantly, osteoblast-based PPM-SIM-epsilon-PL living materials could improve osteocyte differentiation, accelerating the following osteogenesis and mineralization regulation in vitro and in vivo, boosting osteoblast mineralization by osteoblast-microspheres integration at the microtissue level, which presented an alternative ex vivo model involving osteocyte mineralization in situ, further indicating the success of cell-based living materials construction at microtissue levels.",

        "Title": "    An elevational gradient in floral traits and pollinator assemblages in the Neotropical species Costus guanaiensis var. tarmicus in Peru",
        "Abstract": "    Different populations of plant species can adapt to their local pollinators and diverge in floral traits accordingly. Floral traits are subject to pollinator-driven natural selection to enhance plant reproductive success. Studies on temperate plant systems have shown pollinator-driven selection results in floral trait variation along elevational gradients, but studies in tropical systems are lacking. We analyzed floral traits and pollinator assemblages in the Neotropical bee-pollinated taxon Costus guanaiensis var. tarmicus across four sites along a steep elevational gradient in Peru. We found variations in floral traits of size, color, and reward, and in the pollinator assemblage along the elevational gradient. We examined our results considering two hypotheses, (1) local adaptation to different bee assemblages, and (2) the early stages of an evolutionary shift to a new pollinator functional group (hummingbirds). We found some evidence consistent with the adaptation of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus to the local bee fauna along the studied elevational gradient. Corolla width across sites was associated with bee thorax width of the local most frequent pollinator. However, we could not rule out the possibility of the beginning of a bee-to-hummingbird pollination shift in the highest-studied site. Our study is one of the few geographic-scale analyses of floral trait and pollinator assemblage variation in tropical plant species. Our results broaden our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions beyond temperate systems by showing substantial intraspecific divergence in both floral traits and pollinator assemblages across geographic space in a tropical plant species.\n\n    We analyzed floral traits and pollinator assemblages in the Neotropical species Costus guanaiensis var. tarmicus along a steep elevational gradient in Peru.

        "Introduction": "    Floral traits are evolutionarily labile and subject to pollinator-driven natural selection (Armbruster, ; Carr & Fenster, ). Selection often changes floral traits in a way that enhances plant reproduction by increasing attraction and reward traits for pollinators, resulting in higher visitation rates, and by shaping traits in a way that improves the pollinator-flower fit, resulting in higher pollination efficiency (Stebbins, ). Thus, different plant populations of the same species adapt to local pollinators and diverge in floral traits accordingly (Anderson et al., ; Anderson & Johnson, ; Galen, ; Johnson & Steiner, ; Maad et al., ; Medel et al., ; Nattero et al., ; Newman et al., ; Thompson, ). Understanding floral adaptation to pollinators can provide insight into major evolutionary processes involved in angiosperm diversification, such as pollination shifts (Kay & Sargent, ).\n\n    Different populations of plants occurring along elevational gradients can exhibit floral phenotypic variation mediated by pollinator selection (Galen, ; Maad et al., ; Nattero et al., ; Zhao & Wang, ). Studies of multiple bee-pollinated species found an increase in flower size with elevation (Galen, ; Maad et al., ; Malo & Baonza, ). Similarly, bee community composition can change with elevation, resulting in an increase in the mean body size in the community (Hoiss et al., ; Malo & Baonza, ). Research on the association between floral traits and bees' pollinator assemblages concluded that selection drives the increase of flower size along elevational gradients to improve the fit of bigger pollinators with the floral reproductive structures (Galen, ; Maad et al., ). Changes in pollinator assemblages can result in rapid floral trait divergence over a single generation (Galen, ) or even from one year to the next one (Schemske & Horvitz, ). To date, however, few studies have focused on floral traits and pollinator assemblages variation within species along elevational gradients and even fewer studies have been conducted in tropical areas (but see Dellinger et al.,  for a study focused on bee-to-hummingbird pollination shifts; and Klomberg et al.,  and Nattero et al.,  for studies on geographic floral trait variation without pollination shifts). It is imperative to devote efforts to existing research programs on tropical species, such as species in the Neotropical spiral gingers (genus Costus, reviewed in Moreira-Hernandez & Muchhala, , and Thomson & Wilson, ), for a comprehensive understanding of pollination shifts across temperate and tropical systems (Thomson & Wilson, ).\n\n    Bee diversity and abundance decrease with elevation in both temperate and tropical areas, (Arroyo et al., ; Hoiss et al., ). In contrast, vertebrate pollinators, such as hummingbirds, can inhabit a wider elevational range than bees and perform well as pollinators. For instance, in rainy conditions at high elevations in Mexico, bird-pollinated plants were more effectively pollinated than closely related bee-pollinated plants (Cruden, ). The abundance and diversity of hummingbirds are higher in tropical versus temperate areas (Greenwalt, ). Thus, it is more likely that in the tropics, pollinator assemblages at high-elevation sites might include the presence of hummingbirds as pollinators, in addition to larger bee pollinators. There is however little empirical evidence regarding environmental factors, such as those associated with elevation (Thomson & Wilson, ), driving specific changes in pollinator assemblage from bees to hummingbirds (but see Dellinger et al., ), or from bees to a mixed pollinator assemblage.\n\n    Costus (Costaceae), a species-rich genus of herbaceous plants, has several Neotropical species pollinated either by orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) or hermit hummingbirds (Phaethornithinae, Kay & Schemske, ). Bee- and hummingbird-pollinated species have different suites of floral traits (Kay & Grossenbacher, ). Bee-pollinated species generally have long, wide, and pale flowers, and a large petaloid labellum colored with two thick yellow lines that presumably act as nectar guides. In contrast, hummingbird-pollinated species have short, narrow, and brightly colored flowers with a reduced labellum (Kay & Grossenbacher, ). Flowers of Costus guanaiensis var. tarmicus seem to differ in visual floral traits among sites distributed along an elevational gradient from the Amazonian basin to the Andes mountains in Peru (up to 2000 meters above sea level [m a.s.l.]). These observations and the broad elevational distribution of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus offer a natural setup to study floral divergence across a tropical elevational gradient. We addressed the following questions: (1) Do floral traits vary among sites along an elevational gradient? (2) Do pollinator assemblages vary among sites along an elevational gradient? and (3) Is the pollinator assemblage variation associated with floral trait variation? To answer these questions, we conducted an analysis of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus floral traits (size, color, and reward) and its pollinator assemblages at four sites along a 1000 m elevational gradient in Peru.\n\n    We had two hypotheses about how floral traits and pollinator assemblages of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus might vary with elevation. First, if C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus is adapted to pollination by the local bee fauna (local bee adaptation hypothesis), we expected that the floral traits and pollinator assemblages would covary among sites. Given that there may be fewer bees in the highest site, and thus, a lower bee visitation rate compared to lower sites, attraction traits might be exaggerated there; for instance, the yellow lines (nectar guides) in the labellum would cover a wider area and the nectar sugar concentration would be greater at the high site compared to lower sites. Pollinator assemblages at all sites would comprise orchid bees, but the highest elevation site might receive visits from bigger bee species than those at lower elevation sites (Bishop & Armbruster, ; Galen, ; Maad et al., ). If so, we expect that the highest elevation site would have bigger flowers than lower elevation sites.\n\n    Alternatively, if in the high elevation site, C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus is not only adapted to the local bee fauna but also to hummingbird pollination (pollinator shift hypothesis), we expect that the floral traits would vary with elevation, as we explained in the previous hypothesis, but that the floral traits at the highest site would include traits that deter bees and attract or fit hummingbirds. Thus, we would not detect a flower and bee morphology correlation along the elevational gradient. For example, for a better hummingbird-flower fit, the flowers at the highest site would be the shortest to allow hummingbirds to reach the nectar and the narrowest to improve pollen transfer. To deter the bees, the flowers at the highest site would have thinner or absent yellow lines (nectar guides) on the labellum. In addition, the nectar sugar concentration would be the lowest at the highest site, matching similar levels to known hummingbird flower sources (Baker, ; Bolten & Feinsinger, ). A dilute nectar would deter bees by reducing their sugar intake rate (Cnaani et al., ; Harder, ; Heinrich, ). Pollinator assemblages at the highest site would comprise orchid bees and hummingbirds, but with the lowest bee visitation rate and the highest hummingbird visitation rate compared to lower sites.",
        "Methods": "    Costaceae is a family of monocots native to tropical climates of Central America, South America, Asia, and Africa (Maas, ). The studied species belongs to the Neotropical Costus clade with species distributed from Mexico to Brazil, encompassing the Andes mountainous regions, with species present in low- to mid-elevation (0-2000 m a.s.l.; Maas, ; Vargas et al., ). Costus typically produce a single nectar-rich flower per plant per day, and pollinators are thought to travel on traplines between widely spaced plants. Bee pollination is ancestral in the Neotropical clade, but there have been at least 11 independent shifts to hummingbird pollination (Kay & Grossenbacher, ; Vargas et al., ), motivating the hypothesis that geographic divergence in floral traits might be associated with adaptation to hummingbirds.\n\n    Costus guanaiensis is a polyphyletic species with multiple named varieties (Maas, ; Vargas et al., ). Here we focus solely on the taxon C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus. Costus guanaiensis var. tarmicus ranges from 250 to 2000 m a.s.l. in the Peruvian Amazon and Andes (www.tropicos.org). There are no previous studies on the pollination biology of this specific taxon, although there are records of orchid bees pollinating C. guanaiensis var. macrostobilus (Schemske, ; Sytsma & Pippen, ). The common name of these plants in Central and South America is \"cana agria,\" due to their resemblance with sugar cane plants (Maas, ).\n\n    We reviewed herbaria collections (CUZ, HOXA, HUNMSM, MOBOT) of C. guanaiensis to locate populations of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus in different elevations, in areas of relatively easy access by terrestrial routes and close to research stations or towns. We sampled C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus at four sites during its flowering season (November-February, rainy season in the Amazon) in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. The sites are in the following areas and elevations: (1) surroundings of Iscozacin town between 280 and 350 m a.s.l. (low elevation site, hereafter Iscozacin_L), (2) Reserva Comunal Yanesha between 300 and 400 m a.s.l. (low elevation site, hereafter Yanesha_L), (3) Bosque de Proteccion San Matias San Carlos between 500 and 700 m a.s.l. (middle elevation site, hereafter Sanmatias_M), (4) Parque Nacional Yanachaga Chemillen between 1000 and 1200 m a.s.l. (high elevation site, hereafter Yanachaga_H). During the 2019-2020 sampling season, we worked at sites Yanesha_L, Sanmatias_M, and Yanachaga_H but concluded that the logistics of working at Yanesha_L were too complicated to go back to the following sampling season. Then, we decided to sample the Iscozacin_L site during 2020-2021 because we found a population of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus there (not reported in the herbaria) more easily accessible than Yanesha_L. For the analysis, we decided to keep all four sites due to habitat conservation differences between the two low sites. All the sites are in the Department of Pasco on the eastern side of the Andes and western Amazonia in central Peru (Figure 1).\n\n    We measured flower size, color corresponding to the nectar guides area, and nectar sugar concentration to quantify variation in floral traits among sites. We collected 9-11 flowers at each site to analyze flower size. In the morning, we searched for fresh flowers, removed them from the plants, and transported them in 50 mL thick plastic tubes to the research station/hotel, where we had a photography station set up. If any flower withered or damaged during the transportation, we did not use it for photos and waited to collect new flowers the next day. We took pictures of the flowers standing in molding clay to achieve a straight axis parallel to the camera. We took pictures of the frontal, lateral, and internal faces of each flower next to a ruler. From the pictures, we measured (in mm) 12 different floral traits using ImageJ (Rasband, ). From the frontal view, we measured labellum length, labellum width, and corolla width. From the lateral view, we measured labellum length, corolla length, and corolla width. From the internal view, we measured petaloid stamen length (measured above the stigma), internal and horizontal labellum width, internal and diagonal labellum width, the distance between the anthers and the labellum, the distance between the anthers and the corolla base, and corolla tube length (see Appendix 1 for floral traits reference).\n\n    We performed a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on floral traits measurements using the prcomp function in R (R Core Team, ). To assess if the floral traits differ among the sites, we applied a PERMANOVA followed by multiple pairwise comparison tests using the functions adonis (Thioulouse et al., ) and pairwise.adonis (Martinez Arbizu, ) from the package \"vegan,\" respectively. Also, we assessed how the flowers vary specifically in length and width. To compare the floral length, we applied ANOVA tests to the frontal and lateral measurements of labellum length and the lateral measurement of corolla length. For the floral width, we applied ANOVA tests to the frontal and lateral measurements of the corolla width. Following ANOVAs, we analyzed pairwise comparisons using the post hoc test function TukeyHSD.\n\n    To quantify the colors corresponding to the nectar guides area, we took pictures of five flowers from Iscozacin_L, Sanmatias_M, and Yanachaga_H sites in 2021. We could not take pictures of Yanesha_L flowers due to the site's inaccessibility during our second sampling season. We took pictures of the top part of the floral labellum. We placed the flower next to a Spyderckr color card that served as the gray standard. We used a Sony Alpha R7 full spectrum converted camera, a UV transmission lens model Nikon EL-Nikkor 80mm f5.6, a visible-spectrum-pass filter (UV/IR Cut Hot Mirror 39 mm lens filter, Kolari Vision, US), and a UV-pass filter (UV Bandpass 39 mm lens filter, Kolari Vision, US). We took pictures under natural daylight between 1000 and 1200 h, avoiding moments when clouds were covering direct sunlight. We took several pictures with each filter varying the exposure levels to select the best shot for the analysis. We assessed the nectar guides area on the labellum using the MicaToolbox plugin (Troscianko & Stevens, ) in ImageJ.\n\n    First, we generated a multispectral image using one flower picture taken with the visible-spectrum-pass filter and one taken with the UV-pass filter. Then, we converted the multispectral image to a honeybee cone catch image (using the cone catch model available in the MicaToolbox software). Next, we acquired a presentation image for human vision from which we can distinguish colors seen by bees but not humans. These colors include the UV reflectance ones that we assumed corresponded to the flower's nectar guides. In the image, they appeared in dark pink-purple colors. We converted this image to RGB colors and saved it as a jpeg image. Then, we converted the jpeg image to an 8-bit color type with 256 colors (maximum number available). By doing so, we aimed to better define the different color areas, especially those with dark pink-purple colors. Next, we converted the generated image to an 8-bit grayscale type to measure the dark pink-purple nectar guides area using the threshold settings. Then, we adjusted the threshold levels to identify the pixels corresponding to the nectar guides area. Finally, we used the measure command to get the nectar guides fraction area on the labellum (as the percentage area occupied on the labellum, see Appendix 2 for examples of the image processing). We compared the nectar guides fraction area among sites with a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a post hoc Dunn's test (due to the small sample size) for pairwise comparisons.\n\n    To quantify nectar sugar concentration, we collected nectar from 10 to 13 fresh flowers per site, between 0700 and 1030 h, using a capillary tube. The flowers we used were bagged the previous afternoon to avoid floral visitors taking the nectar before us. We placed a drop of the nectar in a refractometer (Eclipse refractometer, Bellingham + Stanley, UK) to record the sugar concentration in degrees Brix. We compared nectar sugar concentration among sites with an ANOVA test followed by Tukey's post hoc comparisons.\n\n    We recorded pollinators visiting the flowers of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus. We placed cameras with motion detection systems next to the inflorescence for 1-10 h per day. We used Canon Powershot SX530 cameras with the Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK Development Team, ) installed in the SD card to enable the motion detection feature in the camera. The number of inflorescences and hours recorded varied among sites (Table 1) depending on the number of plants with flowers available and the number of days that we worked at each site. Our sample unit was each plant-day combination. We recorded pollinator activity for up to 21 days at Iscozacin_L, Sanmatias_M, and Yanachaga_H. At Yanesha_L, we only recorded the flowers for 4 days due to site inaccessibility in our second sampling season. We watched the videos to record floral visitors and identify those that contacted reproductive organs (legitimate visits), thus acting as pollinators.\n\n    To facilitate the identification of orchid bees in our videos, we caught orchid bees with entomological nets between 0900 and 1600 h for 3 days at each site. We always caught the orchid bees after we finished recording their pollination activity on the Costus flowers so that we did not interfere with their activity. We used pure chemical attractants eugenol, cineol, methyl salicylate, and benzyl acetate to attract them. We applied 0.10 mL of attractant to a cotton ball every half hour, and we used one cotton ball per attractant. We suspended the cotton balls at 1.50 m from the ground, 2 m apart among attractants. The captured individuals were euthanized and preserved with 70% ethanol for later identification in the Entomology Laboratory of the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del Cusco, Peru, using a stereoscope (NOVEL NSZ-608T). For the determination of the specimens, we used the terminology and taxonomic keys proposed by Dressler , Bonilla-Gomez and Nates-Parra , and Michener . We tried to determine the orchid bee in our videos to species level when possible.\n\n    From our videos, we counted how many visits an inflorescence received and divided this number by the number of flowers present (visits per flower); then, we divided the visits per flower by the number of hours recorded to estimate the pollinator visitation rate per hour (hereafter visitation rate). We estimated the pollinator visitation rate at different taxonomic levels, such as family (Apidae and Trochilidae or pollinator group), and species or morphotypes. Moreover, we categorized bees into three groups based on their size, small (Euglossa spp), medium (Eulaema cf mocsaryi, Eulaema cf polychroma, Eulaema sp.), and big (Eulaema cf bombiformis, Eufriesea cf ornata), to estimate visitation rate by bee size. We decided to exclude the species Aglae caerulea from the big-size bee group because it belongs to a different genus which is known to have ecological differences with species of the genus Eulaema (Roubik & Hanson, ) and we only recorded three visits of A. caerulea at Yanachaga_H site. We also constructed a standardized variable called pollinator morphotype abundance to compare pollinator assemblages among sites. This was calculated by dividing the visits per flower of each pollinator by the total number of pollinators visits at each site.\n\n    For the statistical analysis, we first compared the visitation rate of each pollinator group (bees separately from hummingbirds) among sites with a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, and a pairwise Wilcoxon post hoc test. Second, we compared the visitation rate of different orchid bee sizes among sites with a Kruskal-Wallis test and a pairwise Wilcoxon post hoc test. The visitation rate of big-sized orchid bees was mostly zero in mid and low sites, then, for the Wilcoxon test, we indicated the alternative hypothesis of \"less\" for the group that had all or almost all zero values. Third, we compared the bee visitation rate by size within each site by applying the Kruskal-Wallis and the post hoc pairwise Wilcoxon tests. Fourth, we used the pollinator morphotype abundance to perform a Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) using the metaMDS function in the package \"vegan\" (Oksanen et al., ). We applied a PERMANOVA and a multiple pairwise comparison test, to assess if pollinator assemblages differ among sites. Also, we ran a Simper analysis using the function simper from the package \"vegan\" to identify the pollinator morphotypes from each site that contributed to the dissimilarity with the other sites. Finally, from the bee sampling, we estimated orchid bee relative abundance in the different sites to evaluate if the orchid bee abundance changes along the elevational gradient. We applied a Kruskal-Wallis test and the post hoc Dunn's test (due to small and unequal sample size among the sites).\n\n    In addition, we carried out a survey of hummingbirds in the sites Iscozacin_L, Sanmatias_M, and Yanachaga_H during the 2020-2021 season. We conducted four walk transects of 1 km in each site and recorded the hummingbird species by observations (using binoculars) or songs. We looked up the bill length of the recorded hummingbird species in the literature (Hilty, ; Meyer et al., ; Schulenberg et al., ) to assess if they could reach the nectar of the flowers of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus in the different sites. We considered hummingbird species that conducted a legitime visit to the flowers as having long enough bill length to reach the nectar of the flowers. We aimed to identify if there were other species with similar bill length in the sampled sites.\n\n    We determined whether floral size traits correlated with orchid bee body traits to evaluate if the different floral phenotypes were associated with the pollinator sizes. We chose the bee species with the highest visitation rate within each site to take the bee body measurements, assuming that the species most likely effecting the highest selection pressure on the floral traits would be the most frequent pollinator (Stebbins, ). We selected the species Euglossa imperialis in Iscozacin_L, Euglossa intersecta in Yanesha_L, Eulaema mocsaryi in Sanmatias_M, and Eulaema bombiformis in Yanachaga_H. We measured the bee thorax width and height, and the bee tongue (proboscis) length from 5 to 10 individuals of each orchid bee species. Using the mean of each variable, we applied Pearson's correlation between the following bee and flower traits, bee thorax width and the frontal corolla width, bee thorax height and the lateral corolla width, bee tongue length and corolla tube length (or the functional floral length that interacts with the bee's tongue), and bee tongue length and the distance between the anthers and the corolla base. We also conducted a bootstrap resampling from our empirical bee body measurements with replacement to pair each individual plant measurement with an individual bee measurement per site, thus, incorporating variation in each trait. We repeated the resampling for 1000 times and applied a Pearson's correlation to each originated dataset.",
        "Results": "    We found that floral traits varied among sites. Flower size and nectar sugar concentration differed among two or more sites. The PCA using 12 floral trait measurements of size from four sites of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus showed that PC1 captures 43.7% of the variation and PC2 captures 18.8%. Labellum and corolla length traits most correlated to PC1, whereas the lateral corolla width and the internal and diagonal labellum width most correlated to PC2. Grouping of flowers by site explains 34% of the floral size variation and this may be mainly driven by flower length traits (Figure 2a). The PERMANOVA test showed a significant difference in flower size among sites (F = 6.17, R 2 = .34, p = .001) and the multiple pairwise comparisons showed a significant difference in flower size between all site pairs (p < .05), except for Sanmatias_M:Yanesha_L and Yanachaga_H:Iscozacin_L.\n\n    The ANOVA test comparing the frontal measurements of the labellum length showed a significant difference among sites (F = 5.88, p = .002, Figure 2b) and Tukey's post hoc test showed a significant difference between the pairs Yanesha_L:Iscozacin_L, Sanmatias_M:Iscozacin_L and Sanmatias_M:Yanachaga_H (p < .05). The ANOVA test comparing the lateral measurements of the labellum length showed a significant difference among sites (F = 6.49, p = .001, Figure 2b) and Tukey's post hoc test showed a significant difference between the pairs Sanmatias_M:Iscozacin_L and Sanmatias_M:Yanachaga_H (p < .05). The ANOVA test comparing the lateral measurements of the corolla length showed a significant difference among sites (F = 21.89, p < .001, Figure 2b) and Tukey's post hoc test showed a significant difference between the pairs Yanesha_L:Iscozacin_L, Sanmatias_M:Iscozacin_L, Yanesha_L:Yanachaga_H and Sanmatias_M:Yanachaga_H (p < .05). Thus, we inferred that, Sanmatias_M has the largest flowers, Yanesha_L has intermediate flower length, and the other two sites have the shortest flowers. The ANOVA test comparing the frontal measurement of the corolla width showed a significant difference among sites (F = 5.41, p = .004, Figure 2c) and Tukey's post hoc test showed a significant difference between the pairs Sanmatias_M:Iscozacin_L and Sanmatias_M:Yanachaga_H (p < .05). The ANOVA test comparing the lateral measurement of the corolla width also showed a significant difference among sites (F = 7.04, p < .001, Figure 2c), the Tukey's post hoc test showed a significant difference between the pairs Sanmatias_M:Iscozacin_L, Yanachaga_H:Iscozacin_L, Sanmatias_M:Yanesha_L and Yanachaga_H:Yanesha_L. Thus, we inferred that, Sanmatias_M and Yanachaga_H have the widest flowers, whereas Iscozacin_L and Yanesha_L have the narrowest ones.\n\n    We found variation in nectar guides fraction area among sites (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 11.02, df = 2, p = .004). Dunn's test revealed that Yanachaga_H was significantly different than Sanmatias_M (p = .002) and Iscozacin_L (p = .05). But the latter two did not differ between them. Thus, the nectar guides fraction area was the smallest in Yanachaga_H (x = 0.37%, SD +- 0.83, Figure 3a). Similarly, we found variation in nectar sugar concentration among sites (ANOVA, F = 6.47, p < .001). The Tukey's post hoc test showed that Yanachaga_H was significantly different from the other three sites (p < .05). Thus, Yanachaga_H had the lowest nectar sugar concentration (x = 38.9 B, SD +- 1.4), whereas the other three sites had similar levels of nectar sugar concentration (Figure 3b).\n\n    We video-recorded a total of 1192 h of pollinator activity on the flowers of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus. The flowers were visited by bees and hummingbirds (Table 1). We recorded orchid bees from four genera pollinating the flowers. By contrasting the video images with our orchid bee collection, we identified the following species pollinating the flowers, Euglossa cf imperialis, Euglossa intersecta, Euglossa cf magnipes, Euglossa cf mixta, Eulaema cf cingulata, Eulaema cf mocsaryi, Eulaema cf polychroma, Aglae caerulea. There were some individuals that we could not identify at the species level, which we recorded as Euglossa sp., Eulaema sp., and a morphotype composed of Eulaema bombiformis and Eufriesea ornata. In addition, there were a few legitimate visits by a bumble bee (Bombus sp.) and a stingless bee (Melipona sp.). Also, there were some legitimate visits from hummingbirds, mainly from the green hermit Phaethornis guy, and only one visit from the great-billed hermit Phaethornis malaris.\n\n    We caught orchid bees from the genera Euglossa, Eulaema, Eufriesea, and Exaerete. We found a significant difference in orchid bees' relative abundance among the sites (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 8.48, df = 3, p = .047), and Dunn's test revealed that Yanachaga_H had a lower bee abundance than Yanesha_L (p = .026). We recorded 21 species of hummingbirds in our survey (9 in Iscozacin_L, 9 in Sanmatias_M, and 11 in Yanachaga_H, see Appendix 3 for the complete list of species recorded in each site). The species with the longest bill were Phaethornis guy (40 mm, Schulenberg et al., ) in Yanachaga_H, and Phaethornis malaris (45 mm, Meyer et al., ) in Sanmatias_M and Iscozacin_L, corresponding to the same species that visited the flowers of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus. The species with the next longest bill reached 34 mm.\n\n    Orchid bee visitation rate differed among sites (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 28.224, df = 3, p < .001), with Yanesha_L having the highest bee visitation rate (x = 3.13, SD +- 3.18, pairwise Wilcoxon tests between Yanesha_L and each of the other sites, p < .001). The bee visitation rate among the other three sites did not differ. Similarly, we found a significant difference in hummingbird visitation rate among sites (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 10.687, df = 3, p = .01); Yanachaga_H had the highest hummingbird visitation rate (x = 0.03, SD +- 0.15; Wilcoxon test between Yanachaga_H and each of the other sites, p <= .05). However, the hummingbird visitation rate is only approximately 7% of the bee visitation rate in Yanachaga_H (Table 1).\n\n    We compared the visitation rates of small, medium, and big-sized orchid bees among sites (Figure 4a). We found a significant difference among sites for small-sized bees (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 87.746, df = 3, p < .001), and the pairwise Wilcoxon test showed a significant difference between all site pairs (p < .01), resulting in a decrease of visitation rate of small-size bees in the following order, Yanesha_L, Iscozacin_L, Sanmatias_M, and Yanachaga_H. There was also a significant difference in visitation rate for medium-sized bees (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 29.304, df = 3, p < .001), the pairwise Wilcoxon test showed that the visitation rate of medium-sized bees is higher in Iscozacin_L and Sanmatias_M than in the other two sites (p <= .01). Finally, there was a significant difference in visitation rate for big-sized bees (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 34.497, df = 3, p < .001). The visitation rate of big-sized bees was higher in Yanachaga_H (pairwise Wilcoxon tests comparing Yanachaga_H with each of the other sites p < .05), and decreases in the following order, Yanesha_L, Sanmatias_M, and Iscozacin_L. In addition, comparing the visitation rate by bee size within sites we found that in both low sites, Iscozacin_L and Yanesha_L, small-sized bees had the highest visitation rate; in the mid site, Sanmatias_M, medium-sized bees had the highest visitation rate, and in the high site, Yanachaga_H, big-sized bees had the highest visitation rate (Table 2). Thus, the highest site is mainly pollinated by big-sized bees, the mid site by medium-sized bees, and the low sites by small-sized bees.\n\n    Finally, the PERMANOVA test showed a significant difference between the sites based on the NMDS projection of the pollinator morphotypes' abundance (F = 7, R 2 = .08, p = .001, Figure 4b). The multiple pairwise comparisons showed a significant difference between all the pairs (p < .01). The Simper analysis showed that Euglossa cf imperialis differentiated the Iscozacin_L pollinator assemblage from the rest (contributing between 20.5% and 30.1% to the dissimilarity), Euglossa intersecta in Yanesha_L (contributing between 56.3% and 64.3%), Eulaema cf mocsary in Sanmatias_M (contributing between 18.1% and 38.5%), and the compound morphotype of Eulaema bombiformis and Eufriesea ornata in Yanachaga_H (contributing between 16% and 30.8%) Thus, the pollinator assemblages differed among sites by the presence of hummingbirds and because there were different orchid bees assemblages at each site.\n\n    We tested if floral traits and bee traits covaried using Pearson's correlation test. We found a non-significant correlation between our site-averaged variables, as expected with four sites. The correlation between the bee body size traits and the floral width traits showed positive correlation coefficients higher than .75 (Figure 5a,b), whereas the correlation between the tongue length and the corolla tube length, and the tongue length and the distance between the anthers and the corolla base showed a negative correlation coefficient lower than .4 (Figure 5c). After bootstrap resampling and repeated correlation, we found a positive significant correlation between bee thorax width and the frontal corolla width (1000 out of 1000 repetitions with a p < .05, .34 < coef < .5), and between the bee thorax height and the lateral corolla width (1000 out of 1000 repetitions with a p < .05, .42 < coef < .57). We did not find a significant correlation between the bee tongue length and the corolla tube length (61 out of 1000 repetitions with a p < .05), nor between the bee tongue length and the distance between the anthers and the corolla base (0 repetitions out of 1000 with a p < .05).",
        "Conclusion": "    We found substantial divergence in floral traits of a Neotropical Costus species and its pollinator assemblage across a steep elevational gradient spanning the Amazonian lowlands to the eastern foothills of the Central Andes, establishing the necessary preconditions for pollinator-driven divergence. Taking together the results from floral traits and pollinator assemblages variation suggest that the populations of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus are adapted to the local bee fauna along the studied elevational gradient, but we cannot rule out the possibility of the beginning of a bee-to-hummingbird pollination shift in the highest studied site.",
        "Discussion": "    Our results showed clear variation in floral traits and pollinator assemblages in C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus across a steep elevational gradient from the Amazon to the foothills of the Andes in Peru. We also found an association between floral traits and bee body traits contributing to the mechanical flower-pollinator fit. The substantial divergence in both floral traits and pollinator assemblages suggests the establishment of the necessary preconditions for pollinator-driven divergence. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing floral traits and pollinator assemblages' geographic variation in the Neotropics by allowing us to learn from a new plant study system and novel composition of pollinator assemblages that are not found in temperate areas (orchid bees and hermit hummingbirds). Below we examine our results in light of two hypotheses for how variation is structured: that it could reflect local adaptation to different assemblages of the same pollinator functional group (bees) or that it could reflect the early stages of an evolutionary shift to a new pollinator functional group (hummingbirds).\n\n    The local bee adaptation hypothesis predicts that the pollinator assemblages of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus comprise only bees in all the different elevational sites and the floral traits vary among sites. We found support for this hypothesis in the dissimilarity of flower sizes and in the presence of bees as part of all pollinator assemblages along the elevational gradient. Also, the association found between floral traits and bee body traits further supports this hypothesis. The corolla size (frontal and lateral corolla width) changes with the bee thorax size (width and height) of the most frequent pollinator, with both traits increasing along the elevational gradient. The variation in corolla size may promote a better fit between flowers and bees. Our finding coincides with the pattern found by previous studies that higher elevation populations have wider flowers and are pollinated by bigger bees (bumble bees) compared to lower populations (Polemonium viscosum in the Rocky Mountains by Galen, ; and Campanula rotundifolia in the Norwegian mountains by Maad et al., ). Previous studies found an association between the flower length and the pollinator mouth part length (Maad et al., ; Nagano et al., ), which we did not find in our study. Perhaps the flower length is not a trait upon which orchid bees' tongue length exerts a selective pressure, given that the bees crawl inside the flowers of Costus to feed on the nectar. Studies about the evolution of nectar flowers for orchid bees suggested that long flowers for orchid bees might have evolved via competition among sympatric species for attracting traplining pollinators that would include them in their feeding routes (Borrell, ; Garrison & Gass, ; Rathcke, ), and not via directional selection exerted by specialized pollinators (Darwin, ), such as those with extreme trait adaptations. In addition, the local bee adaptation hypothesis stated that if there is a low bee visitation rate in the highest site, we should see an exaggeration of bee attraction traits there. Our results did not support this part of the hypothesis; we neither found a lower bee visitation rate nor exaggerated bee attraction traits in the highest site. This finding contrasts with the study of Dellinger et al. , who found a decrease in bee visitation rate with elevation in Merianieae species, but their high elevation sites were located beyond 1800 m a.s.l. Altogether, we found evidence that supports the adaptation of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus flowers to the local bee fauna along the studied elevational gradient.\n\n    The pollinator shift hypothesis predicts that the pollinator assemblage of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus at the highest elevation site would comprise bees and hummingbirds, but with the lowest bee visitation rate and the highest hummingbird visitation rate compared to lower sites. The floral traits of the highest site would include traits that deter bees and/or attract-fit hummingbirds. Our main finding supporting this hypothesis is the presence of hummingbirds of the species Phaethornis guy as part of the pollinator assemblage of only the highest site. Even though we recorded a hummingbird species with a similar bill size in the lower sites (P. malaris), we did not record hummingbirds feeding on the C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus flowers there. The feeding of P. guy on C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus flowers in the highest site could be due to two non-mutually exclusive factors, the presence of hummingbird fitting or attracting floral traits in C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus, and a decrease in hummingbird floral resources in the area (Biesmeijer et al., ; Maglianesi et al., ; Ornelas et al., ; Smith et al., ). Regarding hummingbird fitting floral traits, the short corolla in the flowers of the highest site should make those flowers accessible to the hummingbirds. In addition, the level of sugar concentration in the nectar of the highest site (x = 38.9  Brix, SD +- 1.4) might work as a hummingbird attracting floral trait. This is because the sugar level in the highest site is higher than the sugar level found in many hummingbird-visited flowers (Baker, ; Bolten & Feinsinger, ; Chalcoff et al., ; McDade & Weeks, ; Rodriguez-Flores & Stiles, ), including hummingbird-pollinated Costus species (Rodriguez-Flores & Stiles, ; Sytsma & Pippen, ). We initially thought that the level of sugar concentration in the nectar found in the highest site might be related to bee deterrence since it is lower than the one found in the lower sites. However, the sugar level found in the nectar of the highest site is within the range of sugar level of most flowers foraged by euglossine bees (30%-40%, Roubik et al., ). Regarding the availability of other hummingbird floral resources, unfortunately, we did not account for other hummingbird floral resources in our studied sites to analyze if there are lesser available resources in the highest site compared to lower sites. Maglianesi et al.  showed that if there is a decrease in hummingbird floral resources, hummingbirds can show a less specialized diet feeding on a larger number of plant species. Moreover, Stiles  reported hermit hummingbirds feeding on a bee-pollinated Costus species (C. malortieanus) in Costa Rica at the end of the rainy season (November-December) which matches the low flowering point of hummingbird foodplants during the year.\n\n    Another finding supporting the pollination shift hypothesis is the reduced nectar guides fraction area in the highest site compared to lower sites. Schemske and Bradshaw  found that the removal of nectar guides on the Mimulus flowers lowered the bee visitation rate. In our study, we did not find a decrease in bee visitation rate, perhaps the nectar guides area must be completely absent to influence bee visitation. Overall, we found some evidence supporting the pollinator shift hypothesis. Although the association between the corolla size and the bee thorax size of the most frequent pollinator could contradict this hypothesis, the two scenarios might not be mutually exclusive.\n\n    Flower length differed between the two lowest sites, Iscozacin_L has shorter flowers than Yanesha_L. Moreover, we also found differences in pollinator assemblages and pollinator visitation rates between them. These findings suggest that other factors beyond the elevation can promote variation in floral traits and pollinator assemblages.\n\n    Furthermore, the Yanesha_L bee's visitation rate was the highest among all the sites. This result might be driven by differences in the level of habitat degradation among sites. Yanesha_L is in the middle of protected areas, whereas Iscozacin_L is outside of a protected area surrounding a small town. The other sites, Sanmatias_M and Yanachaga_H, are on the border of protected areas with roads crossing these sites (Figure 1). Previous studies showed that orchid bee abundance and richness are higher in well-preserved areas compared to disturbed areas (Storck-Tonon & Peres, ). Our findings contribute evidence to the importance of habitat conservation for orchid bees and their role as pollinators, considering that, in average, the bee visitation rate inside a protected area was 7 times higher compared to unprotected areas. This striking difference may also affect the reproductive success of our native studied plant species C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus.\n\n    Some caveats about correlation versus causation for the association of floral traits and pollinator assemblages merit discussion. First, we do not know the mechanism behind the correlation we found between the corolla size and the bee thorax size. The flower size may adapt to the available pollinators, or the flower size may vary due to pollination-unrelated factors and the pollinators preferentially feed on the right size of flowers for them (Nagano et al., ). If the latter mechanism was true, we might see a wider variation of the floral trait in a site with a wide range of bee sizes visiting the flowers. Our best option to observe this would be the Yanesha_L low site, where we observed the widest range of bee sizes visiting the flowers. However, the floral size range there does not surpass the floral size range of other sites with a narrower range of bee sizes visiting the flowers. The lack of the proposed scenario suggests that the available pollinator assemblage is what might influence the variation in the floral size of C. guanaiensis var. tarmicus. A proper analysis of the mechanism would involve conducting an experiment exposing different flower sizes to bees of different sizes and testing whether by feeding on a flower size that correlates with their own size the pollination efficiency is higher than when there is a flower-pollinator trait mismatch. Second, our goal was to relate the observed floral phenotypes with the pollinator assemblages, not to test for floral local adaptation to pollinators. A proper test of local floral adaptation would be to conduct a reciprocal transplant experiment with cloned plants from different elevations to test whether clones would attract a pollinator assemblage similar to its native pollinator assemblage in every location, achieving similar levels of pollination efficiency as in their native sites and whether clones from native populations would have higher pollinator visitation rate (or any other measure of reproductive success) than the introduced populations (Newman et al., ; Streisfeld & Kohn, ). The logistics for an experiment of this nature are tremendous in places like Peru, which lack the infrastructure to grow Costus clones for experiment replicates in most of the research sites we visited, and the unpaved roads make preclude transporting clones between distant sites. Finally, it is difficult to understand which floral traits are targets of pollinator-mediated selection with an assessment of floral phenotype and pollinator assemblage correlation. Conducting studies hybridizing populations or species to increase phenotypic variance (Schemske & Bradshaw, ) or artificially manipulating single and combined floral traits and exposing them to different pollinator groups would help to elucidate any selected traits, as well as specific floral traits that function as anti-bee and/or pro-bird traits as it has been done in temperate plant systems (Castellanos et al., ; Gegear et al., ; Salas-Arcos et al., ; Zung et al., , but see Bergamo et al., , for a study of tropical flowers).",

        "Title": "    Therapeutically useful mycobacteriophages BPs and Muddy require trehalose polyphleates",
        "Abstract": "    Mycobacteriophages show promise as therapeutic agents for non-tuberculous mycobacterium infections. However, little is known about phage recognition of Mycobacterium cell surfaces or mechanisms of phage resistance. We show here that trehalose polyphleates (TPPs):high-molecular-weight, surface-exposed glycolipids found in some mycobacterial species:are required for infection of Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium smegmatis by clinically useful phages BPs and Muddy. TPP loss leads to defects in adsorption and infection and confers resistance. Transposon mutagenesis shows that TPP disruption is the primary mechanism for phage resistance. Spontaneous phage resistance occurs through TPP loss by mutation, and some M. abscessus clinical isolates are naturally phage-insensitive due to TPP synthesis gene mutations. Both BPs and Muddy become TPP-independent through single amino acid substitutions in their tail spike proteins, and M. abscessus mutants resistant to TPP-independent phages reveal additional resistance mechanisms. Clinical use of BPs and Muddy TPP-independent mutants should preempt phage resistance caused by TPP loss.\n\n    Trehalose polyphleates are surface-exposed glycolipids that are required for successful infection by phages BPs and Muddy when infecting Mycobacterium abscessus and M. smegmatis.",
        "Introduction": "    Non-tuberculous mycobacteria include several important human pathogens such as Mycobacterium abscessus and M. avium. These infections are often refractory to effective antibiotic treatment due to both intrinsic and acquired resistance mutations, and new treatment options are needed. The therapeutic application of mycobacteriophages shows some promise for the treatment of pulmonary infections in persons with cystic fibrosis, disseminated infection following bilateral lung transplantation and disseminated M. chelonae infection. However, broadening therapy beyond single-patient compassionate use applications will require expansion of the repertoire of therapeutically useful phages and increasing host range such that a higher proportion of clinical isolates can be treated. Clinical administration of bacteriophages is anticipated to give rise to phage-resistant mutants and disease recurrence, but the frequency and mechanisms of mycobacteriophage resistance are poorly understood. Very few mycobacteriophage receptors are known, although glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) are proposed as receptors for mycobacteriophage I3 in M. smegmatis.\n\n    Over 12,000 individual mycobacteriophages have been described, with most having been isolated on M. smegmatis. The genome sequences of 2,200 of these show them to be highly diverse genetically and pervasively mosaic. They can be sorted into groups of genomically related phages (for example, Cluster A, B, C and so on), some of which can be readily divided into subclusters (for example, Subcluster A1, A2, A3 and so on) on the basis of sequence variation. Seven of the sequenced phages currently have no close relatives and are designated as 'singletons'. A subset of these phages have relatively broad host range and are also able to efficiently infect M. tuberculosis, including phages in Clusters/Subclusters A2, A3, G1, K1, K2, K3, K4 and AB. A similar subset of phages also infect some clinical isolates of M. abscessus, although it is noteworthy that phage host ranges on these strains are highly variable (even for related phages within clusters/subclusters) and are highly variable among different clinical isolates. There is also substantial variation in the outcomes of phage infection of M. abscessus strains, with notable differences between rough and smooth colony morphotypes. For example, a smaller proportion of smooth isolates are susceptible to phage infection compared with rough strains, as determined by plaque formation, and none of the smooth strains is efficiently killed by any phage tested.\n\n    Mycobacterial cell walls characteristically have a mycolic acid-rich outer layer referred to as the mycobacterial outer membrane or mycomembrane. In addition to abundant mycolic acids, there are numerous other types of complex molecule including multiple acylated lipids such as di- and polyacyltrehalose (DAT and PAT), phthiocerol dimycocerosate and sulfoglycolipids, although not all are found in all Mycobacterium species. Smooth strains of M. abscessus have abundant GPLs, whereas these are lacking or greatly less abundant in rough strains. Recently, it has been shown that some mycobacterial species, including M. abscessus, have trehalose polyphleates (TPPs), which are high-molecular-weight, surface-exposed glycolipids, in their cell walls. These TPPs may be important for M. abscessus virulence and are associated with clumping and cording. A five-gene cluster, including a polyketide synthetase (Pks), is required for TPP biosynthesis and TPP precursor (DAT) transport to the outer surface of the cell by MmpL10 (ref. ). TPPs are not present in M. tuberculosis although DAT and PAT are. The specific roles of TPPs are not known, but their position on the outer surface makes them candidates for use as phage receptors.\n\n    Here we show that TPPs are required for the binding and infection of M. abscessus by phages BPs and Muddy. These phages share little or no nucleotide similarity but both have been used therapeutically, sometimes in combination with each other. M. abscessus transposon insertion mutants that are resistant to these phages map in all five genes involved in TPP synthesis, all have lost TPPs from their cell walls and phage adsorption is lost. Spontaneous phage-resistant mutants of some M. abscessus clinical isolates also have mutations in the known TPP synthesis genes, and some M. abscessus clinical isolates that are insensitive to BPs and Muddy are naturally defective in TPPs. However, the TPP requirement can be readily overcome by mutations in phage tail spike proteins, suggesting that TPPs are acting as a co-receptor, and the cell wall binding target of the phages is probably essential for mycobacterial viability. M. abscessus strains resistant to BPs and Muddy TPP-independent mutants reveal new mechanisms of phage resistance.",
        "Methods": "    Bacterial strains (Extended Data Table 4) were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 media (BD Difco) supplemented with 10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose and catalase (OADC enrichment) (7H9/OADC), or in Middlebrook 7H10/OADC solid media (BD Difco) at 37  C. Antibiotics were added when required. Transformations of electrocompetent mycobacteria were performed using a Bio-Rad Gene pulser (25 microF, 2,500 V, 800 Omega). For some M. smegmatis strains, Tween80 (0.05%) was used in starter cultures but omitted in subcultures used for phage infections. Cultures used in phage infection were supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2. When required, M. abscessus strains were selected with 1 mg ml-1 hygromycin (Toku-E, 31282-04-9) or 200 microg ml-1 streptomycin, and M. smegmatis was selected with 50 microg ml-1 hygromycin. M. abscessus strains in the GDxx series are part of the strain collection at the University of Pittsburgh and were kindly provided by numerous colleagues.\n\n    Phage MycoMarT7-Hyg1 and MycoMarT7-Hyg2 were engineered from phage MycoMarT7 using CRISPY-BRED recombineering. Briefly, double-stranded DNA recombineering substrates were designed that contained the desired mutation (a HygR cassette) with flanking sequences to permit the replacement of either KanR (MycoMarT7-Hyg1) or KanR and oriR6K (MycoMarT7-Hyg2). These substrates and genomic (g)DNA from MycoMarT7 were transformed into M. smegmatis mc2155 recombineering cells that contain the plasmid pJV138 (ref. ). Transformations were combined with cells containing a CRISPR plasmid (a derivative of pIRL53) selecting against the parent MycoMarT7 and plated on solid media; this enriches for mutants containing the allelic replacement that form plaques on the plate. Resulting plaques were screened for the presence of the Hyg-marked transposon by PCR, and positive plaques were plaque purified, whole-genome sequenced and confirmed to have retained temperature sensitivity.\n\n    The transposon mutagenesis library was largely prepared as previously described. Briefly, 50 ml of M. abscessus GD01 was grown to an OD600 of 0.2. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of phage buffer (10 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgSO4, 68.5 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2), pre-warmed to 37  C and infected with 800 microl MycoMarT7-Hyg2 (5 x 1010 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) ml-1). The cells and MycoMarT7-Hyg2 were incubated at 37  C for 7.5 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 8 ml PBS + 0.05% Tween80, and the resuspension was combined with 8 ml 40% glycerol for freezing at -80  C. The transduction frequency was determined by measuring hygromycin-resistant colonies per ml and 120,000 transductants were plated onto large square plates containing solid 7H10/OADC media with 0.1% Tween80 and 1 mg ml-1 hygromycin. Plates were incubated at 37  C for 9 d. To collect the library, cells were scraped off the solid media, resuspended in 7H9/OADC combined with 40% glycerol, aliquoted and frozen at -80  C.\n\n    To identify GD01 insertion mutants that were resistant to phage infection, ~20 microl of GD01 Tn library was thawed and grown overnight to an OD600 of 0.175. Dilutions of this culture (approximately 104, 105 and 106 cells) were spread onto 7H10/OADC solid media plates seeded with or without 108 p.f.u. of phages BPs 33HTH_HRM10, Muddy, phKSW1 or Muddy_REM1. Plates were incubated at 37  C for 7 d. Colonies able to grow on phage-seeded plates were subjected to PCR to identify a transposon insertion site (see below) and struck out two times to remove any remaining phage. After streaking, single colonies were grown in liquid media and used for phage susceptibility testing by standard plaque assay.\n\n    Transposon insertion sites were identified by PCR using a primer that annealed to the transposon in the hygromycin resistance gene (Tn_Hyg_Fwd_2: 5'-CTTCACCTTCCTGCACGACT-3') and a primer with a degenerate 3' end, or if that did not yield an amplicon, nested PCR with primers Tn_Hyg_Fwd_2 and Primer 557 (5'-GGCCAGCGAGCTAACGAGCANNNNNNNGTT-3') followed by PCR with primers Primer 414 (5'-GGCCAGCGAGCTAACGAGAC-3') and Tn_Hyg_Fwd_1 (5'-TTCGAGGTGTTCGAGGAGAC-3'). Amplicons were gel extracted, Sanger sequenced from the transposon and the result aligned to the GD01 sequence to identify the transposon insertion site. For most strains (and at least one strain per interrupted gene), the transposon insertion site was confirmed by designing primers that flanked the site identified by the initial PCR and confirming that this region had increased in size by 1,259 bp compared with strain GD01. For five strains resistant to phKSW1 (GD01Tn_phKSW1_RM1, 2, 4, 6 and 10), the entire genomes were also sequenced as previously described (and see below) to confirm the location of inserted transposons. Reads were assembled into contigs and the location of the transposon sequence was identified. To confirm the total number of transposon insertions, reads at the transposon/chromosome boundaries were closely inspected to determine the number of branches, and the coverage of the transposon contig compared to the rest of the genome was determined. In the cases of RM1, 2 and 4, the transposon contig had approximately the same coverage as the rest of the genome and showed only one type of transposon/chromosome hybrid read at each end. In the cases of RM6 and 10, the transposon contig had approximately twice the coverage of the rest of the genome, and at each end, there were two types of transposon/chromosome hybrid read.\n\n    Phages used in this study were obtained from the University of Pittsburgh and M. smegmatis mc2155 was used to propagate them. Phage ZoeJ 43-45 is a derivative of the previously described ZoeJ 45 (ref. ) and contains a deletion of genes 43 (integrase), 44 and 45 (repressor), corresponding to ZoeJ coordinates 33972-36489. It also contains the following single nucleotide polymorphisms different from ZoeJ: G3204T, A10165G, A10713G, C15262T. Phage susceptibility profiles were assessed using standard plaque assays. Top agar bacterial lawns were made by combining Middlebrook top agar (Middlebrook 7H9, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.35% BactoAgar) with 300-500 microl cell culture. After top agar had solidified, phages were tenfold serially diluted and spotted onto the top agar bacterial lawns and incubated for 24-48 h (M. smegmatis) or 5-7 d (M. abscessus) until bacterial lawns were confluent.\n\n    To create plasmid pKSW131, fadD23, pE, mmpL10 and papA3 and the flanking intergenic sequence was amplified using Q5 HiFi 2x master mix (New England Biolabs) from gDNA isolated from M. abscessus GD01. The amplicon was purified and cloned into EcoRI-digested vector pLA155 using the NEBuilder HiFI DNA Assembly master mix (New England Biolabs) and transformed into E. coli strain DH5a; plasmids and primers are shown in Extended Data Table 5. The culture that yielded a successfully constructed plasmid was grown at 30  C rather than 37  C, although it is unknown whether this contributed to successful plasmid maintenance in the culture. To create plasmid pKSW134, the open reading frame of fadD23 was amplified from GD01 gDNA and cloned into Pml I-digested anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-inducible vector pCCK39 (ref. ) using the NEBuilder HiFI DNA Assembly master mix. The entire plasmids were sequenced using Plasmidsaurus (https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/).\n\n    pMVpks_mWasabi and pMVmmpL10_mWasabi were constructed on the basis of pMVpks and pMVmmpL10 by in-fusion cloning. The mWasabi sequence under the control of the constitutive Pleft* promoter was amplified by PCR using a Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Plasmids were linearized with KpnI-HF (New England Biolabs). Agarose gels were used to purify linear fragments, then circularized using In-Fusion SNAP Assembly master mix (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stellar competent cells (Takara) were used for transformation. Plasmids generated were verified by sequencing (Eurofins Scientific).\n\n    Two of these phage-resistant mutants (GD17_RM1 and GD22 RM_4) were described previously; the others were isolated in the same manner. Briefly, 108 colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of M. abscessus were incubated with 109 p.f.u. of phage. Infections were plated on solid media at 2 and 5 d post infection, and survivors were purified, tested for phage resistance and sequenced. The mutants were sequenced as described previously. Briefly, 3 ml of culture was pelleted and resuspended in 600 microl nuclei lysis solution (Promega). Cells were added to lysing matrix B tubes (MP Biomedicals) and milled four times using a BeadBug6 microtube homogenizer (BenchMark). RNAse A (2 mul, Thermo Scientific) was added and the solution was incubated at 37  C for 10 min. Phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol was added to the lysed cells and the aqueous phase was removed after centrifugation. DNA was precipitated using isopropanol and 3 M sodium acetate, and washed two times with 75% ethanol before resuspension. Libraries were prepared with the NEBNext Ultra II FS Library Prep kit (New England Biolabs) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. The resulting reads were aligned to the parent strain genome using Consed. A custom programme (AceUtil) was used to identify differences between the mutant reads and the parent genome, and all mutations were confirmed by close inspection of the reads.\n\n    Clear plaques were observed within high-titre spots for phage BPs 33HTH_HRM10 on strains GD01Tn_BPs_HRM10_RM6, GD01Tn_BPs_HRM10_RM11 and GD180_RM2. These plaques were picked and plated on the resistant strain two additional times to purify. A purified plaque was then used to produce a high-titre phage lysate on M. smegmatis mc2155 and subsequently subjected to gene 22 PCR sequencing or whole-genome sequencing.\n\n    Bacteria were grown in LB medium (Lennox, X964.3) at 37  C without agitation and pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 g, 10 min, room temperature). Lipids were extracted from bacterial pellets treated successively with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2) (Carlo Erba, 67-66-3; Honeywell, 67-56-1) and CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), washed with water and dried. Lipids were resuspended in CHCl3 before spotting on TLC. For TLC analysis, silica gel G60 plates (10 x 20 cm, Macherey-Nagel) were used to spot samples and lipids were separated with CHCl3/CH3OH (90:10 v/v). Lipid profiles were shown by spraying the plates with a 0.2% anthrone (Sigma, 90-44-8) solution (w/v) in concentrated H2SO4 (Honeywell, 7664-93-9) and charring.\n\n    M. smegmatis strains were grown to an OD600 of 0.5-0.8, then concentrated approximately tenfold to 1.75 x 109 ml-1 in 7H9/10% albumin dextrose complex (ADC)/1 mM CaCl2. One millilitre of cells (M. smegmatis mc2155 or mc2155  pks) was infected in triplicate in a 12-well plate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. Cells were incubated at 37  C with agitation. At each timepoint, 50 microl of liquid was removed and pelleted, and the supernatant that contained unbound phage was titred on M. smegmatis. For M. abscessus GD01 and M. abscessus GD01 fadD23::Tn, the same protocol was followed but the strains were grown to an OD600 of 0.15-0.25 and cells were concentrated approximately tenfold to 6.3 x 108 ml-1 in 7H9/10% OADC/1 mM CaCl2.\n\n    Bacterial growth assays were performed in 96-well plates (Falcon), each well containing 100 microl of bacterial culture and 100 microl of phage lysates or medium as control. Exponential phage cultures of mycobacteria were used and set at 3 x 107 c.f.u. ml-1 in Middlebrook 7H9/OADC supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2. Phages were incubated at an MOI of 10 and diluted in 7H9/OADC supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2. Measurements were taken every 3 h for M. smegmatis strains and every 6 h for M. abscessus strains using a spectrophotometer (Tecan, infinite 200 PRO) until stationary phase was reached (2 d for M. smegmatis strains and 6 d for M. abscessus strains). Plates were incubated at 37  C without agitation.\n\n    Mycobacteria were subcultured in 7H9/OADC with agitation to obtain exponential phase cultures. Bacteria were concentrated to obtain a sample containing 1.2 x 107 c.f.u. (for microscopy) or 6 x 106 c.f.u. (for flow cytometry) and then incubated with either medium or phage BPs 33HTH_HRM10 (MOI 10) as controls or phage BPs 33HTH_HRM10 mCherry (MOI 10). The infections were performed for 2 h and 4 h for M. smegmatis and M. abscessus strains, respectively, at 37  C without agitation. After infection, samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, EM-15714) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then diluted as necessary, depending on the experiment, with 7H9/OADC supplemented with 0.025% tyloxapol and sonicated to disrupt bacterial aggregates. For microscopy, samples were then mounted between coverslips and slides with Immu-Mount (Epredia). Samples were kept at 4  C in the dark until analysis.\n\n    Differential interference contrast and epifluorescence images were acquired on a ZEISS Axio Imager Z1 upright microscope. A x63 Plan Apochromat 1.4 NA oil objective and a x100 Plan Apochromat 1.4 NA oil objective were respectively used for M. smegmatis and M. abscessus strains. mCherry was excited with an Intenslight fibre lamp with Texas Red (Ex: 560/40, dic. 585, Em: 630/75) filter cube. Images were acquired with an scMOS ZYLA 4.2 MP camera.\n\n    Representative fields without technical artefacts were chosen. Fiji software (version 1.53t) was used to adjust intensity, brightness and contrast (identically for compared image sets).\n\n    Infected bacteria were analysed by flow cytometry using a NovoCyte ACEA flow cytometer (excitation laser wavelength: 561 nm, emission filter: 615/20 nm). Gates were drawn using SSC-A/FSC-A and multiple cells were excluded with SSC-H/SSC-A. Uninfected cells and bacteria infected by non-fluorescent phage were included as controls. Experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Approximately 300,000 events were recorded per experiment. Analysis was done with NovoExpress version 1.6.1.\n\n    Concentrated cultures were fixed on glass slides by heating at 150  C for 15 min, followed by chemical fixation with methanol. BD Carbolfuchsin kit was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were observed using an Evos M7000 imaging system.\n\n    The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines were followed to determine the MICs. Briefly, all cultures were incubated in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth (Merck, 90922) at 30  C prior to the experiment. Each well of a 96-well plate was filled with 100 mul of bacterial suspension previously inoculated with 5 x 106 c.f.u. ml-1, except for the first column, to which 198 mul of the bacterial suspension was added. Drug (2 mul) at its highest concentration was added to the first column containing 198 mul of bacterial suspension and was twofold serially diluted. Results were obtained after 4 d of incubation at 30  C without agitation. Three independent experiments were carried out in duplicate.\n\n    Statistical analysis was carried out with GraphPad Prism v.9.0.0 for Windows. Descriptive statistics are cited and represented as median and interquartile range for each of the variables calculated. A non-parametric Dunn's test was used to compare the different conditions at 48 h for M. smegmatis or 144 h for M. abscessus. An a priori significance level was set at alpha = 0.05.\n\n    A phylogenetic tree was constructed for a concatenated alignment of amino acid sequences of the five TPP synthesis pathway members for 143 clinical isolates of M. abscessus and M. abscessus ATCC19977. Homologues were identified using MMSeqs2 (v.13.45111) and phammseqs (v.1.0.4) and subsequently aligned using ClustalO (v.1.2.4) and Trimal (v.1.4.1). A concatenated alignment was generated with a custom Python script and the maximum-likelihood phylogeny was generated using RAxML (v.8.2.12).\n\n    Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
        "Results": "    M. abscessus GD01 (subspecies massiliense) was selected for transposon mutagenesis as it is the first clinical isolate treated therapeutically and is killed well by phages Muddy, ZoeJDelta45 and BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10, mapping in Clusters AB, K2 and G1, respectively. Muddy is a lytic phage and ZoeJDelta45 and BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 are engineered lytic derivatives of ZoeJ and BPs, respectively. Because GD01, similar to many M. abscessus isolates, is kanamycin resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 128 microg ml-1), we re-engineered the extant KanR MycoMarT7 transposon using CRISPY-BRED to include an HygR cassette, constructing derivatives both with and without the existing R6Kgamma origin of replication (Fig. 1a). The shorter transposon (MycoMarT7-Hyg2) transduced strain GD01 ~100 times more efficiently than the longer MycoMarT7-Hyg1 transposon; this efficiency difference was not observed for M. smegmatis. We transduced strain GD01 with MycoMarT7-Hyg2 and selected Hyg-resistant transductants on solid media to yield a random mutagenesis library (Fig. 1b). We note that the parent of the transposon delivery phages, TM4, does not form plaques on any M. abscessus strain but efficiently delivers DNA to M. abscessus cells.\n\n    To identify M. abscessus GD01 phage-resistant mutants, the Tn library was plated on solid media seeded with either BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 or Muddy. Single colonies were recovered at a frequency of ~10-3 and 20 individual colonies were picked from each selection, rescreened and characterized (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). Eighteen of the 20 BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10-resistant candidates were mapped, all of which have transposon insertions in a gene cluster involved in TPP synthesis; some appear to have secondary transposon insertions mapping elsewhere (Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 1c,d). Thirteen of the 20 Muddy resistant candidates were mapped and surprisingly, all also contain insertions in TPP synthesis genes (Extended Data Table 1 and Fig. 1c,d). TPP synthesis has previously been reported to be non-essential and these observations suggest that loss of TPPs is the primary mechanism of resistance to both BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 and Muddy. Further analysis showed that all of the mutants tested have similar phenotypes, with a large reduction in the efficiency of plaquing of BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 and a more modest reduction in the efficiency of plaquing of Muddy, but with formation of very turbid plaques (Fig. 1e). Complementation of a fadD23 Tn mutant confirmed that phage resistance results from TPP loss (Fig. 1f). All of the strains that we tested remain sensitive to ZoeJ 43-45, Itos and Faith1 38-40 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1).\n\n    Analysis of cell wall lipids shows that all of the mutants tested have lost TPPs (Fig. 1g). Interruption of TPP precursor transport (as in an mmpL10 mutant; Fig. 1d), or loss of PE protein needed for the final step of TPP synthesis (Fig. 1d) can result in accumulation of the DAT precursor, and our mmpL10 transposon insertion mutants did accumulate DAT. Our pE mutants did not accumulate DAT and the Tn insertions may be polar, interrupting fadD23 expression and DAT synthesis (Fig. 1c,d,g). No defects in trehalose dimycolate synthesis were observed, trehalose dimycolate being transported by MmpL3 (ref. ) (Fig. 1g).\n\n    Although BPs 33HTH_HRM10 does not efficiently infect M. abscessus TPP synthesis mutants, plaques were observed at high phage titres that are candidates for TPP-independent mutants (Fig. 1e). Five individual plaques were purified, shown to have heritable infection of M. abscessus TPP mutants and were further characterized. Two were isolated on M. abscessus GD01 fadD23::Tn (phKSW2 and phKSW3), two on GD01 pE::Tn (phKSW4 and phKSW5) and one on GD180_RM2 (BPs_REM1; see below); an additional mutant (phKSW1) was isolated on M. smegmatis  MSMEG_5439 (Extended Data Table 2; see below). These mutants form clear plaques on all TPP synthesis pathway mutants tested (Fig. 2a), and sequencing showed that all have single amino acid substitutions in the predicted BPs tail spike protein, gp22 (Extended Data Table 2). Interestingly, two of these substitutions, gp22 A306V and A604E (present in phKSW3 and phKSW5, respectively), were reported previously as BPs host range mutants able to infect M. tuberculosis. The gp22 A604E substitution is also present in phage BPsDelta33HTH_HRMGD03 that infects some other M. abscessus strains. Although phKSW4 (and phKSW2; Extended Data Table 2) has a gp22 L462R substitution, BPs_REM1 has both a gp22 L462R substitution and a G780R substitution. BPs_REM1 forms somewhat clearer plaques than phKSW4 on the TPP mutants (Fig. 2a), suggesting that G780R has an additive effect towards clear plaque formation.\n\n    Because TPPs are surface exposed and are required for BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 infection, we tested whether they are required for adsorption (Fig. 2b). Wild-type BPs adsorb relatively poorly to M. smegmatis and BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 adsorption is similarly poor on M. abscessus GD01 (Fig. 2b). However, BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 is clearly defective in adsorption to a GD01 fadD23::Tn mutant (Fig. 2b, left panel). Interestingly, the TPP-independent phage phKSW1 (Extended Data Table 2) adsorbs considerably faster to GD01 (as does a BPs gp22 A604E mutant in M. smegmatis) than its parent phage (Fig. 2b, middle panel) and shows only a small improvement in adsorption to the GD01 fadD23::Tn mutant relative to BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 infection of GD01 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, ZoeJDelta43-45 adsorbs similarly to both M. abscessus strains (Fig. 2b, right panel).\n\n    We similarly isolated a resistance escape mutant of Muddy (Muddy_REM1, Extended Data Table 2) and, together with three Muddy mutants with expanded M. tuberculosis host ranges, characterized their infection of TPP pathway mutants (Fig. 2c). Three of the mutants (Muddy_REM1, Muddy_HRMN0157-1 and Muddy_HRMN0052-1) efficiently infect all of the TPP pathway mutants; Muddy_HRMN0157-2 forms very turbid plaques on all of the mutants, similar to wild-type Muddy (Fig. 2c). Sequencing showed that Muddy_REM1 contains a single base substitution in the tail spike gene 24 conferring an E680K substitution (Extended Data Table 2), the same substitution as in Muddy_HRMN0052-1; Muddy_HRMN0157-1 and Muddy_HRMN0157-2 have G487W and T608A substitutions in gp24, respectively.\n\n    We previously reported M. abscessus mutants spontaneously resistant to BPs derivatives. Two of the strains (GD17_RM1 and GD22_RM4, Extended Data Table 3) have mutations in pks and are at least partially resistant to BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 (ref. ). We have similarly isolated three additional spontaneous mutants resistant to BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10, two of which (GD38_RM2 and GD59_RM1) have mutations in pks; the third (GD180_RM2) has a nonsense mutation in mmpL10 (Extended Data Table 3). BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 does not form plaques on mutants GD38_RM2, GD17_RM1 or GD59_RM1 and forms very small plaques at a reduced efficiency of plaquing on GD22_RM4 (Fig. 3a). Thus, point mutations in M. abscessus TPP synthesis genes can give rise to BPs resistance, although these have not been observed clinically. These mutants are infected well by other phages we tested that infect the parent strain (Fig. 3a).\n\n    The M. abscessus Pks protein (MAB_0939) is a 3,697-residue multidomain protein (Fig. 3b). Two of the spontaneously resistant mutants have frameshift mutations close to the midpoint of the gene (at codons 2,115 and 2,389, Extended Data Table 3 and Fig. 3b) and two others have amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal ketosynthase (KS) domain (Extended Data Table 3 and Fig. 3b). We note that the two frameshift mutations are in the second acyltransferase (AT) domain and leave the upstream domains intact (Fig. 3b).\n\n    M. abscessus clinical isolates vary greatly in their sensitivity to BPs 33HTH_HRM10 and Muddy. There are probably numerous determining factors, but these could include loss of TPPs. Analysis of the TPP synthesis proteins (Pks, PE, PapA3, MmpL10 and FadD23) of 143 sequenced clinical isolates and reference strain ATCC19977 identified 37 distinct genotypes that generally correlate with global nucleotide similarity (Fig. 3c); however, no evident correlation between these variations and sensitivity to BPs 33HTH_HRM10 and/or Muddy was observed (Fig. 3c). Most of the variations observed reflect amino acid substitutions, although two strains (GD262 and GD273) have identical large deletions in pks (3,645 bp) and two others (GD155 and GD286) have translocations resulting in 30.2 kbp insertions in pks (Fig. 3d). Both GD273 and GD286 have phage infection profiles consistent with TPP loss, and the TPP-independent mutant Muddy_HRMN0052-1 overcomes the defect (Fig. 3e). GD262, GD273 and GD286 are not susceptible to BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 or the TPP-independent mutant BPs_REM1 (Fig. 3e), and these strains probably carry additional phage defence mechanisms targeting BPs and its derivatives. GD155 has a smooth colony morphotype (Fig. 3c) and is not susceptible to any of the phages tested here.\n\n    Mutants GD22_RM4 and GD180_RM2, which are defective in pks and mmpL10, respectively (Fig. 4a), can both be complemented to fully restore BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 and Muddy infection (Fig. 4b). Both mutants lack cell wall TPPs and TPPs are at least partially restored by complementation (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, a derivative of BPs expressing mCherry, which behaves similarly to BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 in plaque assays (Fig. 4b) and liquid infections (Fig. 4d), gives fluorescence from parent strains but not from GD22_RM4 and GD180_RM2 (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2). Complementation fully restores liquid infection of GD180_RM2 and partially restores infection of GD22_RM4 (Fig. 4d), as well as fluorescence with the reporter phage (Fig. 4e,f). These data are consistent with an early defect in phage infection in these mutants, consistent with loss of adsorption to the cell surface. We note that disruption of TPP synthesis does not interfere with Ziehl-Neelsen staining of the bacteria or alter antibiotic sensitivities (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\n    M. smegmatis is genetically tractable and susceptible to a large number of diverse phages, and using TPP mutants in pks (MSMEG_0408), papA3 (MSMEG_0409), mmpL10 (MSMEG_0410), fadD23 (MSMEG_0411) and pE (MSMEG_0412), we showed that these have similar, albeit somewhat milder, phenotypes to M. abscessus TPP mutants (Fig. 5a). As expected, Deltapks, DeltammpL10 and DeltapE mutants failed to produce TPPs, while complementation restores the presence of TPPs (Fig. 5b). The relatively efficient infection of the  fadD23 mutant is consistent with incomplete TPP loss, possibly due to an unidentified fatty acyl-AMP ligase partially overcoming the defect. Muddy similarly forms very turbid plaques on the Deltapks and DeltapapA3 mutants, but only mildly so on the DeltafadD23 mutant (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the TPP-independent BPs and Muddy mutants infect M. smegmatis TPP mutants normally (Fig. 5a). Complementation of the DeltapapA3, Deltapks, DeltammpL10 and DeltapE mutants restores normal infection by both Muddy and BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 (Extended Data Fig. 4).\n\n    BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 and its mCherry derivatives are both defective in liquid infection of the Deltapks, DeltammpL10 and DeltapE M. smegmatis mutants, and efficient infection and lysis are restored by complementation (Extended Data Fig. 4a,e). The mCherry reporter phage shows fluorescence in wild-type M. smegmatis but loss of fluorescence in infection of all three mutants, with restoration of infection in the complemented strains (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). In addition, the mCherry fluorophage behaves similarly to its parent in plaque assays on M. smegmatis mutant and complemented strains (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Both BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 and the TPP-independent phKSW1 are defective in adsorption of a Deltapks mutant relative to wild-type M. smegmatis (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 5), similar to M. abscessus (Fig. 2b).\n\n    Testing a broader phage panel showed that most are not dependent on TPPs, except for ShedlockHolmes, MsGreen and Papyrus in Clusters/Subclusters K3, L3 and R, respectively, which show some TPP dependence (Fig. 5d). MsGreen and ShedlockHolmes have tail genes related to Muddy gene 24, although we note that ZoeJ also does and yet is not TPP dependent. However, such variation is not unexpected, as the escape mutant observations show that only a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to confer TPP independence (Figs. 2a,c and 5a).\n\n    The TPP-independent phage mutants infect M. abscessus efficiently and we therefore repeated the selection for Tn insertion mutants to explore whether there are other surface molecules required for infection. Interestingly, such mutants arise from the same library at a 100-fold lower abundance than BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 and Muddy resistant mutants (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Table 1). All but one of the phKSW1 resistant mutants analysed are similarly resistant to BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10, BPs_REM1 and phKSW1 but remain sensitive to Muddy and Muddy_REM1 (Fig. 6b); one (GD01Tn_phKSW1_RM10) is resistant to phKSW1 but is sensitive to BPs_REM1 and is resistant to Muddy but not Muddy_REM1 (Fig. 6b). One of the two Muddy_REM1 resistant mutants is only partially resistant to Muddy and Muddy_REM1, but both are fully sensitive to all of the BPs derivatives (Fig. 6b).\n\n    Characterization of these mutants shows that they are unlikely to be defective in surface recognition by the phages. Two Muddy_REM1 resistant strains have Tn insertions in transcription genes greA and rpoC (Extended Data Table 1), and one phKSW1 resistant mutant maps in recB (MAB_0399c; Extended Data Table 1); these are unlikely to be directly involved in phage binding. Four of the phKSW1 resistant mutants (RM2, RM5, RM7 and RM8), representing at least three independent insertions (Fig. 6 and Extended Data Table 1), have transposons at GD01 coordinate 1,169,901 in a region absent from ATCC19977 and many other M. abscessus strains and within a candidate 'phage-inducible chromosomal island' (PICI) (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Table 1). The insertions are upstream of GD01 gene EXM25_05825 encoding a protein with a DUF4145 domain, which is implicated in a variety of viral defence systems and is often fused with restriction endonucleases and abortive infection systems (Fig. 6c). It is plausible that the BPs resistant phenotype results from overexpression of this gene.\n\n    Analysis of the cell wall lipids shows that all of the mutants retain TPPs, except for GD01Tn_phKSW1_RM10 (Fig. 6d), which has a Tn insertion in papA3 in addition to a secondary insertion in MAB_1686 (Extended Data Table 1). Two additional mutants (GD01Tn_phKSW1_RM1 and RM4) have an insertion in the nearby MAB_1690 gene and have normal TPPs (Fig. 6d); MAB_1686 and MAB_1690 are within a large (22 kbp) operon encoding an Mce4 transport system (Extended Data Table 1). However, this Mce4 system is probably not acting as a receptor as the GD01Tn_phKSW1_RM1 mutant does not have an adsorption defect (Fig. 6e). The GD01Tn_phKSW1_RM2 mutant also does not have any adsorption defect (Fig. 6e).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Trehalose polyphleates are among the largest known lipids in mycobacteria and are structurally related to sulfolipids SL-1 and polyacylated trehalose PAT, which, in contrast to TPPs, are found exclusively in M. tuberculosis. The roles of TPPs in mycobacterial physiology and/or growth remain unclear, but they are implicated in clumping and cording in M. abscessus. Many TPP-defective M. abscessus strains have rough morphotypes, typically associated with cording, consistent with the rough colony morphology primarily resulting from GPL loss. Clearly, TPPs are critical for adsorption of several phages, including the therapeutically useful Muddy and BPs. The finding that both phages require TPPs is a surprise, as they are genomically distinct, share few genes and were thus considered to be suitable for combination in phage cocktails. Nonetheless, the availability of TPP-independent phage mutants provides substitutes to which resistance to both phages occurs at a much lower frequency, and such mutants do not typically show co-resistance to the two phages. We propose that the TPP-independent phages replace their cognate parent phages in therapeutic cocktails.\n\n    A simple explanation for the role of TPPs is that they are specifically recognized and bound to by BPs, Muddy and the other TPP-dependent phages as the only requirement for DNA injection. However, it is then unclear as to how the TPP-independent phages overcome TPP loss, and it seems implausible that they gain the ability to bind to a completely different receptor. A more likely explanation is that TPPs act as co-receptors for Muddy and BPs and facilitate recognition of a different surface molecule; the TPP-independent phage mutants would then simply bypass the need for activation by TPPs. The observation that tail spike mutants such as phKSW1 adsorb substantially better than the parent phage, even to TPP-containing host cells, is consistent with this latter explanation. Furthermore, wild-type BPs does not efficiently infect M. tuberculosis H37Rv, but a mutant with the gp22 A604E substitution enables efficient infection, even though M. tuberculosis lacks TPPs. Similarly, wild-type Muddy efficiently infects M. tuberculosis H37Rv despite its lack of TPPs, and Muddy tail spike substitutions expand its host range to other M. tuberculosis strains. These observations not only suggest that TPPs are not the receptors per se for these phages, but that there may be general mechanisms governing receptor access by the phages, together with phage strategies for expanding host cell recognition and infection. Furthermore, if TPPs are not the target of direct phage recognition, the true receptor is likely to be encoded by genes that are essential for mycobacterial viability. Thus, although transposon insertion mutagenesis has been used in other systems for identifying phage receptors, this may be of more limited use in Mycobacterium, although as we have shown here, it is useful for mapping a plethora of resistance mechanisms.\n\n    Understanding the roles of TPPs in M. abscessus is important for therapeutic phage use, and we note that in at least some clinical isolates, the loss of TPPs through gene deletions or translocation leads to loss of infection by BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 or Muddy. In the first therapeutic use of mycobacteriophages, BPsDelta33HTH_HRM10 and Muddy were used in combination with ZoeJ, and it is of interest that ZoeJ is not TPP dependent. We also note that resistance to BPs derivatives or Muddy has not been observed in clinical use, even in 11 cases where only a single phage was used. It is plausible that resistance through TPP loss has a trade-off with fitness, although the roles of TPPs in M. abscessus pathogenicity and persistence are not known. Strikingly, the use of TPP-independent derivatives of BPs and Muddy not only avoids concerns about resistance via TPP loss, but also negates cross-resistance between the two phages (Fig. 6).\n\n    Finally, transposon mutagenesis and selection of mutants resistant to the TPP-independent phages reveal additional mechanisms of phage resistance. Particularly intriguing is the isolation of insertions in a candidate PICI, with the potential to activate expression of a PICI gene implicated in phage defence. These Mycobacterium PICIs and their roles in phage infection profiles deserve further investigation.",

        "Title": "    Chloroplast Genes Are Involved in The Male-Sterility of K-Type CMS in Wheat",
        "Abstract": "    The utilization of crop heterosis can greatly improve crop yield. The sterile line is vital for the heterosis utilization of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The chloroplast genomes of two sterile lines and one maintainer were sequenced using second-generation high-throughput technology and assembled. The nonsynonymous mutated genes among the three varieties were identified, the expressed difference was further analyzed by qPCR, and finally, the function of the differentially expressed genes was analyzed by the barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) method. A total of 16 genes containing 31 nonsynonymous mutations between K519A and 519B were identified. There were no base mutations in the protein-encoding genes between K519A and YS3038. The chloroplast genomes of 519B and K519A were closely related to the Triticum genus and Aegilops genus, respectively. The gene expression levels of the six selected genes with nonsynonymous mutation sites for K519A compared to 519B were mostly downregulated at the binucleate and trinucleate stages of pollen development. The seed setting rates of atpB-silenced or ndhH-silenced 519B plants by BSMV-VIGS method were significantly reduced. It can be concluded that atpB and the ndhH are likely to be involved in the reproductive transformation of 519B.",
        "Introduction": "    Wheat (T. aestivum L.) is the world's most widely grown food crop, feeding nearly half of the world's population. It is also an important raw material for industry. For example, wheat gluten can be used as a natural binder in the manufacture of paper. Additionally, dry gluten extracted from wheat can be used as an additive for bread processing. Improving yield per unit area and stress resistance of wheat are very effective strategies to alleviate the food problem. The utilization of heterosis is an effective way to improve wheat yield and quality, and it plays an essential role in the breeding of crops.\n\n    Wheat is a monoecious, self-pollinated crop. Therefore, male sterile lines are essential for the utilizing of heterosis. Male sterility in plants refers to the development of gynoecium as normal during the growth process, but fertilization and seed setting after receiving pollen are abnormal, which are caused by the abnormal development of stamens. The abnormal development of stamens means that the pollens are abortive or anther tissue structure is abnormal, which eventually leads to the decline or loss of pollen vitality. The causes of male sterility in plants are various. According to the origin of male sterile genes, male sterile lines can be divided into three types: genic male sterility (GMS), cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), and nucleus-cytoplasmic male sterility. At first, Kihara transferred the nucleus of common wheat into Aegilops caudata and cultivated the first nucleus-cytoplasmic male sterile line in 1951. Wilson and Ross introduced the common wheat nucleus into the Triticum timopheevi. Finally, they successfully selected and obtained T-type CMS wheat. After this experiment, the maintainer and restorer lines were also selected, these studies were important for the utilization of wheat heterosis. After years of unremitting efforts by scientists, there are many different cytoplasmic sterile lines that have been cultivated in China. The K-type wheat sterile line has the Aegilops kotschyi cytoplasm, S-type has Aegilops crassa cytoplasm, Q-type has wild oat cytoplasm, and V-type has Aegilops variabilis cytoplasm, and they all have the nucleus of common wheat. In addition, according to the response environments, male sterile lines were divided into thermo-sensitive male sterile lines, photosensitive male sterile lines, and photothermosensitive male sterile lines.\n\n    The K-type 1B/1R CMS line is a heterozygote in the cytoplasm of Ae. kotschyi and 1B/1R nucleus of T. aestivum. On this basis, the K-type non-1B/1R CMS line was cultivated. The sterility of the K-type non-1B/1R CMS line was complete and stable, as well as the recovery sources and agronomic traits, thus it has great application value. There have been some researches about K-CMS in physiology, cytology, protein expression, and gene function analysis. For instance, Yang et al. cloned and analyzed the functions of MADS-box, TaAG-A, and TaAG-B genes from a wheat K-CMS line. They found that the expression levels of TaAG-A and TaAG-B were higher in spikes. In the maintainer line, both genes showed downregulation during the uninucleate to trinucleate stage. Then the TaAG-A and TaAG-B were silenced in fertile wheat lines using the VIGS method, resulting in green and yellow striped leaves, emaciated spikes, and decreased seed set rates. Zhang et al. found a total of 41 protein spots differentially expressed through proteomic analysis of pollen in K-CMS lines and maintainers, of which, seven identified proteins were downregulated in CMS lines.\n\n    In general, the genetic systems of higher plants mainly include the nuclear genome and the cytoplasmic genome. The cytoplasmic genome mainly includes the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes. Both mitochondria and chloroplast inheritance belong to the semiautonomous genetic system, which is capable of autonomous DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Besides, many physiological metabolisms of plant cells depend on the combined action of the nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplast. In higher plants, a phenomenon is that the genes of chloroplast and nucleus can be transferred to the mitochondria. Additionally, the chloroplast genes that are transferred to mitochondria often evolve into nonfunctional pseudogenes. However, the genes in the nucleus and mitochondria typically are not transferred to the chloroplast. Besides, this process is bidirectional between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. We speculate that the combination of different types of cytoplasm and nucleus may destroy the intrinsic balance between chloroplast, nucleus, and mitochondria, which may lead to the formation of cytoplasmic male sterility.\n\n    Many studies have revealed that mitochondrial genes are involved in plant male sterility, including atp, cox, rps, ORF, and ORF interacted with genes. The common modes of male sterility were rearrangements of mitochondrial genes and chimeric gene fusion. In addition, the chimeric CMS genes are mostly transcribed together with the upstream or downstream genes, such as ORF79 is co-transcribed with the upstream atp6 gene in rice. Nad2 is co-transcribed with orfB in stem mustard (Brassica juncea). Cytoplasmic male sterility consists of three main pathways: Mitochondrial genes can directly cause male sterility by energy deficiency; male sterility can be caused by the interaction of cytoplasmic and nucleus genes, due to the retrograde signaling from the mitochondrion interferes with nuclear gene expression and there are also some mitochondrial genes that cause male sterility through differences in expression.\n\n    Chloroplasts are important organelles for photosynthesis in higher plants and are important organelles to independent genetic information in cells. The chloroplast genome, also known as chloroplast DNA, refers to the sum of the genetic information contained in the chloroplast. Most chloroplast genomes are 120-250 kb in size and chloroplast genomes typically are depicted as closed double-stranded circular rings. They are typically four-segment structures consisting of two inverted repeats (IRs), a short single copy region (SSC), and a long single copy region (LSC). The sequence of the IRs' regions is the same but in the opposite direction. The structures of the chloroplast genomes are relatively conservative and have fewer changes during the evolution of species. Therefore, the chloroplast genome can provide reliable and accurate information for biodiversity research and provide a lot of basic information for comparative evolution research.\n\n    Since the chloroplast genes can be transferred to mitochondria as mentioned above, and since many mitochondrial genes are involved in the process of male sterility in plants, chloroplast genes might affect male sterility by changing the gene function of mitochondria. Besides, some special structural compositions in chloroplasts were also considered related to the fertility of plants. Li et al. used SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis to compare the differences of peptides on chloroplast thylakoid membranes between CMS lines and their maintainers in beet, corn, and sorghum. There were significant differences in the size, number, and distribution of peptide plaques between the two lines, proving that the composition of chloroplast thylakoid polypeptides might affect cytoplasmic male sterility. Li et al. studied the chloroplast ultrastructure of the CMS line and its maintainer in rape, the number of stacks of grana in the thylakoid of the sterile line was significantly reduced. Additionally, the lamellar structure between grana became thinner or even fractured so that the lamellar system was disordered. Chen et al. found that after the digestion of chloroplast genome DNA of sorghum male sterile line and maintainer line with HindIII endonuclease, the male sterile line produced a 3.7 kb specific fragment, with a 165 bp lack compared to the maintainer line (3.8 kb). The deletion fragment was from the rpoC2 gene, which encodes the beta subunit of the RNA polymerase. The amino acids of the deletion fragment will participate in the formation of an alpha helix. It was found that the identified 1501 differentially expressed transcripts in leaves and anthers at different developmental stages were most of these DETs being localized in plastid and mitochondrion of male sterile line in Brassica napus L. induced by the chemical hybridization agent compared to the wild Brassica napus L..\n\n    K519A is a non-1B/1R K-CMS line, and 519B was the maintainer line of K519A with the same nuclear genotype. Their nuclear genomes are derived from the same paternal species, but their cytoplasm genomes are from different maternal species. Thus, the differences in fertility come from the differences between cytoplasmic genomes. YS3038 is also a non-1B/1R K-CMS line. Additionally, the nucleus of YS3038 is basically the same as that of K519A. However, the sterility of YS3038 is thermo-sensitive. To understand the sterile mechanism of K519A and YS3038, the chloroplast genomes of K519A, YS3038, and 519B were sequenced, assembled, annotated, and compared in this study. Then the nonsynonymous mutant sites of coding genes were verified. Besides, possible SSR, possible long repeat sequences, and phylogeny were analyzed. This study can provide an important reference value for the sterile mechanism studies of K519A and YS3038.",
        "Methods": "    The K-type male sterile line K519A (non-1B/1R T. aestivum Ae. kotschyi cytoplasm), YS-type thermo-sensitive male sterile line YS3038 (non-1B/1R T. aestivum with Ae. kotschyi cytoplasm), and the same nuclear genotype maintainer line 519B (T. aestivum) of K519A were used in this study. They are provided by our laboratory (Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China).\n\n    After the pollens matured, the opening angle of the glumes of the male sterile line become larger than 519B, the anthers stretch out from the glume (Figure 1(A1,B1)). Additionally, the anther is wizened, short, and crooked, and the pollen cannot spread out from the anther (Figure 1(A2)). After the pollens have matured, the anthers of 519B are plump and cracked, and the amount of fertile pollen spreads out from the anthers (Figure 1(B2)).\n\n    The test materials were planted in the experimental field of the Northwest A&F University (108 4' E, 34 16' N) on 3 October 2018. The two materials were planted in 4 rows (25 cm between rows), respectively, with 15 seeds in 1 m. Planting was done with general field management measures. Young leaves were stored in a refrigerator at -80  C in March 2019.\n\n    Genomic DNA from young leaves of K519A, YS3038, and 519B wheat was extracted by means of the CTAB method. The whole-genome DNA sequences were obtained using second-generation high-throughput technology, with the Illumina HiSeq XTM Ten sequencing platform and paired-end 150 bp sequencing strategy. Firstly, the original sequencing data for each sample was obtained, then low-quality reads and connector sequences were removed. Additionally, the clean data was used for further genome assembly of the chloroplast.\n\n    The chloroplast assembly was carried out based on the assembly method of Hahn et al.. The assembly steps are as follows: Firstly, the clean data is spliced using SPAdes software, setting default parameters except that the cut-off parameter is not selected. The clean data are spliced into scaffolds. Using the published wheat chloroplast DNA sequences (Chinese Spring, CS, T. aestivum) and protein-coding gene sequences as a reference (KJ614396.1). Then the sequences are aligned using Blastn and Exonerate, respectively. The e value threshold of DNA alignment is 1 x 10-10, and the protein similarity threshold is 70%, respectively. Scaffold with gene matching was selected and the coverage was ranked to remove fragments that were clearly not the target fragments, such as most of them were 1000X, but a few were 10X, and then the low-coverage fragments (10X) were removed. PRICE and MITObim was used to splice the collected fragmented sequences to extend the scaffolds. The number of iterations generally was 50. The original sequencing reads were aligned to scaffolds using bowtie2, then the matched paired reads were picked out and spliced by SPAdes. The path was studied to see if a distinct circle diagram could be formed. If so, the circle genome was extracted, otherwise, steps 3-5 above were repeated until a circular genome was formed.\n\n    The organelle genome annotation is mainly divided into three parts: protein-coding gene annotation, RNA annotation, and structural annotation. Three methods are commonly used for protein-coding gene prediction. The DNA sequences or protein-coding sequences directly align with NCBI to confirm the genes. Submitting sequences to the online service annotation tools, DOGMA (, accessed on 7 April 2020) and CpGAVAS, predicting the ORFs, and then annotating genes in the nr database. In combination with the three methods, the most accurate annotation results are chosen.\n\n    Chloroplast tRNA annotations were performed using the tRNAscan-SE online site (, accessed on 15 May 2020). The rRNA annotations were performed using the RNAmmer 1.2 Server (, accessed on 28 May 2020), in combination with homologous alignments, and boundary correcting. After the sequence annotation was completed, the structure note was edited by Sequin to generate a submission file that could be submitted to the GenBank database. The file was submitted to OGDRAW (, accessed on 17 June 2020) to draw the annotated map.\n\n    A codon is a link between genetic information from DNA and protein, and every three adjacent codons encode an amino acid. In all organisms in nature, there are only 20 amino acids in total, however, each amino acid corresponds to at least one or up to six codons. Synonymous codons mean that different codons can encode the same amino acid. The analysis of codon preference was performed using the CHIPS program in the EMBOSS software package.\n\n    The Microsatellite identification tool (MiSa) was used for finding simple sequence repeats (SSR) in the genome. We used this software to detect SSR with eight times as a minimal repeat number of mononucleotides, five times for dinucleotides, and at least three times for three or more bases.\n\n    The polymorphism SSR markers at the same position in the same gene of K519A and 519B were selected. Primer Premier 6.0 software was used to design SSR primers to verify the polymorphism between K519A and 519B.\n\n    Using REPuter online software to find long repeat sequences, all options: forward, reverse, complement, and palindromic were selected for \"Match Direction\". The parameter \"Hamming distance\" was set to 3, \"maximum computed repeat\" to 50, and \"minimal repeat size\" to 15.\n\n    We used MEGA4.0 software to align the homology of protein-coding genes, then we selected all nonsynonymous mutant sites to verify the accuracy of second-generation sequencing results. According to the company's sequencing sequence, Primer Premier 6.0 software was used to design primers of nonsynonymous mutant sites, then PCR products were sent to the company for first-generation sequencing (FGS).\n\n    The genome-wide alignment of chloroplast genomes K519A, 519B, YS3038, and another 100 chloroplasts of near-source species were performed using HomBlocks (, accessed on 22 July 2021) software with the trimAl trim method. The NJ method was used to build the evolutionary tree with bootstrap value 1000.\n\n    Premier 6.0 software was used for gene-specific primers. RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientifc, Wilmington, DE, USA) was used for cDNA synthesis with random primers according to instructions. TB GreenTM Premix Ex TaqTM II (Tli RNaseH Plus) Kit (Takara Biological Engineering, Tokyo, Japan) and Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used for the qPCR analysis with three biological replicates and three technical replicates. The wheat Actin gene with AB181991.1 (Gene Bank) was used for normalization. The 2-DeltaDeltaCT method was used to calculate relative expression levels of target genes.\n\n    The approximate 200 bp gene fragment with the PacI (TTAATTAA) and NotI (GCGGCCGC) enzyme locus were used for gene-silenced. Then the vector of gamma-gene was obtained.\n\n    MluI was used for the linearization of alpha and gamma plasmids; SpeI was used for the linearization of beta plasmid; and BssHII was used for the linearization of gamma-PDS and gamma-gene plasmids. Then, in vitro transcription was performed using Ribo m7G Cap Analog (Promega), RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega), and Ribolock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo).\n\n    The negative control plants used in vitro transcript mixture of alpha, beta, and gamma, while the positive control plants used in vitro transcript mixture of alpha, beta, and gamma-PDS, and the treatment plants used an in vitro transcript mixture of alpha, beta, and gamma-gene. The 247 muL mixture could be used to infect five individuals including 7 muL in vitro transcription product for each vector, 40 muL sterilized 1% DEPC water, and 200 muL GK-Pbufer.\n\n    The penultimate leaves and the fully unfolded flag leaves were smeared with above-mentioned mixture. The plants were then placed in a 24-26  C incubator for dark cultivation for 24 h.\n\n    After virus infection, 4-5 spikelets per ear were collected at the binucleate stage for RNA extraction and qPCR analysis. When ears grew to the mature stage, the seed setting rate was calculated as follows: Seed setting rate per ear = number of grains per ear / (effective spikelet number x 2) x 100%.",
        "Results": "    Genomic sequencing was performed on K519A, 519B, and YS3038, and the number of paired-end reads of 150 bp was greater than or equal to 14,716,209 for each sample, and the number of reads was greater than or equal to 14,705,908 (4,406,664,764 clean data) and Q30 was greater than 92.35% for each sample after quality control. The length of the chloroplast genome was about 136 kb, indicating a sequencing coverage of 40x.\n\n    Like the chloroplast genomes of other higher plants, the two chloroplast genomes in this experiment contained two inverted repeats, IRA and IRB, which divided the entire genome into four parts, and the remaining regions were the large single-copy region (LSC) and the small single-copy region (SSC). The total length of the chloroplast genome of K519A was 136,996 bp, and the lengths of the four parts were 81,136 bp (LSC), 12,776 bp (SSC), and 21,542 bp (IRA and IRB) (Figure 2). The total length of the YS3038 was 136,919 and the lengths of the four parts were 81,059 bp (LSC), 12,776 bp (SSC), and 21,542 bp (IRA and IRB) (Figure 3). The total length of 519B was 136,235 bp, and the lengths of the four parts were 80,335 bp (LSC), 12,796 bp (SSC), and 21,552 bp (IRA and IRB) (Figure 4). The GC contents of genomes were 38.27% (K519A), 38.28% (YS3038), and 38.28% (519B), respectively. The structures of the chloroplast genomes of the two male sterile lines and 519B were different, such as the expansion and contraction of the boundaries of the four parts, and the sequence insertion of some regions.\n\n    All chloroplast genomes include 77 protein-coding genes, 4 rRNA genes, and 30 tRNA genes. Based on the functions, chloroplast genes and RNA were mainly divided into three categories: photosynthesis (45), self-replication (58), unknown function (4), and others (4) (Table 1). Of these, there were two copies of the protein-coding genes ndhB, ndhH, rps7, rps15, rps19, ycf1, ycf2, and rpl2. Additionally, there were three copies of rpl23. In the tRNA genes, trnA-UGC, trnH-GUG, trnI-GAU, trnN-GUU, trnR-ACG, and trnV-GAC contained two copies. Additionally, there were three copies of the trnfM-CAU. Besides, the trnL-CAA gene had two copies only in YS3038. The trnA-UGC, trnG-UCC, trnI-GAU, trnK-UUU, trnL-UAA, trnV-UAC, atpF, ndhA, ndhB, petB, petD, rpl2, rpl16, and rps16 contained an intron, and ycf3 contained two introns. Rps12 is a trans-splicing gene.\n\n    The regions of exons and introns for each gene were predicted, and the codon preferences were analyzed based on the sequence of exons. The codon preferences of K519A and 519B were different. Additionally, the codon preferences of genes in K519 and 519B are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Among them, both Met and Trp were encoded by only one codon. Ile and stop codons were encoded by three codons. Ala, Gly, Pro, Thr, and Val were encoded by four codons. Arg, Leu, and Ser were encoded by six codons.\n\n    The SSR markers of chloroplasts have been applied for studies of population genetics, evolution processes, and phylogeny. In this study, we found 186 possible SSR repeat motifs in K519A (Table 4) and 188 in 519B (Table 5). In SSRs, the mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant compared to polynucleotide repeats, and the number of A/T repeat motifs was significantly higher than the number of C/G, which was consistent with the results of six legume plastid genomes. In K519A, the proportion of single nucleotide repeat motif was 68.28% and was 67.02% in 519B. The SSR number composed of dinucleotide was 8, of which 6 were AT/TA repeat motifs and 2 were TC in K519A. The SSR number composed of dinucleotide was 9, of which 7 were AT/TA repeat motifs and 2 were TC in 519B. Among the trinucleotides, AAC/TTC most frequently appeared. Additionally, the SSR number of the remaining repeat motif types appeared only once.\n\n    Besides SSR analysis, we also analyzed possible long repeat sequences of the chloroplast genome. Long repeat sequences are special DNA sequences that occur repeatedly in the genome and usually occupy a large proportion in the genome. In general, the proportion of repeat sequences is positively related to the size of the genome. For example, the Arabidopsis thaliana genome is 120 Mb, and the repeat sequences account for 10%. Most repeat sequences accounting for 81% of the wheat genomes (17,000 Mb) exist in the intergenic region, and a small number of repetitive sequences exist in the gene coding region. Repetitive fragments have important molecular significance for plant evolution research. In K519A, a total of 50 possible long repeats were found, and the sizes were 20-286 bp. Of the 50 possible repeats, the positive repeat, palindrome repeats, and inverted replicates were 37, 11, and 2, respectively. The longest repeat was the forward repeat with 286 bp in length. In 519B, a total of 52 possible long repeats were found, the sizes of which were also 20-286 bp, which was consistent with K519A, of which the positive repeat, palindrome repeat, and inverted repeat were 39, 10, and 3, respectively. Most of the long repeats between the two lines are consistent, only a few are inconsistent (Table 6).\n\n    Firstly, the CS was used as a reference sequence to compare the protein-coding genes of 519B, 519A, and YS3038. Compared with CS, 519B has 4 genes with nonsynonymous mutations, 15 genes with synonymous mutations, a total of 28 base mutations, 4 amino acid mutations, 7 deletions, and 2 insertions. There were no base mutations in the protein-encoding genes between K519A and YS3038. Compared with CS, both K519A and 519B have 15 nonsynonymous mutated genes and 27 synonymous mutated genes, including 113 base mutations, 30 amino acid mutations, 8 deletions, and 3 insertions (Table 7). It was concluded that compared with the protein-coding gene of CS, 519B has the least synonymous mutation and nonsynonymous mutation genes, base mutation and amino acid mutation sites, insertions, and deletions, which also indicates that the cytoplasm of 519B belongs to the common wheat cytoplasm.\n\n    A comparative analysis of K519A and 519B revealed that 104 SNPs were identified in the protein-coding sequence in 42 genes (Table 7). Among them, 73 were synonymous mutations, 31 were nonsynonymous mutations from 16 genes (atpB, atpI, ccsA, matK, ndhA, ndhF, ndhH, ndhK, psbB, psbH, rbcL, rpl14, rpl32, rpoB, rpoC2, and rps16), and the proportion of nonsynonymous mutations was 29.8% of the total mutations. Of non-synonymous mutation genes, the NADH dehydrogenase genes are the most, and four genes occur with mutations. The protein-coding gene with the largest difference between K519A and 519B sequences was the rpoC2 gene, and there were 13 SNPs with 5 amino acid differences.\n\n    To verify the accuracy of second-generation sequencing results, 31 nonsynonymous mutant sites from 16 genes, selected based on the results of the above alignment analysis, were identified via FGS technology. The corresponding primers were listed in Table 8, which were prefixed with FGS. It was concluded that the amino acids of the 16 genes were all consistent under the two methods. Some comparison results were listed in Figure 5.\n\n    The phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genomes of K519A, 519B, and another 100 species that have near relatives was performed (Figure 6). Bromus vulgaris was used as the outgroup. It was found that the species of the Aegilops genus and the Triticum genus were clustered in the largest number through phylogenetic analysis. Besides, four species of the Amblyopyrum genus were clustered into the Aegilops genus and a Taeniatherum genus cultivar was clustered into the Triticum genus. Then the Secale genus and the Elymus genus were clustered, but a species of the Thinopyrum genus and two species of the Dasypyrum genus were clustered in the Elymus genus. The relationships between the Hordeum genus and Aegilops genus were relatively distant. In the Eremopyrum genus, five other genus species were clustered. It was concluded that the chloroplasts of K519A and 519B were from two independent taxa, the chloroplast of 519B was closely related to the Triticum genus species. However, K519A was closely related to the Ae. kotschyi cultivar and other Aegilops species, which was consistent with the characteristic that K519A's cytoplasm was derived from Ae. kotschyi.\n\n    To further study the effect of nonsynonymous mutant genes in chloroplasts, we performed a qPCR analysis to assess the expression patterns of genes. According to the existing research results, we selected six nonsynonymous mutant genes (atpB, ccsA, matK, rbcL, rpoC2, and ndhH) for analysis of gene expression levels of K519A compared with 519B. The corresponding primers of qPCR are listed in Table 9. The efficiency of the qPCR primers calculated based on standard curve is 95.56-106.72% (Figure 7A).\n\n    It can be seen from the figures that the expression levels of all genes were downregulated at the binucleate and trinucleate stages, except that the rbcL gene was downregulated only at the trinucleate stage. Additionally, the rpoC2 gene was upregulated at the late uninucleate stage (Figure 7B).\n\n    To further study the relationship between chloroplast genes and fertility, several differentially expressed nonsynonymous mutant genes were selected for barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) in 519B. First, the primers used for gene silenced were designed (Table 10). The recombinant vector was then successfully constructed. Albinism occurred in the leaves after PDS-silencing (positive control) (Figure 8A). It was concluded that the seed setting rate of atpB-silenced plants (20.7%) was significantly reduced compared with the negative control (93.8%). Additionally, the seed setting rate of ndhH-silenced plants (24.5%) was significantly reduced compared with the negative control (93.8%) (Figure 8B) (Table 11). This indicates that atpB and ndhH were likely to participate in the fertility transformation of 519B.\n\n    Several spikelets at the binucleate stage were saved for qPCR. The primers for qPCR were listed in Table 10. Compared with the negative control individuals, the expression of atpB in the gene-silenced individuals was significantly reduced with atpB-qPCR primer, and the expression level was 0.31. After analysis of the reproduction of atpB-silenced fragment with atpB-VIGS primer, it was found that the reproduction efficiency was above 15,914. Compared with the negative control individuals, the expression of ndhH in the gene-silenced individuals was significantly reduced with ndhH-qPCR primer, and the expression level was 0.40. After analysis of the reproduction of ndhH-silenced fragment with ndhH-VIGS primer, it was found that the reproduction efficiency was above 21,283 (Figure 9).",
        "Conclusion": "    In this study, we obtained and analyzed the three chloroplast genomes of two male sterile lines and one maintainer line in wheat. Based on a comparative analysis, a total of 104 mutations were found in 42 genes. There were 16 genes with nonsynonymous mutations between K519A and 519B. There were no base mutations in the protein encoding genes between K519A and YS3038. The atpB, ccsA, matK, rbcL, rpoC2, and ndhH genes were mostly downregulated at the binucleate and trinucleate stages. AtpB and ndhH were likely to be involved in the reproductive transformation of 519B. The chloroplast genomes of 519B and K519A were closely related to the Triticum genus and Aegilops genus, respectively.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    The chloroplast genome sequencing technology has developed from the FGS to the current third-generation sequencing. Currently, most of the chloroplast genome sequences on NCBI are performed by second-generation sequencing technology. Due to the fast improvement of sequencing technology, this results in sequencing costs continually decreasing, thus chloroplast genome data is largely supplemented. In the past few decades, chloroplast studies have made a breakthrough. More than 2400 plant chloroplast genomes have been published in the NCBI database. Of which, the chloroplast genome of tobacco is the first genome to be sequenced in higher plants. The chloroplast genome encodes 100-120 genes, including 70-88 protein structural genes, 30-32 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes. According to the functional classification of chloroplast genes, they can be divided into three categories: the first are genes encoding photoreactive structural proteins, such as psaA, psbB, petD, etc. The second are the coding genes of energy metabolism-related enzymes, such as atpA, ndhB, rbcL, and other genes. The third are the encoding genes of the transcriptional translation system, mainly including the ribosome large subunit encoding RPL family, the ribosome small subunit encoding RPS family, the transport RNA encoding TRN family, and transport RNA polymerase encoding RPOA family, and so on. Besides, there are some genes whose functions have not yet been determined, such as the YCF family. Researches have shown that many genes of plant chloroplasts are involved in some important biological processes. For instance, Zhong et al. demonstrated that the chloroplast heat shock protein HSP21 is involved in plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP)-dependent transcription in Arabidopsis. Yu et al. found that the downregulated expression of ribosomal protein S1 (RPS1) in rps1 mutants negatively modulates the expression of heat-responsive gene HsfA2 and its target genes in Arabidopsis.\n\n    Our study completed the sequencing of the chloroplast genome of the K-type CMS K519A and maintainer 519B. This is similar to the chloroplast genome structure of most plants, which is a typical four-segment structure. The chloroplast genome of angiosperms belongs to maternal inheritance and is generally not affected by genetic recombination. The chloroplast genome is much smaller than the nuclear genome and there are more copies in normal cells, so the chloroplast genome is easy to obtain. Additionally, the structure and coding genes of the chloroplast genome are relatively conserved.\n\n    Molecular marker technology is to detect the polymorphism of DNA sequences based on PCR, which can directly compare the mutations of DNA sequences. With the continuous improvement of molecular biology technologies, it is becoming increasing mature and is applied in many research directions. Among the molecular markers, the SSR marker has high variability, codominant inheritance, easy operation, and easy analysis. It is widely used in genetic mapping construction, gene mapping, genetic diversity analysis, and variety identification of various crops. Stachel et al. successfully analyzed the genetic diversity of 60 wheat cultivated varieties originating from three agro-ecological zones using microsatellite markers. Salameh et al. used a molecular marker to transfer the resistant QTL (Fhb1) on the 5A chromosome into nine European winter wheat lines to develop new scab-resistant lines. Besides, Shim et al. sequenced the whole chloroplast genome of millet and compared it with other reported chloroplast genomes, and obtained 125 SSR loci and 34 indel changes, which can provide effective information for the phylogeny. In our study, there were 186 possible SSR repeat motifs in K519A and 188 possible SSR repeat motifs in 519B. The accuracy of SSR markers and the probability of polymorphism among individuals in a population or among species can only be known when these SSR markers are used for genotyping. Therefore, we will collect some experimental materials for analysis.\n\n    Some nuclear male sterility genes have been identified. For example, Xing et al. cloned the TaAPT2 gene related to thermo-sensitive sterility in wheat, and the gene expression levels of the young anthers, which during the fertility conversion stage, were significantly reduced under the sterile condition by Northern analysis, indicating that the TaAPT2 gene may be related to fertility. Xia et al. confirmed that the male sterile ms2 mutant in wheat was caused by an insertion of terminal-repeat retrotransposons in a miniature (TRIM) element in the promoter region of the Ms2 gene. In addition to this, some studies have shown that the deletion, duplication, or mutation of plant chloroplast DNA may cause the wrong transmission of genetic information between chloroplast, mitochondria and nucleus, leading to male sterility.\n\n    Some studies have found that some chloroplast genes in plants may affect the fertility of plants. For example, the matK gene is located in the intron of the chloroplast trnK gene. Jia et al. extracted DNA of abortive flower buds from the radish male sterile line BT-18 and normal flower buds using DD-PCR technology to study the differential expression of RNA between abortive and normal buds in radish. Additionally, it was found that the matK gene appeared three times in different primers of PCR amplification, and the amplification bands were enhanced in abortive buds, which showed upregulated expression, indicating that the abortion of radish buds had a great relationship with matK gene. Ou et al. studied the intron sequences of ORFs and rps16 genes in chloroplasts of different CMS lines in rice. Additionally, they found that in the gametophyte sterility line, the rps16 gene intron contains a GMTGAG sequence and a unique G at position 595, which can be used as a molecular marker to distinguish sporophytic sterility and gametophyte sterility. In this study, it was found that some genes had nonsynonymous mutant sites between K519A and 519B, and these genes might be related to male sterility.\n\n    The RNA polymerase is a key enzyme controlling chloroplast genomic transcription and gene expression. It is encoded by the copy genes rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, and rpoC2 genes. The alpha subunit and beta subunit of RNA polymerase are encoded by rpoA and rpoB genes, respectively, and the beta' and beta\" subunit by rpoC1 and rpoC2 genes. Chen et al. found a new chloroplast DNA deletion in the sorghum CMS line, which occurs in the middle of the rpoC2 gene, which may be associated with cytoplasmic male sterility in sorghum. We infer that nonsynonymous mutations of rpoB and rpoC2 genes may affect the production of beta and beta\" subunits of RNA polymerase.\n\n    In recent years, with the continuous completion of plant chloroplast genome sequencing, phylogenetic researches based on genes or chloroplast genomes have been greatly promoted. Kallersjo et al. utilized the rbcL chloroplast gene to analyze the phylogenetic relationship of 2538 species, covering the prokaryotic cyanobacteria to higher flowering plants, using the parsimony jackknife analysis method. Bruneau et al. analyzed the evolutionary relationship of 223 legume materials by analyzing the introns of the chloroplast trnl gene. Kim sequenced the chloroplast genome of Panax schinseng Nees and analyzed the evolutionary relationship of vascular plants. Liu analyzed and reported the chloroplast genome of Morella rubra and the evolution patterns of Fagales, proving that Myricaceae is a sister to Juglandaceae. By comparing the chloroplast genomes of rice, wheat, and maize, it was found that some hot parts of the genes were susceptible to mutation, and the tandem tRNA region was species-specific. Additionally, gene deletion of the IR region and the boundary characteristics of the IR region indicated that the genetic relationship between rice and wheat is closer than that of maize. Matsuoka et al. studied 106 genes in the chloroplast genome of rice, wheat, and maize, and found that 86.8% of the genes showed the same evolution rate.\n\n    In this study, it was found that the chloroplasts of 101 materials from 13 genera were closely related. From the perspective of evolutionary relationship, Hordeum was the first to evolve, followed by Eremopyrum, Henrardia, Australopyrum, Agropyron, Elymus, Thinopyrum, Dasypyrum, Secale, Aegilops speltoides, Triticum, Taeniatherum, Aegilops, and Amblyopyrum. Middleton et al. studied the phylogenetic relationships of the chloroplast genomes of 12 species and found that Hordeum vulgare divided into Secale cereale and wheat approximately 8-9 million years ago. It was consistent with this study. Saarela et al. carried out phylogeny analysis on the chloroplast genomes of Triticinae and found that the differentiation relationship was in the order of Hordeum jubatum, H. vulgare subsp. Vulgare, Connorochloa tenuis, Secale cereal, Taeniatherum caput-medusae, Ae. speltoides var. speltoides, T. timopheevii, T. aestivum, Triticum turgidum, Triticum macha, Triticum monococcum, Triticum urartu, Aegilops tauschii, Aegilops cylindrica, Aegilops geniculate, Aegilops longissima, Aegilops sharonensis, Aegilops bicornis, Ae. kotschyi, and Aegilops searsii. This is almost consistent with the evolutionary relationships we found in the 13 genera. In addition, the Triticum contained hexaploid wheat and four origin species of hexaploid wheat in this study. Additionally, the order of differentiation is T. timopheevii, T. Turgidum, T. urartu and T. monococcum. In comparison with these four genera, the differentiation of T. aestivum is not successively obvious and almost simultaneous. The evolutionary sequence of T. urartu and T. monococcum was just opposite to the results of Saarela et al., which may be due to the close relationship between the two species and the small differences in chloroplast genomes. In addition, previous studies found that the genome donors of hexaploid wheat diverged 2.1-2.9 million years ago. It is not difficult to see from the successful application of next-generation sequencing technology in the acquisition of chloroplast genomic data in recent years that the emergence of this new technology will greatly promote the development of chloroplast phylogenetic analysis, and the phylogenetic research of plants will have a bright prospect.",

        "Title": "    Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 Deficiency: Delayed or Permanent Hypomyelination?",
        "Abstract": "    Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency or the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS) is an X-linked psychomotor disability syndrome with around 320 clinical cases described worldwide. SLC16A2 gene mutations, encoding the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter MCT8, result in intellectual disability due to impaired TH uptake in the developing brain. MCT8 deficiency is a multi-organ affecting disease with a predominant neuronal cell-based pathology, with the glial component inadequately investigated. However, deficiency in myelin, a key component of white matter (WM) enabling fast nerve conduction, is a TH-dependent hallmark of the disease. Nevertheless, analysis of the myelin status in AHDS patients has led to conflicting interpretations. The majority of individual case studies reported delayed myelination, that was restored later in life. In contrast, post-mortem studies and high-resolution MRIs detected WM (micro-) abnormalities throughout adolescence, suggesting permanent hypomyelination. Thus, interpretations vary depending on methodology to investigate WM microstructure. Further, it is unknown whether the mutation within the MCT8 is linked to the severity of the myelin deficiency. Consequently, terminology is inconsistent among reports, and AHDS is occasionally misdiagnosed as another WM disorder. The evolutionary conserved TH signaling pathway that promotes the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes enabled deciphering how the lack of MCT8 might affect myelinogenesis. Linking patient findings on myelination to those obtained from models of MCT8 deficiency revealed underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, but knowledge gaps remain, notably how myelination progresses both spatially and temporally in MCT8 deficiency. This limits predicting how myelin integrity might benefit therapeutically, and when to initiate. A recurrent observation in clinical trials is the absence of neurological improvement. Testing MCT8-independent thyromimetics in models, and evaluating treatments used in other demyelinating diseases, despite different etiologies, is crucial to propose new therapeutic strategies combatting this devastating disease.",
        "Introduction": "    The Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS, OMIM #300523) is a very rare, X-linked psychomotor disability syndrome first described in 1944, almost exclusively affecting boys. The clinical picture of AHDS is diverse, including muscle wasting, hypotonia, spastic paraplegia, and severe intellectual disability with an IQ generally lower than 30. Patients often develop complications and are prone to infections, and consequently have a decreased life expectancy, although some have lived beyond the age of 60. A hallmark of the disease are abnormal thyroid hormone (TH) serum levels. AHDS patients have low thyroxine (3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine, or T4), high 3,5',3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and borderline-increased thyroid stimulating hormone levels.\n\n    Soon after the identification of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) as a highly-specific transmembrane TH transporter, inactivating mutations in the human SLC16A2 gene encoding MCT8 were linked to the altered TH levels detected in AHDS patients, now often referred to as the MCT8 deficiency syndrome. Since then, several point mutations, translocations and deletions have been described in more than 320 diagnosed AHDS patients worldwide, though many more are to be expected. It is estimated that up to 4% of the X-linked intellectual disability syndromes involve SLC16A2 mutations.\n\n    MCT8 facilitates cellular influx and efflux of the mainly inactive (pro)hormone T4 and the bioactive T3. The uptake of lipophilic THs is a prerequisite for T3 to bind to nuclear TH receptors and act on gene transcriptional activity. The amount of available T3 to bind receptors is additionally controlled by deiodinases (DIOs), either activating T4 into T3 (DIO2), or inactivating T4 into reverse T3, or T3 into T2 (DIO3). TH action is of vital importance for the development of many organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). Genome-wide studies in rodent brains revealed hundreds of TH target genes whose expression is directly and indirectly regulated through dynamic interactions of (un)liganded TH receptors with chromatin and DNA, as well as through epigenetic modifications. A strict spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression underlies the highly orchestrated development of the human CNS that occurs over a period of many years up to adolescence, and continues throughout life in some brain regions. Animal studies showed that THs orchestrate many cellular processes underlying the foundation of the CNS cyto-architecture, including cell proliferation, cell fate decisions, migration and differentiation, but also maturation including axogenesis, synaptogenesis and myelinogenesis.\n\n    A key developmental process regulated by TH is myelination. Neuronal axons in the vertebrate CNS with a diameter > 0.4 mum are encapsulated by myelin enabling faster electrical conduction over relatively long distances. Any damage to the white matter (WM) has devastating consequences for neural connectivity, impairing neurological performance and motor-coordination. Myelin is a lipid-rich (fatty) substance, giving it a white appearance in post-mortem tissue, hence the name WM for myelinated CNS regions. In humans, the peak of myelination occurs primarily during the first 2 years after birth, and is quasi complete at 5 years of age, but continues until early adulthood in some regions like the frontal cortex. Myelination follows a fixed temporal-spatial pattern, with axons in the brain stem being the first to be myelinated, followed by those in the cerebellum, and finally the cerebral cortex. Compact myelin is a hallmark of the CNS of craniates that allowed the expansion and diversification of the vertebrate subphylum. Furthermore, it is a well-known TH-dependent process, and associates with a neonatal peak in TH levels detected in all vertebrates. Accordingly, congenital hypothyroidism, resulting from an ineffective thyroid gland at birth, is characterized by delayed myelination. Treating new-borns with levothyroxine can restore myelination progress, showing that TH is a key player modulating myelin integrity.\n\n    Impaired myelination is also a common trait in AHDS patients, the majority of them having an abnormal WM content during the 1st years after birth. However, as discussed herein, conflicting interpretations among case reports and brain imaging analyzes, reporting the myelin deficiency as either delayed or permanent, impede the unequivocal classification of AHDS within the broad family of demyelinating disorders. Consequently, there is sometimes an inconsistent use of terminology in different studies. A detailed description of the myelin phenotype is still missing in patient's later life, but also in animal models that replicate various aspects of the human disease. This complicates correct diagnosis of new AHDS patients and hampers prognosis of the extent to which the deficit in myelin might benefit from a potential treatment. Several MCT8-independent thyromimetics, currently tested to combat the peripheral thyrotoxicosis due to the excess of circulating T3 levels, might also improve myelination if their cellular mode of action is thoroughly understood, and if they can be administered early enough to obtain a maximal response.\n\n    Here, we review recent literature data to clarify the myelin deficit associated with AHDS and models of MCT8 deficiency. We also discuss potential mechanisms to investigate how the lack of MCT8 could hamper myelination, and we provide insights on MCT8-independent TH analogs and other drugs as promising candidates for myelin repair therapies.\n\n    To classify AHDS correctly within the broad group of demyelinating disorders, it is imperative to use correct terminology. Clinical myelin disorders have been subdivided according to WM appearance and developmental progression, mostly assessed using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A leukoencephalopathy is any clinical neurological disorder characterized by abnormal development or degeneration of WM in the CNS. In particular, a leukodystrophy is a congenital leukoencephalopathy, i.e., with a genetic etiology. The fact that myelination primarily takes place during the first 2 years of postnatal life means it is important to determine whether a congenital myelination deficit is permanent or delayed. If the same pattern of myelination is observed in at least two MRIs, taken > 6 months apart in a child older than 1 year, the paucity is considered permanent and referred to as \"permanent hypomyelination\". Whenever progress in myelination or WM content can be observed within this time interval, it is defined as \"delayed myelination\".\n\n    During the Delphi convention in 2015, leukodystrophy experts redefined and subdivided the WM disorders into two new groups. The first group comprises the \"leukodystrophies.\" These are defined as WM disorders, with glial cells being the main cause of the pathology and myelin sheath abnormalities the most apparent feature. The second group are the \"genetic leukoencephalopathies\" (gLEs), characterized by neuronal cell pathologies and/or by other systemic disease manifestations, whereby WM abnormalities are subordinate to the neurological component of the disease.\n\n    To determine whether myelination is delayed or permanent in AHDS patients, data on WM status and progression is needed. Azzolini et al. performed a meta-analysis of the myelin status in 32 diagnosed AHDS patients from January 2004 until December 2012, and also reported a new case. We build on this list, citing cases found up until December 2019 and taking case reports into account that described the WM phenotype. We employed a similar search strategy to using the following search terms: \"MCT8\" and \"mutation,\" \"SLC16A2\" and \"mutation,\" \"Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome,\" \"AHDS\" and \"case report,\" \"AHDS\" and \"MRI\" and \"myelination.\" We found an additional 18 peer-reviewed articles reporting on 61 patients for whom MRI was used to assess myelin status in the brain (Table 1). Hence, we had MRI data on 94 AHDS patients in total, representing roughly a quarter of all known cases. We only included data on a patient's last MRI to simplify the analysis (Figure 1). Four patients from Remerand et al. were excluded, since it was unclear whether the WM profile was normal or abnormal for their last MRI. We divided the remaining 90 patients in groups younger than 2 years old (2 year-olds included), between 2 and 6 years old (6 year-olds included), and those older than 6 years. Two years was chosen as a first cut-off point based on, stating that it is difficult to evaluate a myelination deficit before the age of 2 years when the myelination process is still ongoing. The age of 6 years was chosen as an arbitrary cut-off given that myelination is virtually complete by 5 years.\n\n    Abnormal or delayed myelination was evident in 84% of the patients <= 2 years of age. Of the AHDS patients with MRI data that were older than 2 and <= 6 years of age 63% displayed some form of myelination delay. The percentage was reduced to 33% in patients older than 6 years (Figure 1), although the latter group consisted of only 27 patients. Thus, there tends to be a very slow but gradual improvement in myelin status in the patient cohort during this developmental period. A gradual progression in WM status was also observed in several of the patients that underwent sequential MRIs (Table 1). This finding defines MCT8 deficiency as a special case. Pouwels et al., with their long-time experience of demyelination studies, suggested that whenever deficient myelination is still observable in 2 year olds, it seems unlikely a child will ever display a normal WM content. The observed progression is developmental in nature and not a case of spontaneous regeneration of myelin, since no partially remyelinating sites, also called shadow plaques, were observed that are otherwise typical in myelinating disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\n\n    Remarkably, some patients never acquire a completely normal WM content, even after several years. Even though older patients more likely have normal myelination, some MRI data show no normalization in patients above the age of 10 [e.g., ] (Figure 2). Clear signs of hypomyelination were also found during a post-mortem histological exam of the brain of a deceased 11-years-old AHDS boy. Inadequate myelination also coincides with several functional outcomes observed in AHDS patients, such as muscle dystonia, spastic paraplegia with poor head and limb control. A previous comparison of MRI data even identified three patients with a worsening myelin phenotype, and Remerand et al. also described three deteriorating cases out of their 24 patient cohort. The two patients examined in Anik et al. clearly illustrate the discrepancy among patients as a function of age: the two boys of the second investigated family are 6 months and 6 years old, but only the older boy displays hypomyelination.\n\n    In this last case, the myelin status differs extensively despite the brothers sharing the same 2.8 kb deletion in the SLC16A2 gene that results in a complete loss of MCT8 uptake activity due to the lack of exons 3 and 4. This case prompts the question whether or not a genotype-phenotype relationship exists between the type of gene mutation, its impact on MCT8 protein structure and function, and the severity of the myelin deficiency. In vitro cultures using human-derived fibroblasts, or JEG3- and COS9-cells previously identified several point mutations that resulted in residual TH uptake activity. These mutations are often associated with milder neurocognitive phenotypes in patients [e.g., ]. Other point mutations affecting proper substrate binding, trafficking or folding [e.g., ], as well as large deletions, substitutions or premature stop-codons, render the MCT8 protein completely inactive, and result in severe mental and motor disabilities [e.g., ].\n\n    Remerand and co-workers determined that for a group of AHDS patients for which radio- and neurological features were available in literature, 27% of them presented with moderate-to-mild intellectual disability, irrespective of age. However, how the type of mutation in each of these patients differentially affects MCT8 uptake activity is unknown. A genotype-phenotype relationship is expected for MCT8 mutations and the neurocognitive outcome, but a general trend has yet to be uncovered. Data on WM status in particular are currently too fragmentary to identify a potential link with the kind of mutation and the severity of the myelin deficiency.\n\n    More detailed MRI examinations also revealed that while the general WM structure seems intact as a whole, subtle localized myelin abnormalities might go unnoticed. Matheus and colleagues found a normally myelinated corpus callosum in three 6-years-old AHDS patients, but distinct tracts remained inadequately myelinated. The hypomyelination of subcortical U-fibers and periventricular tracts even became more discernible. This is corroborated by several other reports mentioning local, more subtle WM abnormalities too, as for instance in the periventricular WM tracts and indicates regionally hypomyelinated areas may still be present in later life. Similar microstructural WM abnormalities were also observed in children with severe congenital hypothyroidism. This indicates that a global brain MRI is insufficient to discern between \"normal\" vs. \"abnormal\" myelination, and advocates a high-resolution and regional examination of the myelin status of the entire brain, and by extension the spinal cord.\n\n    Future studies employing a more accurate exploration of the WM phenotype by MRI imaging at regular time intervals would reveal if, and how fast exactly myelination improves in AHDS patients. Whenever possible, additional post-mortem analyses should include accurate WM examinations. Clinical data from newly discovered patients extend the database, and could unmask subgroups responding differently to MCT8 deficiency, or could uncover mutations harboring individual-specific traits related to myelination, or even other clinical features. An important observation is that in the patients that do exhibit a gradual increase in myelination, neurological functions do not improve. This suggests persistent neuronal problems throughout the CNS as being the main cause of abnormal sensorimotor functioning, although one can also not rule out a significant impact of poor feeding and extensive muscle wasting. Here too, additional MRI imaging examining the spinal cord WM should be performed to rule out any problems in electrical conductance along downstream axonal tracts. Moreover, novel brain imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) used to image progression of WM lesions in MS could provide new ways to dynamically follow up myelination.\n\n    The enigmatic myelin phenotype accompanying MCT8 deficiency impedes the unequivocal classification of AHDS into a distinct group of WM disorders (Table 2), and it leads to unintentional inconsistencies in literature. For instance, Charzewska et al. proposed to classify it as a leukodystrophy, whereas Barkovich et al. did not include it in their list of \"hypomyelinating disorders\", while Remerand et al. described the myelin deficit as hypomyelination. Furthermore, the unawareness of changing clinical terminology has led to occasionally mixed use of the terms \"delayed\" and \"hypomyelination\" in animal research too (see section myelin deficiency in animal models of MCT8 deficiency: permanent or delayed?). At the Delphi convention, AHDS was categorized as a gLE. This classification is justified if delayed myelination is indeed a typical hallmark during the 1st years of development, but eventually becomes a non-pathognomonic trait if myelin formation recovers.\n\n    That would also mean that AHDS differs from the group of leukodystrophies displaying permanent hypomyelination without any progress noticeable on sequential MRIs. An example is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD) most often caused by duplications in the PLP1 gene that encodes two primary components of myelin. In PMD, brain regions are permanently hypomyelinated and patients suffer from muscle hypotonia, ataxia, and speech problems.\n\n    However, 11% of patients originally diagnosed with PMD had mutations in the SLC16A2 gene, indicating WM status itself is insufficient as a diagnostic marker. In addition, while AHDS is considered primarily as a neuronal cell-based pathology, a criterion for classifying it as a gLE, the glial component remains poorly investigated. It is however almost certain that glial cell types are affected in MCT8 deficiency (see section discovering underlying mechanisms: the oligodendroglial cell and the lack of MCT8), which is a typical hallmark of a leukodystrophy (Table 2). It might therefore be diagnostically more interesting to characterize AHDS as a hypomyelinating disorder, allowing it's integration into a new proposed classification system for leukodystrophies. As such, severe cases of myelin deficiency or ambiguous MRIs will require additional genetic and serum TH level testing as conclusive diagnostic criteria to discriminate between AHDS and other WM disorders such as PMD. That accelerates finding a diagnosis for many undiagnosed patients, but is also crucial to anticipate on how and when to therapeutically intervene. An earlier intervention might increase chances of a maximal response.\n\n    A crucial aspect of vertebrate brain evolution was the appearance of myelin, enabling fast electrical conduction across axons spanning increased distances with CNS expansion. TH levels peak during neonatal stages during which myelination processes occurs. The evolutionary conserved TH signaling pathways are thus an asset for studying how MCT8 deficiency might hamper TH-dependent myelination in animal models and AHDS patients.\n\n    In the CNS, myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, a glial cell type that also provides trophic support for neurons. While myelination occurs mainly postnatally in vertebrates, the pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is established during pre- and perinatal development. The premature CNS consists of multipotent neural stem cells that generate a pool of OPCs (gliogenic wave) after the neurogenic wave. These OPCs can further differentiate into oligodendrocytes, which can mature into fully functional, myelinating oligodendrocytes.\n\n    Decades of research revealed that TH action on OPCs and oligodendrocytes is strongly conserved [for a comprehensive review, see ]. Classic experiments in the 90s using in vitro OPC cultures derived from optic nerves collected from neonatal rats showed that T3 inhibits OPC proliferation in the presence of mitogens, induces differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes, and facilitates the formation of myelin extensions. Subsequent experiments showed that T3 stimulates OPC cell cycle exit by binding to the increasingly expressed TH receptor alpha1, while its interaction with TH receptor beta induces timely expression of genes crucial for normal oligodendrogenesis and myelinogenesis. Important direct target genes include myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP) and Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9).\n\n    The crucial role of TH in promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro echoes the in vivo need of adequate TH levels for proper oligodendrogenesis in the CNS. Induction of hypothyroidism in postnatal rodents reduced oligodendrocyte numbers and delayed oligodendrocyte maturation, leading to insufficient myelination in several brain regions such as the anterior commissure and the corpus callosum. A recent study showed that both transient postnatal (from postnatal day 0 - 21) and permanent hypothyroidism in methimazole-treated rats decreased the number of myelinated axons in the anterior commissure at postnatal day 150, while the number of unmyelinated axons slightly increased. Since prenatal hypothyroidism in rats did not alter the total number of axons in the anterior commissure, it can be concluded that the ratio of unmyelinated vs. myelinated axons increased. The axons that were myelinated had similar g-ratios (reflecting the ratio of the myelin sheath thickness relative to the axon diameter). This suggests that in TH-depleted conditions, some axons might fail to reach a threshold diameter required to induce myelination. Importantly, a short T4 pulse from postnatal day 15-21 during the period of postnatal hypothyroidism did not restore the myelin deficiency at postnatal day 150, emphasizing the vulnerability of myelin integrity to endocrine changes during this crucial developmental window.\n\n    The key role of THs in myelination is also evident in human cases of maternal hypothyroxinemia and congenital hypothyroidism. Children born to hypothyroxinemic mothers have significantly smaller corpus callosums, demonstrating that maternal THs during the first half of pregnancy, when the fetal thyroid gland is not yet functional, already promote cellular events that later drive myelination. Children with severe congenital hypothyroidism displayed poorer hearing and communication skills that could be directly correlated to disrupted WM microstructural integrity. WM abnormalities were present despite early postnatal treatment with levothyroxine, again underlining the importance of the developmental period for normal myelination. Lastly, maternal T4 levels during early pregnancy correlate with a higher gray to WM ratio in childhood, indicating that reaching optimal WM content requires strictly controlled TH levels. While these studies collectively illustrate that TH signaling during the fetal period is essential for later WM status, myelination is a protracted process particularly in primates, expanding the period to which WM development might be susceptible to altered TH levels, or responsive to treatment, up to adolescence.\n\n    Knowing how TH promotes the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes allows understanding how a lack of MCT8 could interfere with this process. Several rodent studies showed how MCT8 expression changes in oligodendroglial lineage cells during development. RNA-Seq analysis on the postnatal mouse brain showed enrichment of MCT8 mRNA transcripts primarily in OPCs, but also in newly differentiated oligodendrocytes. In more mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, OATP3A1 was the only potential TH transporter expressed. Another transcriptome analysis revealed MCT10 transcripts in mature oligodendrocytes of the postnatal day 21 mouse brain. In the developing rat cerebellum, the myelination markers OLIG1 and PDGFRalpha were expressed strongly at perinatal stages, while MBP mRNA expression and protein levels increased at postnatal day 14 when high levels of circulating THs are detected. These temporal expression patterns of important myelin markers coincided with moderately decreased MCT8 mRNA expression and strongly elevated expression levels of DIO2 vs. DIO3 during the first two postnatal weeks, all strictly regulating TH availability.\n\n    Turning to human evidence, MCT8 was also enriched in immature OPCs and pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes derived from the NKX2.1-GFP human embryonic stem cell (ESC) line, suggesting MCT8 could enable T3 uptake during the maturation phase. A transcriptome analysis on human brain cell types also demonstrated moderate MCT8 expression in mature oligodendrocytes. Using immunohistochemistry, one paper suggested MCT8 protein expression in oligodendrocytes of healthy human brain tissue. Furthermore, inadequate TH uptake due to the lack of a functional MCT8 protein in cultured human ESCs prohibited OPC cell cycle exit and maturation into oligodendrocytes. Hence, it is likely that a lack of MCT8 at the OPC level strongly reduces intracellular T3 action, blocking the switch from OPC to mature and myelinating oligodendrocytes.\n\n    Of note, impaired TH uptake might even occur before TH reaches the oligodendroglial cell membrane. Animal and in vitro models of MCT8 deficiency (see section myelin deficiency in animal models of MCT8 deficiency: permanent or delayed?) indicate a crucial role for MCT8 in TH uptake at the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and probably also the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In addition, one cannot exclude that a lack of MCT8 also affects OPC generation during embryonic development. Unfortunately, no immunohistochemical data were provided for the presence of MCT8 protein in OPCs in a set of prenatal post mortem human brains, although MCT8 was widely expressed in several other cell types including radial glia progenitors. The latter finding was recently also observed in neural progenitors in human brain organoid cultures.\n\n    The observation that myelination still progresses in most AHDS patients, albeit at a slow rate, implies that intracellular TH levels might however not be completely depleted in the MCT8-deficient brain, in contrast to deeply hypothyroid brains, which probably never reach a normal WM content. Since in vitro cellular assays demonstrate that most mutations render the MCT8 protein completely inactive, OPCs could be supplied with THs via alternative routes. One possibility is via the T4-selective organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1), expressed in radial glial cells for THs supplied by the cerebrospinal fluid during early development. OATP1C1 was not found to be expressed in relevant amounts elsewhere in the human pre- and perinatal brain except for the hypothalamic region. Therefore, other transporters, such as MCT10 and the large amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and LAT2, for which expression patterns in the developing human brain are still largely unexplored, might play a role in TH uptake at the OPC membrane itself. If such an alternative oligodendroglial TH transporter(s) exists, it should probably be able to take up T3, since the majority of T3 for neurons and other cell types is generated by DIO2 in astrocytes. Mouse brain OPCs express some DIO2, but mature oligodendrocytes in the postnatal brain do not. So far, there is no data on DIO2 expression in human brain oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Sufficient T3 uptake could induce cell-cycle exit and differentiation of some OPCs promoting slow but gradual myelination. An emerging aspect herein is that the oligodendrocyte differentiation potential changes as function of age, questioning whether OPCs still respond the same to cues in later life.\n\n    Together, these data suggest that MCT8 is a key cellular component driving TH-dependent oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Impaired oligodendrogenesis caused by MCT8 deficiency could therefore functionally impair nerve conduction and thus, contributing to at least some psychomotor problems observed in AHDS.\n\n    So far, several genetically altered vertebrates mimic at least some of the characteristics of MCT8 deficiency [for a review, see ]. The relevance of mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrate models relies on the fact that TH action during neurodevelopment is highly conserved amongst the vertebrate subphylum. The involvement of THs in regulation of the oligodendroglial pathway is universal and conserved throughout evolution. Even though some differences might occur in vivo due to imperfect sequence homology, and slight alterations in protein stability and substrate selection, MCT8 orthologues of zebrafish, chicken, mice, and humans possess similar transport characteristics. The myelin deficit associated with AHDS was explored in some animal models of MCT8 deficiency.\n\n    The Mct8 knockout (KO) mouse was the first available model to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AHDS. It reproduces the altered TH serum levels found in AHDS patients, making it an excellent model for the peripheral component of the disease. However, Mct8 KO mice have a normal brain morphology, a normal myelin content as evaluated on frontal brain sections, and only mildly altered neurological and locomotor behavior. The current consensus is that other TH transporters, notably the highly enriched OATP1C1 at the murine BBB, are able to ensure T4 uptake that via astrocyte-dependent DIO2 provides sufficient T3 to neural cells. In contrast, OATP1C1 is only very faintly expressed at the human BBB. The generation of Mct8/Oatp1c1 double KO mice was thus essential to replicate the neurological component of AHDS.\n\n    Genetic deletion of both Mct8 and Oatp1c1 blocked TH uptake by 90%, rendering mice strongly hypothyroid in the CNS, allowing studying the impact on brain structure and function. These Mct8/Oatp1c1 double KO mice displayed pronounced hypomyelination, notably in the corpus callosum as corroborated by the observations of thinner WM tracts, consistent with findings in AHDS patients. A reduction in FluoroMyelin-stained axons and a lower MBP fluorescent signal intensity on frontal brain sections reflected a hypomyelinated status, suggesting impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation.\n\n    Electron-microscope observations revealed many unmyelinated axons, hampering their conductance, thereby contributing to the neurological deficits and locomotor behavioral impairments. The study provided evidence that the myelination deficit is probably permanent given the absence of a normal WM structure at postnatal day 180. Remarkably, the few axons that were myelinated had a normal myelin thickness, but whether or not this was directly related to axonal diameter was not investigated. This was also observed in postnatal hypothyroid mice, and again indicates that the axonal diameter surpassing a certain threshold is a crucial prerequisite for myelination. This observation suggests that MCT8 deficiency increases the ratio of unmyelinated vs. myelinated axons, but might not affect the myelin sheath itself, i.e., how much myelin per axon is produced. Since ~10% of the normal TH levels were preserved in the brain, some oligodendrocytes could thus still take up TH in absence of both transporters, and myelinate axons appropriately. This implies that OPCs express other secondary TH transporters although RNA-Seq analysis of rodent brain cells only showed low expression of several uncharacterized TH transporters. Above all, these findings question whether the myelin deficit is a specific problem of a too small axon diameter, or whether is it caused by blocked OPC differentiation, and requires further investigation. Another possibility is that the fraction of oligodendrocytes still able to myelinate under MCT8-deficient conditions represents a unique subpopulation with a specific (epi)genetic signature, or one that functions more independently of MCT8. Purifying these subpopulations and performing high-throughput analysis should provide more answers.\n\n    The Dio2/Mct8 double KO mouse represents another interesting model. Following T4 uptake by OATP1C1 at the BBB, increased DIO2 activity in astrocytes provides sufficient T3 for transport to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Therefore, eliminating both genes depletes T3 levels in various brain regions, in a slightly different manner than the Mct8/Oatp1c1 double KO mouse. If OPCs express TH transporters other than MCT8 and OATP1C1, loss of DIO2 might prevent astrocyte-dependent T3 supply to cells, resulting in more profound intracellular hypothyroidism. In that case, one can expect a more severe myelin deficiency in Dio2/Mct8 double KO mice.\n\n    Several zebrafish models were established to investigate the role of TH regulators in development thanks to the zebrafish genetic and physiological similarities with mammalian counterparts, amongst which the thyroid axis [for a review, see ]. The myelination process is also strikingly similar to that of mammals. OPCs are generated at day 1 of the 3-day long embryonic development, and following migration form myelinating oligodendrocytes at hatching [i.e., 3 days post-fertilization (3 dpf)]. During this period, a first TH peak occurs. Then, myelination starts and myelinated axons are clearly distinguishable in 7 dpf larvae. Mct8 is expressed in most oligodendrocytes throughout the zebrafish CNS from 3 dpf onwards. The Mct8-deficient zebrafish, first generated by knocking down and then by knocking out mct8, was the first alternative non-mammalian model for AHDS.\n\n    The expression of several genes related to oligodendrogenesis was significantly affected in mct8-/- zebrafish. Increased olig2 expression together with decreased mbp, p0, and plpb1 expression during post-hatch development suggested a block in OPC differentiation to mature oligodendrocytes, corroborated by reduced oligodendrocyte numbers in the CNS, including the spinal cord. The oligodendrocytes that still developed in a Mct8-absent environment generated fewer extensions, suggesting that associated physiological functions could be impaired. Locomotor activity, sleep-awake cycles and responses to light/dark stimuli were abnormal, but could have also been caused by microscopic structural alterations of sensory and motor neurons including reduced axon branching and synaptic density. Thus, it remains unknown to what extent behavioral deficits in these mct8-/- fish are a direct consequence of the myelination impairment. An increased number of Schwann cells could indicate that myelination of the peripheral nervous system is hampered too. However, the myelin status of nerve axons of the peripheral nervous system has never been explored neither in AHDS patients, nor in any animal model of MCT8 deficiency. Another striking observation was the persistent dysregulated expression of TH-responsive genes related to myelination in the adult mct8-/- zebrafish brain, though no data is available on oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. It is therefore uncertain whether myelination is delayed or persistent in these mutants, although the term hypomyelination is commonly used.\n\n    It is clear that data on myelination phenotypes in animal models of MCT8 deficiency gave preliminary insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms, but so far remain incomplete. We do not know if myelination is delayed or permanent in adult Mct8-deficient zebrafish or 1-year-old Mct8/Oatp1c1 double KO mice, and the myelin status in other models of MCT8 deficiency still requires further examination. A more thorough investigation of myelination in different CNS regions such as the cerebral cortex and spinal cord are necessary to obtain a more detailed picture of myelin progression. The corpus callosum is often investigated as a reference region for brain WM status, because this large structure is easy discernible and primarily composed of interhemispheric WM tracts. However, it is known that under transient hypothyroid conditions, neural stem cells in the adjacent dorsal subventricular zone generate new OPCs that can populate the corpus callosum and provide functional remyelination in 3-months-old mice. It therefore remains uncertain to what extent the myelin status of the corpus callosum reflects the WM status of the entire CNS, especially under MCT8-deficient conditions.\n\n    Another major unresolved issue is to what extent the lack of MCT8 in both OPCs and oligodendrocytes and the resulting myelin deficit explain motor and behavioral defects. Lack of TH uptake in global knockouts such as the Mct8/Oatp1c1 double KO mouse affects nearly all CNS cell types controlling sensorimotor functions, and therefore do not allow addressing how deficient myelination contributes to altered behavior. Use of single cell type genetic technologies such as conditional KO mice or zebrafish lacking MCT8 or both MCT8 and OATP1C1 in OPCs/oligodendrocytes could enable isolating neuronal or neuro-muscular defects caused by pathologies linked to other cell types. Measuring electric potentials across major axonal tracts might also help to identify impaired neuromuscular communication. Models, such as in vitro induced pluripotent stem cell-based OPC cultures comparing healthy and MCT8-deficient patients, or human ESCs have also been used. To these approaches, one could add Crispr-Cas9 techniques to induce specific gene mutations thereby delivering important insights on oligodendrogenesis and myelination, as well as to identify genotype-phenotype relationships. Another powerful in vitro model includes investigating the myelination process in co-cultures of neurons and oligodendrocytes.\n\n    The neurological symptoms associated with MCT8 deficiency severely affect quality of life and decrease life expectancy. Enhancing myelination is a promising endpoint to alleviate many of the neurological symptoms. The therapeutic aim is to restore intracellular TH action in TH-deprived cells, while avoiding side effects in other euthyroid or non-target cells. For OPCs and pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, this strategy aims to normalize expression of key TH-target genes such as KLF9, MPB, PLP, and other candidates to promote proliferation, differentiation and maturation of oligodendroglial cells. Using animal models, different TH analogs could potentially improve or even reverse certain symptoms. Several of them have also gathered interest as potential therapeutic agents to alleviate the symptoms of AHDS patients. These compounds must meet several a priori requirements. They should be taken up independently of MCT8, have thyromimetic actions by binding to nuclear TH receptors alpha and beta, and be metabolized and excreted in a similar fashion to THs. However, the transporter(s) responsible for TH analogue in- and efflux remain(s) to be fully identified.\n\n    Table 3 summarizes all available data on myelination following the use of TH analogs and other therapeutic strategies in models of MCT8 deficiency and human patients. Some general trends arise from these pilot experiments. First, physiological doses of T3 alone were not able to mediate any measurable effects on myelination in in vivo models, but remain necessary to confirm the lack of uptake by MCT8 or another secondary transporter. An exception was a high dose of T3 that could rescue oligodendrocyte numbers during zebrafish embryonic development, probably because a functional BBB was not yet developed at this stage. Irrespectively, T3 will never provide a therapeutic option due to its severe side effects in off target organs, such as the heart and liver. Second, the dosage of TH analogue(s) is critical. Administration of a high (400 nM) but not a low dose (50 nM) of 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) from postnatal day 1 to 12 to Mct8/Oatp1c1 double KO mice improved myelination in the cerebral cortex, as analyzed at postnatal day 12. The dose eventually applied in human trials will be a delicate trade-off between beneficial and adverse effects, and also depends on the half-life of a given compound. In the case of Triac, the half-life is ~6 h in humans, which limits its therapeutic use, even though it was already successfully used on a long-term in patients with TH receptor beta mutations that suffer from the resistance to TH syndrome. Three,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid, or Tetrac, has been proposed as an alternative TH analogue with a half-life in the order of several days, but there is far less experience with this drug in animal research and clinical settings. Thirdly, zebrafish experiments showed that the developmental period during which a drug is administered could differentiate between improved oligodendrogenesis or no effect, as already shown above for T3. For instance, an Mct8-expressing construct in the endothelial cells of the BBB successfully restored oligodendrocyte numbers, but only when it was transfected in later post-hatch development.\n\n    Currently, in animal models there are no evaluations of long-term effects following administration of a TH analogue, nor whether rescuing effects at the cellular level translate into improved functional and behavioral outcomes directly related to improved myelination. Here too, evaluating the effects of TH analogue treatments might be more straightforward in conditional KO models. Another promising approach comprised in vitro administration of the TH analogue 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid or Ditpa, to cultured human NKX2.1-GFP ESCs reprogrammed to become oligodendrocytes (Table 3). Ditpa rescued T3-dependent OPC cell-cycle exit and differentiation into oligodendrocytes that were both absent in MCT8-deprived cultures. This indicates that T3 uptake in human OPCs is strongly MCT8-dependent, and that Ditpa is taken up via another TH transporter. Furthermore, Ditpa also inhibited apoptosis of oligodendrocytes and stimulated myelination. Importantly, Ditpa crosses the placental barrier in mice showing its potential for prenatal treatment.\n\n    The beneficial effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination of some other treatments that have already been evaluated in other demyelinating diseases [for excellent reviews, see ] might hold potential for MCT8 deficiency too, despite different aetiologies. In Mct8 KO zebrafish, early administration of the antihistamine drug clemastine also partially rescued oligodendrocyte numbers and myelin-related gene expression (Table 3). Similarly, clemastine stimulated OPC proliferation, differentiation and oligodendrocyte maturation in the prefrontal cortex of socially isolated mice that suffer from demyelination, and it also successfully promoted remyelination in animal models of the demyelinating disease MS that is characterized by a loss of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and locomotor deficits.\n\n    Another promising drug is sobetirome, also called GC-1, and its CNS-selective prodrug Sob-AM2, a methyl amide derivative. The latter crosses the BBB and is converted into the active compound by the CNS-specific enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase, limiting side-effects in peripheral organs. An additional advantage of the prodrug is that it produces increased brain sobetirome levels as compared to equimolar doses of sobetirome. Sobetirome is a TH receptor beta agonist, previously tested as a drug to combat hypercholesterolemia. Sobetirome had myelin-promoting effects by stimulating myelin-associated gene expression and oligodendrocyte differentiation in mouse and human in vitro cultures, but also in several mouse brain regions during development. The drug was successful in partially remyelinating brain areas in mouse models of MS.\n\n    Thus, clemastine and sobetirome are two interesting candidates for testing their effects on myelination in MCT8 deficiency models. Sob-AM2 showed already promising thyromimetic effects on gene expression in the brain of Mct8 KO and Mct8/Dio2 double KO mice. Other drugs already commercially available or in preparation for testing in MS models, or stem cell-based treatments proposed for PMD patients might extend to MCT8 deficiency models too. A last promising therapy would only apply to patients carrying SLC16A2 mutations (e.g., DeltaPhe501) that lead to specific MCT8 protein folding defects and reduced uptake activity. In vitro experiments showed that the drug phenylbutyrate can stabilize the misfolded MCT8 protein and restore TH uptake. It will be interesting to see whether this compound can rescue the myelin deficit and neurological manifestations in mouse models carrying these specific mutations.\n\n    Turning to clinical trials, TH analogs have shown potential in AHDS patients to combat the peripheral effects of thyrotoxicosis [e.g., and Triac trial I: NCT02060474], but have so far proven largely inadequate in improving patients' mental status. However, the youngest patients might still benefit from treatment: a clinical trial using Triac in the youngest new-borns is currently underway (Triac trial II: NCT02396459). Other TH analogs were tested in small cohorts of AHDS patients, but only one study included an examination of the myelin status. Two out of 4 patients that received increasing doses of Ditpa from 2 years on, showed improved myelination at 47 months of age (Table 3). However, given that myelination improves in many patients during the early years of childhood (Figures 1, 2), the authors could not conclude whether Ditpa was responsible for this progress. Nevertheless, restoring TH action could relieve the quasi-blocked oligodendroglial maturation and myelination at the cellular level, and thus it seems interesting to incorporate this parameter into a more extensive study like the Triac trial that includes more detailed MRI examinations in a larger cohort.\n\n    It is also unknown to what extent the embryonic neural stem cell and OPC populations are affected by the central hypothyroidism caused by the mutated MCT8 protein. In mice, the pre- and perinatal period includes the generation of the OPC pool that will persist throughout life within the parenchyma and occurs before and during a postnatal TH peak. In the human brain, many cell types express regulators of cellular TH availability from embryonic stages onwards. Thus, shifting the treatment window toward a period before birth could increase the efficacy of TH-replacement therapies. Triac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in pregnant women, but there are scarce data regarding safety and dose range. In one case, prenatal Triac therapy successfully treated fetal hypothyroidism due to resistance to TH syndrome, although some complications occurred at birth. Apart from the risk of major side effects, ethical and methodological issues are raised for human use. Treatments should target and therefore ameliorate the CNS phenotype to avoid worsening the condition of other body organs that suffer from thyrotoxicosis. Furthermore, epidemiological data indicate that subtle hypo- and hyperthyroidism during CNS development can lead to adverse effects on gray matter and WM content. Further research along the entire developmental period is necessary to understand the interplay between THs and MCT8 in the oligodendroglial lineage and how that mediates myelination.",

        "Conclusion": "    This review underlines the degree of inconsistency existing in the literature on how to classify AHDS amongst the diverse group of WM disorders. One the one hand, this is a consequence of variation amongst patient cases, most showing a gradual improvement of myelination, some still reporting WM abnormalities after several years. On the other hand, MRI studies are not always performed in detail, and follow-up data is often missing. The increasing numbers of case reports in which high resolution, sequential MRIs are performed will progressively give a clearer view on myelin deficits in the disease and whether subtle WM micro-abnormalities are still present later in life. The growing case numbers of AHDS patients identified will also provide more information on patient heterogeneity. Longitudinal assessment of the myelination process in animal models of MCT8 deficiency can further clarify the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Models are also needed to evaluate the translational potential of therapeutic drugs, such as the TH analogs. Here, reciprocal exchanges of new therapeutic evolvements used in other demyelinating diseases sharing some of the hallmarks of AHDS, such as MS or PMD will be particularly edifying. Lastly, comparing data from basic and clinical research assist this same goal, thereby paving the way to improve the health and life span of AHDS patients. Such input will also help those involved in their daily care.",

        "Title": "    Targeted gene panel analysis of Japanese patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young-like diabetes mellitus: Roles of inactivating variants in the  ABCC8  and insulin resistance genes",
        "Abstract": "    To investigate the genetic background of Japanese patients with suspected maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).\n\n    On 340 proband patients referred from across Japan, genomic variants were analyzed using a targeted multigene panel analysis combined with the multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis, mitochondrial m.3243A > G analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction of the imprinted 6q24 locus. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were listed according to the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology criteria. Additionally, variants with a population frequency <0.001 and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion score >20 (CS >20) were listed as rare variants of uncertain significance-CS >20.\n\n    A total of 157 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and 44 rare variants of uncertain significance-CS >20 were identified. In the pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, alterations in the GCK gene were the most common (82, 52.2%) followed by HNF1A (29, 18.5%), HNF4A (13, 8.3%) and HNF1B (13, 8.3%). One patient was a 29.5% mosaic with a truncating INSR variant. In the rare variants of uncertain significance-CS >20, 20 (45.5%) were in the genes coding for the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel, KCNJ11 or ABCC8, and four were in the genes of the insulin-signaling pathway, INSR and PIK3R1. Four variants in ABCC8 were previously reported in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism, suggesting the inactivating nature of these variants, and at least two of our patients had a history of congenital hyperinsulinism evolving into diabetes. In two patients with INSR or PIK3R1 variants, insulin resistance was evident at diagnosis.\n\n    Causative genomic variants could be identified in at least 46.2% of clinically suspected MODY patients. ABCC8-MODY with inactivating variants could represent a distinct category of MODY. Genes of insulin resistance should be included in the sequencing panel for MODY.\n\n    The most comprehensive and one of the largest genomic variant analyses of MODY-like diabetes in East Asians. Found the importance of inactivating variants in the ABCC8 and insulin resistance genes.",
        "Introduction": "    Monogenic diabetes mellitus accounts for 1-4% of pediatric or young adult diabetes cases, and typical clinical presentation includes maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), neonatal diabetes, insulin resistance syndromes, lipodystrophy or other syndromic diabetes.\n\n    Diagnosing and differentiating monogenic diabetes mellitus from the vast majority of type 1/type 2 diabetes is important both for the clinical management and genetic counseling of the patients. Particularly, the diagnosis of MODY caused by pathogenic variants in the glucokinase (GCK), hepatic nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A), hepatic nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A) genes or in the KCNJ11, ABCC8 genes coding for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel) could be critical for the management of these patients, with sulfonylureas often being effective for HNF1A-, HNF4A- or KATP channel-MODY, whereas no medical intervention is generally required for GCK-MODY. The diagnosis of other types of monogenic diabetes also helps properly manage these patients with the accumulated knowledge of comorbidities and the natural course specific for each causative gene.\n\n    Unfortunately, monogenic diabetes is currently extremely underdiagnosed, especially when the diabetes is not associated with specific clinical features, such as neonatal diabetes, lipodystrophy or syndromic diabetes. Multiple factors make a diagnosis of monogenic diabetes difficult. For example, MODY is generally accepted as diabetes characterized by the early-onset before 35 years, non-obesity, dominant inheritance and negative pancreatic autoantibodies. However, not rarely, MODY is diagnosed after middle age, in obese patients, or without any affected family members. The diagnosis is particularly difficult for East Asians with inherently diminished insulin secretory capacities. They develop type 2 diabetes at lower body mass index (BMI; >23 for Japanese), as compared with white Europeans, and often, multiple family members are affected. Therefore, differentiating MODY from early-onset type 2 diabetes has always been challenging for this population, resulting in lower rates of mutation identification in previous studies. Additionally, molecular diagnosis is generally not covered by insurance, making the correct diagnosis even more difficult.\n\n    In the present study, we report the results of our comprehensive, multigene mutational analysis on 340 proband patients with early-onset, MODY-like diabetes who were referred to us under the diagnosis of suspected MODY. To address the possibility of different monogenic diabetes misdiagnosed as MODY, a broader range of monogenic diabetes genes were sequenced, including those typically presenting with insulin resistance or those associated with progressive endoplasmic reticulum stress.",
        "Methods": "    The study participants were 340 proband patients with early-onset (0-42 years, median 11 years) diabetes who were referred to us between 2005 and 2022 from across Japan under the diagnosis of suspected MODY. All were Japanese, and the age distribution at diagnosis is shown in Figure 1. The diagnoses were made by pediatric or adult diabetologists, and the patients fulfilled at least two of the following criteria of MODY; (i) dominant inheritance of early-onset diabetes; (ii) non-obesity with persistently detectable C-peptide; and (iii) negative pancreatic autoantibodies. Patients with the onset of diabetes before 6 months of age; that is, neonatal diabetes, were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Osaka City General Hospital (No. 742). Written informed consent was obtained either from the patient or their legal guardians. Molecular and clinical features of a fraction of these patients were previously reported separately.\n\n    For each patient, clinical data including sex, age at diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c at diagnosis, height and weight at diagnosis, and inheritance of diabetes were obtained from the questionnaire to the referral source. For children aged <18 years, the standard deviation score of BMI (BMI-SDS) was determined by using the Excel-based clinical tool for growth evaluation of children available from the Japanese Society for Pediatric Endocrinology (taikakushisu_v3.1, http://jspe.umin.jp/medical/chart_dl.html). For adults, the data from the 2018 National Health and Nutrition Survey by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare were used for the calculation of BMI-SDS (https://www.e-stat.go.jp/dbview?sid=0003224178).\n\n    All analyses were carried out using the DNA extracted from peripheral blood using the QIAmp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). For patients with maternal inheritance, mitochondrial m.3243A > G mutation was first excluded by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis as described, then the remaining patients underwent the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis covering the common MODY genes (SALSA MLPA P241 including the GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A genes, MRC Holland, Amsterdam) and targeted multigene panel sequencing using the Ion-PGM next-generation sequencer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). To identify patients with monogenic diabetes other than MODYs, the target genes were set broadly to include all exons of the following genes; ABCC8, APPL1, CISD2, EIF2AK3, FOXP3, GATA4, GCK, GLIS3, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, INS, INSR, KCNJ11, NEUROD1, NEUROG3, PAX6, PCBD1, PDX1, PIK3R1, RFX6, STAT3, WFS1 and ZFP57. The primer sets were generated using the Ion AmpliSeq Designer (Thermo Fisher), and sequencing was carried out using the Ion PGM next-generation sequencer (Thermo Fisher) as per the protocol of the manufacturer. The output data were analyzed using the Ion Reporter system (Thermo Fisher). Identified variants were also visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer tool (https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/, Broad Institute), and further confirmed by Sanger sequencing when necessary. Patients referred before 2021 mostly underwent the MLPA analysis and Sanger sequencing of exons in the GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A and HNF1B genes taking into consideration the clinical features. Only those without pathogenic (P)/likely pathogenic (LP) variants in these genes underwent the above-described targeted next-generation sequencing. Finally, patients without P/LP variants underwent the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction of the chromosome 6q24 imprinted region, as described previously.\n\n    The pathogenicity of identified variants was assessed according to the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criteria using the InterVar website (https://wintervar.wglab.org/) and the ClinVar database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), then the P/LP variants were listed as the causative variants. For genes of recessively inherited disorders; that is CISD2, EIF2AK3, GLIS3, PAX6, PCBD1 and ZFP57, the P/LP variants were not listed unless they were identified in both alleles. For RFX6, variants were not listed unless the identified variant was a truncating variant, and for WFS1, monoallelic variants were not listed unless the variant was previously reported to cause dominantly inherited diabetes.\n\n    In addition, variants classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were separately listed as rare VUS with a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score >20 (VUS-CS >20) if they were with a population frequency <0.001 in all ethnic groups in the gnomAD database (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and the Japanese 14KJPN genomic variants database (https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/202112/variants), and also if they had a CADD score >20 (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/). These cut-offs were arbitrarily set, because the incidence of pathogenic variants in the most common, known MODY gene, GCK, is approximately one in 1000, and a cut-off of the CADD score at 10-20 was recommended by the developer.\n\n    Finally, the Human Gene Mutation Database professional version (https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/products-overview/clinical-insights-portfolio/human-gene-mutation-database/; QIAGEN) was used to find previous reports of identified variants in association with the disease phenotype.",
        "Results": "    Of the 340 proband patients, we could identify 157 P/LP causative variants (46.2%; Figure 2a). In addition, we identified 44 variants in 42 patients with a population frequency <0.001 and with the CADD score >20 as rare VUS-CS >20 (12.4%; Figure 2b). Tables 1 and 2 show the details of the identified variants, and the demographic data of those with the P/LP variants and rare VUS-CS >20, respectively. The demographic features of patients without these variants are also shown in Table 3.\n\n    In the P/LP causative variants, alterations in the GCK gene were the most common (82, 52.2%) followed by HNF1A (29, 18.5%), HNF4A (13, 8.3%) and HNF1B (13, 8.3%). The mitochondrial m.3243A > G variant was found in eight (5.1%), all with maternal inheritance, and variants in the rare MODY genes, INS, KCNJ11 and ABCC8, were found in four (2.5%), one (0.6%) and three (1.9%), respectively. As previously reported, abnormalities in the 6q24 imprinted locus were found in three patients (1.9%), and none of these had a history of transient neonatal diabetes, which was confirmed by chart review (details previously reported). Additionally, a variant in the INSR gene (c.282_283TG > GT, p.TyrGly94_95*Trp), normally associated with type A insulin resistance, was found in a single patient as a mosaic with the wild type.\n\n    The 44 variants in the rare VUS-CS >20 category did not fulfill the ACMG/AMP criteria to reach the P/LP status. However, they are rare and possibly deleterious, with a population frequency of <0.001 and with the CADD score >20. The CADD is a tool for scoring the deleteriousness of single-nucleotide variants, which integrates multiple annotations into one metric, and a score of 20 represents the top 1% of the likelihood of pathogenicity. In fact, 21 of these rare VUS-CS >20 were previously reported in association with the disease phenotype and included in the HGMD professional database. Of these, variants in the ABCC8 gene were the most commonly found in 16 (36.4%), followed by HNF1A (10, 22.7%), GCK (8, 18.2%), KCNJ11 (4, 9.1%) and PDX1 (2, 4.5%) genes. Additionally, three variants in the INSR (p.Thr1181Asn, p.Pro269Leu, p.Lys294Arg) and one in the PIK3RI (p.Ser83Leu) genes, both normally associated with insulin resistance, were found in three patients (patients 191, 192, 193), one of them (patient 191) having variants in both genes.\n\n    Compared with the group of patients without these variants, patients with P/LP variants or rare VUS-CS >20 showed significantly lower BMI-SDS at diagnosis (P < 0.0001 by the Kruskal-Wallis test; Figure 3a), whereas there were no significant differences in the age at onset (P = 0.16, Figure 3b). These results suggest that those without P/LP variants or rare VUS-CS >20 are more similar to polygenic type 2 diabetes.\n\n    In total, there were four KATP channel variants (3 ABCC8, 1 KCNJ11) in the P/LP group, and 21 (17 ABCC8, 4 KCNJ11) in the rare VUS-CS >20 group. Of these, 11 were listed in the HGMD database. Interestingly, one of the P/LP variants in the ABCC8 gene was a frameshift, loss-of-function variant (patient 5), and thus, was expected to cause hyperinsulinism. This patient was not obese, with a BMI-SDS of 0.25 and developed diabetes at the age of 7 years. His fasting C-peptide was not diminished at 1.8 nmol/L, and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 7.1, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. Additionally, of the ABCC8 variants in the rare VUS-CS >20, four (p.Arg1420His, patient 161; p.Arg1486Lys, patient 162; p.Gly1378Ser, patient 163; p.Asp1030Asn, patient 170) were listed in the HGMD database in association with congenital hyperinsulinism. The unique clinical course of patient 161 was previously reported by Saito-Hakoda et al. Briefly, the patient was born large-for-gestational-age (4,244 g after 36 weeks' gestation), and presented with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia requiring diazoxide treatment until the age of 6 years. Then, she gradually began to present with postprandial hyperglycemia and was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 11 years. After the diagnosis of diabetes, she still experienced reactive postprandial hypoglycemia, which was successfully treated by a combination of glinide and alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Patient 162 was also an 11-year-old girl who presented with fasting hypoglycemia associated with postprandial hyperglycemia. On the oral glucose tolerance test, her fasting plasma glucose was low at 3.9 mmol/L, with inappropriately elevated insulin at 29.2 pmol/L. After 2 h, however, her plasma glucose was elevated at 15.0 mmol/L. Patient 163 was a non-obese, 10-year-old girl. Her oral glucose tolerance test showed a sign of insulin resistance with the HOMA-IR index at 4.5. Her insulinogenic index was low at 0.08, and her plasma glucose after 2 h was 16.6 mmol/L. Patient 170 was born large-for-gestational-age, with a birthweight of 4,111 g. She reported a history of hospital admission for neonatal apneic episodes. She was not obese, but an oral glucose tolerance test at the age of 9 years showed a sign of insulin resistance with the HOMA-IR index at 4.5. Her insulinogenic index was low at 0.34 and her plasma glucose after 2 h was 16.2 mmol/L.\n\n    Also, interestingly, there was one INSR variant, p.TyrGly94_95*Trp, in the P/LP group (patient 148), which is expected to cause type A insulin resistance. This patient was a 29.5% mosaic with a truncating variant, and presented with symptoms resembling acute type 1 diabetes at the age of 14 years, with highly elevated plasma glucose at 24.8 mmol/L, hemoglobin A1c at 14.9% in association with diminished serum C-peptide at 0.2 nmol/L. Pancreatic autoantibodies were negative. Her BMI at presentation was 20.6 (64th centile), and she had a paternal history of diabetes. Three variants in the INSR gene (p.Thr1181Asn, p.Pro269Leu, p.Lys294Arg) were also identified in the rare VUS-CS >20 group (patients 191, 192, 193). In addition to the INSR variant, patient 191 had an additional variant, p.Ser83Leu, in the PIK3R1 gene, which is responsible for SHORT syndrome characterized by low birthweight and insulin resistance after puberty. This patient was born small-for-gestational-age, with a birthweight of 2,416 g after 39 weeks of pregnancy. She presented with incidentally identified hyperglycemia at the age of 12 years. She had a maternal history of diabetes, and was lean with a BMI-SDS of -0.42. Retrospectively, her C-peptide and insulin at presentation were elevated at 3.0 nmol/L and 2413.4 pmol/L in the presence of plasma glucose at 16.1 mmol/L. Patient 192 was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 33 years. He had a three-generation paternal inheritance of diabetes. Clinical data at diagnosis was unavailable, but after 30 years of diabetes, his insulin secretion was diminished (increment of C-peptide after arginine loading at 0.5 nmol/L). The patient was not obese and was negative for pancreatic autoantibodies. Patient 193 developed diabetes at the age of 8 years. His BMI-SDS at diagnosis was 0.34, and his fasting insulin was not diminished at 241.7 pmol/L when plasma glucose was 5.9 mmol/L.\n\n    Finally, there were two patients, patients 198 and 199, with rare VUS-CS >20 in the PDX1 gene. Detailed clinical data are missing for patient 198, except that the patient had a three-generation family history of early-onset diabetes, was not obese, and could be treated with metformin and sulfonylurea for at least 10 years. Patient 199 had a typical history of MODY. She was not obese and had a three-generation family history of non-obese diabetes, and with homeostatic model assessment for beta-cell function at 32.0.",
        "Conclusion": "    By using the comprehensive targeted gene panel analysis, causative variants could be identified in 157 (46.2%) of 340 real-world Japanese patients with suspected MODY. The identification rate could be higher, as at least some of the 44 rare VUS-CS >20 appear to be truly causative. In addition to common MODY genes, variants in the KATP-channel genes were frequently identified, and a proportion of them was with inactivating variants, probably representing a different category of KATP-channel MODY. An expanded multigene panel including genes of insulin resistance should be used for this population.",
        "Discussion": "    To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive analysis of monogenic diabetes in East Asians. Responsible P/LP variants were identified in 46.2% of the patients, and the identification rate could be higher, as at least some of the rare VUS-CS >20 are apparently pathogenic. These figures are higher than those previously reported for East Asians. Possible explanations include: (i) a higher fraction of pediatric patients in the present study; (ii) most referral sources being diabetologists; and (iii) the study design with a broader range of target genes. As the incidence of type 2 diabetes increases with age, in the pediatric age group, the chances of identifying monogenic diabetes would be higher, especially by diabetologists. Also, with a broader range of target genes, the variant identification rate would be higher compared with studies focusing only on common MODY genes.\n\n    Limiting to the P/LP variants, GCK-MODY was the most common, followed by HNF1A-, HNF4A- and HNF1B-MODY (Figure 2). This is in line with the recent large-scale studies, and is not surprising considering the high population prevalence (estimated at 1.1 in 1000) of deleterious GCK variants in the general population. When mildly hyperglycemic patients are included as in pediatric studies, GCK variants are likely to be the most common, whereas HNF1A variants tend to be more common in studies leaning toward symptomatic patients. As few pathogenic variants with a strong founder effect have been identified in MODY genes, the true incidence of P/LP variants in MODY genes should be similar across different ethnicities if very large, population-based studies linking the genotypes and the serial measurements of blood glucose are obtained.\n\n    In addition to the P/LP variants, we tried to identify VUS variants that might be pathogenic as rare VUS-CS >20 by using the population frequency and the CADD score of the variants. For missense variants of rare MODY genes, it is often difficult to reach the P/LP status of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, unless extensive segregation studies or in vitro functional studies are additionally carried out. In this group of variants, nearly half of them were KATP channel genes, ABCC8 or KCNJ11. Combined with the P/LP patients, variants in the KATP channel genes were identified in 25 patients, and 11 of them were listed in the HGMD database and seven were variants of the amino acids for which different alterations have already been reported (patients 159, 164, 172, 179, 186, 190, 195).\n\n    Interestingly, of the previously reported KATP channel variants, four are listed in association with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the HGMD database. Described clinical phenotypes of patients with these variants (p.Arg1486Lys, p.Gly1378Ser, p.Asp1030Asn, p.Arg1420His) are compatible with the diagnosis of congenital hyperinsulinism, and for p.Gly1378Ser and p.Arg1420His, in vitro evidence of the loss of function has been reported. These findings could simply be the incidental identification of asymptomatic carriers of loss-of-function, hyperinsulinemic variants not related to diabetes. However, at least two of our patients (patients 161, 162) presented with a history of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia evolving into diabetes. Neonatal macrosomia with apneic spells found in patient 170 is also typical of congenital hyperinsulinism, although hypoglycemia was not documented for this patient.\n\n    Cases of KATP channel congenital hyperinsulinism evolving into diabetes have been reported repeatedly. This is likely to be a different category of KATP channel MODY distinct from the patients with activating variants. As the treatment strategy for this group of patients could be different from that for the patients with activating mutations, recognition of this group of patients might be important for the management of diabetes. For example, Ovsyannikova et al. reported a patient with a p.Ala1457Thr variant in the ABCC8 gene with diabetes. This variant is known to be causative of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Unlike neonatal diabetes caused by ABCC8 variants, switching from insulin to sulfonylurea did not work well, with the extensive glucose excursion requiring an add-on treatment by an sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor.\n\n    Another interesting finding in the present study was the identification of variants of the INSR gene, typically causing type A insulin resistance, in patients with suspected MODY; one in the P/LP group (patient 148) and three in the patients with rare VUS-CS >20 group (patients 191-193). Patient 148 was a 29.5% mosaic and presented with acute diabetes with diminished insulin secretion. The role of her insulin variant in the development of diabetes thus remains unknown. On the contrary, two patients with rare VUS-CS >20 INSR variants showed evidence of insulin resistance. Patient 191 presented with diabetes associated with elevated endogenous insulin and had an additional variant of the PIK3R1 gene. As variants in the INSR and PIK3R1 genes both cause insulin-resistant diabetes, it is unclear which of these variants is more responsible for her diabetes, although the low birthweight for gestational age is more consistent with the presentation of PIK3R1 abnormality. Patient 193 also presented with mildly elevated fasting serum insulin (241.7 pmol/L) at diagnosis. The fact that he was not obese and had dominantly inherited diabetes made him a candidate for MODY. In our national survey in Japan, fasting serum insulin of genetically confirmed type A resistance could be as low as 243.1 pmol/L. Insulin resistance syndrome, thus, needs to be included in the gene panel.\n\n    Finally, we identified two patients (patients 198; 199) with variants in the PDX1 gene. As the pathogenicity of missense variants in this gene is difficult to interpret because of a large number of benign rare variants, the pathogenicity of these variants was not clear at the moment.\n\n    We believe the high diagnostic yield and its possible clinical implications support the cost-effectiveness of including multigene analysis of monogenic diabetes in the national health insurance system. The strength of the present study was in the comprehensiveness of target genes and a large number of patients with suspected MODY. There were, however, several weaknesses in the present study. First, because of a lack of confirmatory studies, many variants remained in the category of VUS. To identify true pathogenic variants more efficiently, we generated a category of rare VUS-CS >20 in this study, but still, only a fraction of these appears responsible for the patients' diabetes. Second, the number of genes covered in this study might not be large enough. For example, many genes for syndromic diabetes were not included in this panel in the hope that those patients might be clinically diagnosed otherwise. Third, even for the genes included in this study, the detection of variants might not be complete. The MLPA analysis was carried out only for common MODY genes, and deletions/duplications in other genes were not examined. Detection of mitochondrial m.3243A > G might also be incomplete, given the heteroplasmic nature of mitochondrial variants. Larger-scale panel sequencing, whole-exome sequencing or even whole-genome sequencing combined with the more sensitive detection of copy number variation might be required to address these sensitivity problems, although the chances of capturing benign variants would be increased by scaling up the number of target genes.",

        "Title": "    Crops Change the Morphology, Abundance, and Mass of Microplastics in Mollisols of Northeast China",
        "Abstract": "    Degradation of microplastics (MPs) by both physicochemical and biological processes in the natural environment is determined by the enzymes inside the soil, and which was severely influenced by crop growth and straw amendment (SA). However, it is still unclear how crop growth and SA influence degradation of MPs in soils. In this study, both catalase and sucrase were measured, and the stereomicroscope combined with microscopic infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to detect the morphology and quantity of low-density polyethylene microplastic (LDPE-MP) and low-density polypropylene microplastic (LDPP-MP), after crop growth (maize and soybean, with and without SA, 1 and 2% MP) in an outdoor pot experiment, in the Mollisols. The results showed that the growth of the crops changed the morphology, functional groups (e.g., methylene, carbonyl), total mass, and abundance ratio of MPs of different sizes. These were possibly caused by enzymes that were significantly influenced by crop types, abundance, and types of MPs in the soils. Maize growth decreased the mass of LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP by 28.7 and 32.7%, respectively, and 2% (w/w) of LDPP-MP addition in soil decreased mass of 9%, which was higher than that in 1% (w/w) LDPP-MP addition in soil. Soybean growth with SA decreased the mass of LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP by 36.6 and 20.7%, respectively, than the control treatment (CK). Compared with CK, both crop growth and SA changed the abundance of MPs of different sizes and decreased the mean size of MPs. The LDPE-MP could be more easily degraded by enzymes in the soils compared to LDPP-MP when the MP size was smaller with surface roughness. Generally, both maize and soybean growth can accelerate MP change in soils, and MP change process was mainly determined by SA, MP types, and the dose effect of MP.",
        "Introduction": "    The advantages of using plastics are relative stability, low cost, low density, and nontoxicity, hence, they have been widely used in the industry, agriculture, and daily use. Researchers reported that plastic production has increased every year since the 1950s, and even exceeded 83 Mt in 2017. Worldwide, the production is expected to reach 590 million Mt in 2050, whereas recycling was less than 9% in the current scenario. Some publications indicate that plastics, especially microplastics (MPs, particle size <5 mm) from plastics degradation, can cause adverse effects on biota in both the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Thus, plastic pollution, especially those related to the critical level of MP, is regarded as one of the most vital environmental issues raised in recent decades. Since the terrestrial system is a significant source of MP for oceans, recently, several researchers have focused on the degradation, migration, and distribution of MP in soils.\n\n    It is worth mentioning that the MP degradation process influences the dynamics of MP size, morphology, and distribution in soils. However, there are still fewer reports available on the key factors influencing MPs degradation in soils. Generally, the bigger and coarser the specific surface area of the MP is, the greater their influence by microorganisms, enzymes, and external environment is, especially the pits and flakes were easily colonized by various microorganisms. Degradation of MPs could be caused by certain enzymatic activities and lead to polymer chain cleavage, resulting in the formation of oligomers and monomers. Previous studies have indicated that foreign material, which is organic and beneficial, especially the straw amendment (SA), tends to improve the activities of soil microorganisms and increases the training and richness of enzymes in soils. It is worth mentioning that soil enzymes are released by the microorganisms, and plant roots even account for 90% of soil enzymes. Plants perform key roles that influence the ecological process in the terrestrial systems and control the transformation of substances in soils. However, it is still unclear how crop growth influences soil degradation. found the low-density polyethylene microplastics (LDPE-MPs) in surface and deep soil layers in the farmland, which were positively correlated to macroplastics (MAPs) on a large scale but were not correlated to MAPs on a small scale. They deduced that LDPE-MP distribution was not only influenced by water movement but also possibly by enzymes. Thus, both crop growth and SA alter the soil ecosystems, further combining with microorganisms to change the activity of the enzymes and possibly affect the degradation of MPs in soils.\n\n    Plastic film and changed mulch mainly comprise low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and low-density polypropylene (LDPP), which cause severe pollution and damage the soils when they are not recycled and degraded into MP debris in soils for a long time. Mollisols are mainly distributed in the high-cold areas in the world, which have high soil organic matter (SOM) as well. In these areas, the agricultural film has been widely used to increase soil moisture and temperature with a low recycling rate for a long time, which seriously results in both plastic and MP pollution. In this study, the influences of maize and soybean growth, and SA on the morphology, surface functional groups, abundance, and mass of MPs with different sizes were tested. The changes in enzymes activity in response to crop growth, microorganism, and MP degradation were also measured after 5 months. The primary purposes of this study are to validate the following hypotheses: (1) MP degradation is influenced by both crop growth and SA and could be correlated to the activity of enzymes in soils; and (2) MP degradation was also influenced by crop types and MP composition. The results are beneficial to understand the MP dynamics and driving mechanism more deeply in soils and provide guidance for a better regulation of MP pollution in farmland.",
        "Methods": "    A pot experiment was used in this study, and soils were taken from the farmland of the Harbin region in Heilongjiang Province of Northeast China (no history of plastics application). The soil was classified as typical black soil according to the Chinese Soil Classification (CST) and Mollisols in the United States Soil Classification (USST). The basic physicochemical properties of soil are shown in Table 1. The soils were mixed thoroughly, air-dried at room temperature, and sieved at 2 mm before the experiment. No MP components were detected in these soils using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\n    Because the LDPE and LDPP have been widely used in the farmland of the world and were broadly used in Heilongjiang Province, LDPE-MP and low-density polypropylene microplastic (LDPP-MP) were adopted in this experiment. The irregular shape of PE and PP was changed into the size of 100 mesh particles, which were ground by the same manufacturer in the same production mode and were dried and screened before leaving the factory (both were produced by Red Star Plastics Co., Ltd., Anqing City, China). In addition, the specific LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP were also measured by a sieving method before the experiment. In order to quantify the degradation, the characteristics of the original microplastic were measured and defined as treatment \"original.\" LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP were white in color having sizes of <2 mm (Table 2).\n\n    A compound method of paper cups combining pot was adopted to study the crop growth and SA on MP degradation, and this method can effectively reduce the MP pollution (reducing the MP dose) in the experiment (Figure 1). Then, 100 ml of six paper cups combined with a PVC bucket of 20 L was used in each pot in the incubation experiment. The bottoms of the cups were pre-punched, and multilayer filter papers (<4 mum) were preset on the bottom to ensure water infiltrating while avoiding the MP leaching (the device had been tested repeatedly three times). PVC buckets were pre-perforated in the bottom and were cleaned before the experiment.\n\n    For the treatments of 1% PE, 2% PE, 1% PP, and 2% PP, each paper cup was filled with a homogeneous mixture of 100 g of dry soils (sieved at 2 mm) and MP (LDPE-MP or LDPP-MP). In addition, in treatments of 1% PE + SA, 1% PP + SA, each paper cup was filled with a homogeneous mixture of 100 g of dry soils (sieved at 2 mm), MP (LDPE-MP or LDPP-MP), and SAs (maize straw). The content of MP addition in the paper cup was 1 (w/w) and 2%, and the range of SA was 0.5% (w/w). Each bucket was filled with 1 kg of dry soil (sieved at 2 mm) at the beginning, and then six paper cups with a mixture of soils were evenly arranged on the surface of the earth (Figure 1). The gaps between the paper cups were filled with the soil (sieved at 2 mm), and then the soils were continuously added until the bucket was full. All paper cups were buried at 20 cm soil depth in each bucket.\n\n    Soybean (Glycine max, Dong Nong 254th) and maize (Zea mays, Dong Nong 265th) were most popularly planted in the Mollisol of Northeast China and were used in this experiment. Three soybean seeds were planted at each point, and five seeding points were evenly distributed around the surface of soils in the bucket. In addition, three seeds of maize were planted in the center of the surface of soils in the bucket. Only one plant of soybean/corn was allowed to remain in the buckets when the height of soybean and maize was 5 cm. No crop was planted in the control treatment (CK). Each treatment had four replicates, and all buckets were randomly arranged in an area of the experimental station. Depending on the weather condition, all treatments were watered with the same volume of distilled water once in 2-4 days. Plastic pollution was avoided throughout the experimental preparation, management, and soil sampling.\n\n    The average total rainfall was 570.7 mm from June to August in Harbin of 2019. Seeds were sown in May, and crop harvesting and soil sampling were all carried out in October after one growth cycle of the crop. During the soil sampling process, firstly, surface soils (0-20 cm) were removed; secondly, the root system around the paper cups was cut off, and then paper cups were collected. Crop roots were picked out directly from soils for each paper cup, and then soil samples were mixed evenly, and half of the soils were dried for MPs analysis, while another half of soils was frozen for enzymes analysis.\n\n    To avoid plastic pollution during the separation and determination of soil MPs, we cleaned the laboratory thoroughly before the experiment and kept it clean during the entire test. In addition, during the experiment, it was not allowed to wear clothes and hats made of plastic fibers. The separation of MPs involved two steps, and it has been proved that the extraction rate (MP size (50 (m) is well over 95%:\n\n    A total of 10 g of the soil sample was weighed and added into a glass beaker (100 ml). Then, 60 ml of sterile distilled water was added and stirred with a glass rod, then 40 ml of sterile distilled water was used to clean the MPs from glass rod to beaker. The breaker was kept static over 24 h until the suspension appeared and all high-density substances sunk. MPs were floated onto the surface and were filtrated by the fine filter papers (pore diameter (3 (m). Then, the filter papers with LDPE-MPs and LDPP-MPs were oven dried to the consistent weight at 60 C.\n\n    LDPE-MPs and LDPP-MPs were transferred into beakers and were processed by Fenton's reagent (20 min, 25 C, pH (4) to remove impurities that mainly included organic matter, then dried at 60 C (consistent weight) again and weighed by analytical balance (FA/JA, Shanghai Yueping Instrument Co., Ltd., precision of 0.00001 g). For avoiding the pollution caused by foreign impurities during the experiment, tin lids were used to cover all beakers.\n\n    The abundance of LDPE-MPs and LDPP-MPs with different sizes was calculated by a high-resolution camera (IS Capture 3.7.8, Tucsen Photonics Co., Ltd., China) connected with a stereomicroscope (x50, Novel NSZ-608T) and ImageJ software. After 5 months, the surface morphology of LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP for treatments of crops growth and SA was measured by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, S3400). The FTIR spectroscopy (Nicolet iN10, Thermo Scientific) was used to investigate the structure and functional groups of LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP. For each mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum (4,000-750 cm-1), 16 scans were collected in reflection mode at 4 s-1 frequencies. The background was a pure golden mirror. The IR spectra of LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP were determined by carbonyl index (CI) to measure the formation of several by-products containing carbonyl functionalities on the surface of the MPs that result from the oxidation of the material. CI is the ratio of the carbonyl peak and reference peak. In this study, CI is calculated by the following formula:\n\n    where Ac=o is the absorbance of the carbonyl peak, and A-CH is the absorbance of the reference peak. Therefore, the CI was used in this work as a metric for the oxidation of polymers, enabling the quantification of some of the changes in the chemical structure of the material.\n\n    Oxidoreductases (oxidases and dehydrogenases) and hydrolases have been found to significantly promote the changes in the morphology and mass of MPs in soils, especially on LDPE degradation. The activities of catalase (typical oxidases) and sucrase (specific hydrolases) were measured in this experiment. Sucrase and catalase activities were determined by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method and the hydrogen peroxide consumption method. Debris of straw was picked out under a magnifying glass from the soils after air-drying and weighed by an analytical balance (FA/JA, Shanghai Yueping Instrument Co., Ltd., precision of 0.00001 g).\n\n    The data are presented as the mean +- SD in this study. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were tested via two-way ANOVA. The significant difference between treatments was conducted by least significant difference (LSD) tests (p < 0.05). LSD tests were conducted to compare the significant differences among different crop growth on the same incubation day (p < 0.05). LSD tests were also used to compare the difference between with and without SA in the same periods (p < 0.05). All figures were drawn using Origin 2019. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 22.0. Spectra used for analysis and making figures were the average of the spectra of four random particles and were analyzed using OMNIC 8.2 (Thermo Scientific).",
        "Results": "    Original LDPE-MPs were composed of various sizes of particles that were typically connected. After crop growth at 5 months, LDPE-MP had a smaller size, sharper edge, and rougher surface compared with the original LDPE-MP particles (Supplementary Figure 2A). Similarly, LDPP-MP sizes were also obviously reduced after crop growth at 5 months compared to the original LDPP-MPs, and the surface became rough and even formed many cavities on the surface of MP (Supplementary Figure 2B). The differences between treatments with and without SA were also noticeable, and the morphological changes were more evident with SA than without.\n\n    The original particles of LDPE-MPs and LDPP-MPs had a smooth surface, especially for LDPP-MP (Figure 2), while they were coarser with an irregular shape and a rough surface after growth at 5 months. Primarily there was more difference on LDPE-MP surface when treated with SA (Figure 2).\n\n    With the crop growth, the new peaks appeared in the spectrograms of LDPE-MP, which were initially not found in the original LDPE-MP, such as signals were found near 1,030, 1,665, and 3,435 cm-1 (Figure 3), while no obvious new peaks appeared in LDPP-MP. Compared with the original LDPP-MP, after 1 year of crop growth, the peak area near 1,665 cm-1 increased compared with the peak area of methylene (1,490-1,420 cm-1). Moreover, the peak value near 1,780-1,600 cm-1 represents carbonyl, which was changed in all treatments and had the larger area in treatments with crop growth and SA (compared with methylene, 1,490-1,420 cm-1). CI was higher in treatments of crop growth than those in CK and was significantly greater in the maize treatment compared to soybean treatment (p < 0.05). Additionally, the CI was higher in treatments of SA than those in the treatments without SA (Figures 3C-E).\n\n    Compared with the original LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP, the abundance composition of MP particle sizes was significantly changed in CK treatments (Figure 4) (p < 0.05). Compared with the original LDPE-MP, the abundance of LDPE-MP size >100 mum decreased by 16.1%, while the abundance of size <20 mum increased by 37.0% in CK treatments (Figure 4A). Similarly, compared with the original LDPP-MP, the abundance of LDPP-MP size >100 mum was reduced by 10.1%, while the abundance of LDPP-MP size <20 mum increased by 33.3% in CK treatments (Figure 4C). The change of abundance composition of MP sizes in CK treatments was more obvious in LDPE-MP than in LDPP-MP.\n\n    Compared with CK, the abundance of LDPE-MP size >100 mum decreased in all treatments, while the size <20 mum increased. Crop growth significantly altered the abundance composition of the LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP with different sizes (p < 0.05). Compared with CK, the abundance of LDPE-MP with size >100 mum decreased by 23.3% in maize treatments, while the size of <20 mum increased by 73.0% (Figure 4A). Similarly, compared with CK, the abundance of LDPP-MP with the size of >100 mum decreased by 43.3%, while the size of <20 mum increased by 91.7% in treatments with maize growth (Figure 4B).\n\n    Compared with CK, the abundance of LDPE-MP with size >100 mum was less than 13.5%, and the abundance of LDPP-MP with <20 mum was 104.2% greater in the treatments with SA (Figures 4C,D). The change of abundance composition of LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP sizes between treatments with SA and CK was more obvious in maize treatments than in treatments with soybean growth. The abundance of LDPE-MP sizes >100 mum decreased by 36.4 and 17.6% in the treatment of maize growth with SA compared to CK and maize treatment without SA, while <20 mum increased by 155.6 and 7.8%. Compared with the CK and maize treatment without SA, the abundance of LDPP-MP size >100 mum decreased by 57.1 and 18.2% in maize treatment without SA, while <20 mum increased by 61.2 and 58.0%.\n\n    Microplastic mass was reduced in all treatments after crop growth at 5 months, and the mass of MP was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in treatments of maize and soybean growth than that in CK. Compared with CK, LDPE-MP mass was decreased by 28.7% in maize treatments while the LDPP-MP mass was decreased by 32.7%. The change of MP mass was typically lower in LDPP-MP treatments than that in treatments of LDPE-MP addition.\n\n    The mass reductions were higher in 2% LDPP-MP and LDPE-MP treatments than that in the treatments of 1% MP addition with crops growth and CK (Figures 5A,B). In order to compare with 1% MP addition, the y-axis of MP mass value was shrunk to the proportion of half for 2% LDPP-MP and LDPE-MP addition in Figure 5. When treatments experienced the soybean growth, MP mass in treatment of 2% LDPE-MP addition was lower than that in 1% MP addition but was not significant. Moreover, MP mass was 9% lower in 2% LDPP-MP addition than that in 1% LDPP-MP addition (p < 0.05). At the same time, compared with the treatments of maize growth without SA, the mass of soil LDPE-MP with soybean growth was reduced by 36.6% in the treatments with SA when 1% LDPE-MP was added (Figures 5C,D). Compared with the treatments with soybean growth without SA, the LDPP-MP mass decreased in treatments of maize growth and SA even increased by 20.68% with SA when 1% LDPE-MP was added.\n\n    Sucrase and catalase activity in LDPE-MP addition treatments was slightly higher than that in PP treatments (Figure 6). However, sucrase activity was also slightly higher in crop treatments and was significantly higher in maize treatment than that in no crop treatment (CK) (p < 0.05) when SA was used (Figure 6A). However, sucrase activity was significantly negatively correlated with PE and PP mass (p < 0.05) in crop treatments, while it was not significant in CK (Figure 7). Catalase activity was significantly and positively correlated with PP mass (p < 0.05) in CK, while it was not correlated with MP mass in all crop treatments (Figure 7). Thus, out of sucrase and catalase, in our study, only sucrase may play a major role in MP degradation, which was influenced by crop. Interestingly, straw degradation was significantly higher in soybean treatments than in maize treatments (p < 0.05) (Figure 8).",
        "Conclusion": "    Both maize and soybean growth can accelerate the changes in the morphology, abundance, and mass of MPs in soils. Maize growth has a more vital ability to reduce MP in soils than soybean growth. Compared with LDPP-MP, enzymes in soils change LDPE-MP more easily when MP sizes are small with a rough surface. MP change is also influenced by the SA and the dose effect of MP.",
        "Discussion": "    Microplastics were constantly broken and degraded by physicochemical and biological processes and were finally fragmented into small pieces with various shapes and sizes. MPs promoted colonization, biofilm production, and the transfer of environmental microorganisms. Plastic degradation was mainly determined by their molecular structure in soils and typically reflected by morphology or change in mass. As reported before, the complete mineralization of PE may take hundreds or even thousands of years, while the total mineralization of PP may take 20-30 years. It is worth mentioning that MP change caused by weathering processes is slow and mainly happens on the surface of soils, while MP changes driven by biological processes are quicker in the deep soil layers. In this study, MPs were buried at 20 cm soil depth, which could not be changed by photochemical reaction, while being mainly influenced by biological processes.\n\n    Previous reports indicated that the reduced rate of PE mass reached 0.27 g day-1 under specific microorganisms, such as Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cupriavidus, and Pseudomonas, which significantly changed the morphology, quantity, and mass of MPs in soils, especially Micrococcus-Cu. Necator H16 even decomposes 1.5% LDPE-MP per day. It is worth mentioning that microorganisms promote the degradation and change the morphology, mass, and abundance of MP in soils by producing the enzymes such as oxidoreductases (oxidases and dehydrogenases) and hydrolases. Furthermore, some reports indicated that roots could also produce enzymes during the growth process, which takes up 90% of soil enzymes. Research has shown that MPs may stick to the roots, affect the absorption of water and nutrients, and cause roots to secrete specific enzymes to degrade them. In addition, root exudates can increase phosphatase, invertase, and catalase, thus advancing the microbial biomass and fungal abundance in the soils. In this study, both LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP mass were significantly reduced by 12.1-32.7% of original addition in soils after a growth season of 5 months (Figure 5), and the morphology of LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP was changed (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2). Because the enzymes of sucrase and catalase are highly related to degradation of MPs, these were also detected in this study. In this study, sucrase (belonging to specific hydrolases) may play a major role that was extremely significantly and positively correlated with MP mass (p < 0.01). In addition, functional groups of carbonyl and hydroxyl appeared or increased on the surface of MPs (LDPE-MP and LDPP-PP) in all treatments after crop growth (Figure 3), and these functional groups made the MPs more easily biodegraded and released more small MPs in soils. Thus, MP was possibly also degraded by enzymes produced by microorganisms or crop roots in soils. The specific surface of MPs was also more easily colonized by microorganisms forming the biofilm, which can further accelerate the morphological alterations and biodegradation of MPs. Compared with the treatment without growth, the CI of both LDPE-MP and LDPP-MP increased after 1 year of crop growth (Figures 3C-E), indicating that crop growth could also accelerate both LDPE-MP and LDPP-PP degradation.\n\n    Interestingly, in this study, the mass and abundance of MP decrement were higher in treatments with LDPE addition than the treatments of LDPP addition in the same MP dose addition, and the change of LDPE-MP morphology was more obvious compared with LDPP-MP (Figures 2, 5). Because the methyl side branch of PP is easily broken by the biochemical process, the degradation period of PE is typically longer than PP. In our study, a few hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups were found in the original LDPP-MP, which means that LDPP-MP was more easily degraded than LDPE-MP. While the sucrase activity was significantly and positively correlated with both PP and PE mass, the gradient of LDPP mass vs. sucrase activity is higher than that for LDPE mass vs. sucrase, which means that LDPP was more susceptible to enzymes (Figure 7 and Table 3). Previous studies indicated that the structure and properties of MPs are the main factors that determine the degradation degree of MPs, and the degradation rate typically increased with the surface area due to the microorganisms being more easily colonized on a rough surface, especially for the pits. In our study, the materials of LDPE-MP had a smaller size and higher roughness, and the surface area was higher than LDPP-MP when the mass addition was the same. Thus, LDPE-MP was easily degraded compared with LDPP-MP in soil. In addition, the original LDPE-MP size was smaller than LDPP and could be easily absorbed by crops. Therefore, both degradation and absorption could be the reason that the LDPE-MP decrement was higher than LDPP-MP in this study.\n\n    Our study also found that the abundance and mass of MP decrement were generally higher in the maize-planted treatments than in the soybean treatments. The surface topography and functional groups (especially CI) changes in MP in maize treatments were more evident than those in the treatments of soybean. Maize has massive fibrous roots and can grow fully in the PVC bucket in our research, while soybean has a taproot system whose distribution is not tight. This study also found that the root weight was higher in the paper cups of maize treatment than that in the soybean treatment (Supplementary Figure 3). A previous publication indicated that roots could absorb MP, and MPs can further be transported into both stems and leaves. In addition, the transpiration efficiency of C4 plants (such as maize) is higher than that of C3 plants (such as soybean). In addition, compared with soybean, the enzyme types in soils of maize treatment were relatively higher, and maize produces more quantity of total carbon and total nitrogen, which are beneficial to increase the activity of microorganisms. Interestingly, sucrase activity was highest in maize growth treatments, followed by soybean growth and CK, and was significantly negatively correlated with MP mass in all crop treatments but was not negatively correlated with MP mass in treatments without crop growth. This may hint that sucrase can effectively degrade both LDPE and LDPP in soils of the crop growth treatment, and sucrase activity was mainly determined by crop growth, especially in the maize growth (Figure 7). However, catalase activity showed no difference between treatments with and without crops, while catalase activity significantly increased with LDPP increasing mass (p < 0.05) but was not negatively correlated with MP mass in treatment with crop growth. This may be hinting that catalase was not mainly influenced by crops, while it was mainly produced by the special microorganisms that were preferable to colonize on the LDPP surface. Generally, in this study, maize has a more vital ability to change MP than soybean planted, possibly mainly influenced by both absorption and enzymes.\n\n    It is worth mentioning that SA applications can also accelerate the decrement of MP mass and abundance. The morphology and functional groups (especially CI) changes in MP with the SAs were also more obvious (Figures 2, 4). A previous study reported that maize stalks amendment significantly increased the abundance of Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Mortierellomycota and significantly increased the activity of microorganisms. In addition, in this study, sucrase activity was significantly higher in maize treatment than that in CK (p < 0.05) when SA was used, but no obvious differences in treatments have been observed without SA (Figure 6A). Thus, we deduced that SA accelerated the MP degradation, possibly because of changing microecosystems in soils.\n\n    In this study, MP mass reduction percentage was higher in 2% of MP content than 1% of MP content in the same crop treatments. Other publications also found that increasing LDPE-MP addition significantly increased soil microbial respiration and urease and phosphatase enzyme activities. In this study, catalase and sucrase activity of 2% of MP content treatment was slightly higher. Thus, increasing the doses of LDPE-MPs and LDPP-MPs may provoke soil self-repair mechanisms and accelerate the degradation of MP mass because MP was also the carbon source in the soils.\n\n    Microplastic mass decrement was higher in this study than that in other publications, which may be due to the (1) particle size <3 mum leach out of the filter paper (phi < 3 mum) was not detected; (2) MP particles with the acceptable size, especially for the nanometer size in soils were adsorbed by crops; (3) the Fenton's reagent corroded the parts of MP particles during the analysis process of OM degradation; and (4) the enzymes produced by both microorganisms and roots accelerated the MP degradation. It is worth mentioning that the changes in MP in the morphology, size, quantity, and mass may cause adverse effects on the ecological environment. In addition, the smaller the size of MP is, the larger the harm of MP is to the ecosystems. Therefore, crop growth and SA accelerate MP change, increase MP debris, increase MP migration, and further cause more negative effects on biota, even threatening the aquatic organism when they continuously enter the aquatic ecosystems.",

        "Title": "    A \"built-up\" composite film with synergistic functionalities on Mg-2Zn-1Mn bioresorbable stents improves corrosion control effects and biocompatibility",
        "Abstract": "    Control of premature corrosion of magnesium (Mg) alloy bioresorbable stents (BRS) is frequently achieved by the addition of rare earth elements. However, limited long-term experience with these elements causes concerns for clinical application and alternative methods of corrosion control are sought after. Herein, we report a \"built-up\" composite film consisting of a bottom layer of MgF2 conversion coating, a sandwich layer of a poly (1, 3-trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) co-spray coating (PA) and on top a layer of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) ultrasonic spray coating to decorate the rare earth element-free Mg-2Zn-1Mn (ZM21) BRS for tailoring both corrosion resistance and biological functions. The developed \"built-up\" composite film shows synergistic functionalities, allowing the compression and expansion of the coated ZM21 BRS on an angioplasty balloon without cracking or peeling. Of special importance is that the synergistic corrosion control effects of the \"built-up\" composite film allow for maintaining the mechanical integrity of stents for up to 3 months, where complete biodegradation and no foreign matter residue were observed about half a year after implantation in rabbit iliac arteries. Moreover, the functionalized ZM21 BRS accomplished re-endothelialization within one month.\n\n    A synergistic composite coating (MgF2-PA-P) was developed for surface modification of magnesium alloy stents to improve their corrosion resistance.\n\n    The degradation behavior of the composite-coated stents was evaluated using different assessment techniques, the corresponding relationship between in vivo and in vitro corrosion was established, and the composite coating's excellent corrosion resistance was demonstrated.\n\n    Composite-coated stents re-endothelialize rapidly one month after implantation, and no foreign material remains after degradation, showing excellent biocompatibility.",
        "Introduction": "    Mg alloy bioresorbable stents (BRS) are a promising alternative to permanent stents due to their absorbability and excellent biocompatibility. However, one of the major factors that limit its clinical application is the intrinsic rapid degradation rate. Many efforts have been made to improve Mg alloy corrosion resistance via material optimization and surface coatings.\n\n    Alloying and purification are the two major means of material optimization. Although purification may significantly improve the corrosion properties of Mg alloys, it weakens their mechanical properties. Alloying adjusts the phase composition and distribution, prevents micro-couple corrosion, and forms a denser and more stable passivation film. Aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), calcium (Ca), lithium (Li), zirconium (Zr), strontium (Sr), and rare earth elements are the most commonly used elements for alloying Mg. However, only a few alloying elements are suitable for degradable Mg alloys from a medical perspective. Some studies have shown that the addition of rare earth elements can inhibit micro galvanic corrosion of Mg alloys. However, the biocompatibility of rare earth elements remains controversial. Zn is a vital element in the human body; the addition of Zn to Mg significantly enhanced its corrosion resistance along with a slight improvement of its mechanical properties. Mn can also eliminate impurities like Fe in Mg alloys. Although significant progress has been made in improving the corrosion resistance of Mg through alloying, its clinical application is still limited by its insufficient corrosion control effects in vivo.\n\n    Surface modification preserves key material properties while improving corrosion resistance and biocompatibility compared to alloying. According to the different coating preparation methods, surface modification can be divided into chemical modification, physical modification, and composite modification. Fluoridation treatment is one of the dominant chemical modifications of Mg alloys, being simple, effective and economical. Furthermore, the formed MgF2 layer is beneficial to the improvement of coating adhesion and corrosion resistance. However, a single MgF2 conversion coating is not appropriate for the final surface modification of Mg alloy stents because the coating is particularly brittle and easily cracks upon deformation.\n\n    In contrast, polymer coatings exhibit excellent ductility and still provide complete coverage of the substrate even when subjected to plastic deformation. Several polymer materials have been widely employed in the surface protection of Mg alloys, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and a poly (1, 3-trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC). PLA and PCL's bulk erosion behavior and their acidic degradation products may accelerate Mg alloy corrosion.\n\n    PTMC has been demonstrated to degrade by surface erosion, which provides long-term effective corrosion protection for Mg alloys. More importantly, the hydrolysis of PTMC is an approximately net neutral ionic process, with a pH that remains within the physiological pH during degradation. This feature differs from others usually considered polymers for implant corrosion prevention. The poor stiffness and high viscosity of PTMC remain barriers to its application in Mg alloy BRS. PLGA is an elastomeric copolymer approved by the FDA. Previous research has revealed that PLGA has tremendous potential as a surface coating for Mg alloys due to its excellent biocompatibility, strong hydrophobicity, and drug-carrying ability.\n\n    Although reasonable surface treatment improves the corrosion resistance of Mg alloy BRS as compared to bare stents, the inadequate bonding force between the coating and the Mg alloy substrate and the accelerated corrosion of the stent caused by acidic corrosion products remain significant challenges for existing coating techniques. Accordingly, rare earth-free Mg alloy BRS with sufficient durability have not yet been accomplished, with the exception of Maris stents.\n\n    Here, we adopted the rare earth-free ZM21 alloy for the stent body and developed a \"built-up\" composite film based on biocompatibility and degradation considerations. The composite film is made up of a PTMC and APTES composite coating in the middle, a uniform and dense MgF2 layer at the bottom, and a PLGA layer on top. Based on the inspiration of solid solution strengthening of alloys, a small amount of APTES was added as a strengthening phase in the PTMC coating by physical spraying. APTES has been confirmed to degrade into a single molecule of Si(OH)4 and would be removed by the urinary system without adverse tissue reactions, and silane-based coatings have also been certified to have excellent biocompatibility. The PA coating not only has a corrosion control effect on the substrate but also effectively blocks the weakly acidic corrosion products of PLGA degradation.\n\n    All of the corrosion samples in this study are based on stents to reflect the service conditions of the final device more accurately, and all stents have been compressed onto balloons and expanded before evaluation. In vitro immersion tests in simulated body solution (SBF) were used to assess the degradation properties of the composite-coated stents comprehensively, and the in vivo degradation behavior of the stents was evaluated by implantation experiments. The primary purpose of this study is to establish a complete corrosion evaluation mechanism and the corresponding relationship between in vivo and in vitro corrosion by evaluating the degradation performance of ZM21 BRS in vivo and in vitro, as well as to assess the biocompatibility of MgF2-PA-PLGA stents.",
        "Methods": "    Coronary stents and metal sheets of the rare earth element-free ZM21 were provided by Baier Maidike Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). The actual chemical composition of ZM21 is listed in Table 1. PTMC (Mw = 200000) and PLGA (Mw = 100000, Mw = 500000, Mw = 800000, with a GA:LA ratio of 25:75) were purchased from Daigang Bioengineering Co., Ltd. (Jinan, China). Anhydrous ethanol (AE), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) were purchased from McLean Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). SBF (pH 7.4) was freshly prepared prior to use.\n\n    The preparation procedure of the \"build-up\" composite film is shown in Fig. 1A. Firstly, the ZM21 stents or sheets were immersed in 40% HF solution under shaking (300 r/min) at 25  C for 8 h. Then, the samples were ultrasonically cleaned with AE for 5 min and desiccated using a vacuum oven. Subsequently, the PTMC and APTES solutions were co-sprayed onto the MgF2 surface to obtain PTMC/APTES composite coatings. Briefly, PTMC (1 mg/mL in THF) and APTES (1% in AE) solutions were filtered using a 0.45 mum filter. Then, the two solutions were filled into two individual syringes and placed on micro syringe pumps. The feeding speeds of PTMC and APTES solutions were 0.05 and 0.01 mL/min, respectively, and 20 spraying cycles were processed. After spraying, the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 100  C for 1 h. The PTMC/APTES composite coating-covered samples were named MgF2-PA. Finally, the PLGA coating was deposited on MgF2-PA. Briefly, PLGA was dissolved in THF (2 mg/mL) and filtered using a 0.45 mum filter. Then, the solution was sprayed onto MgF2-PA with a feeding speed of 0.035 mL/min for 20 cycles. Afterwards, the samples were dried in a vacuum for 1 h at 37  C and stored for future use. The obtained PLGA covered MgF2-PA and was named MgF2-PA-PLGA. Simply put, the \"build-up\" composite film consists of a bottom MgF2 conversion coating, a PA intermediate layer, and a PLGA top layer. PLGA was prepared by spraying PLGA on the surface of bare stents, and PTMC, APTES, and PLGA were sprayed on the surface of MgF2 to prepare MgF2-PTMC, MgF2-APTES, and MgF2-PLGA as control samples.\n\n    The chemical characterization of the stents was performed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in area scan mode with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. EDS analysis was carried out in two locations: the first was scanned at low magnification to determine element distribution, and the second was scanned at high magnification to evaluate element content. The molecular structures of MgF2, MgF2-PTMC, MgF2-APTES, MgF2-PLGA, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA composite coatings were measured by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet 5700, Nicolet Inc., USA). High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the PA coating were obtained using a JSM-7800F Prime instrument (JEOL Ltd., Japan). SEM and a stereo microscope (NSZ-608T, Nanjing Jiangnan Novel Optics Co., Ltd., China) were used to observe the microscopic morphology of the coating after the stent was crimped and expanded to a diameter of 2.75 mm. To measure the coating thickness, the stents were first cut out using microscissors, then the cross-sections were exposed by mounting the samples vertically to the stage. All samples were sputtered gold with a 15 nm thickness before SEM evaluation. The process of compressing and expanding the stent is displayed in Fig. 1B. The stent was first compressed with a radial pressure of 90 N using a stent compression station (Model CX with Autosheath and Alpha-Crimp , BlockWise, USA), and then expanded with a balloon pressure pump (JYLB-01, Shenzhen Jinchengrui Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Chain) under 12 atm water pressure. The radial support force of the ZM21 stents was tested with an electronic universal testing machine (AGS-X 2 kN, Shimadzu, Japan) at a loading rate of 1 mm/min.\n\n    Mg corrodes in aqueous solution generally according to the following reaction formula:\n\n    Consequently, the release of hydrogen can be used to calculate the corrosion rate of Mg alloys. Static hydrogen collecting devices were used to assess the stents' hydrogen evolution rate with a 0.05 ml resolution for the detection of gas generation at very low levels. A Tris/HCl buffered SBF solution was chosen as the corrosion medium to evaluate the in vitro degradation behavior of stents to simulate the blood vessel environment. Before the test, all the stents were crimped with 90 N radial pressure on a balloon delivery system (2.75 x 18 mm), followed by full dilatation with 12 atm pressure. Unless otherwise mentioned, the same compression and expansion procedures were performed for all tests. As shown in Fig. 3A and Figs. S1-C, the expanded stents were fixed in the hydrogen evolution collection devices using fishing lines and immersed in 250 mL of SBF solution for 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 days at 37  C. The relative mass loss of the stent is calculated according to the following formula:where V is hydrogen volume in L; Vm = 22.4 L/mol, representing the molar volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure conditions; M = 24.305 g/mol, which is the relative atomic mass of Mg; and M0 is the initial mass of the stent in g.\n\n    The in vitro corrosion rate of the stent is calculated using the following equation:where:\n\n    VH = volume (ml)/surface area (cm2)/days, the surface area of the stent is 1 cm2, and.\n\n    PH = mm/year.\n\n    The morphology and remaining radial support force of stents after immersion were determined by , stereomicroscopy, and an electronic universal testing machine, respectively. On the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, and 21st days of stent corrosion, 5 ml of stent corrosion solution was collected respectively, and the Mg2+ concentration was detected by atomic absorption spectrometry (TAS-990, Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Co., Ltd.).\n\n    The preparation of stent extracts was performed according to ISO 10993-5:2009 standards. The prepared stents (30 each of PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA) were divided into two groups and put into four centrifuge tubes containing 30 ml of endothelial cell culture medium (ECM, ScienceCell, US) and smooth muscle cell culture medium (SMCM, ScienceCell, US) respectively, and the extracts were collected after 24 h of incubation at 37  C.\n\n    In the cell culture experiment, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMCs) purchased from Guangzhou Geneo Biotech were first subcultured and then seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 x 104 and 2 x 104 cells/ml, respectively. After incubation at 37  C and 5% CO2 for 1 day, the medium was removed, and 1 ml of extract was added to the corresponding wells according to the grouping. The cells cultured with ECM and SMCM medium without extract were used as the control group. The HUVECs and HUASMCs added with different extracts were incubated at 37  C with 5% CO2 for 1, 3, and 5 days, and the cells cultured for 3 and 5 days were replaced with new medium and extracts when they were cultured for 1 and 3 days, respectively. After incubation, the culture medium and extraction solution in the well plate were removed, rinsed with 0.9% saline three times, and 300 muL of fresh culture medium consisting of 90% complete medium and 10% CCK-8 reagent were added to each well. The cells were then incubated for 1 h. Subsequently, 200 muL of the supernatant were collected and transferred into a 96-well plate, and the absorbance value at 450 nm was detected with a microplate reader (Epoch 2, BioTek, VT, USA). The following is a detailed calculation of cell viability:where:\n\n    = OD value of the experimental wells;  = OD value of blank wells;  = OD value of control wells.\n\n    The cells in the 24-well plate were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 2 h, stained with rhodamine 123, and photographed by fluorescence microscopy (Axio Observer Z1, Carl Zeiss, Germany).\n\n    Semi-in vivo as well as short-term implantations of the stent were performed in order to further evaluate the hemocompatibility of the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent. Semi-in vivo experiments were performed using an arteriovenous shunt model that had previously been reported. Before the experiment, New Zealand white rabbits (3-3.5 kg) purchased from Chengdu Dashuo Laboratory Animal Technology Co. were anesthetized by intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg). The extracorporeal circuit was established by connecting the left carotid artery and the right external jugular vein of New Zealand white rabbits, and the 316L stainless steel (SS) stent, PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent were compressed and implanted in the middle of the extracorporeal circuit (Fig. 8A). After 2 h of blood circulation, the experiment was terminated, the cross-section of the tube containing the stent was photographed, and the patency rate was calculated. After that, the stent-containing tubes were fixed overnight in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution and subjected to gradient dehydration and drying. The mass of the thrombus was calculated by extracting the stent from the tube and weighing it prior to analysis by SEM.\n\n    In order to further evaluate the hemocompatibility of the stent in vivo. 316L SS and MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were respectively implanted in the iliac arteries of New Zealand white rabbits (Fig. 8F). Blood vessels containing stents were collected 2 h after implantation and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 24 h, then dehydrated, dealcoholized, and critical point dried for SEM observation.\n\n    Twelve adult male New Zealand white rabbits (3-3.5 kg) were used for stent implantation. The rabbits were divided into three groups according to the time of implantation. Bare ZM21 stents and MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were individually crimped onto 2.75 x 18 mm balloon delivery systems and sterilized by ethylene oxide. Before implantation, rabbits were anesthetized with an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). Then, both bare ZM21 stents and MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were delivered to the left and right iliac arteries by puncturing, respectively. During implantation, the balloon pressure was 12 atm for 40 s. The rabbits were euthanized after 1, 3, and 6 months of implantation, and the arteries containing stents were harvested for micro-CT, SEM, and histological analysis. All animal experimentation procedures complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Regulations on the Administration of Laboratory Animals of Southwest Jiaotong University.\n\n    Harvested arteries containing bare ZM21 and MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were randomly selected for morphological and histological evaluation. The stented arteries were cut into two equal sections along the transverse direction. One section was further longitudinally halved and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 24 h, then dehydrated, dealcoholized, and critical point dried for SEM observation. The other half was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 4 h at room temperature, then dipped in 0.5% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 30 min, then blocked with 1.5% BSA in PBS at 4  C for 12 h. After incubating in mouse anti-rabbit CD31/PECAM-1 antibody solution (Novus Biologicals, 1:200 dilution with 1.5% BSA) and goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor  488 secondary antibody solution (BIOSS, 1:200 dilution with 1.5% BSA) for 12 h at 4  C, the stented artery was stained with phalloidin-TRITC (1:40 dilution with 1.5% BSA) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, dilute to 1 mug/mL with 1% BSA) for 24 h and 10 min, respectively, then observed using a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (A1 Plus, Nikon, Japan) and analyzed with NIS-Elements Viewer Software (NIS-E 4.5, Nikon, Japan). The other transversely halved section was fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. The embedded artery was sliced at 5 mum intervals and cut into five slices. Subsequently, the samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), photographed, and analyzed using a light microscope (CKX41, OLYMPUS, Japan).\n\n    The MgF2-PA-PLGA stents at different time points (1, 3, and 6 months) were scanned using a muCT 100 (SCANCO Medical micro-CT systems, Switzerland) with a scanning resolution of 6.6 mum (70 kV, 114 muA, 230 ms). Mimics Research 21.0 software was used to reconstruct three-dimensional images and calculate the volume of stents and corrosion products.\n\n    All experimental results are expressed as mean +- standard deviation (SD). More than three independent samples were used for each test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) by one-way ANOVA of variance. *p < 0.05 was considered a significant difference between groups.",
        "Results": "    The degradation rate of a Mg alloy BRS is determined by the coating's performance. To comprehensively evaluate the mechanical properties of several coatings, SEM was used to characterize the thickness and surface morphology of the coatings after compression and expansion (Fig. 1B and C). The results showed no obvious deformation or detachment of the MgF2 coating during compression and expansion, implying good mechanical properties of the MgF2 coating. While wrinkles and synechiae appeared after compression and expansion of the PTMC coating. This was mainly caused by the poor stiffness and viscosity of PTMC. By contrast, the APTES coating maintained a continuous and smooth surface morphology after compression with only a few small-sized ruptures. Nevertheless, the number of these cracks increased significantly, and part of the coating detached from the substrate after expansion. These results indicated that pure APTES and PTMC coatings both have poor mechanical properties, leading to severe defects during stent deformation. Defects in the coating could weaken its protective effect and induce localized corrosion. Noticeably, the MgF2-PA coating combined the stiffness and stickiness of PTMC and APTES, retaining its shape without cracking throughout the compression and expansion processes. This shows the synergistic function between PTMC and APTES. In comparison to the MgF2-PA coating, the surface morphology of the \"built-up\" composite film was smoother and also had excellent compression and expansion properties.\n\n    The cross-sectional images showed a dense MgF2 conversion layer with a thickness of 0.75 mum formed on the stent surface. In MgF2-PTMC, MgF2-APTES, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA, the coating thicknesses of PTMC, APTES, PA, and PA-PLGA were 3.5 mum, 5 mum, 4 mum, and 9.5 mum, respectively. The MgF2 coating was not visible in other coatings due to its low thickness. Even though the sample preparation process left a tiny gap between the coating and the substrate, the evaluation of the compression and expansion characteristics of the \"built-up\" composite film shows the coating's excellent adherence to the substrate.\n\n    Fig. 2A shows the surface elemental maps of ZM21, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA stents, and the corresponding atomic mass ratios are shown in Fig. 2B. Mg, Zn, Mn, C, and O are clearly visible on the surface of ZM21. C and O may be caused by surface oxidation or alcohol residues left during stent polishing. The homogeneous distribution of F elements on the MgF2 stent surface implies that the MgF2 film was successfully prepared. The Si in APTES emerged on the surface of the MgF2-PA stent, whereas the F element was very faint, implying that the MgF2 had been covered by the PA coating. Furthermore, a trace quantity of Si was detected on the surface of the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent, illustrating that the PLGA entirely encapsulated the MgF2-PA.\n\n    The FT-IR spectra of each material utilized to prepare the composite coating are displayed in Fig. 2C. No characteristic peak was observed on MgF2 substrates. The MgF2-APTES sample clearly showed a peak around 1045 cm-1, corresponding to Si-O asymmetric stretching in -Si-O-Si-. The peak at 1590 cm-1 was mainly caused by the protonated amino groups from APTES's successful bonding. In addition, APTES forms covalent connections with MgF2 substrates due to hydroxyl groups. The peaks of MgF2-PTMC coating at 1750 cm-1 and 1270 cm-1 correspond to the CO and C-O stretching vibration characteristic peaks of PTMC, respectively. The presence of the PLGA layer is confirmed by the CO stretching at 1775 cm-1 and the C-O stretching at 1215 cm-1 in the MgF2-PLGA coating. In the MgF2-PA coating, the characteristic peaks of PTMC and APTES are seen, but not in the MgF2-PA-PLGA coating. However, the CO stretching at 1775 cm-1 and the C-O stretching characteristic peak at 1215 cm-1 for PLGA were seen in the MgF2-PA-PLGA coating. Furthermore, this solid polysiloxane network with exposed amine functional groups not only promotes adhesion to substrates but also enhances bond strength by forming hydrogen bonds with PTMC and PLGA. In order to study the mixed structure of the PA coating further, 1 mg/ml PTMC, 1% APTES, AE, and THF were mixed two by two. As shown in Figs. S1-A, precipitation formed after the addition of APTES solution or AE to the PTMC solution. Nevertheless, no precipitation occurred after adding THF to the APTES solution. This reveals that PTMC is AE-insoluble. As shown in Figs. S1-B, the PA coating has a microphase separation structure. The EDS results show that the continuous phase has a higher silicon content, indicating that the continuous phase is APTES. Additionally, when PTMC and APTES were co-sprayed on the surface of the stent, THF evaporated quicker than AE, causing PTMC to precipitate in AE and form a microphase-separated structure. The above results revealed that the \"built-up\" composite film was successfully prepared on the material's surface.\n\n    The in vitro degradation rates of bare ZM21 and modified stents were evaluated by a hydrogen release detection device. The upgraded hydrogen evolution device is an inverted cylindrical funnel that can contain more electrolytes and increase the ion exchange of the solution around the bracket. Moreover, the gas volume resolution of 0.05 mL allows for the detection of tiny gas changes (Figs. S2-D). In the corrosion assessment, a blank group was included to eliminate the impact of the solution itself on the hydrogen release rate. The hydrogen release curves of the PLGA-coated stents are shown in Figs. S2-A. The protective effects of three molecular weight PLGAs on bare stents did not vary significantly. As shown in Figs. S2-B, bare ZM21 stents had the highest hydrogen release rate, whereas stents coated with MgF2, PLGA, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA had gradually decreased release rates. The gas release curves of the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent and the blank group were almost identical, revealing that the \"built-up\" composite film stents basically did not corrode during four days of immersion.\n\n    Fig. 3B displays the hydrogen release curves of the stents in each group after blank-correction. It is obvious that the MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents did not release substantial hydrogen after immersion for 4 days. The curve reached a plateau after 24 h of immersion, suggesting that the bare ZM21 stents had degraded entirely. MgF2 stents and PLGA stents prolonged the period of degradation to 4 days in comparison to bare stents, whereas MgF2-PA stents dissolved around 50% after 4 days of immersion. Fig. 3C shows that the MgF2-PA-PLGA stents had almost no hydrogen release during the first seven days of immersion, but that the quantity of hydrogen release steadily increased over the seventh through twenty-first days of immersion. This indicates that the MgF2-PA-PLGA stents degrade as immersion time increases. Fig. 3D shows the Mg2+ release rate of the MgF2-PA-PLGA stents at various time periods during immersion. The amount of Mg2+ released in the solution steadily increases as the immersion period increases. At the same time, the mass loss data in Fig. 3E revealed that the stent's mass loss was maintained at a low level throughout the early stage of immersion and increased significantly from 14 to 21 days. In addition, Fig. 3F depicts that the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent has the lowest corrosion rate of 0.26 +- 0.08 mm/y, whereas the bare stent, PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA have corrosion rates of 6.89 +- 0.82, 0.74 +- 0.23, 1.26 +- 0.27, and 1.60 +- 0.52 mm/y, respectively. The above results indicate that the \"built-up\" composite layer has an excellent corrosion control function on the bare stent.\n\n    The corrosion morphologies of bare ZM21 stents and modified stents after immersion in SBF for 4 h, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 14 days, and 21 days are shown in Fig. 4. The macro-corrosion morphology is shown in Fig. 4A. After immersion for 4 h, the bare stents were severely corroded, and the majority of the stent struts were broken. The corrosion resistance of the modified stent was significantly improved compared to the bare stent. The MgF2 stent retained its physical structure during the first two days of immersion, but it was completely dissolved by the fourth day. The MgF2-PA stent still had a relatively complete structure after 4 days, but some areas were seriously corroded. However, when the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent was immersed on the 14th day, it still retained the complete structure, indicating that the MgF2-PA-PLGA coating had excellent corrosion protection on the ZM21 stents. The MgF2-PA-PLGA stent, however, was severely corroded after 21 days of immersion, indicating that the stent exhibited accelerated corrosion from the 14th to the 21st day of immersion.\n\n    The microscopic corrosion morphology is shown in Fig. 4B, which is consistent with the results of the macroscopic morphology. Many cracks appeared on the surface of the bare ZM21 stent after immersion for 4 h, which indicated that the stent had undergone severe crevice corrosion. The same phenomenon also occurs after immersion of the MgF2 stent for 1 day. It is clearly seen that the most serious corrosion is in the bending part of the stents. On the contrary, the coating on MgF2-PA-PLGA stents did not have obvious cracking phenomena even after immersion until the 14th day. However, severe corrosion occurred on the surface of the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent after 21 days of immersion, and the stent struts were distorted. This clearly displays the \"built-up\" composite film's excellent corrosion control effects, as well as the synergistic functions of the MgF2, PA, and PLGA coatings.\n\n    The cross-sections of the stents immersed at different times were evaluated by SEM in order to reflect the overall corrosion morphology more accurately. Furthermore, the stress concentration area is enlarged and analyzed (Fig. 5A). The results demonstrate that all of the stents exhibit a more severe tendency to corrosion in the stress concentration area than in other regions. After 14 days of immersion, the MgF2-PA-PLGA stents still had their full physical structure, but the protective coating at the stress concentration location had decreased, which is also shown in Fig. 5B. However, after 21 days of immersion, the stent structure was distorted, and more severe corrosion occurred in the stress concentration region. This indicates that during long-term immersion of a stent, the preferential corrosion sites seem to be the bending sections, or stress concentration sites. In situ corrosion of expanded and unexpanded MgF2-PA-PLGA stents confirmed this hypothesis (Fig. 5B). During a 21-day immersion, the unexpanded stents exhibited no corrosive signs. Nevertheless, the number of corrosion sites on the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent increased on the 14th day of immersion, and the corrosion area expanded further after 21 days of immersion. This phenomenon clearly illustrates that the stent's compression and expansion significantly influence the coating, particularly at the locations of stress concentration. Furthermore, despite the fact that corrosion sites were observed in the MgF2-PA-PLGA stents after 14 days of immersion due to stress concentration, compared to bare ZM21 stents, the corrosion resistance of MgF2-PA-PLGA stents in vitro was substantially superior. This is sufficient evidence that the \"built-up\" composite film stent has outstanding corrosion control effects in vitro.\n\n    The surface morphology of the stent after corrosion can only reflect the stent's local corrosion degree and hardly reveal changes in the stent's mechanical characteristics. As a result, it is necessary to evaluate the radial support force of the stents after corrosion. Fig. 6 depicts the variations in radial support force of the stents after different immersion times. It can be seen that the bare stent completely lost its supporting force after immersion for one day, while the supporting force of the MgF2 stent and the MgF2- stent dropped sharply after two days of immersion. On the fourth day, the supporting force of the MgF2- stent was less than 40% of the initial supporting force (Fig. 6C). The predominant cause of the decrease in supporting force of MgF2- coated stents after 4 days of immersion was the rapid breakdown of the coating and the occurrence of localized corrosion spots (Fig. 5A). Fig. S2-C reveals that the supporting force of the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent decreases in a linear way, and even after 21 days of immersion, 16% of the supporting force persists, demonstrating once again the MgF2-PA-PLGA coating's exceptional corrosion control effects.\n\n    Excellent biocompatibility is considered a prerequisite for the clinical application of implanted devices. As a result, we performed biological experiments in vitro on PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA. As shown in Fig. 7A, there were no significant differences in the morphology of HUVECs cultured in the control group, PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA extracts after 1, 3, and 5 days of incubation. The cell viability data (Fig. 7B) similarly revealed that there was no significant difference in the cell vitality of HUVECs in various groups after 1 day of culture. Although there was a significant difference in cell viability between the PLGA group and the control and MgF2-PA-PLGA groups after 3 and 5 days of incubation, cell viability remained over 85%, indicating that PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA extracts had no cytotoxicity to HUVECs. Fig. 7C shows the morphology, and cell viability data of HUASMCs cultured with PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA extracts for 1, 3, and 5 days. Compared to the control group, MgF2, MgF2-PA, and MgF2-PA-PLGA exhibited no discernible cytotoxicity.\n\n    The morphology and cross-sectional images of the tube in Fig. 8 B revealed no severe thrombus formation or occlusion after 2 h of blood flow, but there was still a minor quantity of thrombus consisting of blood cells and reticular fibrin structures in local areas (Fig. S3). In addition, Fig. 8D shows that the clogging rate of PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, MgF2-PA-PLGA, and 316L SS after 2 h of blood circulation is less than 10%. The SEM images in Fig. 8E revealed that there were just a few round platelets on the surface of most sections of all stents.\n\n    Fig. 8G displays thrombus formation on the stent surface 2 h after the MgF2-PA-PLGA and 316L SS stents were implanted in the iliac artery. There is no significant thrombus generation in the blood vessels implanted with MgF2-PA-PLGA and 316L SS stents. However, a typical fibrous network structure emerged on the side of the stent's bending section, followed by local red blood cell accumulations. The turbulent flow at the bending location of the stent slows the blood flow at this site, which should be the primary cause of thrombus development. The above results indicate that there are no significant differences in the hemocompatibility of PLGA, MgF2, MgF2-PA, MgF2-PA-PLGA, and 316L SS stents.\n\n    To evaluate the degradation behavior of the stents in vivo, bare stents and MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were implanted into New Zealand white rabbit arteries. Three-dimensional images of MgF2-PA-PLGA stents implanted at 1, 3, and 6 months were reconstructed by high-resolution micro-CT technology. Fig. 9 shows micro-CT images and the volume of Mg stents and corrosion products implanted at different time points. The MgF2-PA-PLGA stent retained physical integrity during one month of implantation in vivo (Fig. 9A-i and A-ii), only a few points of the stent were corroded, and the corrosion locations were the bends of the stent structure (inset in Fig. 9A-i). This is consistent with the results of the in vitro corrosion. At three months, the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent exhibited severe corrosion, especially at the stress concentration sites (Fig. 9A-iii), but the geometry of the stent was still recognizable. Moreover, the stent retracted significantly in the absence of blood pressure due to the lack of support force. At six months, the outline of the stent was no longer observable, except for some scattered corrosion particles and debris (Fig. 8, Fig. 9vi).\n\n    Fig. 9B depicts the cross-sectional slices of the stented vessels. Homogeneous vessel walls and intact cross-sectional pictures of stent struts were found at 1 month. Three months after the MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were implanted, the lumen was obviously lost, and the intima thickness increased, which may be related to the rapid degradation of the stents. At six months, a few stent struts were seen. Volume changes of stents and corrosion products at different time points were calculated by grayscale adjustment in Mimics Research 21.0 software and are shown in Fig. 9C. At 1 and 3 months after stent implantation, the volume of corrosion products remained between 20% and 25%, implying that the degradation products were continuously absorbed. The volumes of MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were 82.6 +- 3.4%, 49.5 +- 10.6%, and 3.1 +- 0.2% after 1, 3, and 6 months after implantation, respectively.\n\n    Image J was used to determine the vessel wall thickness and lumen area from the CT scans. Consistent with the findings in Fig. 9B, the lumen was drastically reduced three months after implantation, decreasing from 4.3 +- 0.3 mm2 at 1 month to 1.0 +- 0.1 mm2 at 3 months, and the vessel wall thickness fell from 206.9 +- 43.9 mum to 391.7 +- 58.6 mum. At six months, the tendency was the opposite; the vessel wall thickness gradually decreased and the lumen area increased.\n\n    The surfaces of the MgF2-PA-PLGA and bare ZM21 stents were covered entirely by tissue one month after implantation into the iliac arteries (Fig. 10A) with the structure of the stents still visible. The stent with the MgF2-PA-PLGA coating retained its mechanical integrity, but the bare ZM21 stent corroded severely at its corners and lost mechanical recoil. To further evaluate the degree of endothelialization, immunofluorescence staining was performed on vessels containing MgF2-PA-PLGA coating and bare stents implanted for 1 month (Fig. 10B). The results showed that the bare stent had fewer nuclei than the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent. Also, both MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents and bare stents showed CD31 expression, but MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents had a denser and more intact endothelial cell layer.\n\n    At 3 months, the MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents were still visible, but the structure had deteriorated, whereas the bare stents were entirely invisible. The MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stent structures were not visible after 6 months, which is consistent with the micro-CT data stated above. Furthermore, the inner wall of the blood artery clearly showed oval endothelial cells growing in the direction of blood flow. This implies that the vascular tissue in the area where the stent was implanted has begun to remodel and that the stent did not have a negative effect on the blood vessel after complete degradation.\n\n    Histological techniques were used to evaluate the biocompatibility of MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents and bare ZM21 stents (Fig. 11A). Some tissue was removed from its original place during tissue sectioning due to a mechanical mismatch between the stent struts and the paraffin-embedded tissue. At 1 month, the MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents and bare ZM21 stents were wrapped in new tissue. Furthermore, the struts of the MgF2-PA-PLGA stent were clearly visible, while some areas of the bare ZM21 stent had been corroded, and no obvious accumulation of corrosion products was found around the corroded struts.\n\n    At 3 months, the arteries implanted with bare ZM21 stents had more severe tissue hyperplasia than those implanted with MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents. The bare stents dissolved completely 6 months after implantation, leaving no corrosion products. Similarly, only a few small particles of the MgF2-PA-PLGA coated stents were discovered, and no corrosion products were detected in other regions. In-stent restenosis data (Fig. 11C) indicated that bare stents had a restenosis rate of 30 +- 7% at 1 month, compared to 9.2 +- 1.1% for MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents. At three months after implantation, the restenosis rates for bare ZM21 and MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents were 78.2 +- 4.1% and 59.1 +- 5.2%, respectively. At six months, the restenosis rates for both stents decreased to 70.8 +- 6.2% and 52.7 +- 6.9%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11D, the lumen areas of the three-month stents were much smaller than those of the one-month stents, but they increased for the six-month stents. There were also significant differences in vessel wall thickness at different times after stent implantation. The vascular wall implanted with a bare stent and MgF2-PA-PLGA stent was thinnest at 1 month, 401.8 +- 128 mum and 267.2 +- 78.7 mum, and thickest at 3 months, 668.8 +- 106.3 mum and 555.1 +- 111.3 mum, respectively (Fig. 11D). It decreased to 471.2 +- 68.2 mum and 474.3 +- 98.3 mum at 6 months, respectively. This indicates that the intimal proliferation has been alleviated with the degradation of the stents.",
        "Conclusion": "    In summary, we developed a \"built-up\" composite film fabrication technique to improve the corrosion control effects of Mg alloy BRS. The degradation mechanism of MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents was determined by corrosion in vitro and stent implantation in vivo. The results showed that the MgF2-PA-PLGA coated stents still had mechanical integrity one month after implantation compared to bare ZM21 stents. The mass loss was 50.49 +- 10.6% at three months of implantation and almost complete at six months. The stress concentration induced during stent compression and expansion is the main factor leading to the early degradation of MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents. Although rapid degradation led to intimal hyperplasia three months after the MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stent was implanted, the level of intimal hyperplasia was greatly reduced at 6 months after implantation, and no foreign matter remained in the tissue, suggesting full resorption of the ZM21 stent with its coating. Therefore, we believe that although rare earth-free Mg alloys have faster corrosion rates, they still have great potential in the field of BRS as long as their degradation rates can be reasonably controlled through coating modification.\n\n    All stent implantation procedures complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Regulations on the Administration of Laboratory Animals of Southwest Jiaotong University.",
        "Discussion": "    Reasonable surface modification contributes to the improvement of the corrosion control effects and biocompatibility of the Mg alloy BRS. In this study, MgF2-PA-PLGA \"build-up\" composite films were successfully prepared on the ZM21 BRS surface. The PA coatings formed by the co-spraying of PTMC and APTES exhibited excellent compression and expansion properties. The covalent bond between APTES and the substrate improves the adhesion of the PA coating with MgF2. The PLGA on the top layer may also form hydrogen bonds with APTES to improve adherence to the PA coating.\n\n    The assessment of a biomedical implant must be performed under the most accurate service conditions. PTMC and APTES have shown superior corrosion resistance in prior studies. However, different results were obtained when we sprayed individual PTMC and APTES onto the surface of ZM21 BRS. Despite the fact that the surface morphology was impeccable after spraying, the coating suffered substantial damage during compression and expansion (Fig. 1B). Flat samples were used in the majority of studies, resulting in the actual service environment of the stents being ignored. Compression and expansion are two essential steps of vascular stent implantation, which pose a high challenge to the coating's interfacial adhesion and mechanical characteristics. Excellent expanding properties have been demonstrated for PA coatings sprayed with PTMC and APTES, they are attributed to the synergistic functions of APTES and PTMC performance. In addition, spraying PLGA over the PA coating overcomes the peeling issue caused by the inadequate adhesion between the polymer and the Mg substrate. Simultaneously, the PLGA top layer is not only corrosion resistant but may also be employed as a medication carrier. This will promote the synergistic function of various coatings.\n\n    In addition, an improved gas volume detection device with enough resolution was utilized. In vitro evaluation results showed that the corrosion resistance of the MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stent was significantly improved compared with the bare stent. Although the MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents had excellent corrosion resistance in static immersion, similar to all other stents, the SEM images of the stents after corrosion revealed that the corrosion degree of the stent bending sections was much higher than that of other parts. It has been demonstrated that during stent compression and expansion, stress concentrations are observed at stent bending locations. Although the degree of stress concentration can still be reduced by optimizing the structure, it remains inevitable. Therefore, the coating's protection just delays the beginning of corrosion in the stress concentration area. Fig. 12 depicts the stent's coating state alterations during expansion and immersion, as determined by comparing the corrosion morphology in vitro and in vivo. After spraying, the stent surface showed a homogeneous and dense coating. Nevertheless, when the stent is compressed and expanded, the coating on the inner surface is subjected to tensile stress due to the stent's plastic deformation. On the one hand, the coating of the deformed portion gets thinner under the influence of tensile tension. In addition, under the effect of the corrosion medium, the coating at tensile stress is more likely to be eroded and generate defects or cracks, and the formation of defects or cracks increases the corrosion rate and corrosion non-uniformity.\n\n    Establishing the connection between in vivo and in vitro is an urgent task to be solved at present. It is widely accepted that in vitro corrosion is more severe than in vivo corrosion, as indicated by prior research. The Micro- results of the stent implanted for one month revealed that the MgF2-PA-PLGA coated stent still had its complete physical structure and provided enough radial support for the blood vessel. However, there were traces of corrosion in a few stress concentration regions, which was consistent with the in vitro corrosion results. The stent's mass loss rate reached 50% three months after implantation, with localized corrosion predominating. As depicted in Figs. S4-A, the mass loss of in vitro immersion for 14 and 21 days was 23.7 +- 8.3% and 80.3 +- 25%, respectively. It is clear that the corrosion accelerated during the 14-20 days of immersion. The coating degradation and the increase of the defect area are the primary causes of the stent's rapid corrosion. The degradation rates were 17.4 +- 3.4% and 50.5 +- 10.55% after 1 and 3 months of implantation in vivo, respectively (Figs. S4-B). In contrast to the in vitro degradation process, the in vivo degradation process exhibits no obvious corrosion acceleration. The impact of coating degradation and endothelialization on the material's corrosion rate should also be considered. Endothelialization of the stent after implantation in vivo slows corrosion, but the consistently high ion exchange rate between the stent and the electrolyte during the corrosion process in vitro promotes coating degradation and corrosion of the stent. As shown in Figs. S4-C, the corrosion rate ratios of 14 days in vitro to 30 days and 90 days in vivo were 2.91 +- 0.59 and 3.02 +- 1.2, and the corrosion rate ratios of 21 days in vitro to 30 days and 90 days in vivo were 6.86 +- 1.17 and 6.63 +- 1.15, respectively. Studies have also shown that for samples with <20% corrosion, an approximate in vitro-in vivo multiple of 1.3 +- 0.2 is used, while when Mg samples are degraded by 25-35%, a multiplier of 1.8 +- 0.2 becomes appropriate. Comparing in vitro and in vivo mechanical behavior during degradation, the combined in vitro and in vivo metric value was 3.1 +- 0.7. It is clear that any approximate multiples of in vivo and in vitro can only be compared under certain evaluation conditions. Outside of assessment conditions, evaluating the relationship between in vivo and in vitro would be meaningless.\n\n    For BRS, it is required that the degradation products of the stents do not cause local or systemic toxicity and are expected to contribute to the remodeling and healing process of blood vessels. This not only necessitates that the materials of the stent be biocompatible but also assures that the stents be capable of promoting endothelialization and offering adequate mechanical support in vivo. Rapid endothelialization has been demonstrated to be crucial for inhibiting intimal hyperplasia, restenosis, and late stent thrombosis. An ideal biodegradable stent is considered to be able to strike a balance between degradation and mechanical integrity after implantation. Theoretically, the stent should provide sufficient mechanical support for the first six months, while gradually degrading and remodeling the vessel over the next 6-12 months. After this period, the presence of the stent in vivo has no positive impact. It has also been recently reported that degradable stents should maintain radial support of the vessel for 3-4 months to aid in vascular remodeling.\n\n    Although the micro- data indicated that the effective support time of the stent was less than 3 months, the findings of biocompatibility research are really encouraging. The scanning electron microscope and laser confocal pictures in Fig. 10 indicate that the stent quickly endothelialized one month after implantation and that the vessel began remodeling at six months as the stent degraded. The HE staining data in Fig. 11 also showed that the bare stent was substantially degraded at 3 months with severe intimal hyperplasia, but this phenomenon was significantly improved at 6 months, and no corrosion product residue was observed. At 3 months, intimal hyperplasia is primarily caused by fast stent degradation that results in \"overload\" of degradation products and vascular rebound from the lack of support force. Additionally, studies have shown that low Mg2+ concentrations (10 mM) increas cell survival, proliferation rate, and cell adhesion. Higher concentrations of Mg2+ (40-60 mM) exhibited the opposite impact on cells. After six months, the degrading microenvironment shifted due to the dissolved remnants of the stent, and the vessels were rebuilt. For MgF2-PA-PLGA-coated stents, the degree of intimal hyperplasia was much lower than that of bare stents, which was related to the slow degradation of stents. Although the in vitro evaluation demonstrated that the MgF2-PA-PLGA stents were non-cytotoxic, the extract could not truly reflect the microenvironment after stent degradation. Fig. 3D shows that there is a low level of Mg2+ release early in the immersion, but corrosion acceleration occurs later in the immersion and the concentration of Mg2+ increases significantly. Even though degradation is different in vivo and in vitro, the continued degradation of the stent after endothelialization also causes a rise in the local pH and the concentration of Mg2+. This may be the primary cause of intimal hyperplasia. The gradual disappearance of corrosion products proved that the stent was completely absorbed in vivo. This eliminates concerns regarding the implant's long-term safety due to prolonged degradation. It should be noted that although the results in Fig. 11C showed that the lumen area was significantly reduced after three months, the reduction in radial support force due to stent degradation was still not negligible, which led to the contraction of isolated vessels when there was no blood pressure.\n\n    The above study revealed that surface-modified ZM21 stents exhibited superior corrosion control effects and biocompatibility compared to bare ZM21 stents. Although the performance of the stents in this study was significantly improved, there are still several flaws: (1) The degradation correlation between in vitro and long-term in vivo implants is unclear. (2) Although it has been shown that stress concentration has negative effects on coatings, this issue is not entirely resolved. (3) The durability of stents still does not meet the requirements, and the surface modification coating technology still needs to be improved. These works will be covered in a further study.",

        "Abstract": "    DNA damage during early life stages may have a negative effect on embryo development, inducing mortality and malformations that have long-lasting effects during adult life. Therefore, in the current study, we analyzed the effect of DNA damage induced by genotoxicants (camptothecin (CPT) and olaparib) at different stages of embryo development. The survival, DNA fragmentation, transcriptome, and proteome of the endangered sturgeon Acipenser ruthenus were analyzed. Sturgeons are non-model fish species that can provide new insights into the DNA damage response and embryo development. The transcriptomic and proteomic patterns changed significantly after exposure to genotoxicants in a stage-dependent manner. The results of this study indicate a correlation between phenotype formation and changes in transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. CPT and olaparib downregulated oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways, and upregulated pathways involved in nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and homologous recombination. We observed the upregulated expression of zona pellucida sperm-binding proteins in all treatment groups, as well as the upregulation of several glycolytic enzymes. The analysis of gene expression revealed several markers of DNA damage response and adaptive stress response, which could be applied in toxicological studies on fish embryos. This study is the first complex analysis of the DNA damage response in endangered sturgeons.",
        "Introduction": "    Genotoxicity is the property of chemical agents to induce DNA damage, modifications, rearrangements, and mutations. The issue of genotoxicity has become increasingly important as numerous genotoxic compounds have been found in the environment. Previous studies have shown that genotoxic compounds may have a long-term impact on organisms, particularly on developing embryos. Embryogenesis is sensitive to DNA damage as the cell cycle is short and DNA replication is fast. Furthermore, most vertebrate species lack functional cell-cycle control checkpoints at the early stages of development. Subsequently, if embryos are exposed to genotoxicants before checkpoint activation, DNA synthesis and cell division continue in the presence of damaged DNA. In fish, after the midblastula transition (MBT) checkpoints become activated, they can block developing embryos until DNA is repaired or apoptosis is initiated. Thus, embryonic development and the cell cycle are closely associated with DNA repair.\n\n    The main DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, which are highly conserved between organisms, include nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), DNA mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Nevertheless, the activity of these pathways during embryo development and their ability to mitigate DNA damage at different stages is still not fully described, particularly in non-model species.\n\n    In the current study, the focus was made on the embryonic response to DNA damage in sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus). The sterlet belongs to the family of sturgeons (Acipenserids), a group of ray-finned fish, which likely evolved approximately 200 million years ago. They have been classified as vulnerable fishes by international organizations (available online:  (accessed on 31 May 2022)). Sturgeons are important aquaculture species known for their meat and caviar production. They represent an attractive model for studying DDR owing to their multiple rounds of lineage-specific whole-genome duplication. Furthermore, sturgeons have extraordinary genomic plasticity, as demonstrated through intraspecific hybridization of individuals with different chromosome numbers, events of spontaneous polyploidization, and artificial ploidy manipulation that yields the highest documented chromosome number in vertebrates. According to the authors of, genome size is linearly related to the number of DNA repair genes and proteins. Taking all this into account, it is possible to speculate that the sturgeon's genome plasticity would require a highly effective DDR.\n\n    Several studies have already investigated the complex effects of water pollution on the transcriptome and/or proteome of model species, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio). Such advanced \"omics\" approaches can decipher the mode of action of the compound and help to understand the organism's response to certain types of toxicity. One of the most popular \"omics\" techniques for the determination of adverse effects is transcriptomics (analysis of RNA transcript abundance). There are several advantages to transcriptomics, such as the low quantity of the biological material needed for analysis, high sensitivity, and robustness. However, the key regulators of the cellular pathways are proteins, which can undergo post-translational modifications and degradation; thus, the levels of functionally available proteins may be independent of transcription. However, 2D gel protein electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry (MS) has limited sensitivity and requires a large quantity of biological material.\n\n    Surprisingly, very few studies have performed complex analyses of the DDR in aquatic organisms, even though DNA damage is commonly used as a biomarker of exposure. Further, it is important to establish the link between phenotype formation and changes in \"omics\" profiles. It is possible to hypothesize that treatment with the same concentration of a genotoxicant at different stages could induce different phenotypes. Therefore, by using stage specificity of DDR and different types of DNA damaging agents, it could be possible to establish molecular markers of adverse effects. In the present study the effect of two genotoxic compounds, camptothecin (CPT) and olaparib (Ola), on sterlet embryo development was analyzed at different stages. Camptothecin is an inhibitor of topoisomerase I (Top1), an enzyme that regulates DNA topology. CPT stabilizes Top1-DNA complexes leading to their conversion into DNA single- and double-strand breaks (SSB and DSB). Olaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA damage sensing and repair. Both chemicals are commonly used in studies on DNA damage and repair. To understand the DDR in fish embryos, the effect of CPT and Ola on embryo morphology, DNA fragmentation, the transcriptome, and the proteome was analyzed at different stages of embryo development.",
        "Methods": "    Gametes were collected from live sterlets during the natural spawning period. Manipulations with broodstock were performed according to the law on the protection of animals against cruelty (Act no. 246/1992 Coll.) as a part of the sturgeon breeding program in the certified workplace (ref. number 6OZ3066/2020-18134, Czech Republic). Fish embryos were exposed to genotoxicants before reaching an independently feeding larval form. Therefore, no special approval from the local ethical committee was needed according to the laws to protect animals against maltreatment (Act no. 246/1992 Coll., Czech Republic).\n\n    As previously described, the sterlets (BW, 0.5-2 kg; 12 females, 12 males) were reared in the aquaculture facility of the Research Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology at the University of South Bohemia, Vodnany, The Czech Republic. Before experimentation, fish were held in 5 m3 indoor tanks supplied with recirculating water system at 14-15  C for 7 days prior to hormone stimulation. To induce ovulation, female fish were injected with carp pituitary extract powder (Rybnikarstvi Pohorelice, Czech Republic) dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution at an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight. The second injection of carp pituitary powder (4.5 mg/kg of body weight) was performed 12 h after the first injection. Oocytes were collected 18-20 h after the second injection through a minimally invasive incision in the oviduct. Sperm production in males was induced by an intramuscular injection of carp pituitary extract powder (4.0 mg/kg of body weight) dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution. At 48 h post-injection, sperm was collected from the urogenital papilla with a catheter. The collected sperm was stored at 4  C in separate cell culture containers (250 mL) until use. Eggs were fertilized with sperm (about 3 x 104 spermatozoa per egg) activated in dechlorinated tap water at 15  C for 2 min, and the stickiness of fertilized eggs was removed by three washes with 0.1% tannic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) solution for 1 min. The identification of early developmental stages was based on studies of Acipenser baerii and Acipenser guldenstadti. The embryos were incubated in Petri dishes with dechlorinated tap water at 16  C; each Petri dish contained approximately 50 embryos.\n\n    The compounds concentrations were selected based on the available literature data and our pilot experiments (Supplementary Table S4). The final concentrations of 7 nM CPT (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA, CAS Number: 7689-03-4) and 20 microM Ola (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) were used. Stock solutions 1000x concentrated (7 microM CPT and 20 mM Ola) were prepared in DMSO. Further, the stock solutions were added to the embryo culture medium (dechlorinated tap water) at a 1:1000 ratio to produce the required concentrations in the medium and 0.1% DMSO (v/v). The same amount of DMSO (0.1% in embryo culture medium) was used as a solvent control.\n\n    For each treatment, a group of 50 fertilized and developing embryos at the two-cell stage were transferred to a Petri dish. Each dish contained either vehicle control or a test compound in a total of 30 mL of dechlorinated tap water. Embryos were exposed to 7 nM CPT or 20 microM Ola for 24 h during one of three stages: (1) 2-24 h-post-fertilization (hpf) (blastula); (2) 24-48 hpf (gastrulation); (3) 48-72 hpf (neurulation). Genotoxicants were replaced with fresh water after 24 h exposure. Embryos were held in separate Petri dishes in dechlorinated tap water. Water was changed every day, and dead embryos were continuously removed. Six biological replicates were performed for each experiment.\n\n    embryonic viability, % (number of live embryos/number of fertilized eggs x 100).\n\n    hatching rate, % (number of hatched larvae/number of fertilized eggs x 100).\n\n    occurrence of malformations.\n\n    Embryos were examined daily under a stereomicroscope (NSZ-608T, Nanjing Jiangnan Novel Optics Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) and counted until hatching (8 days post-fertilization, dpf). The following parameters were analyzed:\n\n    The embryo phenotypes were observed under a microscope and imaged at 2.5x magnification. A minimum of 150 embryos were analyzed per treatment.\n\n    DNA integrity was assessed using comet assays, or single cell gel electrophoresis assays, as described in our previous study. Briefly, embryos at different stages were transferred into 1.5 mL tubes (3-4 embryos in each tube) with 1x PBS on ice. Embryos were mechanically disintegrated and centrifuged at 1000x g for 3 min. The pellets containing embryonic cells were washed with 1 mL of PBS, centrifuged at 1000x g for 3 min, and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS.\n\n    Microscope slides (OxiSelectST; Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) used for the assay were prepared as follows: resuspended samples (200 microL) were mixed with 700 microL of 0.7% NuSieve GTG low melting point agarose (OxiSelectST; Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Forty microliters of this mixture was placed on the slide, and the agarose was allowed to solidify at 4  C. Afterward, slides were immersed in lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO, pH 10) and incubated overnight at 4  C. After the cells were lysed, the buffer was removed, and the slides were placed in a horizontal gel tank filled with freshly prepared electrophoresis buffer (90 mM Tris base, 90 mM boric acid, 2.5 mM EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed for 20 min at 35 V and 170 mA. Following electrophoresis, the slides were washed three times with pre-chilled DI H2O for 2 min. The washed slides were dehydrated with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and then stored at 4  C. Before the analysis, 50 microL of PBS containing DAPI/Antifade Staining Solution (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) was added to the slides for agarose rehydration and DNA staining. The slides were analyzed using an Olympus B x 50 fluorescence microscope at 20x magnification. A minimum of 30 cells was scored for each sample. The images were analyzed with CometScore image analysis software (TriTek Corporation, USA). The percentage of DNA in the tail was calculated using the following formula: %Tail DNA = 100 x Tail DNA intensity/Cell DNA intensity\n\n    The embryos for RNA sequencing were collected at 7 dpf and immediately transferred to a -80  C freezer. Only embryos from the following groups were used for RNA sequencing: CPT 24-48, CPT 48-72, Ola 2-24, and Ola 24-48. Those groups were chosen based on the level of DNA damage and observed phenotypes. For each treatment, only embryos showing typical phenotypes were selected.\n\n    For total RNA extraction, 1 mL of TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol and then re-precipitated with LiCl. Total RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the quality of RNA was assessed using a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical). In total, three biological replicates (three embryos per condition) were prepared for sequencing.\n\n    Libraries for RNASeq were prepared using 700 ng of total RNA. The sequencing libraries were prepared using the SureSelect Strand-Specific RNA Library Prep for Illumina Multiplexed Sequencing (Agilent, G9691) based on the poly-A protocol. The libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 instrument in PE75 high-output mode.\n\n    Approximately 5-10 million raw sequencing reads per sample were obtained. Adaptor sequences and low-quality reads were filtered using TrimmomaticPE (v. 0.36) with parameters \"CROP:70 HEADCROP:12 ILLUMINACLIP: TruSeq-PE3.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36\". SortMeRNA (v. 2.1b) was used to remove any remaining rRNA and mtRNA reads. The reads were pseudo-aligned to the transcriptome of Acipenser baerii (available online:  (accessed on 31 May 2022)) using kallisto (v. 0.43.1) and a count table generated. Before normalization, transcripts were removed that had zero counts in all samples.\n\n    Normalization of the raw counts and detection of the DEGs between the treatment and the control samples were determined using R (v. 4.1.0) software, DESeq2 (v. 1.32.0), using the median-of-ratios method, and a 0.1 p-adjusted (padj) cutoff. Differentially upregulated and downregulated genes were defined as those with padj < 0.1 and log2foldchange greater than one or less than one respectively. Gene ontology (targeting biological processes) and pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed using gprofiler2 (v. 0.2.0) with the default parameters. All the annotatable genes for A. ruthenus were used as a custom statistical background, with multiple testing correction performed using Set Counts and Sizes (g:SCS) with a significance cutoff of 0.05. Related Gene Ontology (GO) terms were then clustered and summarized using the simplifyEnrichment package (v. 1.2.0) with a p-adjusted threshold of 0.05, human reference annotation database, and the binary_cut clustering method. Using Pathview (v. 1.32.0), KEGG maps were produced for the identification of the genes significantly upregulated and downregulated within the cell cycle (pathway: hsa04110), BER (pathway: hsa03410), mismatch repair (pathway hsa03430), NER (hsa03420), homologous repair (hsa03440) pathways. Genes that were known to be involved in DNA damage repair, cell checkpoint, and cell cycle regulation (; KEGG database) were subset from the RNASeq dataset and their fold-change and differential status relative to the control was queried.\n\n    The results of transcriptome analysis have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE190524 (available online:  (accessed on 9 December 2021)).\n\n    Embryos at 7 dpf were mechanically dissociated in protein extraction buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM EDTA, 1 mM okadaic acid) and protease inhibitors (100 mM PMSF, 1 mg/mL pepstatin A, 5 mg/mL leupeptin). Proteins were extracted from at least four embryos per condition and analyzed separately. The analysis was repeated three times for each experimental condition. The Bradford assay was used to determine protein concentrations in each sample. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a Biobase-EL10A microplate reader (Biobase, Shandong, China).\n\n    The obtained protein mixture was used for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Isoelectric focusing was performed on ReadyStrip IPG strips (pH 3-10, 11 cm) with PROTEAN IEF (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). In total, 150 microg of protein in 200 microL of rehydrating buffer (8M Urea, 2M Thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 50mM DTT, 0.4% IPG buffer) was applied to each IPG strip. The following conditions were used for separation: active rehydration at 50 V for 14 h; isoelectric focusing, 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, 3000 V for 1 h (gradient), and 8000 V for 2 h (gradient). After isoelectric focusing, the IPG strips were equilibrated in a buffer containing 6 M urea, 29.3% glycerol, 2% SDS, 75 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and 2% dithiothreitol for 15 min, followed by a second equilibration with a solution as above, but containing 2.5% iodacetamide instead of dithiothreitol, for a further 15 min. The strip was loaded on a 10% acrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were separated by molecular weight using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN vertical electrophoresis system.\n\n    After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to visualize protein spots and scanned using the documentation system Fusion Solo 7S Edge (Vilber Lourmat, Collegien, France). The intensity of spots was analyzed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Only spots that were significantly changed between the control and treatment groups were selected for in-gel digestion and MS.\n\n    After the gels were washed in water, the selected protein spots were cut from the gels. The gel pieces were destained by incubation with 50% v/v acetonitrile in 50 mM (NH4)HCO3 for 15 min. The gel pieces were treated with 5 microL of 50 mM (NH4)HCO3 containing 1 microg of modified sequencing-grade trypsin and incubated for 12 h at 37  C. After digestion, the gel pieces were immersed in 100 microL of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water for further peptide extraction. The peptides were concentrated and desalted using ZipTip pipette tips (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), which had been equilibrated by sequential washing with 100% acetonitrile, 50% acetonitrile-0.1% TFA, and 0.1% TFA in water. The sample was loaded on the ZipTip and contaminants were washed away with 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted with 2 microL of 50% acetonitrile-0.1% TFA in water. A 5 mg/mL solution of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (alpha-CHCA) in 50% acetonitrile-0.1% TFA was used as the matrix. One microliter of each sample was mixed with 1 microL of freshly made CHCA matrix and spotted on a steel MALDI target plate (MT 34 Target Plate Ground Steel, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA). The peptide samples were analyzed using a time-of-flight Autoflex-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-TOF, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The MS and MS/MS LIFT spectra of selected ions were collected and calibrated externally using monoisotopic [M+H]+ ion peptide calibration standards (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) consisting of angiotensin II (1046.54), angiotensin I (1296.68), substance P (1347.73), bombesin (1619.82), ACTH clip 1 (2093.086), ACTH clip 18 (2465.19), and somatostatin 28 (3147.471). The MS peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and fragment mass spectra (MS/MS) from each individual spot were combined and searched against the Acipenseriformes proteins (155374 residues) deposited in the NCBIr database (version from 2 February 2021) using MascotServer (Matrix Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) with the following settings: cleavage enzyme, trypsin; max missed cleavages, 2; mass tolerance mono, 50 ppm; fragment ion mass tolerance, 0.5 Da; parent ion mass tolerance, 100 ppm; alkylation of cysteine by carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification; and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. For the PMF and MS/MS ion search, statistically significant (p <= 0.05) matches by MASCOT were regarded as correct hits.",
        "Results": "    Sterlet (A. ruthenus) embryos were exposed to CPT and Ola at different stages of embryonic development. The results of CPT exposure on sturgeon embryo development (phenotype formation and DNA damage) have been described in detail in our previous study. Briefly, 7 nM CPT was lethal for sterlet embryos exposed at the early stage (2-24 hpf), a mortality rate of up to 70% was induced when embryos were exposed during the gastrula stage (24-48 hpf), with a slight effect on viability following exposure during the neurula stage (48-72 hpf) (Figure 1a). The hatching rate was unaffected when embryos were exposed to CPT during the neurula stage, whereas embryos exposed to CPT during gastrulation showed a low hatching rate (2%) (Figure 1b). The level of DNA fragmentation reached 21.3% TailDNA in the CPT 2-24 group (Figure 2). The embryos in the CPT 24-48 group showed the highest level of DNA fragmentation at 5 dpf (14.2% TailDNA), which decreased by 7 dpf (Figure 2). The sterlet embryos in the CPT 48-72 group showed no increased DNA fragmentation compared with the control. The images of the phenotypes observed following CPT exposure are presented elsewhere.\n\n    Exposure to 20 microM Ola did not lead to 100% mortality, even at early stages (2-24 hpf) (Figure 1a'). Nevertheless, the viability of the embryos decreased significantly compared with the control (Figure 1a'). Further, the hatching rate was as low as 6.8% in embryos exposed to Ola at 2-24 hpf (Figure 1b'). When embryos were exposed to a PARP-1 inhibitor at the later stages, the hatching rate at 8 dpf reached 32.8% for Ola 24-48 hpf and 40.4% for Ola 48-72 hpf (Figure 1b'). Similarly, DNA fragmentation at 5 dpf was significantly higher for Ola 2-24 hpf and Ola 24-48 hpf compared with the control (Figure 2). However, the group Ola 48-72 did not show a significant increase in DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, no phenotype formation was observed in this group, unlike in embryos exposed at earlier stages (Figure 3). Embryos exposed to Ola at the early stages showed skeletal malformations and a phenotype similar to developmental delay (Figure 3b,c).\n\n    For RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis, we selected the embryos from the CPT 24-48, CPT 48-72, Ola 2-24, and Ola 24-48 hpf groups. CPT exposure in the earlier stage was lethal and thus no embryos survived until hatching. Furthermore, the CPT 24-48 and CPT 48-72 groups showed very different patterns of DNA damage and different phenotypes, which made them of interest for further analysis. Similarly, the embryos exposed to Ola at 2-24 and 24-48 hpf showed different levels of DNA fragmentation and phenotype formation. Embryos at the hatching stage were selected for further analysis as, at this stage, differences in phenotype formation between treatments were the most prominent. In addition, our aim was to determine the DDR pathways that led to DNA repair observed at 7 dpf in all chosen groups (Figure 2).\n\n    The transcriptome of sterlet embryos (N = 3-4 for each group) was compared between the control and the CPT 24-48, CPT 48-72, Ola 2-24, and Ola 24-48 groups at 7 dpf. It has been previously shown that the total sterlet genome comprises 120 chromosomes, about 47,500 protein-coding genes, and 1.8 billion base pairs. A total of 45,030 transcripts were identified in sturgeon embryos, with 18,605 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CPT 24-48, 7308 DEGs in CPT 48-72, 21,037 DEGs in Ola 2-24, and 16,583 DEGs in Ola 24-48 compared with the control embryos (Figure 4, Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the comparison of the results among different treatment groups showed a high number of overlapping DEGs in CPT 24-48 and Ola 2-24 (approximately 56% of DEGs, 15,313 DEGs in total) compared with 22% overlapping DEGs in CPT 24-48 and CPT 48-72. The groups of Ola 2-24 and Ola 24-48 shared a total of 48% of similarly expressed genes and Ola 24-48 and CPT 48-72 shared 23% DEGs. Overall, 19% overlapping DEGs were detected between all treatments, and 42% overlapping DEGs were observed among the CPT 24-48, Ola 2-24, and Ola 24-48 groups (Figure 4).\n\n    The DEGs that were detected with a lower mRNA abundance in the treatment groups compared with the control (log2 fold-change < 0) were referred to as \"downregulated\", and those that showed a higher abundance in the treatment compared with the control (log2 fold-change > 0) were defined as \"upregulated\". The enrichment of gene ontologies associated with biological processes was determined for the downregulated and upregulated genes. There were very few downregulated GO terms associated with biological processes in the CPT 48-72 group (Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Table S1). The CPT 24-48 and Ola 2-24 groups shared a similar distribution of enriched GO terms. Ola 24-48 had specific downregulation of terms associated with the electron transport chain and peptide biosynthesis. There was also specific downregulation of terms associated with development (e.g., circulatory system), transport, and apoptotic cell clearance in the CPT 24-48 and Ola 2-24 groups.\n\n    The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in all treatment groups (Figure 5). Only the CPT 24-48 and Ola 2-24 groups had the downregulation of the p53 signaling pathway and autophagy pathways, whereas the autophagy pathway was, in contrast, upregulated in Ola 24-48. There was downregulation of pathways associated with sugar metabolism, protein processing, and the biosynthesis of amino acids in all treatment conditions, except CPT 48-72.\n\n    In comparison with the control embryos, all treatment groups also shared several upregulated GO main terms (Supplementary Figure S2, Supplementary Table S1). These were related to biological processes, such as the increase in the regulation of cellular and metabolic processes, RNA biosynthesis, and macromolecules. There were also upregulated terms associated with the organization of cellular components, chromatin, and the cytoskeleton in all treatment groups. Upregulation was also observed for GO terms associated with the cell cycle and cell cycle phase transition, but these were only seen in the Ola 2-24 and Ola 24-48 groups, a few in CPT 24-48, and were completely lacking in CPT 48-72.\n\n    The following KEGG pathways were upregulated in all treatment groups: adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, cell cycle, Wnt signaling pathway, cellular senescence pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, melanogenesis, Notch signaling pathway, and mRNA surveillance pathway (Figure 5). RNA degradation and mismatch repair were only observed in the Ola-treatment groups. The FoxO and ErbB signaling pathways were only upregulated in the CPT 48-72 and Ola 24-48 groups.\n\n    Enrichment of GO terms was analyzed for the downregulated DEGs in the \"developmental processes\" category (Supplementary Figure S3). The results of this analysis revealed very limited downregulation of GO terms. The upregulated GO terms included anatomical structure development, animal organ development, brain development, eye development, cell development, head development, and sensory system development in all treatment groups (Supplementary Figure S3). The upregulation of GO terms related to embryonic development ending in birth or egg hatching, chordate embryonic development, and embryo development was detected only in the CPT 24-48, Ola 2-24, and Ola 24-48 treatment groups.\n\n    The upregulation of the KEGG pathways involved in NER, BER, and HR was observed for CPT 24-48, Ola 2-24, and Ola 24-48 groups. The upregulation of mismatch repair was observed only in Ola 2-24 and Ola 24-48 (Figure 5). The upregulation of GO terms related to DNA repair and response to stress was detected only in the CPT 24-48 and Ola-treatment groups (Supplementary Figure S2).\n\n    We have compared the changes in the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle, checkpoints, and DNA repair (Figure 6). The results of this analysis showed that numerous cell cycle genes were significantly upregulated in the Ola 2-24, Ola 24-48, and CPT 24-48 groups (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S4). However, the largest fold-change in upregulation was observed in Ola 2-24. All treatment groups showed significant upregulation of tfdp2 and downregulation of ccnd1. In general, CPT 24-48 and Ola resulted in similar trends in cell cycle gene expression.\n\n    Genes associated with cell cycle checkpoint were differently regulated by exposure to genotoxicants (Figure 6). Ola 2-24, Ola 24-48, and CPT 24-48 showed a similar number of DEGs and relatively similar fold changes. Gene tp53bp1 was upregulated, and tp53 was significantly downregulated in all treatment groups. Most of the checkpoint regulating kinases, such as chek1, atr, and atm were upregulated in Ola 2-24, Ola 24-48, and CPT 24-48, but not CPT 48-72.\n\n    Among the genes associated with DNA repair, ddb1, parp8, apex1, rad52, and ogg1 were upregulated in all treatments, whereas xrcc5 and parp9 were downregulated (Figure 6). Sterlet embryos from Ola 2-24, Ola 24-48, and CPT 24-48 groups showed increased expression of xpc, rad50, xpa, xrcc1, msh2, rpa1, ercc5, pold3, ercc2, fen1, blm, rad51ap1, nbn, and eme1. In contrast, the expression of genes associated with DNA repair was only slightly increased in the CPT 48-72 group. Mapping the KEGG pathways of BER (hsa03410; Supplementary Figure S5) showed that most of the BER genes were upregulated in Ola 2-24 and Ola 24-48 groups, but unaffected in the CPT 48-72 group. In the MMR pathway (has03430; Supplementary Figure S6) most of the genes were upregulated in Ola 2-24 and Ola 24-48 groups. The NER pathway (hsa03420; Supplementary Figure S7) and HR pathway (hsa03440; Supplementary Figure S8) were upregulated in the Ola 2-24, Ola 24-48, and CPT 24-48 groups.\n\n    The 2D-PAGE protein patterns were compared between the control embryos and embryos exposed to genotoxicants (N = 3 for each group) (Supplementary Figures S9 and S10). The results of the mass spectrometric analysis of differently abundant proteins (DAPs) are presented in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. The 25 DAPs were identified following exposure to CPT. Interestingly, from these proteins, only two followed the same trend as mRNA levels, namely cofilin-2-like (upregulated relative to control) and translationally controlled tumor protein homolog (downregulated relative to control). The most upregulated group of proteins in both CPT-treated groups (CPT 24-48 and CPT 48-72) were zona pellucida sperm-binding proteins (Supplementary Table S2). Several proteins associated with metabolic pathways were downregulated in CPT-treated embryos: putative aminopeptidase W07G4.4, alpha-enolase isoform X2, and creatine kinase M-type. This result agreed with the results of RNA sequencing from the CPT 24-48, where the DEGs associated with metabolic pathways were downregulated (Figure 5, Table 1).\n\n    The results obtained in the current study are summarized in Table 1. Our data indicate that treatment with Ola upregulated proteins is associated with KEGG metabolic pathways and peroxisome. In contrast, treatment with CPT downregulated cytoskeletal proteins (Table 1).\n\n    Correlation between viability, hatching rate, DNA fragmentation, number of DEGs, and the number of DAPs was analyzed as well (Table 2). According to Spearman's test, there was a strong positive correlation between viability and hatching rate. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between viability and the number of DEGs, viability, and DAPs, as well as hatching and DEGs.",
        "Conclusion": "    This study is the first report on transcriptomic and proteomic changes induced by DNA damage in sturgeon embryos. It was revealed that several DNA repair pathways were activated (HR, BER, NER, MMR) and DNA repair was closely associated with metabolic changes (oxidative phosphorylation, sugar metabolism, etc.). Thus, apart from DNA damage, genotoxicant exposure can be associated with oxidative stress, changes in metabolism, and affected organ development. The effect of genotoxicants and the level of DNA damage were stage-specific with prior-neurulation stages being more sensitive.\n\n    Our results highlighted the correlation between phenotype formation and the \"omics\" response. Treatments that induced DNA damage and phenotype formation were associated with changes in expression of the DDR genes: check1, atm, atr, xpc, rad50, xpa, xrcc1, msh2, rpa1, ercc5, pold3, ercc2, fen1, blm, rad51ap1, nbn, and eme1. The presented pieces of evidence suggest that these genes could be used as markers of DNA damage and DDR. In contrast, several genes were modified irrelevant of phenotype formation: tfdp2, tp53bp1, ddb1, parp8, apex1, rad52, ogg1, ccnd1, tp53, parp9, and xrcc5. It can be concluded that the second group of genes is related to the adaptive stress response. We found that the sturgeon DDR mechanisms have some degree of similarity with previously reported zebrafish DDR, which agrees with the high level of DDR evolutionary conservation. Thus, it could be speculated that the obtained markers could find their use in toxicological studies on a broad variety of fish species.\n\n    Although DDR mechanisms were mainly conserved in sturgeons, we have observed a species-specific response to genotoxicant exposure, namely overexpression of Zp proteins. This result may indicate the neofunctionalization of Zp proteins in sturgeon. Further studies are needed to investigate possible long-lasting effects of stress in sturgeon embryos and the protective role of Zp protein. Finally, this study provides new insights into embryo susceptibility to DNA damage in endangered sturgeons, which is particularly important for sustainable ex situ conservation efforts.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    The current study aimed to describe the DDR in sturgeon embryos induced by exposure to genotoxicants. Considering the endangered status of many sturgeon species and their importance to aquaculture, studies on sturgeon embryo development are highly demanded. Furthermore, the results of our research indicate that sturgeon embryos are most sensitive to stress in the early stages of development. Following neurulation, the embryos acquire mechanisms to cope with chemical exposure and/or DNA damage. This information could be helpful to aquaculture, where sturgeon embryos are produced and reared in large amounts in vitro.\n\n    It has been previously shown that CPT exposure led to different levels of DNA damage and different malformation rates, depending on the stage of exposure. Similarly, Ola exposure in the early stages of development led to decreased survival and hatching rate, whereas exposure after neurulation did not have a significant effect on sturgeon embryos. In contrast to CPT, Ola exposure at early stages (2-24 hpf) did not lead to total mortality, and embryos developed up to 7 dpf. Nevertheless, these embryos failed to hatch, with a high rate of malformations, indicating that the proper functioning of PARP-1 is required for embryo development. This agreed with previous studies on zebrafish embryos that showed how the inhibition of PARP-1 could lead to increased DNA damage, cell death, and problems with development.\n\n    In general, gastrulation is a critical phase for fish embryos, as, at this point, cells acquire the ability to undergo apoptosis. When fish embryos were treated with genotoxicants after gastrulation, they showed a higher rate of survival and hatching than the group treated before gastrulation (; current study). There are several possible hypotheses to explain this gradual increase in the resistance of post-MBT embryos. First, it is possible to suggest that the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis after the MBT transition allows embryos to effectively repair DNA or remove damaged cells. On the other hand, it is known that, upon gastrulation, fish embryos develop an epidermis that acts as the major barrier to harmful molecules. The increased expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters in the epidermis could result in higher resistance of embryos after gastrulation. This is supported by the report of, who observed the decreased uptake of the genotoxicant doxorubicin in post-MBT zebrafish embryos compared with the early stages of development. Further studies are needed to understand the kinetics of genotoxic compounds in fish embryos at different stages of development.\n\n    The changes in the transcriptome were compared between control sturgeon embryos and embryos treated with CPT at 24-48 and 48-72 hpf and with Ola at 2-24 and 24-48 hpf. The results of our study indicate that DNA damage induced by CPT and Ola can be partially repaired. Interestingly, the results of RNA sequencing indicated that CPT 24-48 and Ola 2-24 shared more DEGs than CPT 24-48 and CPT 48-72. Similarly, the CPT 24-48 and Ola 2-24 groups had a low hatching rate, increased malformation rate, and DNA damage. These results suggest that there is a general mechanism of DDR that depends on the stage of embryo development and the level of DNA damage. Thus, both treatments altered metabolism pathways, cell proliferation, the cell cycle, and the developmental processes. This result shows that phenotypic changes in fish embryos induced by genotoxic treatments were associated with changes in gene expression. This agreed with the report of Marx-Stoelting et al., who suggested that the adverse effects of chemicals should be defined based on impairment of functional capacity and pathology formation, rather than only alterations at the transcriptomic level. Thus, it is possible to draw a correlation between embryo phenotypes and \"omics\" data in the case of genotoxic treatments applied in the early stages of embryo development (Table 2).\n\n    In contrast, the CPT 48-72 group developed no phenotype, but several pathways, such as developmental pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, and the regulation of the cytoskeleton, were significantly altered at the transcriptome and proteome levels. In this case, it was difficult to distinguish between the adverse effect of genotoxicity and adaptive response. However, we observed significant upregulation of developmental processes and nervous system development in this treatment. Previous studies indicated that early life stress may have large effects on the developing brain and nervous system in vertebrates. Further studies are needed to understand if exposure to genotoxicants after neurulation may affect sturgeons later in life and subsequently induce adverse effects.\n\n    The analysis of gene expression associated with cell cycle and DNA repair showed that several genes were upregulated in all treatment groups, such as tfdp2, tp53bp1, ddb1, parp8, apex1, rad52, and ogg1, whereas ccnd1, tp53, parp9, and xrcc5 were downregulated. Thus, the cell cycle, p53 signaling, and some DDR pathways were affected by all test conditions. Interestingly, we observed the downregulation of tp53 and ccnd1 expression in most of the treatment conditions. It is known that p53, encoded by tp53, induces cell cycle arrest in response to endogenous and exogenous genotoxic damage. However, reduced levels of cyclin D1, encoded by ccnd1, are required for DNA synthesis during the S phase in proliferating cells. Therefore, the observed decrease in mRNA levels of p53 and cyclin D1 may indicate that embryonic cells overcome cell cycle arrest and undergo proliferation. However, the high expression of check1, atm, and atr in the CPT 24-48, Ola 2-24, and Ola 24-48 groups indicated that at least in some portions of embryonic cells checkpoint activity is increased. This assumption is supported by the low hatching rate in those groups.\n\n    The upregulation of several DNA repair pathways was observed in response to CPT and Ola exposure. Thus HR, BER, and NER were upregulated in embryos exposed to CPT at 24-48 hpf and to Ola at 2-24 and 24-48 hpf. A previous study showed that DSBs induced by Ola are repaired through the HR pathway in zebrafish embryos. Similarly, CPT has been shown to induce DSBs repaired through HR in embryonic stem cells. The activation of several DDR pathways in response to genotoxicity could be attributed to the cooperation between these pathways. Thus, the previous study showed the interaction between the HR and NER pathways in removing the inter-strand crosslinks (ICL). Furthermore, the interplay between BER and NER pathways is well documented. Overall, in the developing sterlet embryos, it is possible that exposure to genotoxicants induced not only DSB but also SSB and ICL formation, as well as oxidative stress, which in turn required activation of several DDR pathways.\n\n    The exposure of sturgeon embryos to genotoxicants has affected the expression of genes associated with metabolism and the cell cycle. Transcriptomic changes were similar to the proteomic changes, in which the abundance of several metabolic proteins was modified. The association between DDR and metabolism is well known. It has been previously shown that growth factors govern metabolism, while metabolism is a factor that drives the cell cycle and proliferation. Furthermore, it is known that DNA damage causes cells to rewire their metabolism. The obtained results suggest that DDR induces the adaptive response of metabolic pathways in developing fish embryos, which also affects the cell cycle and growth. In agreement with this conclusion, we also observed changes in vitellogenin (Vtg) abundance in embryos exposed to CPT and Ola (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). In the oocyte, Vtg serves as one of the main sources of nutrients as well as free amino acids for protein synthesis during early embryogenesis. A previous study reported changes in Vtg cleavage products in zebrafish embryos in response to toxic stress. The stress response in sturgeon embryos altered the expression of genes associated with metabolism, and glycolysis, as well as the protein profiles of Vtg and glycolytic enzymes. Thus, DNA damage in sturgeon embryos is repaired at the cost of metabolic adjustments, changes in the cell cycle, and proliferation.\n\n    Another highly abundant protein in sturgeon embryos treated with genotoxicants compared with control embryos was zona pellucida (Zp) sperm-binding protein. In general, Zp proteins are expressed in egg chorion and provide thickness and hardness. The study of on the sterlet genome showed that there were 116 Zp genes in sterlet. The authors also noted that the possible reason for Zp gene family expansion in sturgeons is a protection mechanism against physical forces for the developing embryos. Based on the results of our study, it is possible to speculate that Zp proteins may also be involved in stress response or protect embryos against xenobiotic exposure. This may indicate the neofunctionalization of Zp proteins in sturgeon.\n\n    Although many similarities were observed in the embryo response to CPT and Ola, there were also compound-specific changes in the transcriptome and proteome of sturgeon embryos. For example, the analysis of protein profiles showed that treatment with Ola upregulated the expression of several proteins associated with oxidoreductase and antioxidant activities. These results agreed with previous studies showing that PARP-1 inhibition induced the formation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative DNA damage. In contrast, exposure to CPT at 24-48 and 48-72 hpf affected proteins associated with metabolism, actin filaments, and cytoskeletal organization. A previous study has shown that CPT can interfere with microtubule polymerization and actin filaments during mitosis. These side effects of CPT and Ola could explain the low Spearman's correlation coefficients between DNA fragmentation and \"omics\" response (Table 2).",

        "Title": "    Situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in the upper northeast regions of Thailand",
        "Abstract": "    Background: Agriculturists exposed to health hazards are affected by increased occupational disease. This retrospective study aimed to investigate situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in upper northeast Thailand.\n\n    Methods: The secondary data of international classification of diseases 10 th revision (ICD-10) case reports of occupational disease among farmers, from the database of the Health Data Center (HDC), were used. The registered farmers data was collected as a dataset from the provincial agricultural office and the data of ICD-10 code utilised from the hospital information system (HIS) of healthcare services in Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces, which was extracted for cases of work-related diseases and injuries of registered agriculturists. The annual morbidity rate of occupational diseases was analysed and presented at a rate per 100,000 farmers.\n\n    Results: Among farmers in the HDC database, lung disease, which was not reported as occupational disease of the HDC database, was the highest ranking of all diseases, followed by work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively, while the injury rate was as high as that of WMSDs. Those morbidity rates of Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces were representative of the morbidity ranking of diseases of the nation and had increasing trends from 2014 to 2016. The number of farmers in the HDC database did not consistently reflect the number of registered farmers in the agricultural database.\n\n    Conclusions: Situations of work-related diseases and injuries discovered among registered farmers reflect the health problems of Thai agriculturists, and the underestimation in the reported disease rate in the health database is explained by big data analysis, which showed that work-related cases with an identifying code of Y96 had rarely been reported among agriculturists. Therefore, Thai agriculturists should be supported in registration with occupational diseases and injuries surveillance as holistic healthcare",
        "Introduction": "    Agriculture is an essential source of livelihood for developing countries. However, it can lead to poor health and is linked to the main causes of health hazards of agriculturists affected by infection, injuries, chronic exposure, and increased occupational disease.  According to a global report on occupational diseases, the highest prevalence of such disease was work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), which ranged between 55.6-97.2%.    The highest reported prevalence was in Korea (97.2%),  followed by Saskatchewan province of Canada (85.6%),  and Ireland (55.6%).  The next most prevalent disease was heat-related disease, which ranged from 35.6-72.3%.    The highest reported prevalence was found in Eastern North Carolina, USA,  followed by Northeast Italy,  and North Carolina, USA.    Additionally, prevalence of hearing loss from noise was reported at levels of 16.9-36.1%,    which were 16.9%  in Korea and 36.1%  in the USA, while work-related injuries were reported at a prevalence of 69.0% in Nepal.  Infectious disease was reported in ranges between 0.7-13.5%,    where brucellosis cases in Greek farmers and livestock breeders corresponded to an annual incidence rate of 7.1 per 100,000 population,  which were 8.9% in the Western Cape of South Africa.  The pesticide toxicity was reported as the rate of 8.8-17.0%, which were 8.8% in China,  and 17.0% in the Sunsari District of Nepal.  Chronic lower respiratory tract disease was also reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was found in a systematic review to be from 3.0% to 68.0%,  as in France, where the rate of COPD was 9.5%,  and South Africa, where the rate was 3.0% for asthma.\n\n    From the survey results in 2019, it was found that the total number of employed persons in Thailand was 37.5 million persons. The number of workforce members who had no social security or were informal workers was about 20.4 million, or 54.3%. By region, those in informal employment working in the Northeast made up the largest proportion (34.9%), followed by Central Thailand (23.4%), the North (20.9%), and the South (14.0%).  When the economic activities of those in informal employment were considered, it was found that more than half of all informally employed persons worked in the agriculture sector (about 11.5 million, or 56.4%).\n\n    In Thailand, the Health Data Center (HDC) ( https://hdcservice.moph.go.th/hdc/main/index.php), which is the central health database system of Thailand, collects and analyses the disease surveillance system data of all healthcare services under the provincial public health office by using 43 files, or standard structured health data classified with ICD-10 codes for diseases and disorders, and records the patient's information every time they receive services from officials. The health database of the HDC showed that the highest prevalence of disease between 2014 and 2016 was for work-related injuries (about 0.6%), followed by WMSDs (about 0.3%), noise-induced hearing loss and heat-related disease (0.2%), and pesticide toxicity (0.04%). There was no statistical report on work-related diseases which included respiratory symptoms or lung disease, and infectious disease on the health database of the HDC. In 2019, the prevalence of chronic lower respiratory tract disease was reported of 15-59 years old population to be 1.8%.\n\n    The previous retrospective study in 2016, which showed a higher morbidity rate of all cases in the research from the Nongbualamphu province of Thailand, found the highest prevalence was for WMSDs (21.7%), followed by heat- and pressure-related diseases (5.2%).  The pesticide toxicity was reported in the range of 0.14-0.18% of registered farmers,    which can be compared to the previous prevalence rate of 48.48 per 100,000 registered farmers in Southern Roi-Et.  The study also indicated a prevalence rate of infectious disease at 0.51%,  with chronic lower respiratory tract disease (1.11%) and skin disease (1.5%)  as additional diseases which occurred. The case-control study of registered agriculturists in Khon Kaen confirmed that the noise-induced hearing loss cases from the 43 health files data had been diagnosed through the audiometer test of those agriculturists.  Work-related injuries had a prevalence of 20.1% among the farmers of the Phayao province  and the three-year morbidity rate of heat-related illness in our most recent report (2020) was 13.5 per 100,000 farmers, or 0.014%, in registered agriculturists of Khon Kaen province.\n\n    Those work-related diseases and injuries in Thailand were identified by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 th revision (ICD-10) ( https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en)  and the specified Y96 external code (work related condition). Nowadays, however, some cases of agriculturists are not practically identified, and this leads to inconsistency in data as above. Hence, healthcare for agricultural workers in Thailand is not covered by labour legislation and as a result they only access services from the National Health Security Office (NHSO) ( https://eng.nhso.go.th/view/1/Home/EN-US),  without claiming compensation for diseases related to agricultural activities. Although occupational disease case reports are important for enabling the surveillance system to carry out national health policy among agriculturists, there is still no representative morbidity rate of the upper northeast of Thailand. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in the upper northeast of Thailand by using the case study of the Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces.",
        "Methods": "    This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Khon Kaen University (No. HE592154). The underlying data for this study is secondary data collected by the Health Data Centre and agricultural registries and is restricted due to ethical and data protection considerations. Under the ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Khon Kaen University (No. HE592154), participants' data was not allowed to be shared and the secondary data of health dataset and registered farmer dataset were utilized under restriction. The individual information or further reused inclusion data is not permitted under the ethically approved conditions for human research. This was confirmed under the data protection of human/participant privacy as no individuals gave explicit written consent that their identifiable data can be made publicly available.\n\n    This study was a retrospective analytic study that used secondary data from three sources, which were 1) The health database of the Health Data Center (HDC) of Thailand, between 2014 and 2016, for the number of cases of occupational disease among agriculturists (by occupational code) who visited public healthcare service providers as details in HDC data collection and public health region seven (PH region 7) and public health region eight (PH region 8), and Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces in the upper northeast regions of Thailand; 2) The secondary dataset of the list of cultivating farmers who had registered with the provincial agriculture offices of Roi-Et ( http://www.roiet.doae.go.th/) and Udon Thani provinces ( http://www.udonthani.doae.go.th/) between 2014 and 2016 as in the report Form 04-2; and 3) The secondary data of ICD-10 utilised from the hospital information system (HIS) database as detailed in the HIS data collection that used for routine care services in primary care units, secondary, and tertiary hospitals was selected from the provinces of the pilot study areas (Roi-Et and Udon Thani).\n\n    The sample size of the retrospective descriptive study was the total number of registered agriculturists of the studied area and all cases of occupational diseases who were farmers visiting healthcare units for health services at the studied areas of the upper Northeast of Thailand, during the three years from 1 st January, 2014 to 31 st December, 2016. The inclusion criteria for farmers from the HDC were those registered under the occupational codes shown in Table 1. The registered agriculturists from a provincial agriculture office of Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces who were included as the population in this study met the inclusion criteria of cultivated farming classifications according to agricultural activity during 2014-2016.\n\n    For analysis of the morbidity rate of occupational diseases among agriculturists in the upper northeast region, this study used two provinces as representative of the upper northeast of Thailand. The agriculturists from Roi-Et province were representative of PH region 7 and those of Udon Thani province were representative of PH region 8 of Thailand; they were chosen to represent the healthcare service visits for all cases among farmers in provinces of the northeast of Thailand and be compared to those of Thailand as a whole. All registered agriculturists of the two provinces were the representative population of agriculturists in those provinces in Thailand as the nature of the impact from agricultural work was found to be similar across from other areas of Thailand.\n\n    The health database reports for national and PH region 7 and PH region 8 levels in the northeast region of Thailand were collected by using the ICD-10 code of occupational disease used in reports to the HDC      from 2014 to 2016. The data collected were the total number of planting farmers according to occupation code ( Table 1) who had accessed healthcare in the area of interest and the number of cases of occupational disease among farmers who met the inclusion criteria for planting farmers reported to the HDC, with regard to four occupational diseases and injuries classified by icd-10        ( Table 2). The total number of farmers registered nationwide with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and provincial agriculture offices was collected from the agricultural database.\n\n    Provincial agriculture offices of Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces data collection\n\n    Those data of the ICD-10 code and the registered agriculturists were also collected as a big dataset for Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces as representative provinces in the upper northeast regions of Thailand. The secondary data that was collected from a provincial agriculture office was a big dataset with the number and lists of registered agriculturists in the pilot study areas (Roi-Et and Udon provinces) during 2014-2016. The record was explored and copied into an excel file by the information technology personnel who were responsible for the database of a provincial agriculture office with permission for the use of the data in this study. Reports included the identification number, name, gender, house address, farming activities, and planting areas of all registered farmers during 2014-2016 from the Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces who were cultivating farmers classified according to agricultural activity, i.e., cultivating rice, cassava, corn, soybean, or sugarcane as in the report Form 04-2.\n\n    Another big dataset collected from the provincial public health offices was the ICD-10 code record of the health standard data structure (43 health files of file 10, file 15, and file 19) on cases visiting Primary Healthcare Units (PCUs) and the secondary or tertiary hospitals in Roi-Et and Udon provinces for healthcare services in 2014 to 2016). Health-related information of registered agriculturists regarding cases with ICD-10 codes, was listed in the 43 health files of the health standards data structure and standards used for the hospital information systems (HIS) of the hospitals in Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces: file 10 - diagnosis (opd), file 15 - diagnosis (ipd), and file 19 - surveillance. The dataset of ICD-10 codes related to occupational disease and injuries data in an excel file or an SQL file were explored and copied from the provincial health database by using the permission code available only to the information technology personnel of the organisation. Data of ICD-10 code with access permission and restricted use was extracted from the 43 health files data based on identifiers of individuals registered as agriculturists with the Provincial Agriculture Office of Roi-Et or Udon Thani and sorted by using the hardware and installed software of the computer, which were a CPU @ 1.99 GHz, installed RAM of 16.0 GB, system type of a 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor, and software including Windows 10 or equal to a higher version and Microsoft Office (Excel program) 2016 licensed by Khon Kaen University, or equal to a higher version. The data was screened for duplicate registration of farmers or disease accounts, and they were removed for duplication; it was shown that the final number of registered agriculturists in the period of 2014 to 2016 in Udon Thani province was 154,478, while that in Roi-Et was 207,465 farmers. The ICD-10 codes met the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined as shown in Table 2 for occupational disease and injuries were considered for analysis of occupational diseases among the registered agriculturists. The collaborated data of registered farmer and accounted ICD-10 codes among the registered was explored and used for the morbidity rate analysis per 100,000 registered farmers.\n\n    STATA version 10.0 software ( https://www.stata.com/) (StataCorp LLC: College Station, TX) was used for all statistical analyses in this study. A freely accessible alternative software which can be used to complete the statistical analyses in this study would be program R for statistical computing ( https://www.r-project.org/). Categorical data were presented as numbers and percentages. To estimate the annual morbidity rate of an occupational disease with a confidence interval (95% confidence interval) among registered agriculturists from 2014-2016. The data of occupational diseases among planting farmers or registered agriculturists was analysed for morbidity rate as per the following formula:\n\n    In case of missing codes of the 5 th digit (activities, 2) for work-related injuries or Y96 for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), they were also countable for the ICD-10 cases of occupational diseases or injuries among registered farmers from provincial agriculture office by considering the main ICD-10 code.\n\n    The underlying data (TABLE A B C D: Situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in the upper northeast regions of Thailand) of this study is available in the underlying data statement.",
        "Results": "    In 2014-2016, the number of registered farmers collected from the provincial agriculture office in Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces was 207,465 and 154,478, respectively. Among those registered farmers, there were 53,794 (34.82%) total cases who visited for health services in Udon Thani, and 77,438 (37.32%) total cases in Roi-Et during 2014-2016.\n\n    For the number of farmers from HDC database, the number of HDC farmers varied upon types of diseases or injuries as well as the number of cases of diseases as shown in Table 3. The highest number of farmers accessed healthcare due to cases of noise and heat-related disease in Roi-Et (82,458) and Udon Thani (1,324,168). According to the HDC, the number of farmers who accessed healthcare services for injuries in each year varied; it was shown that in 2016, there was a total of 12,580,864, 663,729, and 41,350 farmers who visited healthcare services nationally, in Udon Thani province, and in Roi-Et province, respectively. The total number of registered farmers in Thailand recorded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives in 2016 was 4,178,064.\n\n    The morbidity rate of occupational disease and injuries in Thailand, i.e., WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity and injuries (per 100,000 farmers), increased between 2014 and 2016, according to the HDC database. According to national results, the results of PH region 8 and Udon Thani supported this trend of increasing morbidity rate (as shown in Figure 1). Noise- and heat-related diseases and injuries have been increasing every year in all regions, which is also supported by the rates from Roi-Et province and PH region 7.\n\n    This study analyzed the rate of chronic lower respiratory symptoms (J40-J47) as one category of lung diseases among farmers between 2014 and 2016. This was analysed in this manner following the categories of the top five prevalence of occupational diseases among crop planting farmers  as in Table 2. The disease was not directly reported as representative of a kind of occupational disease classified in the HDC database, but there was a reported data available as categories by age groups for 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15-59 years, and 60 years or more, which could be accountable for the cases of workforce ages as agriculturists.  In 2016, the national rate of lung disease was 1,129.0 per 100,000 farmers, and the highest rate was found in Roi-Et (1,527.2), which was higher than that of the national total. The rate of lung disease was followed in order by the rates of injuries, WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively, and there was a higher morbidity rate in Udon Thani compared to Roi-Et. In Roi-Et, injuries were found to be at the highest rate (319.4 per 100,000 farmers) in 2014, which was followed by WMSDs (41.0), pesticide toxicity (11.4), and noise- and heat-related diseases (6.8), while the top-ranking rate of Udon Thani was that of WMSDs (405.3), which was followed by those of noise- and heat-related diseases (47.4), and pesticide toxicity (12.8), while the injuries rate was 400.0. In 2015, apart from injuries, lung disease (1,359.3 per 100,000 farmers) had the top-ranking morbidity rate of diseases among farmers in Roi-Et, followed by those of noise- and heat-related diseases (67.3), WMSDs (62.7), and pesticide toxicity (14.5), according to the HDC. Meanwhile, in Udon Thani, the morbidity rate of lung disease was the highest rate (831.6), followed by WMSDs (296.8), noise-and heat-related diseases (88.0). A similar trend was found during 2014-2016, in that the morbidity rates of Udon Thani, or PH region 8, in this year were mostly close to the national rate. In 2016, the morbidity rate of chronic lower respiratory symptoms (lung diseases) was the highest among all diseases and injuries in Roi-Et (1,527.2 per 100,000 farmers) and was also shown to be the highest among all diseases and injuries when compared to other regions and the nation ( Figure 1, see underlying data: TABLE A).\n\n    Even though the number of cases of diseases was stable, the number of people who had a recorded occupation of farmer in the HDC database and the number of registered farmers were different. Udon Thani as well as the nation always had a higher recorded number of farmers in comparison to the registered number of farmers, which contrasted with Roi-Et, as shown in Table 3.\n\n    In 2016, all rates of Udon Thani were higher than those of Roi-Et, i.e., with a 5.89, 1.16, 1.89, and 1.20-times higher rate of WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, pesticide toxicity, and injuries, respectively.\n\n    Although the number of registered farmers of Roi-Et Province was higher than that of Udon Thani, the recorded cases or number of farmers to health service visits were lower compared to Udon Thani, for all diseases and injuries ( Table 3). The morbidity rate of disease was higher in Udon Thani in comparison to Roi-Et. It was found that the morbidity rates of the nation and Udon Thani Province had been increasing similarly.\n\n    When comparing the rate of occupational disease and injuries among registered farmers in 2016 to the rate of farmers who visited health service providers, the higher rate was found in the registered farmers for WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, and injuries (pesticide toxicity was scarcely different), especially in Roi-Et, where the rate was 27.58 times higher for injuries and 16.32 times higher for WMSDs. Regarding those who identified as farmers when visiting Udon Thani health service providers, they had a 1.76 times lower rate of WMSDs and a 15.83 times lower rate of injuries than registered farmers. Similarly, the rates of noise- and heat-related diseases among those who identified as farmers in Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces were about two times lower in the HDC database, in comparison to the rates of registered farmers.\n\n    According to the secondary dataset of the health standard data structure (43 health files) and the number of agriculturists registered to the provincial agricultural office during 2014-2016, without duplicated registration of farmers or disease accounts, the analysis showed the number of registered farmers in 2014 to 2016 of Udon Thani Province was 154,478, while that of Roi-Et was 207,465 farmers (see underlying data: TABLE C).  By utilising the 43 health files data of the ICD-10 code of occupational cases and injuries during 2014 to 2016, it was found that there were 53,794 total cases (34.82%) of registered farmers who had accessed healthcare in Udon Thani, and 77,438 total cases (37.32% ) in Roi-Et. Regarding the characteristics of those cases of registered farmers in Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces, more than 60% were female. The largest proportion of cases in Roi-Et were working on rice plantations (98.26%), followed by cassava (1.12%), sugar cane (0.19%) and rubber (0.37%) plantations. Regarding cases in Udon Thani, most cases were working on rice plantations (89.56%), and the next highest proportions were working on the following plantations, i.e., cassava (4.97%), sugar cane (4.56), rubber (0.24%), and soybean/corn (0.67%). Almost 80% of them worked in relatively small farming areas of less than 4 acres. Most of them (about 70%) produced less than 10 tons (see underlying data; TABLE D).\n\n    The results of morbidity rates in 2016 are presented in Table 4. The ranking of morbidity rates of work-related disease among registered farmers was as follows: lung disease, WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, i.e., 2781.7, 754.3, 221.7, and 8.7 in Roi-Et and 2,278.6, 479.1, 207.7, and 26.5 in Udon Thani, respectively. The rate of work-related injuries was more than four times higher compared to all rates of other diseases in Udon Thani and Roi-Et, as shown in Table 4.\n\n    From the 43 health files data, it was found that the morbidity rates among the registered agriculturists of Roi-Et were ranked in the following order, from highest to lowest, as follows: injuries, lung diseases, WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, in every year from 2014 to 2016. The morbidity rate of registered agriculturists was not consistent with those who identified as farmers, as recorded by the HDC, in every year from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, registered agriculturists in Roi-Et had a higher morbidity rate of all diseases and injuries than Udon Thani, except pesticide toxicity. The rates and trends increased every year in this manner, except for pesticide toxicity, which had a lower rate in Roi-Et when compared to Udon Thani. In Udon Thani, the morbidity rates from the 43 health files were found to have the same ranking as Roi-Et for every health problem, and all those rates had increasing trends from 2014 to 2016.\n\n    The results from the HDC database showed that the morbidity rate of all diseases and injuries had an increasing trend, except WMSDs in Udon Thani, which remained constant as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Conclusion": "    The morbidity-rate ranking of work-related diseases and injuries, excluding lung diseases, among agriculturists in the upper northeast of Thailand was injuries, WMSDs, noise- and heat-related disease, and pesticide toxicity, respectively. Lung disease, which was not reported as an occupational disease of the HDC database, had the highest morbidity rate among occupational diseases in Roi-Et (2,781.7 per 100,000 farmers) and Udon Thani (2,278.6 per 100,000 farmers) from the 43 health files data. The national morbidity-rate ranking in 2016 (per 100,000 farmers) from the HDC database was injuries (601.0), work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) (354.3), noise- and heat-related diseases (104.4), and pesticide toxicity (14.6), respectively. Those morbidity rates of Roi-Et and Udon Thani provinces were representative of the morbidity ranking of diseases of the nation. When comparing the morbidity rates of diseases of farmers from the 43 health files data to those of the HDC database, the closest rates were found in the pesticide toxicity of Roi-Et (26.5 per 100,000 farmers) and Udon Thani (27.7 per 100,000 farmers). The rates of WMSDs in Roi-Et (754.3 per 100,000 farmers) and Udon thani (479.1) from the 43 health files data were more than two times higher than those rates from the HDC database (Roi-Et: 46.2 and Udon Thani: 272.4 per 100,000 farmers), which was like those of noise-and heat-related diseases as well as that of injuries. All work-related diseases and injuries of the 43 health files data and almost all of those of the HDC data had increasing trends from 2014 to 2016. The number of farmers in the HDC database did not consistently reflect the number of registered farmers in the agricultural database. Situations of work-related diseases and injuries discovered among registered farmers reflect the health problems of Thai agriculturists, and the underestimation in the reported disease rate in the health database is explained by big data analysis, which showed that work-related cases with an identifying code of Y96 had rarely been reported among agriculturists. Therefore, recording an occupational cause when visiting health service providers should be promoted in the future, and Thai agriculturists should be supported in registration with healthcare databases for surveillance of various types of occupational diseases and injuries, including lung, skin and infectious diseases.",
        "Discussion": "    At present, the numbers of work-related diseases and injuries reported and cases among Thai farmers are likely to be lower than the true numbers because the health surveillance data of farmers or agricultural workers may not be accurate, as can be seen from the following findings and discussion.\n\n    By using registered farmers as the population for the morbidity rate calculation, which was different from using those who used a farmer occupational code as the population to calculate the rate from the HDC database, one could explain the inaccurate number of agriculturists found in healthcare service reports. The number of farmers from the HDC database may sometimes include duplicate recordings of farmers who visited healthcare providers more than once or sometimes be missing the occupational code identification of an agriculturist. That inaccurate number of farmers from the HDC database has led to incorrect results of morbidity rate. Therefore, for the next step of analysis, it was necessary to study registered agriculturists for accounted cases of occupational disease among agriculturists.\n\n    Those results of work-related diseases and injuries, excluding lung disease, among registered agriculturists, from the two case studies of Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces from analysis of the HDC database and the 43 health files data, showed the same ranking of morbidity rate, which were injuries, WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively. Consequently, both Udon Thani and Roi-Et were possibly representative of national rates. For the case of lung diseases, the number of cases who had lung disease specific to the age group of between 15 to 59 years of age was analysis for the morbidity rate from HDC database, the disease was not further reported in the HDC database as occupational disease as mentioned before. It showed the highest morbidity rate from our analysis for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, or a specified lung disease among occupational diseases. However, when considering the morbidity rates (per 100,000 registered farmers) of diseases and injuries from 2014 to 2016 found in the 43 health files data, it was found that the highest morbidity rate from our analysis was not for a specified lung disease, which had not been found before with regard to occupational disease in the disease surveillance system of the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. The high morbidity rate of occupational lung disease, which was not yet covered by the HDC database, might be explained by the fact that in disease diagnosis, it was not found to have an external cause, which would require recoding to Y96 to specify an occupational disease group.\n\n    Some other diseases related to exposure to agrochemical hazards were recommended from the previous studies, e.g., Parkinson's disease ; cancers of specific organs, e.g., lung, pancreas, lymphohematopoietic organs, bladder, prostate gland,  or thyroid ; gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)  or diabetes ; etc. In covering those diseases to build up the surveillance system among agriculturists, some more investigation is still needed to confirm an association between each disease and a specific toxic substance used in pest control. Moreover, occupational lung disease should be considered in health surveillance of disease among farmers as per the previous report done by using a systematic review among Thai agriculturists.\n\n    Excluding lung disease, the three top-ranking rates across all regions and years were injuries and/or WMSDs, followed by hearing loss and diseases from heat, and pesticide toxicity, respectively. In addition, the rate of injuries was highest among all occupational diseases in Roi-Et, Udon Thani, and the nation. Udon Thani, which was chosen as a good representative province of PH Region 8, had a top-ranking rate which was the same as the nation, namely that of injuries, followed by WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively. These findings confirmed the ranking rate results found among registered crop farmers in Nong Bua Lamphu, one of the provinces in PH Region 8, Thailand;  however, all morbidity rates of WMSDs were more than 10 times lower than those found in other countries in Asia,  Canada,  and Europe.  With regard to noise- and heat-related disease, the rate found was 100 times lower compared to that of America,    and the rates of injuries and pesticide toxicity were found to be extremely low when compared to those found in Nepal  and China.  The closest morbidity rate to global rates was that of the cases of lung disease, which was more than two times lower than that of South Africa. This finding of low morbidity rates from the health database of Thai agriculturists when compared to global rates might be explained by underestimation of the morbidity rates of occupational disease and injuries.\n\n    In cases of toxicity from pesticides in 2016, the morbidity rate in Roi-Et Province was lower than previously reported among southern Roi-Et farmers during the same period,  which could be explained by local agricultural behaviors and the fact that pesticide toxicity report cases depended on the disease surveillance of each regional public health service.  Moreover, it was noteworthy that Roi-Et provincial-level case reports were very low in number compared to those of Udon Thani ( Table 3).\n\n    The accuracy of the health databases varies based on the hospital level; for instance, data from hospitals at the provincial level are more accurate than those at the district level and all collected data in this study are summations of sources of data at the provincial level, which are sent to the health data centre at the national level. On the other hand, inaccuracies and actual missing data exist in Thailand, which is a major problem of diagnosing occupational diseases with a coding of Y96, and is one main problem that has been reported before.  However, this study used a method of matching cases with an ICD10 diagnosis code of individuals identified by national ID to cases of those who had a registered occupation of agriculturist; both types of cases can be found in databases which present the situation of occupational disease among agriculturists in Thailand.\n\n    According to the analysis of ICD-10 utilized from the 43 health files standard among registered farmers, the morbidity rate of WMSDs in Roi-Et was around double that of Udon Thani. In contrast, the morbidity rate of WMSDs in Udon Thani, according to the HDC database, was around 10 times higher than that of Roi-Et. Regarding this comparison of morbidity rates of WMSDs, namely the HDC database versus the 43 health files data records, the trends were found to be unclear. This might be explained by the fact that case reports of WMSDs are not only specific to farming work, or they have multi-factor causes.  Another explanation might be the wrong or missing diagnostic coding of Y96, which signifies a specified occupational cause, as reported earlier regarding the health surveillance system in Roi-Et province.  However, from our data of the cases extracted from the 43 files of the most recent year, 2020  it was confirmed that WMSDs had an increasing trend and a higher morbidity rate in Roi-Et than in Udon Thani province. Intriguingly, it was found that between the years 2014 and 2016, the province of Roi-Et had the fourth-highest tonnage of inland rice production in the country.  In comparison to Udon Thani, Roi-Et's in-season rice yield was approximately 2-3 times higher.  This study discovered from the 43 health files data that the WMSDs rate in Roi-Et was greater than that in Udon Thani province, presumably because rice farming requires more body exertion in various agricultural activities throughout the year than farming of other crops, e.g., cassava and sugar cane, which is planted more in Udon Thani.\n\n    According to HDC database analysis, Udon Thani had a higher rate than Roi-Et with regard to injuries, and diseases caused by noise and heat and pesticide toxicity; increasing rates were also observed from 2014 to 2016 among Udon Thani and Roi-Et agriculturists. Those two occupational disease groups as well as injuries were confirmed as the major health problems among agriculturists in Thailand.\n\n    Infectious diseases, such as leptospirosis and melioidosis, had the highest prevalence in farmers, but there was no infectious disease group shown for occupational disease in the HDC database. This was not only the case in Thailand; a previous study in Poland showed a significantly higher rate in farmers who had been exposed to repeated tick bites,  which corresponded to annual reports in Greece from 2004-2015.  Moreover, brucellosis cases have been found in farmers and livestock breeders, with a high incidence rate of 7.1 per 100,000 population.\n\n    From the HDC database, it was found that the ranking of the morbidity rates, in Roi-Et, in 2014, excluding that of lung disease, were as follows: morbidity rate of injuries, followed by that of WMSDs, pesticide toxicity and noise- and heat-related diseases, respectively. However, during 2015 and 2016, the morbidity rates changed in order. Meanwhile, the ranking order of morbidity rates of Udon Thani (2014-2016) was the morbidity rate of injuries, followed by that of WMSDs, noise- and heat-related diseases and pesticide toxicity, respectively. That explains why Roi-Et was unable to provide good representative data because the province had not reported data as forecast, which contrasted with Udon Thani province in this study. The morbidity rates from the 43 files health data standard of Roi-Et province showed congruous results among the registered farmers. The highest rate was for work-related injuries, followed by WMSDs, hearing loss and heat-related disease, and pesticide toxicity, respectively. Similar results were found in Udon Thani, where rates of work-related injuries, WMSDs, and noise- and heat-related disease were similar and close to the national rates. Hence, these results reveal that the provincial data of Udon Thani can be representative of the nation. The consistency of the database is shown by the top three highest morbidity rates of disease from the previous study in crop farmers of Nongbualamphu province, which were shown to be WMSDs, noise- and heat-related disease, followed by skin irritation.  Moreover, the number of reported cases was very different between Udon Thani and Roi-Et, and the morbidity rate of pesticide toxicity in Roi-Et was dramatically lower than that of the previous report from 2016-2018 among registered farmers in Sakon Nakhon, a province in PH Region 8.  Those cases mentioning skin disease were suspect due to a combined effect in the group of pesticide toxicity, which is that of a reported acute symptom (irritant), and confirmed the previous studies.\n\n    Regarding agricultural productivity in the study area, the Office of Agricultural Economics reported that cassava, rubber, and rice had the highest productivity between 2016 and 2019,  as found in the case characteristics of this study. That could support results concerning the significant increase in morbidity rates of all occupational diseases and injuries in Roi-Et from 2014 to 2016; this increase was also found in Udon Thani, particularly in regard to pesticide toxicity. Pesticide toxicity has been shown to be a potential disease of the agricultural sector of Thailand, and as discussed, that problem was exacerbated by the trend of increasing pesticide imports, particularly herbicide imports, during the 5-year period from 2013 to 2017.  In comparison to Roi-Et province, Udon Thani has almost five times the production areas of cassava and Para rubber.  This study reveals that Udon Thani has a higher increasing trend of morbidity rate for pesticide toxicity than Roi-Et province. Hence, it is clear that herbicides are being used continuously to treat the rubber and cassava while it is being harvested.\n\n    These disputations with strong evidence suggest health surveillance of occupational disease among agriculture workers (informal workers) or Thai farmers by 1) realizing the diagnosis with a coding record of Y96, 2) improving the recording method of occupation to be used practically for agriculturists, and 3) promoting agriculture workers to register on the health database. It was more than interesting that some have mentioned other diseases should be added to ICD-10 for occupational disease, i.e., lung disease, skin disease and infectious disease, for the occupational surveillance system.",

        "Title": "    Weber-Cockayne Type Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex Resulting from a Novel Mutation (c. 608T>C) in the Keratin 5 Gene",
        "Abstract": "    Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), an inherited genetic disorder, is most often caused by a dominant-negative mutation in either the keratin 5 (KRT5) or the keratin 14 (KRT14) gene. These keratin mutants result in a weakened cytoskeleton and cause extensive cytolysis. It is important to analyze the KRT5 or KRT14 genes of the patient and their family members by mutational analysis in order to identify genetic defects as well as the need for genetic counseling. In this study, we present a 5-year-old Korean boy who had been developing blisters and erosions on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet since infancy. In addition, while his younger sister and father showed similar clinical manifestation, his mother did not. The patient was diagnosed with EBS based on clinical manifestation, which is characterized by the presence of blisters restricted to the palms and soles, histological findings, and mutational analysis. Mutational analysis of the patient's DNA revealed a thymine-to-cytosine transition at codon 608 in the KRT-5 gene, resulting in a leucine-to-proline substitution in the keratin 5 protein. The same mutation was identified in the paternal, but not maternal, DNA. Here, we report a case of Weber-Cockayne type EBS with vesicles and bullae restricted to the palms and soles with a novel, paternally inherited mutation in KRT5 gene (exon2, c.608T>C).",
        "Introduction": "    Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a chronic vesicular disorder with characteristic manifestations, from birth to infancy, of intraepidermal vesicle and milia formation on the hand, elbow, or knee due to minimal trauma. It is a genetic disorder that is caused by a dominant-negative mutation in either the keratin 5 (KRT5) or the keratin 14 (KRT14) gene. EBS is sub-categorized by its clinical manifestation into the systemic (Koebner), localized (Weber-Cockayne), and herpetiform (Dowling-Meara) types. The localized type of EBS is the mildest form of the subtypes that involves easy development of vesicles on the palms and soles from minimal mechanical trauma. According to molecular genetic studies of EBS, there are mutations in KRT5 and KRT14, which contribute to skeletons on hemidesmosome in keratinocytes located in the basal layer near the dermo-epidermal junction. Mutations in each subtype of EBS vary in location and severity.\n\n    In our case, a 5-year-old Korean boy, who, from infancy, developed blisters and erosions on his palms and soles, visited Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center. Through physical examination, discussion of family history, skin biopsy, and mutation analysis, we identified a novel mutation of thymine-to-cytosine transition at codon 608 in KRT5. From these results, the patient was diagnosed with Weber-Cockayne type EBS.",

        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Epidermolysis bullosa, a rare genetic disorder, is categorized into EBS, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, depending on the extent of vesicle formation and its clinical manifestations. EBS is caused by mutations in the genes coding for KRT5, a member of the type II group keratin located in chromosome 17, and KRT14, a member of the type I group keratin located in chromosome 12. An \"alpha-helical rod\" domain, composed of 4 subdomains, plays a key role in the pairwise conjugation of keratin, which is needed for structural support against friction. Mutations in this domain can cause severe problems in the assembly of keratin filaments. Hence, the sites of the mutations are important for determining the clinical repercussions of mutant proteins. For example, mutations in the ends of the subdomains result in the herpetiform type-the most severe clinical form. In contrast, mutations in the central portions of the subdomains result in a less severe form, the Dowling-Meara type EBS. The mildest form of EBS, the localized type, results from mutations in the head, tail, or non-helical portions, including the linker area. In our case, the location of the neutral L608P mutation was in a non-helical portion (linker area) and resulted in a localized type EBS.\n\n    While the location of the KRT5 or KRT14 mutation can affect the severity of EBS, the polarity of the substituted amino acid residue is also important. Even mutations within the same region can lead to various clinical symptoms, depending on the polarity of the amino acid. Similarly, there can be severe clinical findings in case of a change in the acid/base properties of a residue because of the destabilizing effects exerted onto the protein structure. Predictably, if the polarity of amino acid does not change, such as neutral to neutral, only mild clinical findings are observed. For example, in our study, a neutral leucine was mutated to a neutral proline. In conclusion, we can presume that the localized/Weber-Cockayne type EBS in this patient was induced by the neutral substitution of a leucine residue for a proline residue in the non-helical area (linker region) of keratin 5.",

        "Title": "    Intracranial Bleeding in a Female Hemophilia Patient: Molecular Analysis of the Factor 8 Gene and Determination of a Novel Mutation",
        "Abstract": "",
        "Introduction": "    An 11-month-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with right occipital fracture and epidural hematoma. The father had severe hemophilia A and the parents were cousins. Laboratory tests revealed normal complete blood count and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Mixing test results were normalized after mixing with normal plasma. After plasma samples were collected for further diagnostic tests, fresh frozen plasma and dexamethasone were administered. The factor VIII level was 0.1%, 35%, and 0.5% for the patient, mother, and father, respectively. The patient's von Willebrand factor (VWF) level was 128 IU/mL, VWF:Ricof was 110 IU/mL, collagen ADP was 110 (reference: 71-118) s, and collagen epinephrine was 98 (reference: 85-165) s. Intron 22 inversion was investigated with the IS-PCR method and was found to be normal. Whole-genome analysis including all exonic regions of the F8 gene (NM_000132.3) was conducted and the homozygous c.608T>C (L203P) mutation was found. This mutation was not previously reported. As this variant was not reported in any exome databases (ExAC, EVS) and as it was shown to be the cause of the disease in at least three in silico protein modeling programs, the mutation was considered as a novel mutation causing hemophilia A (\"probably damaging\" with 0.987 PolyPhen2 score, \"disease causing\" with 0.999 MutationTaster score, and \"damaging\" with 0 SIFT score). The mutation was also confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1). Plasma-derived FVIII at 2x500 IU/day was administered for 14 days followed by 300 IU/week prophylaxis. Inhibitor screening at the 5th and 10th exposure days was negative.\n\n    Hemophilia A is rarely seen in female patients due to skewed inactivation of the X chromosome leading to inactivation of the wild-type X chromosome, anomalies like Turner syndrome, or translocations, as well as homozygous/compound heterozygous mutations for hemophilia A. The karyotype analysis of our patient revealed 46,XX. The patient and the father were hemizygous and mother was heterozygous for the c.608T>C (L203P) mutation (Figure 2). The clinical situation of our patient as she was admitted with epidural hematoma requiring surgical intervention and the fact that the family did not apply for prenatal diagnosis before birth point out the importance of prenatal diagnosis in regions where consanguineous marriage is common.\n\n    Conflict of Interest: The authors of this paper have no conflicts of interest, including specific financial interests, relationships, and/or affiliations relevant to the subject matter or materials included.",

        "Title": "    Application of a New Genetic Deafness Microarray for Detecting Mutations in the Deaf in China",
        "Abstract": "    The aim of this study was to evaluate the GoldenGate microarray as a diagnostic tool and to elucidate the contribution of the genes on this array to the development of both nonsyndromic and syndromic sensorineural hearing loss in China.\n\n    We developed a microarray to detect 240 mutations underlying syndromic and nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The microarray was then used for analysis of 382 patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (including 15 patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome), 21 patients with Waardenburg syndrome, and 60 unrelated controls. Subsequently, we analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of this new approach after Sanger sequencing-based verification, and also determined the contribution of the genes on this array to the development of distinct hearing disorders.\n\n    The sensitivity and specificity of the microarray chip were 98.73% and 98.34%, respectively. Genetic defects were identified in 61.26% of the patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, and 9 causative genes were identified. The molecular etiology was confirmed in 19.05% and 46.67% of the patients with Waardenburg syndrome and enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome, respectively.\n\n    Our new mutation-based microarray comprises an accurate and comprehensive genetic tool for the detection of sensorineural hearing loss. This microarray-based detection method could serve as a first-pass screening (before next-generation-sequencing screening) for deafness-causing mutations in China.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss is the most common sensory-nerve disease worldwide, with approximately 250 million people suffering from moderate to severe hearing loss. Moreover, one child in 1,000 is estimated to be born with prelingual hearing loss. The 2006 National Sample Survey in China revealed that hearing impairment affected roughly 20 million people, accounting for 24.16% of all people with disabilities. Furthermore, approximately 30,000 babies are born with congenital hearing impairment annually in China, and nearly half of the cases of congenital deafness are estimated to be associated with genetic factors. Genetics studies have shown that 77% of hereditary deafness is autosomal recessive, while 22% is autosomal dominant, 1% is associated with X chromosomal mutations, and <1% is associated with maternally inherited mitochondrial genes.\n\n    In hereditary hearing impairment, roughly 70% of the cases are nonsyndromic and, as of August 2015, >80 pathogenic nuclear genes associated with this disorder have been cloned. Moreover, 2 mitochondrial genes were found to be associated with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/). In particular, GJB2 (OMIM: 121011), GJB3 (OMIM: 603324), SLC26A4 (OMIM: 605646), and the mitochondrial gene MT-RNR1 (OMIM: 561000) are the 4 major causative genes of hereditary nonsyndromic SNHL in China. The incidence of positive genetic errors in these 4 genes was reported to be 43.58%. However, beyond the mutations in these 4 genes, it is unclear which genetic defects are the next most prevalent among SNHL patients in China. To address this gap in our knowledge and to develop a microarray that is more comprehensive than the ones used to date, we selected key mutations from a larger number of deafness genes than were previously analyzed; these mutations were selected based on the prevalence at which they are reported in the literature.\n\n    Currently, >400 types of syndromes are recognized to be associated with hearing impairment, accounting for 30% of prelingual deafness. The most common autosomal-recessive type of syndromic deafness is Usher syndrome (US; OMIM: 276900). While US is known to affect 50% of the deaf-blind population in the USA, few studies of this disease have been conducted in China. Pendred syndrome (PS; OMIM: 274600) is the second most common type of autosomal-recessive syndromic deafness and is characterized by severe to profound sensorineural deafness and goiter. Meanwhile, the most common autosomal-dominant syndromic deafness is Waardenburg syndrome (WS), which is mainly characterized by impaired hearing and pigmentation abnormalities and is highly heterogeneous both clinically and genetically, with WS1 (OMIM: 193500) and WS2 (OMIM: 193510) being the most prevalent forms of WS in China. The microarray chip we developed features gene mutations related to each of the aforementioned common types of syndromic SNHL for the following reasons: First, the incidences of these 3 syndromes are high; second, the 3 syndromes can directly and markedly affect quality of life; third, because of their phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity, the 3 syndromes might be underdiagnosed or highly challenging to detect. Genetic screening is a currently available method for early diagnosis, which helps to prevent or predict disease and thus considerably alleviate the disease burden on patients and their families. Therefore, we considered it critical to include mutations related to these 3 deafness syndromes in our microchip assay.\n\n    Recent developments in molecular genetics have led to the design of diverse gene diagnostic tools. However, there is currently no detection method that covers both syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Moreover, a comprehensive genetic array for the Chinese SNHL population has yet to be developed. This study was therefore conducted, not only to evaluate the GoldenGate array as a diagnostic tool, but also to further elucidate the contribution of the genes on this array to the development of both nonsyndromic and syndromic SNHL in China.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 403 unrelated Han Chinese patients with SNHL were recruited between 2014 and 2015 from the Otolaryngology Department of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. We recruited patients in whom deafness resulted from unclear causative factors, but excluded patients in whom clear causative factors were identified such as noise exposure, trauma (exception for the patients who are identified with enlarged vestibular aqueduct by medical imaging), intrauterine infection, poisoning, or tumors. All participants were probands and were divided into 382 cases of nonsyndromic SNHL (including 15 of enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) syndrome) and 21 cases of WS based on clinical history, physical examination, audiological examination, and imaging tests. All patients presented with moderate to profound bilateral SNHL in pure-tone audiometry and/or auditory brainstem response testing. Hearing loss was classified into mild (26-40 dB), moderate (41-55 dB), moderate severe (56-70 dB), severe (71-90 dB), and profound (>90 dB). Genomic DNA was isolated from the blood of each patient using the phenol/chloroform extraction method. As a control for detection, we used DNA samples from 60 healthy unrelated people from the Chinese population who did not show any sign of hearing loss.\n\n    This study was approved by the Xiangya Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents (when participants were under 18 years old).\n\n    We comprehensively searched the literature available on PubMed, Embase, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Wanfang Literature Database in order to estimate the likely frequency of mutations in causative genes for SNHL in the Chinese population, and then selected an initial set of genes that were previously implicated in SNHL for inclusion. The paramount criterion for inclusion was that the mutations had to have been reported >2 times, and primacy was given to the mutations that had been reported in the Chinese population. In the end, the GoldenGate custom microarray (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) included 240 mutations selected from 46 nuclear genes (such as GJB2, GJB6, GJB3, and SLC26A4) and one mitochondrial gene, MT-RNR1; a detailed list of the variants is provided in S1 Table. The mutation list included single-nucleotide changes as well as deletions. For each of the 240 mutations on the microarray, 60-bp oligonucleotides were constructed in both directions based on the wild-type sequence of each gene.\n\n    The 240 mutations covered all currently characterized mutations involved in the etiology of either nonsyndromic or syndromic SNHL, and were comprised of (1) mutations covering the mitochondrial gene and the 46 autosomal deafness genes; (2) 200 nonsyndromic SNHL variants (43 dominant inherited variants, 152 recessive inherited variants, 1 maternally inherited variant, and 4 X-linked variants) and 40 common syndromic SNHL variants related to WS, PS, and US (Table 1); and (3) 8 of the most common mutation hotspots in the Chinese population: GJB2 c.35delG, GJB2 c.235delC, GJB2 c.299-300delAT, GJB3 c.538C>T, GJB3 c.1174A>T, SLC26A4 c.IVS7-2A>G, SLC26A4 c.2168 A>G, and mitochondrial 12rsRNA 1555A>G.\n\n    In the GoldenGate genotyping assay (Illumina) protocol, allele-specific extension methods are used and PCR-amplification reactions are conducted at high multiplex levels. The entire process is completed in 3 days, as described below.\n\n    Day 1. Preparation, precipitation, and resuspension of samples in single-use DNA (SUD) plates\n\n    DNA samples were normalized to a concentration of 50 ng/muL with a Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA), after which 5 muL of MS1 reagent and 5 muL of the normalized DNA sample were added to each well of the SUD plates; the plates were then incubated at 95 C for exactly 30 min. Next, 5 muL of PS1 and 15 muL of 2-propanol were added to the wells of the SUD plates to precipitate the DNA, and excess MS1 DNA-activation reagent was removed. Lastly, 10 muL of RS1 was added to each well to resuspend the DNA.\n\n    Preparation of the allele-specific extension (ASE) plates\n\n    Ten microliters of OPA, 30 muL of OB1, and 10 muL of the biotinylated sample from the SUD plates were added to ASE plates. Plates were then sealed and placed on a 70 C heat block, after which the temperature was immediately reset to 30 C. The ASE plates were incubated on the heat block for 16 h and the query oligos for each target sequence of interest were allowed to anneal to the biotinylated genomic-DNA samples.\n\n    Day 2. Addition of the master mix for extension and ligation (MEL).\n\n    To wash off nonspecifically hybridized and excess oligos, 50 muL of AM1 and 50 muL of UB1 were added to the ASE plates. After washing, 37 muL of MEL was added to each DNA sample, and the extension and ligation reaction was allowed to proceed at 45 C for exactly 15 min.\n\n    PCR amplification\n\n    Sixty-four microliters of Titanium Taq DNA Polymerase, 50 muL of UB1, and 35 muL of IP1 were added to each well of the ASE plates, and the plates were placed on a raised-bar magnetic plate until the beads had been completely captured. Next, 30 muL of each resulting supernatant was transferred to the PCR plate, and PCR was performed using 3 universal primers (2 labeled with fluorescent dyes, the third biotinylated). The reagents were denatured at 37 C for 10 min and at 95 C for 3 min, and then subjected to 34 cycles of denaturation for 35 s at 95 C, annealing for 35 s at 56 C, and extension for 2 min at 72 C, followed by a final extension for 10 min at 72 C and then incubation for 5 min at 4 C.\n\n    Binding of PCR products\n\n    Twenty microliters of each MPB reagent was added to the PCR plates, and the resulting mixtures were transferred to a filter plate. The filter plate was incubated at room temperature to allow the biotinylated DNA strand to bind to the paramagnetic particles, thereby immobilizing the double-stranded PCR products.\n\n    Preparation of the intermediate (INT) plates for BeadChip\n\n    The single-stranded fluorophore-labeled PCR products from the filter plate were washed and then eluted into an INT plate. The products from this plate were hybridized to a BeadChip; the chip was hybridized overnight in an Illumina hybridization oven, with a temperature ramp-down from 60 C to 45 C.\n\n    Day 3. The hybridized BeadChips were washed and then imaged using the iScan System, and the data from these images were analyzed using Illumina's BeadStudio software.\n\n    All reagents used in the protocol were supplied by Illumina Inc., except for the Titanium Taq DNA Polymerase, which was purchased from TaKaRa Inc. (Shiga, Japan).\n\n    To evaluate the validity, reliability, and reproducibility of the hearing-loss mutation-detection microarray, the results were verified through direct sequencing. Subsequently, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity, the false-positive and false-negative rates, Youden's index (gamma), and the positive likelihood rate (+LR) and negative likelihood rate (-LR) to further assess the validity. We also calculated the Kappa value, which represents reliability. Lastly, we analyzed the contribution of the examined causative mutations to the development of hearing loss. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Statistics, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",
        "Results": "    The 382 nonsyndromic SNHL patients were aged 11.78 +- 1.44 years old; 193 of the 382 patients (50.52%) were females, 189 (49.48%) were males. All 382 patients presented bilateral SNHL, 329 (86.13%) exhibited prelingual hearing impairment, and 16 (4.19%), 51 (13.35%), and 315 (82.46%) patients showed moderate, severe, and profound hearing loss, respectively. This group also included 15 patients with EVA syndrome (average age, 7.07 +- 1.45 years; 6 (40%) females, 9 (60%) males). All 15 patients with EVA syndrome presented with bilateral SNHL, 12 (80%) patients showed prelingual hearing impairment, and 3 (20%) exhibited postlingual hearing impairment. Of these 3 patients, 2 had a history of head trauma. Meanwhile, severe and profound hearing loss was present in 1 (6.67%) and 14 (93.33%) of the 15 EVA patients, respectively.\n\n    The WS patients were aged 9.04 +- 1.38 years old; 6 of these 21 patients (28.57%) were females and 15 (71.43%) were males. All 21 patients presented bilateral profound SNHL, prelingual hearing impairment, and dystopia canthorum of hair, eyes, or skin. Of these 21 individuals, 10 (47.62%) were WS1 patients and the remaining 11 (52.38%) were WS2 patients.\n\n    The call rate of the microarray was 99.375%. To evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of the hearing-loss genotyping microarray, the results were validated through Sanger sequencing. The results of this analysis demonstrated that the microarray assay was highly sensitive and specific, as few false-negative and false-positive mutations were detected. The calculated performance values were as follows (respectively): sensitivity and specificity, 98.73% and 98.34%; false-negative and false-positive rates, 1.27% and 1.66%; Youden's index (gamma), 0.97; and positive likelihood rate (+LR) and negative likelihood rate (-LR), 59.49 and 0.01. As compared with directing sequencing, the Percent Agreement was 98.44% and the Kappa value was 0.917.\n\n    Using our microarray protocol, we detected molecular defects in 234/382 (61.26%) patients with nonsyndromic SNHL; thus, mutations were not detected in <40% of the cases (38.74%, 148/382). In summary, 48 patients were homozygous for mutations in GJB2, 16 for mutations in MT-RNR1, and 10 for mutations in SLC26A4; 15 patients harbored compound heterozygous mutations in GJB2, 14 harbored mutations in SLC26A4, 2 in CDH23 (OMIM: 605516), and 1 in MYO15A (OMIM: 602666). Because these genes are recessive, only the SNHL patients who harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous pathological mutations were considered to present hearing impairment caused by the aforementioned mutations. Thus, through this analysis, the molecular etiology of deafness was confirmed in 23.56% (90/382) of the patients, and it involved the GJB2, SLC26A4, CDH23, MYO15A, and MT-RNR1 genes (Tables 2 and 3). Ten patients were identified with multiple genetic mutations (Table 4), who were not confirmed molecular etiology.\n\n    The mutant frequency of GJB2 was 36.13% (Table 2), and GJB2 was the most prevalent causative gene among the nonsyndromic SNHL patients. In this gene, 8 types of mutations were detected, among which c.235delC was the most prevalent mutation. Furthermore, the c.235delC mutation accounted for 59.68% (111/186) of all mutant GJB2 alleles. In addition, c.608T>C, c.299_300delAT, and c.427C>T were frequently encountered pathological mutations of GJB2, accounting for 18.28% (34/186), 10.20% (20/186), and 4.3% (8/186) of all mutations in this allele, respectively.\n\n    SLC26A4 was the second most prevalent causative gene among the nonsyndromic SNHL patients examined (20.68%; Tables 2 and 3). Eleven distinct mutations were detected in SLC26A4, among which c.IVS7-2A>G was the most prevalent mutation, accounting for 58.43% (52/89) of all mutant SLC26A4 alleles. Meanwhile, the c.2168A>G, c.IVS10-12T>A, c.754T>C, and c.1975G>C mutations accounted for 13.48% (12/89), 6.74% (6/89), 4.49% (4/89), and 4.49% (4/89) of the mutant SLC26A4 alleles, respectively.\n\n    Furthermore, the results obtained using our protocol revealed that the incidence of genetic dominant defects in the patient group tested was 2.88% (11/382). The molecular etiology was confirmed for each of these 11 patients, and it involved the KCNQ4 (OMIM: 603537), WFS1 (OMIM: 606201), TECTA (OMIM: 602574), or MYH9 (OMIM: 160775) genes (Table 5). Because these 4 genes showed a dominant inheritance pattern, we confirmed the sequence variants of the probands by DNA sequencing, and verified the co-segregation in their families. The results identified the following mutations harbored by the patients: KCNQ4 c.546C>G, WFS1 c.1846G>T, TECTA c.249C>T, and MYH9 c.2114G>A (Table 4).\n\n    Heterozygous mutations were also confirmed in the following 11 nuclear recessive genes: DFNB59 (OMIM: 610219), PCDH15 (OMIM: 605514), OTOF (OMIM: 603681), TRIOBP (OMIM: 609761), TMC1 (OMIM: 606706), MYO1A (OMIM: 601478), MYH14 (OMIM: 608568), MYO3A (OMIM: 606808), EYA4 (OMIM: 601316), MYO6 (OMIM: 600970), and TMPRSS3 (OMIM: 605511). As shown in Table 2, 4.19% (16/382), 3.66% (14/382), and 2.45% (9/382) of the patients were heterozygous for mutant DFNB59, PCDH15, and OTOF alleles, respectively. Last, no changes were identified in any of the patients in the following genes: COCH (OMIM: 603196), COL11A2 (OMIM: 120290), CRYM (OMIM: 123740), DFNA5 (OMIM: 608798), DIAPH1 (OMIM: 602121), EDN3 (OMIM: 613265), EDNRB (OMIM: 277580), FOXI1 (OMIM: 274600), GJB3 (OMIM: 603324), GJB6 (OMIM: 604418), KIAA1199 (OMIM: 608366), LHFPL5 (OMIM: 609427), LRTOMT (OMIM: 612414), MARVELD2 (OMIM: 610572), OTOA (OMIM: 607038), PAX3 (OMIM: 606597), POU4F3 (OMIM: 602460), RDX (OMIM: 179410), SLC26A5 (OMIM: 604943), SOX10 (OMIM: 602229), TMIE (OMIM: 607237), and WHRN (DFNB31; OMIM: 607928).\n\n    Thus, the molecular etiology was confirmed in 30.63% (117/382) of the children with nonsyndromic SNHL, and 76.92% (90/117) of these probands harbored pathogenic recessive mutations, 9.4% (11/117) carried pathogenic dominant mutations, and 13.68% (16/117) harbored pathogenic mutations in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA coding sequence.\n\n    The nonsyndromic SNHL patients examined in this study included 15 patients with EVA syndrome, and molecular defects in SLC26A4 were detected in 11 of these patients (73.33%) using our protocol. The results presented in Table 6 show that among these 11 individuals, 2 (18.18%) were homozygous for the c.IVS7-2A>G mutation, 5 (45.45%) were compound heterozygous for 2 pathogenic mutations, 1 (9.09%) was heterozygous for c.1489G>A, 1 (9.09%) was heterozygous for c.2168A>G, and 2 (18.18%) were heterozygous for c.IVS7-2A>G. Thus, 7 of the 15 patients (46.67%) patients were confirmed to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for biallelic mutations in SLC26A4. The allele frequencies of IVS7-2A>G and 2168A>G were 30% (9/30) and 10% (3/30), respectively, in the EVA patient group.\n\n    We determined that 4 out of 15 patients (26.67%) carried mutations in genes related to WS: 1 patient was heterozygous for EDN3 c.293C>A, 1 was heterozygous for PAX3 c.238C>G, 1 was heterozygous for PAX3 c.808C>T, and 1 carried only one MITF c.651G>T mutation. The clinical features and genotypes of these 4 WS patients are listed in Table 7.\n\n    GJB2 c.235delC was the only mutation detected in the control group, being present in 1 of the 60 control participants with normal hearing (mutation carrier frequency: 1.67%). The other mutations were not detected in the control group.",
        "Conclusion": "    We successfully developed an accurate and comprehensive genetic tool for SNHL diagnosis, and were able to use this tool to detect genetic defects associated with nonsyndromic SNHL and causative mutations of WS in up to 61.26% and 19.05% of the Chinese SNHL and WS patients tested, respectively. These attributes make the method presented here highly useful. Indeed, our method could be used for first-pass screening before NGS screening. However, no data on PS and US patients were analyzed in this study, as these 2 syndromes were not diagnosed in any patient in our department. Thus, for future versions, we will replace some of the featured mutations and optimize the microarray based on large-scale screening.",
        "Discussion": "    Deafness, the most common sensory-nerve disease worldwide, not only causes hearing disability, but also affects mental health, and concurrently places a heavy burden on the patient's family and the society. Although the use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other methods can improve or restore hearing function in some patients, these approaches do not explain the cause of deafness or provide methods to prevent the occurrence of the same phenotype in the patients' children. Approximately half of all congenital deafness cases are associated with genetic factors, and genetic screening and diagnosis both simplify the entire progress of diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis, and help to explain the etiology and predict the possibility of inheritance. However, the approach required for obtaining a genetic diagnosis of hereditary deafness is challenging for the following reasons: first, there are currently no optimal strategies to obtain such diagnoses. Because of the high genetic heterogeneity of genetic hearing loss, no clear and confirmed relationship exists between each type of hearing loss and the identified genetic variants. Indeed, patients with identical same clinical manifestations might present distinct genotypes, or vice versa. Although certain strategies for detecting variants have been previously suggested, these are not suitable for people of all ethnic groups living in distinct geographical regions. Second, there are currently no optimal technologies available for diagnosis of hereditary deafness. Sanger sequencing, which has been the screening method used for genetic research and clinical genetic diagnostics for almost 40 years, is the most definitive method. However, using Sanger sequencing to screen each disease-associated gene to identify causative variants is time-consuming and expensive. Thus, gene chips have typically been used in the screening and diagnosis of hearing loss. The advantages of gene-chip technology are its low cost, simplicity, and availability; however, the technology can only be used to detect specific known mutations. Another technology that has been developed is next-generation sequencing (NGS; also called second-generation sequencing), which offers high throughput and high sequencing depth, and is considered as a suitable method for molecular diagnosis of hearing loss; however, the increased output of NGS is associated with an increased error rate, which varies from 0.1% to 2%. Moreover, analysis of the data obtained via this technique remains a bottleneck encountered by geneticists. Given these drawbacks, we sought to develop a tool that could be used as a first-pass screen prior to NGS-based screening.\n\n    We developed a hearing-loss-detection microarray featuring 240 selected mutations in 1 mitochondrial gene and 46 nuclear genes. The variants in this microarray represent the genes that are currently those most frequently involved in deafness, most of which have been reported more than twice previously in the Chinese population. As such, ours is the first microarray to cover both nonsyndromic and syndromic SNHL. In Table 8, we compare our microarray with a few previously reported technologies. No currently available technology for molecular testing of SNHL in China is as efficient or comprehensive as the hearing-loss microarray presented here. Our microarray is easy to operate, and is highly advantageous because of its versatility. The call rate of the microarray was 99.375%. Moreover, the assay performed in this study was highly sensitive and specific, as indicated by the low detection rates of false-negative and false-positive mutations. Specifically, the sensitivity and specificity were 98.73% and 98.34%, respectively. Furthermore, for a given test, a +LR of >10 and -LR of <0.10 theoretically indicate a high validity for the test in clinical application. In our study, +LR and -LR were 59.49 and 0.01, respectively. Meanwhile, Youden's index serves as an index for summarizing the performance of a diagnostic test, and its value ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating that a test is unreliable and 1 indicating that the test is optimal. In our study, Youden's index was 0.97, demonstrating that the test is highly reliable. Kappa is a statistical measure of the agreement in ratings between two tests, and its value ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating complete consistency between two tests. When comparing the microarray results with those obtained by Sanger sequencing, the Kappa value for our microchip was 0.917, which further demonstrated the reliability of our microarray.\n\n    Among the variants in all identified causative autosomal-recessive genes, GJB2 variants represent the most common known cause of autosomal-recessive SNHL in several ethnicities, and GJB2 is the currently the only gene examined in most diagnostic laboratories. The occurrence ratio of GJB2 mutations in the general population is around 1/33. GJB2 is a common pathogenic gene and its variants have been reported in, for example, Europe, Tunisia, Lebanon, Australia, and New Zealand. In China, 21%-27% of prelingual deafness is due to GJB2 mutations, the most common of which is 235delC. In this study, 36.13% of our patients presented GJB2 mutations together with nonsyndromic SNHL, and more than half (53.85%, 63/117) of the nonsyndromic SNHL patients with an identified molecular etiology were diagnosed with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in GJB2. GJB2 c.235delC was the most common mutation identified, accounting for 59.68% of the mutant GJB2 alleles, which is comparable to the results of earlier studies. Three other key causative mutations identified here were GJB2 c.427C>T, c.608T>C and c.299_300del. To clarify the genetic etiology for the patients who only carry one mutation, the entire coding sequence of GJB2 must be analyzed for the possible existence of a second mutant allele.\n\n    As the major genetic contributor to nonsyndromic SNHL, PS, and EVA, SLC26A4 might be the second most frequent causative gene of hereditary hearing loss worldwide. In this study, 20.51% (24/117) of the nonsyndromic SNHL patients with an identified molecular etiology were diagnosed with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in SLC26A4. c.IVS7-2A>G was the most prevalent SLC26A4 mutation, accounting for 58.43% (52/89) of all mutations in this gene. SLC26A4 c.2168A>G, c.754T>C, and c.1975G>C were next most prevalent pathological mutations. Among the EVA patients, 46.67% (7/15) carried causal mutations in SLC26A4, and c.IVS7-2A>G accounted for 31.58% (6/19) of all mutant SLC26A4 alleles.\n\n    The mitochondrial 12S rRNA 1555A>G mutation is another hot spot associated with both aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss and SNHL in China. Indeed, the 1555A>G mutation was reported to account for up to 7.5% of the deaf in the Chinese population. In our study, 4.08% (16/382) of the patients with nonsyndromic SNHL were homoplastic for 1555A>G, and each of these patients exhibited profound and prelingual SNHL. Moreover, for 2 patients with prelingual and profound SNHL, the molecular etiology was identified to involve CDH23, and these patients carried the compound heterozygous mutations c.6823G>A and c.8866C>T, and c.6823G>A and c.2968G>A, respectively. In addition, another patient with prelingual and profound SNHL was found to harbor the compound heterozygous mutations MYO15A c.3685C>T and c.9478C>T. Notably, these 3 types of compound causative mutations have not been previously reported in the Chinese population. Altogether, 11 patients were confirmed to harbor dominant mutations in 4 genes: KCNQ4, WFS1, TECTA, and MYH9. We confirmed the sequence variants of these probands by Sanger sequencing analysis, and verified the co-segregation in their families. Furthermore, mutation carriers were confirmed in the case of 15 autosomal genes, including GJB2, SLC26A4, CDH23, MYO15A, DFNB59, PCDH15, OTOF, TRIOBP, TMC1, MYO1A, MYH14, and MYO3A. In particular, the carrier frequencies for CDH23, MYO15A, DFNB59, PCDH15, and OTOF were 14.17%, 5.45%, 4.36%, 3.81%, and 2.45%, respectively. For patients who were heterozygous for only a single mutation (Table 2) or multiple mutations of different genes (Table 4), these mutations were highly suggestive of a genetic cause and the patients' samples required further sequencing analyses. Increased attention should be paid to these genes when screening for nonsyndromic SNHL in China.\n\n    Genotype-to-phenotype correlation is also important, because different mutations in the same gene can lead to different phenotypes. Most nonsyndromic autosomal forms cause prelingual hearing loss which is severe to profound. In our study, 63 nonsyndromic SNHL patients with an identified molecular etiology were diagnosed with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in GJB2. All 63 of these patients presented prelingual SNHL and most of the patients (96.83%, 61/63) showed profound SNHL, and other 2 patients were severe hearing loss. Among 24 patients identified with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in SLC26A4, 21 (87.5%, 21/24) presented prelingual SNHL and 23 (95.83%, 23/24) presented profound SNHL, 1 presented severe SNHL. Furthermore, each of the patients who were diagnosed with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in mitochondrial 12S rRNA, CDH23, MYO15A, WFS1, KCNQ4, TECTA, and MYH9 exhibited profound and prelingual SNHL. Most of these patients were consistent with genotype:phenotype relationship as previous reports. However, two patients who respectively carried KCNQ c.546C>G and MYH9 c.2114G>A presented prelingual and profound hearing impairment. This is not consistent with the progressive hearing loss of KCNQ and MYH9 mutants as reported.\n\n    WS is the most common autosomal-dominant syndromic deafness. While the incidence rate of WS is 1/212,000, the genuine incidence rate is suspected to be 1/42,000 because the incomplete penetrance rate is 20%, which accounts for 2%-5% of congenital deafness and 0.9%-2.8% of deaf-mutism. The major clinical features of WS are sensorineural deafness and abnormal pigment distribution on the skin, hair, iris, and inner ear. On the basis of these phenotypes, WS can be divided into 4 types (WS1-WS4), with WS1 and WS2 being the most prevalent. To date, 6 genes have been confirmed to be related to WS: MITF (OMIM: 156845), PAX3 (OMIM: 606597), SOX10 (OMIM: 602229), SNAI2 (602150), ENDRB (OMIM: 277580), and EDN3 (OMIM: 613265). In our study, we selected 14 mutations from 5 genes, most of which have been reported in Chinese WS patients. Twenty-one WS patients were evaluated using our microarray, and the molecular etiology was confirmed for 4 (19.05%) of these 21 patients. Of these, 3 were WS1 patients and 1 was a WS2 patient, and all 4 presented congenital and profound SNHL (Table 6). We suggest that when screening for WS patients in China, increased attention must be devoted to the following 4 previously reported causal mutations: EDN3 c.293C>A, PAX3 c.238C>G, PAX3 c.808C>T, and MITF c.651G>T.\n\n    In summary, genetic defects were detected in up to 61.26% (234/382) of the nonsyndromic SNHL patients in our study, and the inherited molecular etiology was confirmed in 30.63% (117/382) of these patients. Our results show that, among the patients tested, 76.92% (90/117) of hereditary nonsyndromic deafness was autosomal recessive, 9.4% (11/117) was autosomal dominant, and 13.68% (16/117) was associated with a maternally inherited mitochondrial gene. This study also supports the notion that the mutations in GJB2, SLC26A4, and the mitochondrial gene are the major genetic causes of nonsyndromic SNHL in China, and account for approximately 53.85% (63/117), 20.51% (24/117), and 13.68% (16/117) of these cases, respectively. Genetic defects were identified in 19.05% of the WS patients, and genetic causative mutations were confirmed in 46.67% of the EVA patients. Thus, the array presented here comprises an optimal platform for screening and detecting hereditary hearing loss, and the use of this array could yield valuable findings. The mutation screening could help the deaf in avoiding marriage between people carrying the same mutations. Moreover, the platform can be used for neonatal screening. Once the etiology of the hearing loss has been identified, early interventions, such as the use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, medicines, and life guides, can contribute substantially toward improving the quality of life in people with hearing impairment.",

        "Title": "    GJB2 mutation spectrum in 2063 Chinese patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations in GJB2 are the most common molecular defects responsible for autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI). The mutation spectra of this gene vary among different ethnic groups.\n\n    In order to understand the spectrum and frequency of GJB2 mutations in the Chinese population, the coding region of the GJB2 gene from 2063 unrelated patients with NSHI was PCR amplified and sequenced.\n\n    A total of 23 pathogenic mutations were identified. Among them, five (p.W3X, c.99delT, c.155_c.158delTCTG, c.512_c.513insAACG, and p.Y152X) are novel. Three hundred and seven patients carry two confirmed pathogenic mutations, including 178 homozygotes and 129 compound heterozygotes. One hundred twenty five patients carry only one mutant allele. Thus, GJB2 mutations account for 17.9% of the mutant alleles in 2063 NSHI patients. Overall, 92.6% (684/739) of the pathogenic mutations are frame-shift truncation or nonsense mutations. The four prevalent mutations; c.235delC, c.299_c.300delAT, c.176_c.191del16, and c.35delG, account for 88.0% of all mutantalleles identified. The frequency of GJB2 mutations (alleles) varies from 4% to 30.4% among different regions of China. It also varies among different sub-ethnic groups.\n\n    In some regions of China, testing of the three most common mutations can identify at least one GJB2 mutant allele in all patients. In other regions such as Tibet, the three most common mutations account for only 16% the GJB2 mutant alleles. Thus, in this region, sequencing of GJB2 would be recommended. In addition, the etiology of more than 80% of the mutant alleles for NSHI in China remains to be identified. Analysis of other NSHI related genes will be necessary.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing impairment is the most common neurosensory disorder in humans. The reported incidence varies from 1 in 300 to 1 in 1000 children. Approximately half of cases have a genetic etiology, including syndromic and non-syndromic forms, with extraordinary genetic heterogeneity. Non-syndromic deafness accounts for 60-70% of inherited hearing impairment. It involves more than 100 different genes with autosomal dominant (DFNA), autosomal recessive (DFNB), X-linked (DFN), and maternal inheritance, with autosomal recessive being the most common. For many populations, the most common cause for non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss is mutated Connexin 26, a gap junction protein encoded by the GJB2 gene (MIM 121011). There are a few specific mutations in GJB2 gene that are associated with the autosomal dominant syndromic forms of deafness, and typically present with skin abnormalities including keratitis-ichthyosis.\n\n    Connexins are transmembrane proteins. Six monomers of connexin proteins associate to form a transmembrane hexameric gap junction hemi-channel called a connexon. Connexons embedded in the surfaces of adjacent cells associate to form an intercellular channel. In the inner ear, connexin 26 can be in association with other connexins to form heteromeric connexons. Gap junction channels can be homotypic or heterotypic. Connexin 26 gap junction channels recycle potassium ions as part of a mechanism of auditory signal transduction in inner ear.\n\n    Mutations in three connexin (Cx) genes, GJB2 (Cx26), GJB6 (Cx30), and GJB3 (Cx31), have been identified and are known to cause hearing impairment. Sequence analysis of the GJB2 gene in subjects with autosomal recessive hearing impairment revealed that a high number of patients carried only one mutant allele. Some of these families showed clear evidence of linkage to the DFNB1 locus, which contains two genes, GJB2 and GJB6 . Further analysis demonstrated that some GJB2 heterozygotes also carried a truncating deletion of the GJB6 gene, encoding connexin 30, in trans .\n\n    To date, more than 150 mutations, polymorphisms, and unclassified variants have been described in the GJB2 gene . The mutation spectrum and prevalence of mutations vary significantly among different ethnic groups. Three mutations, c.35delG, c.167delT, and c.235delC, are found to be the most frequent mutations in Caucasian, Ashkenazi Jewish, and Asian populations, respectively.\n\n    In China, it is estimated that 30,000 babies are born with congenital hearing impairment every year. The mutation spectrum of the GJB2 gene in Chinese patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) has not been analyzed. Our recent study by screening for just the most common mutation, c.235delC, in 3004 Chinese NSHI patients revealed that 488 (16.3%) patients carried at least one c.235delC mutant allele, with 233 (7.8%) homozygotes and 255 (8.5%) heterozygotes, though the frequencies of homozygote and heterozygote of c.235delC varied from 0% to 14.7% and from 1.7% to 16.1% respectively in the populations examined in this study. Among different Chinese sub-ethnic groups the c.235delC allele frequency was the lowest (0.8%) in the Tibetan and the highest (31.0%) in Maan. These results highlight the need to sequence the entire GJB2 gene in order to more accurately establish the actual mutation frequency and mutation spectrum of GJB2 gene within various Chinese sub-populations. Our preliminary results reveal that other GJB2 mutations account for an additional 7.1% of NSHI patients from Qinghai, where only 7.1% patients carried at least one c.235delC mutation. Nevertheless, sequencing analysis of the entire coding region of the GJB2 gene in patients from Guangxi where the frequency of the c.235delC mutation is 3.4% reveals only one other mutation in 87 deaf patients. These results have two important implications: that the GJB2 gene needs to be sequenced in its entirety; and that mutations in genes responsible for NSHI other than GJB2 should be searched in patients who do not harbor two mutant alleles in the GJB2 gene. In this study, we report the results of sequencing the GJB2 gene in 2063 patients with NSHI from 23 different regions of China (Figure 1).",
        "Methods": "    A total of 2063 unrelated NSHI students from 23 different regions of China were included in this sequencing study. The selection of samples was random regardless of the c.235delC genotype. The patients consisted of 1179 males and 884 females ranging in age from 2 to 30 years with an average age of 13.7 +- 4.5. The majority of patients were Han Chinese (1640), followed by Tibetan (122), minorities in the Southwest region (119), Hui (79), minorities in Xinjiang (62), Mongolian (21), Maan (18) and Korean (2). Ethnic subgroup designations were based on permanent residency documentation.\n\n    This study was performed according to a protocol approved by the ethics committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. The subjects in this study were from deaf schools of each region and were recently described. Only the unrelated patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss were included in this study. Parents were not included in this study. All patients showed moderate to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment on audiograms and no pathient with mild hearing impairment was found in this cohort. In addition to the 2063 patients, 301 Han control individuals with normal hearing (either evaluated by pure tone audiometry or by self-assessment) from Beijing Capital (Northern) and Jiangsu Province (Eastern), two densely populated regions consisting of 98% Han Chinese, were also analyzed. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using a commercially available DNA extraction kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc, Shanghai, China).\n\n    The coding exon (Exon2) and flanking intronic regions of GJB2 gene were PCR amplified with forward primer 5'TTGGTGTTTGCTCAGGAAGA 3' and reverse primer 5'GGCCTACAGGGGTTTCAAAT 3'. Among this study cohort, 851 patients from central China were also analyzed for mutations in Exon1 and flanking introns by PCR/sequencing. The PCR primers used are forward primer: 5'CTCATGGGGGCTCAAAGGAACTAGGAGATCGG3' and reverse primer 5'GGGGCTGGACCAACACACGTCCTTGGG3'. The PCR products were purified on Qia-quick spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (version v3.1) and ABI 3130 automated DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA,) with Sequence Analysis Software (Sequencing Analysis version 3.7). DNA sequence variations were identified by comparison of subject DNA sequence to GJB2 reference sequences, Genebank Accession Number AY280971. Numbering of GJB2 begins with the nucleotide A of the ATG start codon in Exon2 as cDNA position number 1. The sequences were analyzed using Genetool Lite software and the GJB2 Genebank sequence. The presence of 309 kb deletion of GJB6 was analyzed by PCR method. A positive control of this deletion provided by Balin Wu (Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA.) was used for the detection of deletion in GJB6 gene.\n\n    The statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.1.3 software (SAS, Cary, North Carolina, USA).",
        "Results": "    Sequencing of the coding region of the GJB2 gene revealed that at least 104 different genotypes were found in the 2063 patients (Table 1). Among them, 64 different genotypes harboring pathogenic mutations were found in 432 patients (Table 1). Three hundred and seven patients had two confirmed pathogenic mutations, including 178 homozygotes and 129 compound heterozygotes. One hundred twenty five patients carried one heterozygous pathogenic mutation without an identified second mutant allele. Thus, GJB2 mutant alleles account for 17.9% (739/4126) of the total alleles in 2063 NSHI patients. The most common genotype was homozygous c.235delC, followed by compound heterozygosity for c.235delC/c.299_300delAT, which accounted for 8.0% (164/2063) and 3.2% (66/2063) of NSHI patients respectively. The most common mutation c.235delC was in compound heterozygosity with 14 other different pathogenic mutations in 113 patients, and was present as a single heterozygous mutant allele in 68 patients. In addition, there were 23 different genotypes in patients carrying one allele of unclassified variants (Table 1). Twenty-three alterations were found, five (p.W3X, c.99delT, c.155_c.158delTCTG, p.Y152X, and c.512_c.513insAACG) of them were novel and pathogenic, and twelve (p,G21R, p,I30F, p.F31L, p.V37I, p.V63L, p.T123N, p.V153A, p.D159N, p.F191L, p.M195V, p.V198M, and p.I215N) are unclassified variants (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1). The distribution of various genotypes in 23 regions (Figure 1) is detailed in Table 2 and Supplemental Table 2. The frequencies of the three most common GJB2 mutations in the 23 regions studied are listed in Table 2. The allele frequency of all mutations in the GJB2 gene in NSHI patients varied from 4.0% in Guangxi to 30.4% in Jiangsu (Table 2). Regions which appeared to have a higher frequency of the c.235delC mutation (Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Beijing, Hebei, Shanghai) also had a relatively high frequency of other GJB2 mutations (eg, the frequency of the c.235delC mutation in Jiangsu was as high as 20.6% and the frequencies of other mutations were also as high as 9.8%). Similarly, regions such as Shaanxi and Guangxi where the frequency of the c.235delC mutation is low (5.8 and 3.4% respectively), also had lower frequencies of other mutations (1.9 and 0.6% respectively). Patients from Tibet, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Ningxia appear to have the most diverse mutation spectrum because uncommon mutations (except c.235delC, c.299_c.300delAT and c.176_c.191del16) comprise 84.2, 30.8, 26.1, 21.4, and 20.4%, respectively of overall GJB2 mutations in those regions.\n\n    The c.235delC is the most prevalent mutation in the Chinese NSHI population with a total of 509 alleles (164 homozygous, 113 compound heterozygous with other pathogenic mutant alleles, and 68 one heterozygous allele only), followed by 98 c.299_c.300delAT mutant alleles (8 homozygotes, 76 compound heterozygotes, and 6 one allele heterozygotes), 31 c.176_c.191del16 mutant alleles (2 homozygous, 25 compound heterozygous and 2 with only one allele), and 12 c.35delG mutant alleles(2 homozygous, 3 compound heterozygous and 2 with only one allele) (Supplemental Table 1). The four prevalent mutations account for 88.0% (650/739) of all mutant alleles identified. Five novel mutations were identified in 20 patients; including two nonsense; p.W3X, p.Y152X, and 4 frame-shift truncation mutations; c.99delT, c.155-c.158 delTCTG, and c.512-c.513 insAACG. Among these, c.512-c.513insAACG occurs in 12 patients, including one homozygous from Yunnan. The novel truncation mutations account for only about 3.1% (23/739, Supplemental Table 1) of the overall GJB2 mutant alleles. The most prevalent Caucasian mutation, c.35delG, was found in 2 homozygous, 3 compound heterozygous, and 5 single allele heterozygous patients. Among the patients with c.35delG, 70% of patients (7/10) are Uigur from Xinjiang area. The c.35insG mutation was found in 2 patients (both are Hui people) compound heterozygous with the c.235delC mutation. Other reported frame-shift mutations; 1 c.388-c.397del10 and 3 c.605-c.606ins46, as well as nonsense mutations; 3 p.E47X, account for a small fraction (1.0%) of GJB2 mutant alleles. Overall, 92.6% (684/739) of the pathogenic mutations are frame-shift truncation or nonsense mutations, and they are predicted to cause loss of function of connexin 26. Only 6.9% (51/739) of the mutant alleles are reported missense mutations.\n\n    There are 8 reported missense pathogenic mutations and 1 in-frame deletion of 1 single amino acid, c.424_c.426del3 (p.del142F), which occurs in 4 heterozygous patients (Supplemental Table 1). The 8 missense mutations are p.G4D (3 heterozygous patients), p.R32C (one patient in compound heterozygosity with c.235delC), p.R143W (4 compound heterozygotes), p.T86R (all compound heterozygous, 6 with c.235delC and 1 with c.299_c.300delAT), p.R127H (one compound with p.Y152X, 31 single heterozygotes), p.S139N (2 single heterozygotes), p.E47K (one compound with c.299_c.300delAT), p.S85P (single heterozygote). All occur in an evolutionarily highly conserved region (Figure 2).\n\n    Twelve unclassified missense variants were identified. The p.G21R is most likely to be pathogenic based on its highly evolutionarily conserved nature and the dramatic effect of the amino acid substitutions on structure and ionic strength. The p.I215N variant is located in the conserved region of C-terminal ion channel domain. Replacing the hydrophobic amino acid isoleucine with a hydrophilic amino acid asparagine in this conserved region is expected to cause detrimental effect. This variant is also in compound heterozygous with a novel pathogenic mutation, c.155_c.158delTCTG. Thus, it is likely to be pathogenic.\n\n    The missense variants, p.I30F, p.F31L, p.V63L, p.V153A, p.D159N, p.F191L, p.M195V, and p.V198M, do not involve drastic change in amino acid structure and polarity. They are all present as single heterozygous alleles without the presence of a second pathogenic mutant allele. Thus, their pathogenicity cannot be determined. Other changes of the same amino acids have been reported. For example, p.V63A has been reported as a novel variant, p.V153I and p.D159N were reported as a polymorphism. The p.M195V and p.V198M, each occurs in two patients, without the second mutant allele. Each of the other variants occurs as heterozygous in one patient. None of these missense variants were detected in the control population.\n\n    Several nucleotide substitutions do not result in amino acid change. These are p.A49A, p. K61K, p.F146F, and p.T186T (p.T186T is heterozygous with a single c.235delC). Although these nucleotide changes do not alter the encoded amino acids, we cannot exclude the possibility that they may activate an exonic splice enhancer and cause aberrant splicing. Alternatively, changes in triplet codon may affect the preference of codon usage or the stability of the mRNA, which in turn can affect the protein levels.\n\n    GJB2 is a small gene but harbors many mutations. Thus, the carrier frequency of GJB2 mutation in the Chinese population is not negligible. We sequenced the coding region of 301 normal control individuals of the Han ethnic group. Nine individuals were found to be heterozygous carriers of GJB2 pathogenic mutations; three had the c.235delC, three had the c.299_c.300delAT, and the c.512_c.513insAACG, c.35delG, and p.E47X mutation have been detected in single individuals (see Supplemental Table 3). Thus, the carrier frequency of GJB2 mutations in the control population is 3%.\n\n    The frequencies of common missense variants such as p.V37I, p.V27I, p.I203T, p.T123N, p.E114G in patients, control, and other Asian populations were compared (see Supplemental Table 4 and Table 5). The pathogenic role of p.V37I has been controversial. It was found that the p.V37I allele frequency was significantly higher in the Han patient group (excluding all cases with two clearly pathogenic mutations) than in the control group (6.7% and 2.8% respectively,. p = 0.0003), supporting a pathogenic role of p.V37I. The allele frequencies of p.V27I, p.E114G, p.I203T, and p.T123N were higher in the control group than in the Han patient group (excluding all cases with two clearly pathogenic mutations), arguing against their pathogenic role (see Supplemental Table 4 and Table 5).\n\n    As indicated in Table 2, the frequency of GJB2 mutations varies from 4% in Guangxi to 30.4% in Jiangsu. These results suggest that the variation in mutation frequencies may be due to ethnic diversity in various regions. The total population of China is 1.3 billion and sub-populations of Han, Tibetan, Hui, Man, Mon, minorities in Xinjiang, and minorities in South-western China are 1137.4 million, 5.4 million, 9.8 million, 10.7 million, 5.8 million, 10.8 million, and 57.1 million, respectively . We therefore analyzed the mutation frequencies in different sub-ethnic groups. As shown in Supplemental Table 6, Hui has the highest frequency of overall GJB2 mutations, followed by Han and minorities in Xinjiang with 20.3, 19.1, and 15.3% respectively. Tibetan and the minorities in the Southwest have lower mutation frequencies, 9.4 and 5.0% respectively, similar to the frequencies observed in corresponding regions. The majority of mutations found in this study were found in the Han patient group (1640 cases) only except c.35 insG that was in compound heterozygous with c.235delC found in two Hui patients. The common Caucasian mutation, c.35delG was mainly detected in the minorities of Xinjiang, and accounted for almost half of the GJB2 mutant alleles in minorities of Xinjiang (9 c.35delG/19 total mutant alleles). The finding of the c.35delG mutation in Xinjiang may be due in part to the close vicinity of Xinjiang to Russia and Eastern European countries, and possible admixture. The Maan sub-ethnic group also appears to have diverse GJB2 mutation spectrum because mutations other than c.235delC account for more than one third of the mutant alleles. The three most common mutations c.235delC, c.299_c.300delAT, and c.176_c.191del16 account for 100% of GJB2 mutations in 18 Mongolian individuals analyzed. However, the sample size is too small to be statistically significant.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Previous reports have suggested that the prevalence of GJB2 mutations among different ethnic groups varies. In our patients, the most common Caucasian mutation, c.35delG was only found in 10 patients (seven of them were Uigur from Xinjiang). Instead, the c.235delC account for 68.9% of all GJB2 mutant alleles in our Chinese study population. These results support that the c.235delC mutation in connexin 26 gene is the most prevalent mutation in most Asian populations, including Han Chinese. The results from this study indicate that analysis of four common mutations, c.235delC, c.299_c.300delAT, c.176_c.191del16, and 35delG can detect 88.0% (650/739) of GJB2 mutations. In 13 regions of China, by analyzing these four mutations, we were able to identified at least one mutant allele in all studied patients with one or two GJB2 mutations (see Table 2 and Supplemental Table 2). In contrast, mutations in the GJB2 gene account for a variable proportion of the molecular etiology of NSHI in different regions and sub-ethnic groups in China. Our results have tremendous impact on the design of molecular diagnostic and carrier testing of NSHI families in China. For example, in addition to the three most common mutations of c.235delC, c.299_c.300delAT, c.176_c.191del16, for minorities in Xinjiang, testing of Caucasian c.35delG mutation should be included. In patients with Maan ethnic background, sequencing of the GJB2 coding region should be offered, since the analysis of three common mutations detects only 71% of GJB2 mutant alleles. In minorities from Southwest provinces, although the three most common mutations account for >90% of all GJB2 mutations, defects in GJB2 gene account for only a small fraction (5%, Supplemental Table 2 and Table 6) of mutant alleles in NSHI patients. Thus, in these groups, analysis of other NSHI related genes should be pursued.\n\n    We recently reported that 7.8% of patients with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment in China were homozygous for the most common c.235delC mutation in GJB2 gene and 8.5% of them carried one mutant allele of the c.235delC mutation. Sequencing of the coding region of the GJB2 gene reveals that 14.9% of the patients carry two pathogenic GJB2 mutation and 6.1% carry only one mutant allele. These results are comparable to other reported studies. The proportions of patients with GJB2 mutations carrying only one mutant allele vary among different regions, different sub-ethnic groups, and different countries. The observation that sequence analysis of GJB2 gene in subjects with autosomal recessive NSHI results in a high number of patients with only one GJB2 mutant allele has been puzzling. Our unpublished data showed that no mutation were found in GJB2 Exon1 and its splicing sequence among 851 deaf individuals from Central China in this cohort which suggested extremely low detection rate of GJB2 Exon1 mutation among Chinese deaf population. For there is higher frequency of single heterozygous GJB2 mutation detected in the deaf population than in the normal population in this study, the further more extensive study of sequence change in GJB2 Exon1 or promoter area and 3'-UTR, fragment deletion neighboring GJB2 ORF region and digenic inheritance with other genes are already considered in this large Chinese deaf cohort for elucidating complex pathogenesis of GJB2 gene to hearing impairment. We already added a paragraph in discussion. Thus, a digenic hypothesis was proposed and mutations in two other connexin (Cx) genes, GJB6 for Cx30 and GJB3 for Cx31 were studied. In families with clear evidence of linkage to the DFNB1 locus, which contains two genes, GJB2 and GJB6 , a common 309 kb deletion, involving the coding region GJB6 gene upstream of GJB2 gene has been identified and found to account for up to 10% of DFNB1 alleles in Caucasians. We analyzed the deletion in GJB6 gene in 372 patients from Inner Mongolia and central China, and deletions in GJB6 gene were not detected. Similar studies of GJB6 mutations in Taiwanese prelingual NSHI patients carrying one GJB2 mutant allele also did not detect any deleterious mutations in GJB6, consistent with our results.\n\n    Although the spectrum of rare GJB2 mutations varies among sub-ethnic groups and in different regions of China, the same most common c.235delC mutation is shared. This observation is in agreement with the reports from the studies of other Asian NSHI patients. However, instead of c.299_c.300delAT being the second most prevalent mutation, p.G45E accounts for 16% of the Japanese GJB2 mutations, while p.G4D accounts for 10.6% of Taiwanese GJB2 mutant alleles. The p.G45E mutation was not detected in our patients. The p.G4D mutation accounts for only 0.3% of GJB2 mutant alleles in Chinese NSHI patients and was recently reported in a US study.\n\n    Among the 23 pathogenic mutations, 14 cause truncated connexin 26 proteins due to nonsense or frame-shift mutations, 8 are missense mutations, and one is a deletion of one amino acid. These mutations occur along the coding region. The truncation mutations account for 92.6% of the mutant alleles. Amino acids sequence homology alignment reveals that all missense mutations and unclassified variants occur at an evolutionarily conserved amino acid (Figure 2).\n\n    Three missense variants, p.V63L, p.V153A, and p.V198M, are located in extracelluar domain 1, 2, and transmembrane span 4, respectively, of connexin 26 protein. All these changes have not been reported in the Connexins and Deafness mutations database at . However, p.V63L has been found in 1 Taiwanese patient. These three variants likely contribute to the pathogenesis of deafness, because (a) they were detected only in the patient group and not in 394 Japanese, 864 Taiwanese, 494 Korean and 301 Chinese (in this study) hearing normal subjects, and (b) they are evolutionarily conserved in xenopus, mouse, rat, sheep, orangutan, and human (Figure. 2). These variants were found in a heterozygous state in 4 unrelated patients who carried only one mutant allele.\n\n    The pathogenicity of p.V37I is controversial. In a recent multicenter study, the p.V37I mutation was found to be associated with mild to moderate hearing impairment (median 25-40 dB). Our study revealed that p.V37I with an allele frequency of 6.7% (185/2744) in the Han patient group (excluding all cases with two clearly pathogenic mutations) is significantly higher compared with that (2.8%;17/602) found in the control population (p = 0.0003, see Supplemental Table 4 and Table 5), supporting Wu's opinion to reassignment of p. V37I from an allele variant to a pathogenic mutation.\n\n    The p.T123N is an unclassified variant. It was counted as a mutation in Japanese group but a polymorphism in a Taiwanese study. We found a higher p.T123N allele frequency in the control group than in the patient group, suggesting that it may be neutral variant. However, its clinical implication is not clear at this time.\n\n    The results of this study provide a great potential benefit for the clinical application of genetic testing for deafness. Based upon our preliminary data of molecular epidemiology of hearing impairment in China, Li has combined allele-specific PCR and universal array (ASPUA) methodologies for the detection of mutations causing hereditary hearing loss. It was employed for multiplex detection of 11 mutations in GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4 and mitochondrial DNA causing hereditary hearing loss. Although this simple screening chip only include probes and primers for the c.35delG, c.176_c.191del16, c.235delC, c.299_c.300delAT mutations of GJB2 gene, it can detect 88.0% (650/739) of GJB2 mutations among these 2063 deaf individuals, meanwhile, up to 88.9% (384/432) of 432 patients confirmed to carry at least one GJB2 mutation by sequencing in this study will be picked up by this fast screen method. The new methods for multiple mutation detection including ASPUA with capacity to test more gene loci have been under developed in our center, the data of this study will be crucial for the mutation selection in any new technology development for GJB2 gene testing in Chinese population.\n\n    In summary, this study revealed a unique GJB2 mutation spectrum in Chinese patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment. The c.235delC mutation is the most frequent mutation in Chinese patients. Testing of four common mutations, c.235delC, c.299_c.300delAT, c.176_c.191del16, and c.35delG can detect 88.0% of the GJB2 mutant alleles. However, in some regions or sub-ethnic groups, the GJB2 mutations only account for a small fraction of the NSHI mutant alleles. In these regions, analysis of NSHI related genes is necessary. The molecular defects of more than 80% of the mutant alleles for NSHI in China remain to be identified.",

        "Title": "    GCK-MODY (MODY 2) Caused by a Novel p.Phe330Ser Mutation",
        "Abstract": "    Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The second most common cause is GCK-MODY due to heterozygous mutations in the GCK gene which impair the glucokinase function through different mechanisms such as enzymatic activity, protein stability, and increased interaction with its receptor. The enzyme normally acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreatic beta cell and regulates insulin secretion. We report here a three-generation nonobese family diagnosed with diabetes. All affected family members presented with mild hyperglycemia and mostly slightly elevated hemoglobin A1c values. Genetic testing revealed a novel heterozygous T   C exchange in exon 8 of the GCK gene which resulted in a phenylalanine330 TTC   serine (TCC)/p.Phe330Ser/F330S substitution.",
        "Introduction": "    MODY is a monogenic disease which accounts for 2-5% of all diabetes cases. The most frequent form is HNF-1alpha-MODY (MODY type 3), which is caused by mutations in the HNF1A gene encoding hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha. The second most frequent form is GCK-MODY (MODY type 2), which has been shown to be the result of mutations in the GCK gene. The GCK gene maps to chromosome 7p15.3-p15.1 and consists of 12 exons that encode the 465-amino-acid protein glucokinase, which is one of four members of the hexokinase family of enzymes. It catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose as the first step of glycolysis. Glucokinase is exclusively expressed in mammalian liver and pancreatic islet beta cells. The enzyme plays an important regulatory role in glucose metabolism. As a glucose sensor, it regulates insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta-cell by changing the glucose phosphorylation rate over a range of physiological glucose concentrations (4-15 mmoL/L). GCK gene mutations can cause both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Heterozygous inactivating mutations cause GCK-MODY, which mostly presents with mild hyperglycemia and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Usually, no diabetes-related complications such as nephropathy or retinopathy occur in patients with GCK-MODY. Homozygous or compound heterozygous inactivating GCK mutations result in a more severe phenotype presenting at birth as permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Heterozygous activating GCK mutations, in contrast, cause persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy.\n\n    In 1992, GCK was the first MODY gene to be linked to disease in French and UK families. These linkage studies were quickly followed by the identification of the first genetic defects. Meanwhile, over 600 different GCK mutations have been described in many populations, the majority having been identified in Europe. Missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations have been reported, which are distributed throughout the 10 exons encoding the pancreatic beta-cell isoform of the enzyme. There are no mutational hot spots. Over 250 mutations have been reported in more than one family. All inactivating mutations are associated with mild fasting hyperglycemia while other specific symptoms are missing. Therefore, GCK-MODY is likely to be underdiagnosed, and no reliable data on its prevalence are available. In Caucasians, approximately 2% of the population are diagnosed as having gestational diabetes and approximately 2-5% of these patients will have GCK-MODY. This would suggest a population prevalence of 0.04-0.1%.\n\n    The identification of a GCK gene mutation is important for the correct and definite diagnosis of GCK-MODY. It also helps the clinician to predict the clinical course of the disease and to advise appropriate therapy. Since only mild fasting hyperglycemia and no diabetes-related complications are usually present, diet is sufficient as a therapeutic approach in most cases.\n\n    We report a novel heterozygous inactivating GCK gene mutation in a nonobese family diagnosed with diabetes over three generations.",
        "Methods": "",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    So far, more than 620 GCK gene mutations have been reported in over 1400 patients with GCK-MODY (Table 2), permanent neonatal diabetes, and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The mutations are spread over the ten exons of the gene which encode the pancreatic beta cell isoform of glucokinase (exons 1a and 2-10). Only few mutations have been detected in exon 1a, since most laboratories only screen for GCK mutations in exons 2-10. Missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations have been reported. There are no mutation hot spots. Most of the mutations are private, although 255 mutations have been described in more than one family. We here report a novel heterozygous p.Phe330Ser mutation encoded by GCK exon 8 which results in the typical GCK-MODY phenotype. The mutation was found in three generations of a nonconsanguineous family, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\n\n    A GCK gene polymorphism with functional significance also has been reported in the literature. The G>A exchange at position -30 of the beta-cell-specific promoter (rs1799884) has been shown to be associated with increased fasting glucose levels in young adults and in pregnant women as well as an increased birth weight of their offspring.\n\n    The identification of a pathogenic GCK gene mutation is important for the correct and definite diagnosis of GCK-MODY and helps the clinician to predict the disease course and to initiate the appropriate therapy. Since only mild fasting hyperglycemia and usually no diabetes-related complications are present in patients with GCK-MODY, diet is sufficient as a therapeutic approach in most cases. This may significantly improve the patient's quality of life.",

        "Title": "    Mutation Spectrum of Common Deafness-Causing Genes in Patients with Non-Syndromic Deafness in the Xiamen Area, China",
        "Abstract": "    In China, approximately 30,000 babies are born with hearing impairment each year. However, the molecular factors causing congenital hearing impairment in the Xiamen area of Fujian province have not been evaluated. To provide accurate genetic testing and counseling in the Xiamen area, we investigated the molecular etiology of non-syndromic deafness in a deaf population from Xiamen. Unrelated students with hearing impairment (n = 155) who attended Xiamen Special Education School in Fujian Province were recruited for this study. Three common deafness-related genes, GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA, were analyzed using all-exon sequencing. GJB2 mutations were detected in 27.1% (42/155) of the entire cohort. The non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) hotspot mutations c.109G>A (p.V37I) and c.235delC were found in this population, whereas the Caucasian hotspot mutation c.35delG was not. The allelic frequency of the c.109G>A mutation was 9.03% (28/310), slightly higher than that of c.235delC (8.39%, 26/310), which is the most common GJB2 mutation in most areas of China. The allelic frequency of the c.109G>A mutation was significantly higher in this Xiamen's deaf population than that in previously reported cohorts (P = 0.00). The SLC26A4 mutations were found in 16.77% (26/155) of this cohort. The most common pathogenic allele was c.IVS7-2A>G (6.13%, 19/310), and the second most common was the c.1079C>T (p.A360V) mutation (1.94%, 6/310) which has rarely been reported as a hotspot mutation in other studies. The mutation rate of mtDNA12SrRNA in this group was 3.87% (6/155), all being the m.A1555G mutation. These findings show the specificity of the common deaf gene-mutation spectrum in this area. According to this study, there were specific hotspot mutations in Xiamen deaf patients. Comprehensive sequencing analysis of the three common deaf genes can help portray the mutation spectrum and develop optimal testing strategies for deaf patients in this area.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing impairment is among the most common congenital disorders; approximately half of the cases are caused by genetic factors. In China, many previous genetic screening studies have shown that GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA are the three most common causes of non-syndromic deafness, and the mutations in these three genes can explain 26.65-35.7% of the pathogenesis of Chinese non-syndromic hearing impairment. Mutations in GJB2 have been reported to be the most common molecular defect in the Chinese deaf population, with an almost 21% mutation detection rate; of these mutations, c.235delC is the most common in the Chinese deaf population. The most common mutation of SLC26A4 seen in the Chinese deaf population is c.IVS7-2A>G; its detection rate can be as high as 12.5%. The most common mutation of mtDNA12SrRNA is m.A1555G, the frequency of which was reported to be 3.43% in a Chinese deaf population.\n\n    China is a large country with the highest population in the world. Chinese people from different areas may have different genetic backgrounds due to geographical and language separation. Xiamen is a city in the South Fujian region in southern China, neighboring the Golden Gate Island of Taiwan. Because it is an island, Xiamen communicated with the mainland by boat and it was relatively isolated before the construction of Xiamen Gaoji Seawall in 1955. The most ancient Xiamen resident migrated from the Chinese Central Plains region due to the wars during the Chinese Shang, Tang, and Song Dynasties, and maintained their language (now called Hokkien or Southern Min) and traditional culture. The close-relative marriage rule can be traced back to ancient China, where intermarriages among individuals with the same surname or among clansmen were forbidden or not encouraged. However, the phenomenon of marriage among individuals who have the same language and culture prevailed. Until now, no systematic genetic analysis of deaf patients in Xiamen has been reported previously. To provide accurate genetic testing and counseling in the Xiamen area, we evaluated the molecular etiology of non-syndromic deafness in a deaf population from Xiamen Special Education School. In total, 155 patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss were recruited for this investigation. All exons in the open reading frames (ORF) of the GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA genes were sequenced and analyzed.",
        "Methods": "    In total, 155 unrelated patients with hearing impairment (152 students, three teachers) from Xiamen Special Education School in Fujian province were recruited for this study. The patient cohort consisted of 93 males and 62 females, 5-36 years old (13.40 years, on average): in terms of ethnicity, the cohort comprised 153 Han and two She. Hearing tests demonstrated that the level of hearing loss was severe to profound in all cases. There were 25 patients whose families had more than one other family member with a hearing impairment. No family had a consanguineous marriage except that one patient's parents were cousin.\n\n    The protocol for this investigation was performed with the approval of the ethics committees of the Chinese PLA General Hospital and Fujian Provincial Hospital. The notification of deafness gene detection was performed a half month prior. We provided the consent form and individual information questionnaire to patients and guardians who volunteered to participate in this detection study. We obtained informed consent from all participants; in the case of minors, consent was obtained from their parents/guardians on their behalf. All of the subjects or their guardians signed the informed consent forms prior to blood sampling. Questionnaires included basic information, including name, age, address, family history, health records of the mother during pregnancy, and a clinical history of the patient, such as infections, possible head or brain injury, and the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics. All subjects underwent hearing tests and medical examinations. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using a commercially available DNA extraction kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc., Shanghai, China).\n\n    The coding exons plus approximately 50-100 bp of the flanking intron regions of GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Sanger sequencing was used to determine the sequences in all patients. According to the manufacturer's manual, the results were analyzed using an ABI 3100 DNA sequencing machine (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) and the ABI 3100 Analysis Software (ver. 3.7 NT). Patients with monoallelic GJB2 coding region mutations were further tested for the GJB2 c.IVS1+1G>A mutation or defects in GJB2 exon 1 and its basal promoter. Data analysis was performed using SPSS20.0 software.",
        "Results": "    Fourteen variants were identified in this cohort. Seven of them were pathogenic including three frameshift deletions (c.235delC, c.176del16, c.299delAT), one frameshift insertion (c.512insAACG), and three missense mutations [c.109G>A(p.V37I), c.257C>G(p.T86R), c.187G>T(p.V63L)]. The mutant alleles of GJB2 accounted for 20.0% (62/310) of the total alleles in the 155 NSHL patients(Table 1). Unlike most areas of China, the most common mutation allele of GJB2 in Xiamen was not c.235delC but c.109G>A. The allele frequency of c.109G>A was 9.03% (28/310), followed by 8.39% (26/310) for c.235delC, 0.65% (2/310) for c.257C>G, 0.65% (2/310) for c.299delAT, 0.65% (2/310) for c.512insAAGG, 0.32% (1/310) for c.176del16, and 0.32% (1/310) for c.187G>A (Table 2). There were seven types of GJB2 polymorphisms: c.11G>A, c.34G>T, c.79G>A, c.341A>G, c.368C>A, c.571T>C, and c.608T>C. All of the variants were reported and discussed in previous studies.\n\n    There were 20 patients (12.9%) confirmed to have GJB2 deafness-causing mutations: 13 homozygotes (nine with the c.235delC allele and four with the c.109G>A allele) and seven compound heterozygotes. Twenty-two patients (14.2%) carried only one heterozygous pathogenic mutation: one with c.187G>T, three with c.235delC and eighteen with c.109G>A. Thus, the detection rate of GJB2 mutations in the patients was 27.1% (42/155) (Table 1).\n\n    Among the 24 patients carrying at least one c.109G>A allele, there were four homozygotes, one compound heterozygote with c.235delC, one compound heterozygote with 512insAACG, and 18 single heterozygotes. The second most common mutation of GJB2 in this group was c.235delC, with a mutation allele frequency of 8.39% (26/310): nine homozygotes, five compound heterozygotes, and three heterozygotes.\n\n    Twenty-two variants were identified in this cohort, including three novel variants (c.1167G>A, c.1738_1739delAA, and c.1764_1765insAGGAAAATA). Among the four splice site variants in this cohort, c.IVS7-2A>G and c.IVS16-6G>A are pathogenic because they affect canonical splice donor and acceptor nucleotide positions that had been previously identified; c.IVS11+47T>C was previously identified as a polymorphism, and c.IVS7-18T>C was considered a polymorphism in our laboratory, which will be analyzed further in the Discussion section. The three frameshift insertions [c.916_917insG (FS306, P329*), c.1692_1693insA (FS565, P573*), and c.1764_1765insAGGAAAATA (FS558)], two truncated mutations [c.2086C>T (p.Q696*) and c.1336C>T (p.Q446*)], and one frameshift deletion [c.1738_1739delAA (FS580, P606*)] were considered pathogenic due to a dramatic prematurely altered or truncated protein. Combining the prediction of SIFT and Polyphen-2 with the results of previous studies, the following 12 missense variants were analyzed in our cohort: c.1079C>T (p.A360V), c.2168A>G (p.H723R), c.754T>C (p.S252P), c.1229C>T (p.T410M), c.1472T>C (p.I491T), c.1595G>T (p.S532I), and c.2007C>G (p.D669E) were considered pathogenic mutations, and c.1790T>C (p.L597S) and c.147C>G (p.S49R) were deemed polymorphisms. c.2283A>G (p.T761T) and c.1167G>A (p.G389G, this study) were considered polymorphisms without amino acid sequence alteration after the nucleotide changed. c.2009T>C (p.V670A) still had unknown significance according to our data and prediction, which will be discussed later (Table 3).\n\n    There were 18 (11.61%) patients confirmed to be carrying two SLC26A4 pathogenic mutations: six homozygotes (5 c. IVS 7-2A>G and 1 c.1079C>T), twelve compound heterozygotes, and eight (5.16%) patients with one SLC26A4 pathogenic mutation. Thus, the detection rate of SLC26A4 mutations was 16.77% (26/155) in this patient cohort.\n\n    The most common mutation of SLC26A4 was c.IVS7-2A>G, with a 6.13% (19/310) allele frequency. Except for five homozygotes and one heterozygote of it, there were eight patients carrying c.IVS7-2A>G heterozygous mutations combined with the other mutations included three c.1079C>T, two c.2086C>T, one c.2168A>G, one c.1336C>T, and one c.2007C>G.\n\n    The mutation allele frequency was 1.61% (5/310) for c.1079C>T, 1.29% (4/310) for c.2168A>G, 0.97% (3/310) for c. ivs16-6G>A, 0.65% (2/310) for c.2086C>T and 0.32% (1/310) for each of the others (Table 4).\n\n    This variant has been proposed to exert a likely pathogenic effect according to the reported data (http://deafnessvariationdatabase.org/). According to the Fruitfly analysis tool (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html), a change in the splice donor sequence from T to C in intron 7 (c. IVS7-18T>C) of SLC26A4 is predicted to make no difference in splice site recognition by the splicing factor from 0.93 to 0.92 (when the score is reduced to less than 0.4, the mutation may affect the function of the original). We checked the previous records of our laboratory and found that four of 261 control subjects (1.53%) carried the single heterozygous c.IVS7-18T>C allele. Based on prediction analysis and our laboratory data, we concluded that this variation was a polymorphism.\n\n    This variant was not found in 1,668 EVAS patients from our laboratory before this study, and the mutation frequency of c.2009T>C in this Xiamen's cohort was 1.29% (2/155). We predicted the pathogenicity of this mutation by SIFT and Polyphen-2, and the results suggested \"tolerant,\" with a SIFT score of 0.05 and \"possibly damaging\" with a Polyphen-2 score of 0.873 by each. We made an alignment of the SLC26A4 amino acid sequence of six species, namely Homo sapiens (043511), Macaca mulatta (XP_001094049.1), Mus musculus (NP_035997.1), Rattus norvegicus (NP_062087.1), Bos taurus (XP_608706.3), and Sus scrofa (XP_003357559.1) (Fig 1), and the results suggested the evolutionary conservation of c.2009T>C. However, only two of 155 patients (1.29%) were found to carry the heterozygote of this variant in the present study; thus, a conclusion still cannot be reached.\n\n    Six patients (3.87%) carried a mtDNA12SrRNA mutation, all of which were the m.1555A>G homoplasmic mutation. Four patients had a clear history of aminoglycoside antibiotic use. Among them, one used gentamicin alone, one used streptomycin alone, one combined gentamicin and streptomycin, and one combined streptomycin and neomycin.",
        "Conclusion": "    In this study, the three most common deafness-associated genes were investigated by exon sequencing in a cohort of deaf patients recruited from Xiamen Special Education School. According to exon sequencing of GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA, almost half of the deaf cases appeared to have a genetic etiology. Our data revealed special hotspots and spectra of mutations in the Xiamen deaf population, and this information will be helpful in designing the protocol for genetic testing for deafness and achieving an accurate molecular diagnosis in the Xiamen area.",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, GJB2 mutations were detected in 27.1% (42/155) of all patients, with 12.9% (20/155) having two pathogenic mutations and 14.2% (22/155) having only one mutant allele. c.109G>A (p.V37I) and c.235delC were the hotspot mutations in the non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) patients in the Xiamen area, whereas the Caucasian hotspot mutation c.35delG was not detected. Unlike other areas of China, c.235delC (8.39%) was not the most common GJB2 mutation, but rather c.109G>A, the allelic mutation frequency of which was 9.03% (28/310), indicating some features of GJB2 mutations in this area.\n\n    In East Asians, the c.109G>A (p.V37I) mutation is common: the frequency of this allele in the deaf population had been reported to be 4.3% in Thailand, 0.6% in Korea, 1.0% in Japan and 4.2%(175/4162) in China. Li reported that the frequency of c.109G>A mutation in newborns was 6.2% in Shanghai, China. Given that some individuals with normal hearing also carry the homozygous c.109G>A mutation, there has been much controversy concerning its significance. Recent research has shown that the hearing phenotypes of homozygous c.109G>A patients could be diverse in Chinese Han, and such patients may even show severe to profound hearing loss. In our group, the four patients with the homozygous c.109G>A mutation had severe-to-profound hearing loss, the severity of which was similar to that of others in this cohort. In our study, the allele frequency of the c.109G>A mutation was 9.03% (28/310). Compared with the former data (4.2%, 175/4126) from the large Chinese deaf population evaluated by Dai, the frequency of the c.109G>A mutation in Xiamen was remarkably higher than that obtained in Dai's results (P = 0.00). Because the c.109G>A mutation has been found in many countries in Southeast Asia, Oceania, East Asia, North Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, the complexity of its origin and migration should be considered. Furthermore, it will be worthwhile to study the founder effect and migration route in China based upon the large-sized samples from representative areas of China that could explain the significant differences in the frequency of c.109G>A among the studies of different Chinese deaf populations.\n\n    In East and Southeast Asia, c.235delC has been reported as the most common mutation acting as a frameshift mutation causing premature protein termination in hearing impaired patients, while lower frequencies were reported in Europe and Oceania. In an earlier nationwide study by our group, Dai analyzed the GJB2 mutation of 2063 unrelated NSHL students from 23 different regions of China, the c.235delC mutation allele frequency was 12.34% (509/4,126). Compared with the 8.39% (26/310) c.235delC mutation allele frequency in the Xiamen area, the difference in the c.235delC mutation allele frequency was not significant (P = 0.064), reflecting a certain consistency of the c.235delC frequency between the Xiamen and entire nation. The shift in the c.235delC mutation from the most common to the second most common was a feature of the Xiamen deaf population that might indicate that, among the Xiamen aboriginals, the carrying rate of c.235delC was likely lower than the carrying rate of c.109G>A in Xiamen.\n\n    The c.512insAACG mutation was first reported by Dai; it is a frameshift mutation with a mutation allele frequency of 0.58% (12/2,063) in a Chinese population. In our group, two patients were c.512insAACG compound heterozygotes with c.235delC and c.109G>A, respectively, resulting in a 0.65% (2/310) mutation allele frequency.\n\n    Pendrin, a 780-amino acid protein, functions as a transmembrane anion exchanger and is encoded by SLC26A4. Over 100 mutations in the SLC26A4 (PDS) gene are involved in both Pendred syndrome (PS) and NSHL (DFNB4), showing specific differences among racial backgrounds. The mutation hot spots are p.T416P and c.IVS8+1G>A in Northern Europe, versus p.H723R and c. IVS7-2A>G in South Korea and p.H723R in Japan. It was reported by Dai that the most common Chinese SLC26A4 mutation is c.IVS7-2A>G, the mutation allele frequency reported in that study was 8.65% (566/6542). In our study, whole exons of SLC26A4 were sequenced, and the most common mutation in our Xiamen patient cohort was also c.IVS7-2A>G, the mutation allele frequency was 6.13% (19/310). The frequencies of c.IVS7-2A>G found in Xiamen's deaf population and in the large Chinese deaf population evaluated by Dai are not significantly different (P = 0.12).\n\n    c.1079C>T (p.A360V), the second most common mutation of SLC26A4 in the Xiamen patient cohort, was first reported in Taiwan by Lai et al. in 2007, with two compound heterozygous missense mutations involving a residue in a highly conserved domain of the eighth transmembrane region. One of the patients in Taiwan with a compound heterozygous mutation of c.1079C>T and c.IVS7-2A>G was positive for both the perchlorate discharge test (PDT) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO Abs), suggestive of Pendred's syndrome. This mutation has rarely been reported in other studies. In our group, there was one homozygous mutation and three compound heterozygous mutations of c.1079C>T and c.IVS7-2A>G, but none of the patients had thyroid dysfunction. The four patients were aged 17, 11, 15, and 18 years, respectively, and the onset ages of deafness were 2, 3, 2, and 3.4 years, respectively. Compared with the previous studies by Dai and Guo in China, c.1079C>T was not found in 647(135+514) patients and 167(50+117) normal control subjects. However, one study by Yuan in China found only one heterozygote in their large cohort of 2,352 patients and none in the normal control group. The phenomenon of c.1079C>T mostly being found in Xiamen and Taiwan, but very rarely occurring in other areas, suggested the nature of the distribution of this mutation. Previous investigations of multiple regions of China did not include the Southern Fujian people, whose dialect is Hokkien (Southern Min). Hokkien is one of the eight main Chinese dialects that are popularly spoken in Taiwan and Xiamen. Historically, a proportion of Taiwan's population migrated from southern China (mostly from Xiamen and Quanzhou). This may partly explain why c.1079C>T has mostly been found in Xiamen and Taiwan; however, more samples from such areas will be needed to analyze the origin and migration of c.1079C>T.\n\n    c.2168A>G (p.H723R) is a common mutation in Japanese and Korean populations, with mutation allele frequencies of 4.1% and 10.34%, respectively. The c.2168A>G allele frequency was reported to be 1.51%(71/4704)in China. In our report, the mutation allele frequency was 1.29% in the Xiamen area. The allele frequency of c.2168A>G in this study is consistent with the allele frequency of this mutation in Yuan's study. Our study suggested differences in the c.2168A>G frequency among countries and areas. Haplotype analyses in previous studies confirmed that c.2168A>G was a founder mutation in Japan, Korea and China, but the geographical environment and migration route may suggest explanations for the significant gradient distribution of c.2168A>G in these three East Asian countries.\n\n    Associated with aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced deafness, the mtDNA12SrRNA mutation shows variation by racial and geographic origins in populations with non-syndromic hearing loss, with a frequency of 0.6-2.5% in Caucasians, 2.4% in Danes, 1.8% in Turks, 0.7% in Germans, 1.8% in Hungarians, and 2.4% in Poles. It also showed frequencies of 3% and 5.3% in Japanese and Indonesian deaf populations, respectively. The m.1555A>G mutation is a common mutation of the mitochondrial 12SrRNA gene, shown to be the third most common mutation in China with a frequency of 3.43%. In this study, the 3.87% (6/155) frequency of m.A1555G was close to that observed by Dai (3.43%).",

        "Title": "    CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation enhances chromosome alignment and the mitotic checkpoint",
        "Abstract": "    The state of CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation in response to spindle microtubule capture regulates kinetochore function and accurate chromosome segregation.\n\n    How the state of spindle microtubule capture at the kinetochore is translated into mitotic checkpoint signaling remains largely unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate that the kinetochore-associated mitotic kinase BubR1 phosphorylates itself in human cells and that this autophosphorylation is dependent on its binding partner, the kinetochore motor CENP-E. This CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation at unattached kinetochores is important for a full-strength mitotic checkpoint to prevent single chromosome loss. Replacing endogenous BubR1 with a nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant, as well as depletion of CENP-E, the BubR1 kinase activator, results in metaphase chromosome misalignment and a decrease of Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at kinetochores. Furthermore, expressing a phosphomimetic BubR1 mutant substantially reduces the incidence of polar chromosomes in CENP-E-depleted cells. Thus, the state of CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation in response to spindle microtubule capture by CENP-E is important for kinetochore function in achieving accurate chromosome segregation.",
        "Introduction": "    During mitosis, the kinetochore, the protein complex assembled at each centromere on each chromosome, serves as the attachment site for spindle microtubules and powers chromosome movement along the mitotic spindle. Unattached kinetochores generate the \"waiting signal\" for the mitotic checkpoint (also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint), which delays anaphase onset before successful attachment of every chromosome to microtubules of the spindle. Errors in this process cause aneuploidy, which early in development leads to lethal development defects and later is the hallmark of human tumor progression.\n\n    BubR1, an essential mitotic checkpoint kinase, also plays an important role in kinetochore-microtubule attachment and metaphase chromosome alignment. BubR1 has been shown to be phosphorylated by several other mitotic kinases, and these phosphorylations are important for BubR1 functions in kinetochore-microtubule attachment as well as the mitotic checkpoint. However, how BubR1's own kinase activity is involved in its kinetochore functions is largely unknown. Although BubR1 kinase activity is below a detectable level in vitro with purified components, its autophosphorylation activity is significantly increased upon either prephosphorylation by Cdk1 and Plx1 or addition of CENP-E, a kinetochore-associated microtubule motor protein and a BubR1 binding partner. Furthermore, microtubule capture by CENP-E can silence BubR1 kinase activity in a ternary complex of BubR1-CENP-E-microtubules. The BubR1 kinase activity has been shown to be important for the mitotic checkpoint in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and human cells. Replacing endogenous BubR1 with a kinase-inactive (kinase dead [KD]) BubR1 in Xenopus egg extracts, Drosophila melanogaster, and human cells all results in metaphase spindles with misaligned chromosomes, indicating that BubR1 kinase activity also directly modulates microtubule capture at the kinetochore.\n\n    CENP-E, the activator of BubR1 kinase, is a kinetochore-associated kinesin motor protein. Interference with CENP-E function using anti-CENP-E antibody injection or CENP-E depletion by antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNAs results in an obvious but incomplete metaphase plate with variable numbers of polar chromosomes. Individual cells from cultured CENP-E-null embryos also show one or more misaligned chromosomes. Furthermore, the mitotic checkpoint cannot be activated or maintained in Xenopus egg extracts depleted of CENP-E, probably because of the loss of Mad1-Mad2 from unattached kinetochores. Cells without CENP-E in vitro and in vivo also have reduced levels of Mad1-Mad2 associated with unattached kinetochores and produce premature anaphase onset with one or a few polar chromosomes, resulting in an increase of aneuploidy. These results indicate that the mitotic checkpoint cannot be maintained in the absence of CENP-E when there are only one or a few unattached kinetochores. Upon identifying a CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation site using purified components, we now show that BubR1 kinase activity and its autophosphorylation are important for kinetochore function in achieving accurate chromosome segregation to prevent single chromosome loss in human cells.",
        "Methods": "    Recombinant full-length Xenopus BubR1 was expressed in Escherichia coli with a His tag at the N terminus and purified over an Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocols. Recombinant Xenopus CENP-E protein was produced as previously described. In summary, the full-length CENP-E was expressed in Hi5 insect cells using the expression system (Bac-to-Bac; Gibco/Life Technologies). The recombinant bacmids were produced as directed by the manufacturer. The CENP-E protein was then purified from whole-cell extracts upon being frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed, through a two-step ion-exchange chromatography, a HiTrap SP Sepharose ion-exchange column, and a Source 15Q column. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient from 100 mM to 1 M KCl in ion-exchange chromatography buffer (10 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, and 50 microM ATP).\n\n    Purified BubR1 were incubated with or without CENP-E at room temperature for 30 min with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 200 microM ATP. BubR1 from both reactions were recovered from the SDS-PAGE. The gel bands were subjected to liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis.\n\n    T98G cells were cultured in DME with 10% FBS at 37 C in 5% CO2. BubR1 siRNA were purchased from QIAGEN. Transfection was performed using HiPerFect (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In all chromosome alignment analyses, 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with monastrol to accumulate mitotic cells for 4 h and released into MG132 medium for 1 h. Cells were then fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. Nocodazole, monastrol, and MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, 100 microM, and 10 microM, respectively, or as indicated in figures and/or figure legends.\n\n    A synthesized phosphorylated peptide, KPNPED-pT-CDFARAAR-amide, was used to raise BubR1 pT608 antibodies in rabbits, and the sera were affinity purified (YenZym Antibodies, LLC). The pS55-Hec1 and Mad2 antibodies are provided by J. DeLuca (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO) and G. Kops (The University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands), respectively. Other antibodies were obtained from Abcam.\n\n    For indirect immunofluorescence, cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were washed once with microtubule-stabilizing buffer (MTSB; 100 mM Pipes, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, and 30% of glycerol), extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in MTSB for 1 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in MTSB or cold methanol (-20 C) for 10 min, and blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 4% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Coverslips were subjected to primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and then to FITC or Rhodamine secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Cover glasses were mounted with antifade reagent with DAPI (ProLong Gold; Molecular Probes). Image acquisition and data analysis were performed at room temperature using an inverted microscope (IX81; Olympus) with a 60x, NA 1.42 Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective lens (Olympus), a monochrome charge-coupled device camera (Sensicam QE; Cooke Corporation), and the SlideBook software package (Olympus). All images in each experiment were collected on the same day using identical exposure times and were deconvolved and presented as stacked images. Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence was performed with the SlideBook software. For quantification of kinetochore intensities, a mask was created with a circular region covering each kinetochore, and the mean pixel intensities were obtained within the mask. For live-cell imaging, HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-EYFP were plated onto 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation). Images were acquired using a 40x, NA 0.6 dry objective lens every 3 or 5 min with a 37 C, 5% CO2 chamber and processed using SlideBook software. All statistical significance of quantification experiments was verified by Student's t test using Excel software (Microsoft).\n\n    Fig. S1 shows that BubR1 autophosphorylation at the kinetochores is sensitive to spindle microtubule capture. Fig. S2 demonstrates that the kinetochore-associated BubR1 autophosphorylation signals are dependent on CENP-E, the BubR1 kinase activator. Fig. S3 indicates that BubR1 kinase has substrates other than the BubR1T608 autophosphorylation site that are important for accurate chromosome segregation. Fig. S4 shows the reduction of the signal levels of kinetochore-associated Mad1 in nocodazole-treated cells in which the endogenous BubR1 is replaced by a nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant. Fig. S5 demonstrates that CENP-E depletion, but not BubR1 depletion, causes a decrease of Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at kinetochores.

        "Results": "    As we showed before, purified recombinant Xenopus BubR1 was able to phosphorylate itself in vitro but only in the presence of its binding partner, CENP-E (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). By mass spectrometry (MS), we subsequently identified a single CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation site, Thr593 (Thr608 in human BubR1), which lies just adjacent to the kinase domain and is conserved through frog to human (Fig. 1 B).\n\n    We generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated Thr608 (pAb-T608) against human BubR1. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with this phosphoantibody revealed a clear increase in phosphorylation of this site during mitosis with a band corresponding to the size of human BubR1 (Fig. S1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Immunoreactivity with the pAb-T608 was eliminated either by treating the lysates with lambda protein phosphatase (Fig. S1 A, compare lanes 3 and 4) or by adsorption of the antibody with the phosphopeptide but not with the nonphosphopeptide (Fig. S1 B). More importantly, indirect immunofluorescence analysis in human T98G cells revealed that the kinetochore staining of pAb-T608 was substantially reduced in cells transfected with BubR1 siRNA (Fig. 1, compare C and D). Expressing an siRNA-resistant mCherry-tagged wild-type BubR1, but not a nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant, restored pAb-T608 signals at the kinetochore (Fig. 1, compare E and F). Furthermore, replacing endogenous BubR1 with a kinase-inactive (KD) point mutant (K795A) did not display kinetochore-associated pAb-T608 signals even with an overexposed time compared with cells with wild-type BubR1 (Fig. 1 G). Collectively, these results strongly demonstrate that BubR1 is a kinase in human cells and phosphorylates itself at the kinetochore.\n\n    We further evaluated the BubR1 autophosphorylation at kinetochores during mitotic progression using the BubR1 pAb-T608 phosphoantibody. Cells in prometaphase showed BubR1 autophosphorylation signals at the kinetochores, whereas cells in metaphase displayed low levels of pAb-T608 signals at all aligned kinetochores (Fig. S1 C). Thus, BubR1 autophosphorylation is sensitive to kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Treatment with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules indeed resulted in a relatively uniformly high level of BubR1 autophosphorylation on all unattached kinetochores (Fig. S1 C).\n\n    BubR1 kinase activity and its autophosphorylation were substantially increased in the presence of its binding partner, the kinetochore motor CENP-E, in vitro (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Decreased levels of CENP-E after siRNA to CENP-E also reduced levels of BubR1 autophosphorylation on unattached kinetochores (Fig. S2, A-D). In contrast, the antibody that detects BubR1 regardless of its autophosphorylation state did not display substantial change in signal levels at kinetochores in CENP-E-depleted cells (Fig. S2, E-H). These results suggest that BubR1 kinase activity and its autophosphorylation, but not BubR1 itself, at the kinetochore in human cells depend on its interaction with CENP-E.\n\n    To determine whether the autophosphorylation is important for BubR1 functions in mitosis, we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert the autophosphorylatable residue to an amino acid mimicking constitutive phosphorylation (glutamic acid [E]) and to a nonphosphorylatable amino acid (alanine [A]). The endogenous BubR1 expression level in T98G cells can be reduced by an siRNA duplex targeted to a region of human BubR1, and the BubR1 expression can be restored with a cotransfected BubR1 gene mutated in three silent base positions within the site of action of the siRNA. Using this approach, we replaced endogenous BubR1 with mCherry-tagged siRNA-resistant wild-type BubR1 or BubR1 phosphorylation mutants to a similar expression level in human cells (Fig. 2 A).\n\n    Cells with BubR1 replaced by either type of mutants at the autophosphorylation site were assessed by live-cell imaging in unperturbed mitoses; each yielded overall time spent in mitosis was comparable to that of cells expressing wild-type BubR1 (Fig. 2, B and C). Although a majority of the cells expressing wild-type BubR1 (84%) progressed through normal mitosis with accurate chromosome segregation (Fig. 2, B and C), >75% of the cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant had misaligned (polar) chromosomes, which subsequently missegregated during anaphase (Fig. 2, B-D). Notably, cells that had many misaligned chromosomes spent a much longer time in mitosis. The majority of the cells expressing the phosphomimetic BubR1T608E mutant (86%) had full congression without any obvious misaligned chromosomes; however, 40% of them exhibited unequal chromosome segregation with chromosome bridges during anaphase (Fig. 2, B, C, and E). These results demonstrate that CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation is essential for both metaphase chromosome alignment and a full-strength mitotic checkpoint to prevent single chromosome loss.\n\n    To better understand the role of BubR1 kinase activity in chromosome segregation, we replaced endogenous BubR1 with a BubR1T608E-K795A double mutant, which is constitutively phosphorylated at the autophosphorylation site but lacks the kinase activity. Live-cell imaging analysis revealed that cells expressing this BubR1 double mutant exited mitosis with unaligned chromosomes more frequently than those expressing the BubR1T608E single mutant do (Fig. S3). Furthermore, in contrast to cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable or phosphomimetic BubR1 single mutant, cells expressing the BubR1T608E-K795A double mutant spent less time in mitosis in comparison to cells expressing wild-type BubR1 (Fig. S3 B). These results indicate that BubR1 kinase has other substrates that are important for achieving accurate chromosome segregation, further supporting a role of BubR1 kinase in mitosis.\n\n    The basic plan of the mitotic checkpoint signaling cascade is established. Before spindle microtubule capture, the Mad1-Mad2 complex is targeted to unattached kinetochores, in which additional Mad2 is recruited and converted into a rapidly released, inhibitory form, including possible assembly of complexes with other checkpoint proteins. To test whether BubR1 autophosphorylation at unattached kinetochores affects recruitment of Mad1 and Mad2, quantitative immunofluorescence was used to determine the levels of kinetochore-bound Mad1 and Mad2 upon treatment with nocodazole, which induces spindle microtubule disassembly. Relative to cells expressing wild-type BubR1 or the phosphomimetic BubR1 mutant, cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant had diminished levels of Mad1 on unattached kinetochores (58.4%; Fig. S4). Furthermore, cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant recruited even lower levels of Mad2 (17.3%) on unattached kinetochores compared with cells expressing wild-type BubR1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the nonphosphorylated form of BubR1 reduces Mad1-Mad2 recruitment at the kinetochore.\n\n    Kinetochore levels of Mad2 were also determined in the absence of the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole. Mad2 signals at metaphase kinetochores were largely undetectable in cells expressing wild-type BubR1 as well as the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A and the phosphomimetic BubR1T608E mutants (Fig. 3 C). However, kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes in cells expressing wild-type BubR1 or the phosphomimetic BubR1T608E mutant had strong Mad2 signals, whereas the levels of kinetochore-associated Mad2 signals on polar chromosomes were substantially diminished in cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant (Fig. 3 C).\n\n    Cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant enter anaphase with a few unaligned chromosomes and have reduced levels of Mad1-Mad2 on unattached kinetochores, suggesting a weakened mitotic checkpoint. We therefore compared the duration of the mitotic arrest in cells expressing either wild-type BubR1 or the BubR1T608A mutant by treating them with 0.33 and 3.3 microM nocodazole. As expected, we observed a prolonged mitotic arrest (>10 h) in cells expressing wild-type BubR1 at both concentrations (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, the duration of the mitotic arrest (359 +- 46 min) for cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant in the presence of high concentrations of nocodazole (3.3 microM) decreased significantly in comparison to cells expressing wild-type BubR1 (Fig. 3 D). Furthermore, cells expressing the BubR1T608A mutant left mitosis more rapidly (125 +- 36 min) at low concentrations of nocodazole (0.33 microM) than at high nocodazole concentrations (3.3 microM), though the duration of mitosis in those cells was still longer than cells without BubR1 (41 +- 10 min; Fig. 3 D). Collectively, these results support the notion that inhibition of BubR1 autophosphorylation results in a weakened mitotic checkpoint.\n\n    Though it is clear that BubR1 plays an important role in metaphase chromosome alignment, the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. To specifically test for effects of BubR1 autophosphorylation on chromosome alignment, we treated cells with monastrol and MG132 for 4 h to accumulate mitotic cells and then released them into MG132 alone for 1 h (to prevent premature anaphase onset; Fig. 4 A). Consistent with an earlier study, BubR1 siRNA resulted in only 30% of cells with fully aligned chromosomes, a decrease from 67% for cells with mismatch siRNA (Fig. 4, B and C). The siRNA-resistant wild-type BubR1 was able to effectively rescue the metaphase chromosome alignment defect (Fig. 4, B and C). Although 64% of cells expressing the phosphomimetic BubR1T608E mutant had all chromosomes fully aligned, only 25% of cells with the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant achieved metaphase chromosome alignment (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, replacing endogenous BubR1 with a kinase-inactive (KD) BubR1 mutant phenocopied the nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant, which produced bipolar spindles with misaligned chromosomes (Fig. 4, B and C). These results are consistent with a role of BubR1 kinase activity and its autophosphorylation in metaphase chromosome alignment.\n\n    In comparison to wild-type BubR1, the relative levels of the nonphosphorylatable or phosphomimetic mutants on unaligned (polar) kinetochores and aligned kinetochores were not significantly altered, though, as expected, the levels of all three BubR1 proteins on aligned kinetochores were reduced (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the autophosphorylation state of BubR1 at kinetochores is important in regulating metaphase chromosome alignment.\n\n    The high frequency of syntelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments even after cold treatment in cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant (Fig. S5 A) prompted us to investigate the Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation in these cells. Aurora B has been shown to function in destabilizing the improperly attached kinetochore microtubules by phosphorylating kinetochore-associated microtubule interactors, such as the KMN network (e.g., Ndc80) and the formin mDia3, to reduce their affinities to microtubules in the absence of tension. We first examined the levels of phosphorylated Hec1 (pS55-Hec1), a component of the Ndc80 complex and a major Aurora B substrate in attachment error correction, in nocodazole-treated cells. This revealed low levels of kinetochore-associated pS55-Hec1 signals in cells in which endogenous BubR1 was replaced by the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant or the kinase-inactive (KD) mutant but not by the wild-type BubR1 or the phosphomimetic BubR1T608E mutant (Fig. 5, A and B). The kinetochore localization of Hec1 itself was obviously not affected in those cells (Fig. 5 C). Next, we examined the levels of phosphorylated pS55-Hec1 signals in untreated cells with both aligned and unaligned chromosomes. In agreement with the results obtained in cells treated with nocodazole, the levels of pS55-Hec1 signals on unattached kinetochores in cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant were also diminished in comparison to those in cells expressing wild-type BubR1 or the phosphomimetic mutant (Fig. S5 B). In addition, the levels of Aurora B phosphorylation of Hec1 at the S55 site on aligned kinetochores were diminished in all cells expressing any of the three BubR1 proteins (Fig. S5 B). Thus, our results support the hypothesis that the nonphosphorylated form of BubR1 is able to reduce Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at kinetochores.\n\n    The effects of the nonphosphorylatable BubR1T608A mutant on the Hec1 phosphorylation by Aurora B at the kinetochore are surprising, given that BubR1 depletion has been shown to increase Aurora B-mediated CENP-A phosphorylation at kinetochores. Thus, we tested the effects of BubR1 depletion on Hec1 phosphorylation at the S55 site by Aurora B. In contrast to the reduced kinetochore signals of pS55-Hec1 in cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant, the levels of pS55-Hec1 signals at kinetochores in BubR1-depleted cells increased or at least remained similar (Fig. S5 C). Therefore, the state of BubR1 autophosphorylation, not the mere presence of BubR1, is important for the regulation of Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at the kinetochore.\n\n    BubR1 autophosphorylation depends on CENP-E, the kinetochore-associated motor and the activator of BubR1 kinase, in vitro (Fig. 1 A) and at the kinetochores in human cells (Fig. S2). Depletion of CENP-E resulted in metaphase chromosome misalignment with polar chromosomes, which phenocopies the expression of the BubR1 nonphosphorylatable mutant as well as the kinase-inactive (KD) BubR1 mutant (Fig. 4). Therefore, we next tested whether a decreased level of CENP-E expression upon treatment of CENP-E siRNA can also cause reduced levels of Ndc80 phosphorylation by Aurora B at kinetochores in human cells. We indeed observed substantially decreased levels of kinetochore-associated pS55-Hec1 signals in CENP-E-depleted cells (Fig. S5 D), which is consistent with our hypothesis that the Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation is reduced at kinetochores with a nonphosphorylated form of BubR1.\n\n    Expressing the nonphosphorylated BubR1 mutant or depletion of CENP-E results in reduced levels of Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at kinetochores, leading to attachment errors. We next tested whether expressing the constitutively phosphorylated BubR1T608E mutant could correct chromosome misattachments in the absence of CENP-E. Cells expressing H2B-EYFP were treated with monastrol (and MG132 to prevent premature anaphase onset) to produce large amounts of syntelic and monotelic attachments. Upon release into MG132 medium alone, cells were followed by time-lapse microscopic analysis (Fig. 6 A). Control cells with wild-type CENP-E were able to position all chromosomes at the metaphase plate (Fig. 6 B), whereas CENP-E-depleted cells (11 out of 11) had persistent polar chromosomes (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, although it took a much longer time, a majority of the CENP-E-depleted cells (9 out of 10) expressing the phosphomimetic BubR1T608E mutant were able to align all chromosomes at the metaphase plate in the absence of CENP-E (Fig. 6 D).\n\n    To further confirm that attachment errors are able to be corrected in CENP-E-depleted cells expressing the phosphomimetic BubR1 mutant, we quantified our results in fixed cells upon indirect immunofluorescence. Compared with control cells, depletion of CENP-E produced polar chromosomes in 82% of cells. In contrast, 70% of CENP-E-depleted cells expressing the BubR1T608E mutant did not show any obvious polar chromosomes and had a complete metaphase plate (Fig. 6, E-I). These results clearly suggest that CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation regulates Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at kinetochores in response to spindle microtubule capture.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Although the yeast homologue of BubR1, Mad3, does not harbor a kinase domain, several lines of evidence in Drosophila, Xenopus egg extracts, and human cells support a role of BubR1 kinase activity in metaphase chromosome alignment and/or the mitotic checkpoint. However, this role has been challenged by reports that replacing endogenous BubR1 with a kinase-inactive BubR1 mutant or a BubR1 mutant without the kinase domain is still able to achieve accurate chromosome segregation in unperturbed mitoses. Furthermore, even a cytosolic murine BubR1 fragment (amino acids 1-386) without the Bub3-binding domain (essential for BubR1 kinetochore localization) and the kinase domain has been shown to be able to support metaphase chromosome alignment, the mitotic checkpoint, and cell survival. Adding to these is the undetectable kinase activity of purified recombinant BubR1 alone in vitro as well as the lack of substrates. The disparity of those results could be attributed to inefficient knockdown or depletion of endogenous BubR1 or different experimental approaches, as well as different systems, to examine subtle phenotypic differences.\n\n    In this study, we have identified a CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation site using purified components and MS. This site has also been identified in human cells using systematic phosphorylation analysis of mitotic protein complexes. Using a specific phosphoantibody against this site, we show that kinetochore-associated signals are eliminated by BubR1 depletion (siRNA) in mitotic cells. More importantly, the kinetochore-associated signals are restored only by expressing the siRNA-resistant wild-type BubR1 but not a BubR1 kinase-inactive (KD) point mutant (Fig. 1). To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence to support the kinase activity of BubR1 in human cells. Furthermore, the kinetochore-associated BubR1 autophosphorylation signals in cells also depend on the presence of CENP-E (Fig. S2), just as in the previous results that CENP-E can stimulate BubR1 kinase activity in vitro and in Xenopus egg extracts.\n\n    Live-cell imaging analysis has revealed that BubR1 autophosphorylation is not only important for metaphase chromosome alignment (for details see next Discussion section) but also a full-strength mitotic checkpoint. Cells harboring the nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant spend a similar time in mitosis to that of cells having wild-type BubR1, suggesting that BubR1 autophosphorylation is not required for mitotic timing and the basic mitotic checkpoint strength when there are lots of unattached kinetochores in a short time frame. However, a majority of those cells with the nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant initiate anaphase onset with polar chromosomes (Fig. 2), phenocopying what has been shown in cells without CENP-E function. Cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant also have a shorter duration of mitotic arrest induced by nocodazole in comparison with cells having wild-type BubR1 (Fig. 3 D). Furthermore, similar to what has been shown in the absence of CENP-E, unattached kinetochores in cells expressing the nonphosphorylatable BubR1 mutant have reduced levels of checkpoint components Mad1 and Mad2 (Fig. 3, A-C; and Fig. S4). Therefore, the CENP-E-dependent BubR1 kinase activity and BubR1 autophosphorylation are essential for a full-strength mitotic checkpoint to prevent chromosome missegregation when there are only one or a few unattached kinetochores (Fig. 7 A). A study using BubR1 conditional knockout cells and BubR1 domain mutants has suggested that a prolonged mitotic checkpoint signaling requires BubR1 kinase activity at kinetochores. The CENP-E-dependent BubR1 kinase activity is also important for the mitotic checkpoint in Xenopus egg extracts, a system known to produce a weak mitotic checkpoint signal to the extent that >9,000 sperm head nuclei (haploid without sister kinetochores)/microliter are needed to activate the checkpoint.\n\n    Although the crystal structure of BubR1 kinase has not been resolved, superposition of a 3D model structure of BubR1 kinase generated by comparative modeling using the known Bub1 kinase as a template has suggested that these two kinases have very similar structures. One of the particularly intriguing features is the interaction of the N-terminal extension with the kinase domain, similar to what has been shown for the activation of Cdks by cyclins. The interaction between BubR1 and CENP-E and the subsequent BubR1 autophosphorylation could cause a structural change of BubR1 and, therefore, influence the functional roles of BubR1 at the kinetochore.\n\n    The current spatial separation model suggests that centromere tension produces spatial separation of Aurora B from the kinetochore substrates, subsequently reduces their phosphorylation, and therefore, stabilizes kinetochore-microtubule interactions. KNL1- and CENP-E-dependent PP1 recruitment at the outer kinetochore has also been suggested to reverse Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of the core microtubule-binding proteins (e.g., the Ndc80 complex) for stable microtubule capture by chromosomes. Here, our findings support another mechanism involved in reducing Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at attached kinetochores to stabilize microtubule attachment (Fig. 7 A). CENP-E-dependent activation of BubR1 is sensitive to the kinetochore attachment state, occurring only on unattached kinetochores. The capture of spindle microtubules by kinetochore-associated motor CENP-E silences BubR1 kinase activity. Therefore, the nonphosphorylated form of BubR1 residing on aligned kinetochores is able to reduce Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation through an unknown mechanism, leading to subsequent stable attachment between kinetochores and dynamic spindle microtubule ends.\n\n    Cells without CENP-E, the BubR1 kinase activator, cannot correct attachment errors upon release from monastrol with large amounts of syntelic attachments caused by the reduced levels of Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation in the absence of CENP-E-dependent BubR1 autophosphorylation, whereas expression of a phosphomimetic BubR1 mutant is able to largely rescue the phenotypes (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 B). However, it takes a much longer time for CENP-E-depleted cells expressing the phosphomimetic BubR1 mutant to align all chromosomes at the metaphase plate, and a quarter of the cells remain to have polar chromosomes. This could be attributed to two possibilities. First, the levels of Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation at the kinetochores are influenced by the balance of the phosphomimetic BubR1 mutant and the endogenous nonphosphorylated form of BubR1 in the absence of CENP-E to achieve correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment. And second, CENP-E could play an important role in achieving metaphase chromosome alignment. CENP-E has been proposed to stabilize microtubule capture at kinetochores because most CENP-E-free aligned kinetochores bound only half the normal number of microtubules, and polar chromosomes have no obvious attached microtubules in primary mouse fibroblasts. It has also been proposed that congression of polar chromosomes to the metaphase plate can be powered by the processive, plus end-directed kinetochore motor CENP-E alongside kinetochore fibers attached to other already bioriented chromosomes.",

        "Title": "    Light and electron microscopy characteristics of the muscle of patients with SURF1 gene mutations associated with Leigh disease",
        "Abstract": "    Leigh syndrome (LS) is characterised by almost identical brain changes despite considerable causal heterogeneity. SURF1 gene mutations are among the most frequent causes of LS. Although deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a typical feature of the muscle in SURF1-deficient LS, other abnormalities have been rarely described. The aim of the present work is to assess the skeletal muscle morphology coexisting with SURF1 mutations from our own research and in the literature.\n\n    Muscle samples from 21 patients who fulfilled the criteria of LS and SURF1 mutations (14 homozygotes and 7 heterozygotes of c.841delCT) were examined by light and electron microscopy.\n\n    Diffuse decreased activity or total deficit of COX was revealed histochemically in all examined muscles. No ragged red fibres (RRFs) were seen. Lipid accumulation and fibre size variability were found in 14 and 9 specimens, respectively. Ultrastructural assessment showed several mitochondrial abnormalities, lipid deposits, myofibrillar disorganisation and other minor changes. In five cases no ultrastructural changes were found. Apart from slight correlation between lipid accumulation shown by histochemical and ultrastructural techniques, no other correlations were revealed between parameters investigated, especially between severity of morphological changes and the patient's age at the biopsy.\n\n    Histological and histochemical features of muscle of genetically homogenous SURF1-deficient LS were reproducible in detection of COX deficit. Minor muscle changes were not commonly present. Also, ultrastructural abnormalities were not a consistent feature. It should be emphasised that SURF1-deficient muscle assessed in the light and electron microscopy panel may be interpreted as normal if COX staining is not employed.",
        "Introduction": "    Leigh syndrome (LS), first described in 1951, is a severe neurodegenerative disease with characteristic neuropathological lesions located mainly in the basal ganglia, brain stem and sometimes other structures of central nervous system. Since the first description, hundreds of patients with LS-type brain changes have been reported. Various respiratory chain dysfunctions and/or the presence of different mitochondrial DNA mutations have been considered characteristic for all LS patients.\n\n    The SURF1 gene discovered in 1998 is the first nuclear gene for which the association of its mutations with deficiency of respiratory chain complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase (COX)) has been confirmed in humans. The SURF1 mutations were found invariably and almost exclusively in patients with generalised COX-deficit coexistent with LS features. Nearly 60 such patients and over 35 different mutations have been reported so far in the literature. SURF1 encodes for one of several proteins involved in proper assembly of the active COX complex.\n\n    Despite numerous detailed reports in muscle pathology in many different mitochondrial disorders the character of skeletal muscle lesions in SURF1-deficient LS has not been precisely described to date. In order to establish if there are any lesions of skeletal muscle specific for the SURF1 gene mutated patients, we summarised results of muscle biopsy in 21 patients with confirmed SURF1 gene mutations. Our analysis also includes data on 15 patients available from the literature (patients were of English, French and Czech nationality).",
        "Methods": "    Retrospective pathological investigations were performed in all children with the diagnosis of LS established at our mitochondrial centre during the period 1994-2005 in whom genetic molecular studies eventually revealed the presence of SURF1 gene mutations.\n\n    Skeletal muscle samples from 21 patients from 20 unrelated Polish families (11 boys and 10 girls, aged from 9 months to 12 years) were reassessed by light and/or electron microscopy.\n\n    Commonly accepted clinical criteria was applied for establishing the LS diagnosis in the patients. Biochemical assays of muscle homogenates showed a decrease in activity of complex IV of the respiratory chain and an increase in activity of citric synthase (CS). Molecular analysis of the SURF1 gene revealed the presence of the c.841delCT (formerly c.845delCT) mutation in all patients studied. Twelve patients were homozygous for this mutation, and the remaining seven were compound heterozygous. Clinical, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the patients are presented in table 1, and were also published in part previously.\n\n    Skeletal muscle was obtained by open surgical biopsy of the vastus lateralis as a diagnostic procedure. Pathological studies comprised light microscopic assessment of frozen sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), modified Gomori trichrome, oil red O, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), COX, NADH dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and myosin ATPase at pH 4.3, 4.6, and 9.4. Assessment was performed in parallel with ongoing mitochondrial biochemical and clinical diagnostics.\n\n    For ultrastructural study the tissue was fixed in 2.5% cold glutaraldehyde for 1 h, washed in cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded alcohols and embedded in Epon 812 resin (DDSA, MNA; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). The semi-thin sections were stained with toluidine blue to identify the region for ultrastructural study. Transverse and longitudinal sections were examined. Ultra-thin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a JEOL 1500 electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). All muscle samples were processed for electron microscopy (EM) in the years 1994-2005.\n\n    The study protocol has been accepted by the institutional Childrens' Memorial Health Institute Bioethical Commission.",
        "Results": "    Muscle light microscopy and electron microscopy results obtained from the individual patients are shown in the table 2.\n\n    Histological and histochemical pattern of muscle changes were similar in all children with SURF1 gene mutations. Diffuse decreased activity or total deficit of COX activity was found in all patients (fig 1A,B).\n\n    In most children, COX deficit was accompanied by slight to moderate accumulation of lipids in muscle (fig 1C). Only three patients demonstrated no lipid increase. Half of the patients showed mild variability in muscle fibre diameter (fig 1D). Predominance of type 1 fibres was not found in the muscle with the exception of three cases. One case showed mild tendency for fibre type grouping. This phenomenon (not seen in any other patient) was considered unrelated to the primary molecular defect. No patient showed presence of RRF or increase of succinate dehydrogenase activity in muscle.\n\n    Ultrastructural examination of skeletal muscles biopsies revealed a spectrum of morphological abnormalities consisting mainly of more or less detectable mitochondrial alterations (fig 2). In a majority of patients (12 of 19 examined cases), several muscle fibres demonstrated distinct subsarcolemmal accumulation of altered mitochondria (fig 2B,C). Frequently, the mitochondria were markedly enlarged or elongated (fig 2C,D) and exhibited dark matrix with densely packed, concentrically arranged lamellar cristae (fig 2D,E). Occasionally, the mitochondrial matrix displaced spaces with amorphous granular material and small, electron-dense, osmophilic granules (fig 2D). Extensive accumulation of lipid deposits occurred in association with normal and altered mitochondria (fig 2F,G). Some muscle fibres revealed alterations of myofibrils including their focal or widespread disorganisation and/or disruption (fig 2A-H,I). Moreover, the tubulofilamentous structures typical of cytoplasmic body formation and subsarcolemmal aggregation of concentric laminated bodies were also found in individual cases (fig 2H).\n\n    Major changes in mitochondria on electron microscopy were not common in all SURF1-deficient LS patients, and were observed in a third of the cases (fig 3). The picture was normal in five cases and mild in two others.\n\n    No correlation was found between the electron microscopy findings and the light microscopy findings (ie, variability of fibre size), or with the clinical parameters (ie, age of biopsy and homozygous/heterozygous status of c.841delCT mutation).\n\n    A slightly significant correlation was found only between presence of lipid accumulation demonstrated by light and electron microscopy (Pearson test 0.39; p<0.05).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    SURF1-deficient LS presents a special sub-group of LS in which an as-yet unexplained homogeneity of changes in the brain co-exist with a homogeneous pathogenetic molecular background. The exact role of the SURF1 protein has not been fully elucidated, but it is well known that without its contribution the COX complex is assembled improperly and functionally impaired. SURF1 acts in the early steps of COX assembly and may promote the association of the mitochondrially-encoded subunit COXII with the COXI-COXIV-COXV subassembly. There is a paucity of data on the typical morphological features of skeletal muscle in SURF1-deficient LS patients. In the majority of publications referring to SURF1 gene mutations, skeletal muscle morphology is not included or it is limited to histochemical confirmation of COX deficit. Only anecdotal reports about light microscopy findings in these 15 single case reports are available (table 3).\n\n    The experimental model of SURF1-deficient mice presented with profound and isolated defect of COX activity, reduced histochemical reaction of COX, and mitochondrial proliferation.\n\n    The cohort reported in this study was especially homogenous, carring the same c.841delCT mutation on both or one of alleles of the SURF1 gene. This mutation is frequent among Polish, Czech and probably other Slavonic populations. Here, we demonstrate that muscle biopsy of patients carrying the c.841delCT SURF1 gene mutation show features that are similar to those found in the knock-out mice. In a manner akin to the results observed in the mouse model, all but two patients did not show a predominance of type I fibres (table 2). This is in agreement with the findings previously reported for cases with SURF1 gene mutations (table 3). By contrast, this finding is considered frequent in the mitochondrial myopathies in general.\n\n    SURF1-deficient skeletal muscle of patients with Leigh syndrome (LS) shows a reproducible and characteristic pattern of changes in light and electron microscopy that are potentially helpful in diagnosis.\n\n    It should be kept in mind that those changes are not specific.\n\n    Diffuse cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficit remains the salient feature, and muscle may be interpreted as normal if the histochemical panel does not include COX reaction. The role of an experienced pathologist at this step of LS investigation is therefore important.\n\n    Among other minor features of the mitochondrial lesions lipid accumulation was seen more frequently in our material, and was present in 14 examined SURF1-LS specimens (table 2). Similarly the lipid accumulation was also commonly found in the SURF1-deficient LS muscles described earlier (table 3). The next quite frequent feature found in the studied material was variability of fibre size, present in nine muscle samples. Some degree of this abnormality was also mentioned in the previously reported cases (table 3). In general, the muscle morphology of these patients does not differ significantly from our findings. The so-called \"Polish\" SURF1 mutation of c.841delCT, the most prevalent in our patients, was not found in any of the described cases.\n\n    It is important to emphasise that the presence of RRFs in the muscle, characteristic of mtDNA encoded mitochondrial myopathies, was extremely rare if not non-existent in the nuclearly encoded SURF1-LS muscle specimens, particularly in those carrying c.841delCT mutations. There is only one description of LS with SURF1 mutations showing RRFs in a patient carrying two protein truncated mutations (table 3). RRFs were also not detected in the muscle of SURF1-deficient knock-out mice.\n\n    However, the signs of increased mitochondria number seem not to be rare in the SURF1-deficient muscle. Subsarcolemmal NADH-tetrazolium positive rims, or intense subsarcolemmal SDH staining suggested incipient mitochondrial proliferation. Increased SDH reaction was also seen in the animal knock-out model of the disease. These reactions were negative in all our muscle specimens with homozygous and heterozygous c.841delCT SURF1 gene mutation.\n\n    Ultrastructural assessment of knock-out mice revealed marked subsarcolemmal accumulation of enlarged mitochondria. Our ultrastructural findings in the affected human muscles were comparable to the animal model, also suggesting an increased number of mitochondria in several cases, but not in all of them. In the literature there is only scant information on the ultrastructure of human SURF1-deficient LS muscles. An exception is one case with COX-deficient Leigh syndrome reported in 1977. Thirty years later, a homozygous c.370C>A SURF1 gene mutation was identified in this patient. The dominant ultrastructural feature of this case was enlarged mitochondria of bizarre shape and various size and form, aggregated in juxtanuclear and subsarcolemmal regions. The mitochondria contained an excessive number of irregularly arranged and distorted cristae. Fine granular electron-dense material was seen in the matrix, but paracristalline inclusions and large spherical dense bodies were absent. Myofibrils and myofilaments were preserved. Lipid droplets were seen in association with abnormal mitochondria.\n\n    In agreement with this description, our ultrastructural study confirms that SURF1 mutations may be associated with detectable structural manifestations of mitochondrial involvement. However, approximately a third of our SURF1-deficient muscle specimens (and the remaining two reports of ultrastructural findings in the literature) did not demonstrate any ultrastructural anomalies of the mitochondria.\n\n    Ultrastructural abnormalities found by us were similar to these seen in the animal model of the disease. However it is not possible to identify any morphological or ultrastructural features that are exclusively and commonly present in muscles with SURF1 mutations. Our results and those described in the literature data indicate that mitochondrial abnormalities can not be considered specific for the SURF1-deficient LS as it is unanimously accepted for all mitochondrial disorders, including those associated with mtDNA mutations.\n\n    On the basis of our study we propose that a diffuse deficit of COX in the muscle by histochemical staining, in particular in a child of Polish origin with a clinical phenotype of LS, should prompt direct molecular testing for the c.841delCT mutation in the SURF1 gene. In our experience the contribition of an experienced clinical pathologist was very useful at this step of diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders in children. Additional histological features such as lack of RRFs and normal fibre size proportion, presence of lipid accumulation of mild to remarkable degree and fibre size variability had only limited diagnostic value in differential diagnosis of LS associated with SURF1 gene mutations.\n\n    The electron microscopy showed no abnormalities in a third of our SURF1-deficient muscle biopsies, as in three of four descriptions found in the literature. This demonstrates that the diagnostic value of minor ultrastructural abnormalities is disputable, especially in children with a suspicion of mitochondrial disorder.\n\n    In conclusion, diffuse COX deficit in muscle biopsies is the only reproducible pathological finding of patients with LS. It should be emphasised that samples from LS patients solely assessed by means of microscopy or by histochemistry using a panel not including COX may be misinterpreted as normal.\n\n    Funding: This work was supported by MitoNet, the Polish Mitochondrial Network (http://mitonet.pl).\n\n    Competing interests: None declared.",

        "Title": "    A six-generation Chinese family in haplogroup B4C1C exhibits high penetrance of 1555A > G-induced hearing Loss",
        "Abstract": "    The 1555A > G mutation is the most common cause of aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic deafness. However, the variable clinical phenotype and incomplete penetrance of A1555G-induced hearing loss complicate our understanding of this mutation. Environmental factors, nuclear genes, mitochondrial haplotypes/variants and a possible threshold effect have been reported to may be involved in its manifestation.\n\n    Here, we performed a clinical, molecular, genetic and phylogenic analysis in a six-generation Chinese family.\n\n    A clinical evaluation revealed that affected individuals without aminoglycoside exposure developed hearing loss extending gradually from 12000 Hz to 8000 Hz and then to 4000 Hz. Using pyrosequencing, we detected an identical homoplasmic 1555A > G mutation in all individuals except one. We did not find any correlation between the mutation load and the severity of hearing loss. T123N coexisted with the 1555A > G mutation in six affected subjects in our pedigree. Analysis of the complete mtDNA genome of this family revealed that this family belonged to haplotype B4C1C and exhibited high penetrance. Upon the inclusion of subjects that had been exposed to aminoglycosides, the penetrance of the hearing loss was 63.6%.; without exposure to aminoglycosides, it was 51.5%. This pedigree and another reported Chinese pedigree share the same haplotype (B4C1C) and lack functionally significant mitochondrial tRNA variants, but nevertheless they exhibit a different penetrance of hearing loss.\n\n    Our results imply that the factors responsible for the higher penetrance and variable expression of the deafness associated with the 1555A > G mutation in this pedigree may not be mtDNA haplotype/variants, but rather nuclear genes and/or aminoglycosides.",
        "Introduction": "    A number of mitochondrial mutations have been described to be associated with non-syndromic and syndromic hearing loss. The 1555A > G mutation is the most common mutation attributed to aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic deafness. It was first described in a large Arab-Israeli family that exhibited maternally inherited non-syndromic deafness.\n\n    The first family with aminoglycoside-induced hearing impairment was reported by Higashi K. Aminoglycosides exert their antibacterial effect by specifically binding to the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting protein synthesis or inducing mistranslation of messenger RNAs. In 1993 Prezant et al. first determined that the 1555A > G mutation causes the structure of the mitochondrial 12sRNA to be more similar to that of bacterial rRNA, thus rendering the mitochondrial ribosomal decoding site more available to aminoglycoside antibiotics. This strengthens the binding of aminoglycosides to mitochondrial RNA and causes hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Clinical phenotypes due to 1555A > G mutation may vary among maternal relatives within families or among different families, ranging from severe pre-lingual hearing loss to moderate progressive hearing loss of later onset to no hearing loss at all in some individuals. However, many studies have suggested that the 1555A > G mutation leads to only mild dysfunction and sensitivity to aminoglycosides, as it alone was insufficient to produce the variable phenotypes of deafness. In contrast, patients carrying the 1555A > G mutation can also suffer from hearing loss without any aminoglycoside exposure. Thus the genotype-phenotype relationship between the 1555A > G mutation and deafness is very complicated.\n\n    Phenotypic heterogeneity is an unsolved problem of mitochondrial disorders. Owing to the presence of heteroplasmy, the proportion of mutant mtDNA might be one of the causes of the variable penetrance and severity of mitochondrial disorders. There may be a threshold effect for both the clinical expression and biochemical defects. In addition, many modifiers are suspected to be involved, including environmental factors (e.g. aminoglycoside antibiotics), nuclear genes and mitochondrial haplotype/variants. Mutations in the nuclear genes GJB2 and TRMU are reported to influence the degree of hearing loss in patients with the 1555A > G mutation. Recently, many mitochondrial tRNA variants have been reported to modulate the penetrance of the 1555A > G mutation. However, the mechanisms of the phenotype variation and the incomplete penetrance of hearing loss in subjects harboring the 1555A > G mutation have remained unclear.\n\n    Here, we investigated a six-generation Han Chinese family with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss. An identical 1555A > G mutation was found in all members of this pedigree. We then performed an evaluation of the possible modifiers mentioned above by 1) quantification of the 1555A > G mutation load by pyrosequencing (Biotage AB, PSQ96MA) and 2) analysis of mutations in the nuclear gene GJB2 and TRMU and 3) phylogenetic tree analysis to identify the mitochondrial haplogroup.",
        "Methods": "    This study was conducted in accordance with the policies of the Ethics Committee of Eye & ENT Hospital, Fudan University. A six-generation Han Chinese family with 103 members is shown in Figure 1. Thirty three of them were examined at the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University after written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A comprehensive history interview was conducted with all participants and a detailed physical examination by professional otolaryngologists was performed to ensure that there were no other abnormalities except for deafness. Appropriate audiological examinations were carried out, including otoscopic examination, pure-tone audiometry (PTA), otoacoustic emissions, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, auditory brainstem response (ABR). PTA was calculated from the average of audiometric thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz. The severity of hearing impairment was classified as follows: normal < 26 decibel (dB) hearing level (HL); mild: 26-40 dBHL; moderate: 41-70 dBHL; severe: 71-90 dBHL; profound: > 90 dBHL.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a Paxgene blood DNA kit (Qiagen, Hongkong, Germany). The entire mitochondrial genomes of the two probands(IV44, IV45) and one maternal member in this pedigree were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 24 overlapping fragments as described elsewhere. The PCR products were purified and subsequently analyzed by direct sequencing analysis in an ABI 3700 automated DNA sequencer. Sequences were compared with the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) of the human mitochondrial DNA (Accession No. AC_000021. 2). Oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to 12SrRNA and tRNA were also used.\n\n    DNAs samples from an unrelated person with normal hearing (PTA <26 dB) and a person identified as having the 1555A > G mutation were amplified using the following pair of primers: Forward 5'-CGATCAACCTCACCACCTCT-3' and Reverse 5'-TGGACAACCAGCTATCACCA-3'. PCR products were cloned into a pGEM-T vector and plasmids of all colonies were sequenced. Two clones were identified, one with the wild-type genotype and the other with the 1555A > G mutation. The wild-type and mutated DNA were then mixed to generate samples with the 1555A > G mutation present at gradient levels ranging from 0%-100%. Specific SNP assays were performed by pyrosequencing with the following primers: Forward 5'-ACATTTAACTAAAACCCCTACGCA-3', Reverse 5'-AGTTGGGTGCTTTGTGTTAAGCT-3' and Sequencing 5'-CACTTACCATGTTACGACT-3'. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate by pyrosequencing assays to determine the detection threshold. Sequencing identification was performed automatically by the SQA software.\n\n    Mutations in the GJB2 nuclear gene were analyzed. The primers used for screening the entire coding region of GJB2 mutation have been described elsewhere (Forward 5'-TTGGTGTTTGCTCAGGAAGA-3' Reverse 5'-GGCCTACAGGGGTTTCAAAT-3'). PCR products were sequenced and compared with the wild-type GJB2 sequence (Accession No. NM_004004.5).\n\n    The forward and reverse primers for the A10 S variant in the TRMU gene are 5'-ACAGCGCAGAAGAAGAGCAGT-3' and 5'-ACAACGCCACGACGGACG-3', repectively. The PCR segments were subsequently analyzed and compared with the TRMU genomic sequence (Accession No. AF_448221).\n\n    Phylogenetic trees were used to analyze the haplogroups, including mtDB Http://www.genpat.uu.se/mtDB and the recently updated East Asian mtDNA phylogeny. A logistic procedure and odds ratio estimate were used to assess the correlation between age and deafness. The analysis of covariance was used to assess the factors. The hearing thresholds per frequency was used as dependent variable, the presence of 1555A < G mutation, T123N variant in GJB2 gene, age, aminoglycoside exposure as covariates.",
        "Results": "    All patients came from a large Han Chinese family living in Zhejiang Province (Figure 1). Computed tomography scans of the temporal bones of the two probands (IV44, IV45) ruled out congenital ear malformations. Hearing loss was the only symptom and was ascertained at the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University. The pattern of inheritance was typical maternal transmission. After a comprehensive clinical review and audiological and molecular biological examination, we found that 21 out of 33 maternal members carrying the 1555A > G mutation exhibited bilateral and symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss, which was especially severe at high frequencies. Four of the affected matrilineal relatives in the fourth generation had a history of aminoglycoside injection. Subjects V-17 and V28, who displayed normal hearing and mild deafness, respectively, shared similar audiograms. There was a slope of hearing loss at high frequency (8000 Hz) and more severe loss at extended high frequency (12000 Hz), while the hearing at frequencies 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz was normal. In the third generation, III7 and III9 showed mild-to-moderate hearing loss, with normal hearing at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz, but an obvious loss at high frequencies (4000 Hz, 8000 Hz) and no response at 12000 Hz (Figure 2). The exact timing of aminoglycoside exposure, audiometric configuration, severity of deafness and age of onset are shown in Table 1. The penetrance of hearing loss in this pedigree was 63.6% (included aminoglycosides received) and 51.5% (excluded aminoglycosides received).\n\n    We sequenced the mitochondrial 12SrRNA and tRNA genes of all participants in this pedigree (GFX). By direct sequencing, the 1555A > G mutation was the only detected pathogenic mutation. To assess the association of the mitochondrial haplotype with the penetrance and phenotypic expression of the 1555A > G mutation, the two probands (IV44, IV45) and another affected relative received a complete mitochondrial genomes spanning and sequencing. Many variants were detected (Table 2). According to the recently updated East Asian mtDNA phylogeny and mtDB, this pedigree thus can be grouped into haplotype B4C1C (Figure 3).\n\n    To explore the role of the GJB2 gene and the A10 S variant in the TRMU gene in the hearing loss phenotype of this pedigree, we screened GJB2 and A10 S variant in maternal individuals. The V27I (79G > A) and I203T (608T > C) in the GJB2 gene were detected as homozygous status in maternal relatives. Seven maternal relatives, six of whom suffered from hearing loss were found to be heterozygous for the T123N (368T > C) SNP (Table 1). We failed to detect any variant in TRMU in affected maternal relatives who did not have a history of exposure to aminoglycosides.\n\n    Using pyrosequencing, we examined all maternal relatives, one spouse in this pedigree and one unrelated individual. All matrilineal relatives of this family were found to be homoplasmic for the 1555A > G mutation except for subject II2 who was heteroplasmic. The exact load of the mutation in each subject is shown (Table 1, Figure 4).",
        "Conclusion": "    In summary, we have analyzed possible modifiers associated with hearing loss due to the 1555A > G mutation. First, we found that the load of the 1555A > G mutation is not correlated with phenotype expression or penetrance in this family. Second, our pedigree exhibits a statistically different penetrance from another reported Chinese pedigree, both of which share haplotype B4C1C and lack functionally significant mitochondrial tRNA or rRNA variants. Our data further strengthen the idea that haplotype background and functional variants may not play a substantial role in the penetrance and expression of the deafness associated with the 1555A > G mutation. Rather nuclear genes and/or aminoglycoside exposure may be responsible for the higher penetrance and variability of hearing loss with the 1555A > G mutation in our pedigree. Third, the covariance analysis showed that m.1555A > G and aminoglycoside exposure are main influence factors, but no frequency specificity. The m.1555A > G places the individual at risk for hearing loss, but the severity and penetrance of hearing lossis based on the interplay of mutation with other factors such as unknown nuclear genes and/or aminoglycoside exposure.",
        "Discussion": "    The hereditary pattern of aminoglycoside hypersensitivity is usually consistent with maternal transmission, implying mitochondrial genome involvement. In our study, we found that in six generations of a Han family affected with aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss, the mode of inheritance was strictly maternal. Therefore, we performed a series of tests for mitochondrial disease, including clinical examination, molecular biological investigationl, genetic analysis, pyrosequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis for this pedigree. The mtDNA analysis indicated that the 1555A > G mutation was the only pathogenic mutation. Furthermore, we detected the identical homoplasmic 1555A > G mutation in all members of this pedigree except II2, who was heteroplasmic for the mutation. In addition, the pedigree exhibited a high penetrance and phenotypic expression of hearing loss carrying 1555A > G mutation with 63.6% of the family members suffering from hearing loss.\n\n    Pyrosequencing technology is an accurate, sensitive and specific way to detect heteroplasmy and to quantify the mutation load. Pyrosequencing was used by Ballana et al to detect unrecognized low-level mtDNA heteroplasmy in a three-generation heteroplasmic family harboring the 1555A > G mutation. Similar to Castillo, they found a slight correlation between the heteroplasmic mutation load and the severity of hearing loss. Interestingly, we did not find such a correlation in the present study.\n\n    It has been suggested that mtDNA haplotypes could modulate the penetrance and phenotype of mtDNA mutations. The phylogenetic tree can be a very helpful approach to assessing the origin of an mtDNA mutation. Phylogenetic analyses of a family with Leber's hereditary optic neurophy (LHON) suggested that the mtDNA haplotype J increased the penetrance of a disease-causing LHON mutation in Europe. In contrast, Torroni et al concluded that the specific European haplotype had no effect on the clinical phenotype of the mtDNA A3243G mutation. To assess the effect of haplotype on disease penetrance, we performed a complete mitochondrial genomic analysis in this pedigree (GFX). In addition to the identical 1555A > G mutation, we found a set of mtDNA polymorphisms. According to the recently updated East Asian mtDNA phylogenetic tree and mtDB, we were able to classify this pedigree as haplotype B4C1C based on the observed variants (A16183C, T16189C, 9-bpdel, T16217C, T1119C, G15346A, C3497T, C150T, T195C, A5441G, A10398G, A13629G, T15941C). Interestingly, another Chinese pedigree (WZD1), which is known to be associated with 1555A > G-induced hearing loss, turned out to be haplotype B4C1C rather than haplotype B4C1C1, according to the haplotype system developed by Tanaka et al. This pedigree showed a strikingly low penetrance of hearing loss (5.9%). Thus, with the effect of aminoglycosiders included, the penetrance of hearing loss in these two Chinese families was 63.6% and 5.9%, respectively. Without the effect of aminoglycosides, the penetrance in the two pedigrees was 51.5% and 0%, respectively. Interestingly, the two pedigrees shared the same mitochondrial haplotype (B4C1C) in the same racial background and yet exhibited different penetrances. Thus, the mtDNA haplotype may not have any effect on penetrance. Torroni et al used a phylogenetic tree to analyze 50 Spanish families and 4 Cuban families carrying the 1555A > G mutation, and they found that different mtDNA haplotypes are not responsible for the variable phenotype of the 1555A > G mutation. This finding was further strengthened by Casano et al. in their studies of an Italian family. However, the effect of mtDNA haplotype on penetrance could differ between regional groups, as the mtDNA of European and East Asians occupy different branches of the world phylogeny, In their reappraisal of the complete mtDNA of Chinese and Japanese families suffering from deafness, Yao et al concluded that the mtDNA background may not play a decisive role in modulating the phenotypic expression of the 1555A > G mutation in an East Asian background. While sharing the same ethnic and haplotypic background, both the pedigree in our study and pedigree WZD1 exhibited strikingly different clinical phenotypes and penetrances. This finding as well as those of Yao, Torroni and Casano, indicates that haplotype B4C1C may not play a substantial role in the penetrance and expression of the 1555A > G mutation associated with deafness. Given the mounting evidence that haplotype (whether in different racial groups or in a similar racial background) does not have a major effect on penetrance, there may be other factors. Recently, Guan et al reported that mitochondrial tRNAGluA14693, tRNAThrT15908C, tRNAArgT10454C, tRNASer(UCN)G7444A, tRNACysT5802C, tRNAThrG15927A, tRNACysG5821A, ND5T12338C and ND4G11696A seemed to account for the higher penetrance and expressivities in many Chinese pedigrees associated with the 1555A > G mutation and deafness. Conversely, they postulated that the absence of those functionally significant mutations in tRNA and rRNAs or a secondary LHON mutation in these Chinese pedigrees might account for the very low penetrance of hearing loss. However, the pedigree that we studied which did not have a secondary mtDNA mutation or the above functionally significant mutations, nevertheless exhibited high levels of penetrance and phenotype of hearing loss. Thus, the role of the mitochondrial haplotype or functional variants in the penetrance and expression of hearing loss seems to be questionable based on our pedigree. Nuclear genes and aminoglycosides may be responsible for the higher penetrance and more variable clinic phenotypes.\n\n    To better understand the role of nuclear genes in phenotype variation, we analyzed GJB2 in this pedigree and identified homozygous V27I (79G > A) and I203T (608T > C) and heterozygous T123N (368C > A). Six of the maternal subjects harboring heterozygous T123N had hearing loss except subject V18 (Tab. 1). T123N was absent in other maternally related family members with the 1555A > G mutation. Subject III7, who carried T123N, had the worst hearing in the third generation without any aminoglycoside exposure. In the fourth generation, we found T123N in five affected subjects, of which one(IV21) had moderate hearing loss without a history of aminoglycoside exposure, while the others four, all of whom had aminoglycoside exposure, exhibited severe or profound deafness. It appears that the coexistence of T123N and aminoglicoside use led to more severe deafness. In the fifth generation, T123N was found in subject V18, who had a normal hearing. As V18 was only 6 years old and son of IV21, we performed a logistic procedure and odds ratio estimate to assess the correlation between age and deafness. We found age to be a high risk factor in this pedigree (OR = 1.206). It will be interesting to find out whether IV18 dose experience hearing lose in the future. Based on results above, there may be a slight correlation between hearing loss and T123N (except in the case V18). T123N is located in CL functional domain of GJB2. This mutation was reported to be an unknown disease-causing mutation in the Connexin-deafness mutations database at http://davinci.crg.es/deafness and it was identified in Japanese and Chinese patients. Nevertheless, T123N is not highly conserved at position 123 and this mutation was found in both the control group and the patient group. In addition, was counted as a mutation in a Japanese group but as a neutral variant in a Chinese study. Overall T123N was an unclassified mutation in GJB2. Due to its unclear clinical implication and coexistence with the 1555A > G mutation in six affected subjects in our pedigree, we suspect that the heterozygous T123N may be relevant of the phenotype expression and penetrance of hearing loss in this pedigree. However, this interpretation should be taken with caution, as determining the exact pathogenic role of T123n will require further investigation and functional tests.\n\n    It was reported that the A10 S mutation in TRMU gene modulated the phenotypic expression of the 1555 A> G mutation in the Israeli/European pedigrees. To assess the role of the A10 S variant in this pedigree, we carried out a mutational screening of exon 1 in TRMU gene, We failed to detect any variant in TRMU exon 1 in affected maternal subjects of this pedigree. So, the absence of A10 S variant in gene TRMU ruled out it involvement in the phenotypic expression of the 1555 A> G mutation in this Chinese family.\n\n    In our clinical evaluation, we noticed that the degree of the deafness in fourth generation was worse than in the third and fifth generations. Almost of all the affected subjects in the fourth generation presented severe or profound hearing loss with a clear history of aminoglycoside exposure or uncertain history of aminoglycoside, while those in the fourth and fifth generations without histories of aminoglycoside exposure showed normal or mild hearing loss. As II-2 was a 102-year-old woman with severe hearing loss, her hearing loss might be a consequence of age-related hearing impairment combined with the specific genetic defect. Meanwhile, we noted that IV-25 began suffering hearing loss after only two streptomycin injections at age 4. This is consistent with previous findings that Chinese patients with the 1555A > G mutation suffer severe hearing loss with immediate onset after exposure to a very small dose of aminoglycosides. In contrast, in American patients, the hearing loss is mild and progressive over many years after aminoglycoside administration. Some studies have implicated the cochlear neuroepithelia as the major vulnerable site to aminoglycoside ototoxicity. In general, irreversible cochlear damage is first seen in the outer hair cells of the cochlear basal turn and then in the upper cochlear turns and inner hair cells. The outer hair cells in the basal turn are reported to contain more mitochondria, which suggest that the ability to discern high frequencies is more easily affected than that of low frequencies. Because hearing loss in the affected individual without aminoglycoside exposure is too mild to be discerned by other family members, audiometry is required to diagnose high-frequency hearing loss in these affected relatives. We used high-frequency audiometry to test the affected subjects with mild-moderate hearing loss at extended high frequency (12000 Hz). After analyzing the audiograms of the affected subjects without a history of aminoglycoside exposure, we found the hearing loss of these subjects gradually extended from 12000 Hz to 8000 Hz and then to 4000 Hz (Figure. 2). All subjects were not aware of their hearing loss. Using the high-frequency audiometry, we could detect hearing loss at the 12000 Hz frequency early, particularly in hypersensitive subjects harboring the 1555A > G mutation without histories of aminoglycoside exposure or clinical syndrome. As hearing loss due to the 1555A > G mutation is permanent, early identification could help hypersensitive subjects avoid using amiloglycosides, thus reducing the risk of irreversible cochlear damage.",

        "Title": "    Genetics of Hearing Loss in North Iran Population: An Update of Spectrum and Frequency of GJB2 Mutations",
        "Abstract": "    Diagnosis of pre-lingual hearing loss (HL) is difficult owing to the high number of genes responsible. The most frequent cause of HL is DFNB1 due to mutations in the GJB2 gene. It represents up to 40% of HL cases in some populations. In Iran, it has previously been shown that DFNB1 accounts for 16-18% of cases but varies among different ethnic groups. Here, we reviewed results from our three previous publications and data from other published mutation reports to provide a comprehensive collection of data for GJB2 mutations and HL in northern Iran. In total, 903 unrelated families from six different provinces, viz., Gilan, Mazandaran, Golestan, Ghazvin, Semnan, and Tehran, were included and analyzed for the type and prevalence of GJB2 mutations. A total of 23 different genetic variants were detected from which 18 GJB2 mutations were identified. GJB2 mutations were 20.7% in the studied northern provinces, which was significantly higher than that reported in southern populations of Iran. Moreover, a gradient in the frequency of GJB2 mutations from north to south Iran was observed. c.35delG was the most common mutation, accounting for 58.4% of the cases studied. This study suggests that c.35delG mutation in GJB2 is the most important cause of HL in northern Iran.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss (HL) is a sensory impairment that affects millions of people worldwide, with the probability of approximately 1 in 1000 live births (http://hearing.screening.nhs.uk/nationalprog). Approximately, two-third of individuals with hearing impairment reside in developing countries, wherein more than 60% cases are attributed to genetic factors. The genetic forms of HL are syndromic, which is accompanied by other specific abnormalities, and non-syndromic HL (NSHL), in which no additional abnormalities are observed. Autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (ARNSHL) comprises 80% of NSHL cases. ARNSHL is highly heterogeneous, with over 100 associated loci and >60 identified causative genes (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/). GJB2 at the DFNB1 locus is responsible for 60% of all deafness cases, and over 100 GJB2 pathogenic variants have been reported with variable frequency among disparate world populations. c.35delG accounts for >50% of GJB2-related NSHL in many western populations. Other mutations are more origin specific. In the Japanese population, 235delC is more prevalent and c.167delT is common in Ashkenazi Jews. In individuals of Indian and Pakistani ancestry, c.71G>A is the common GJB2 variant. Over the last decade, several studies have been conducted on the Iranian population to identify the mutation spectrum and prevalence of GJB2 mutations. The different ethnicities coupled with the high frequency of familial marriages (38% on an average) tend to change mutation frequencies among the ethnic groups. Therefore, for accurate genetic counseling, studying certain ethnic groups is of high importance. In this study, we have summarized the published data on the frequency and profile of GJB2 mutations in 903 unrelated families from six different provinces, viz., Gilan, Mazandaran, Golestan, Ghazvin, Semnan, and Tehran, in north Iran compared to those in other parts of the country.",
        "Methods": "    This study included results from our three previous publications on GJB2-related HL in Iran. We also performed a PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar search using the search terms \"GJB2 mutations\", \"connexin 26\", and \"Iran\". In the search results, we limited the search to humans with available information on molecular genetics of HL. Studies were included when the following three criteria were fulfilled: 1) inclusion of NSHL subjects, 2) known ethnicity of the tested subjects, and 3) detection of all GJB2 variants. Studies were excluded if HL was a result of environmental factors, such as infection, trauma, rubella, meningitis, mumps, ototoxic drugs, and premature birth. Research data, including data of 903 unrelated deaf families, from the north provinces were collected. The frequency and mutation type of 903 deaf families were extracted from relevant studies and categorized corresponding to the geographical boundaries. In silico analyses were also performed using the available software tools (Mutation Taster and SIFT; http://www.mutationtaster.org, https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/) to predict the pathogenicity of the mutations.",
        "Results": "    Data from 903 unrelated families from six provinces were analyzed (Table 1). The groups studied consisted of 429 families from Tehran (47.5%), 156 families from Gilan (17.3%), 111 families from Semnan (12.3%), 100 families from Mazandaran (11.1%), 85 families from Golestan (9.4%), and 22 families from Ghazvin (2.4%). Among these families, 66.5% reported parental consanguinity, whereas close consanguinity was denied in 33.5% cases (Table 2). GJB2 mutation allele frequencies of each studied group were 32%, 31.3%, 20.9%, 19.75%, 11.5%, and 9% in the total studied families (n=903) of Mazandaran, Gilan, Golestan, Tehran, Semnan, and Ghazvin, respectively (Fig. 1). When moving from the west to east and north to south of the studied provinces, a gradual decrease in GJB2 HL was observed.\n\n    In total, 30 different variants were identified, 22 of which were reported as pathogenic. These included c.-23+1G>A, c.35delG, c.71G>A, c.95G>A, c.136G>A, c.139G>T, c.167delT, c.224G>A, c.229T>C, c.230G>A, c.235delC, K102Q, c.313-326del, c.327-328delGG, c.358-360delGAG, c.326G>A, c.334-36delAA, c.427C>T, 463-464delTA, c.487A>G, c.511G>A, and c.551G>C. The allele variants identified in various Iranian ARSNSHL families are summarized in Table 3. In the studied populations, c.35delG was the most frequent mutation, accounting for 58.4% cases in the populations studied. The highest rate of c.35delG mutation was detected in the Gilan province with an allele frequency of 27.6%, whereas this rate was 6.3% in Semnan (Table 1). A specific combination of GJB2 mutation types and frequencies were observed in the different studied provinces (Table 3). A higher GJB2 mutation diversity (17 types) was identified in Tehran, whereas the lowest diversity was observed in Ghazvin (two types).",
        "Conclusion": "    The critical and specific position of Iran and the existence of various ethnic groups of different cultures suggest high heterogeneity throughout Iran, but specific intra-ethnic traditions, such as intragroup marriages, may result in high homogeneity in some loci and mutations within groups. GJB2 mutations are responsible for 20.7% cases of deaf families in the north, which is more than that in central Iran (13-15%), suggesting the migration pathway from the north to central Iran through the silk route. Regarding GJB2 mutations, c.35delG was the most common mutation first tested. In the studied populations, some mutations were frequent, which were detected in each group, e.g., the frequency of c.35delG mutation showed a high rate in the Gilan province (north Iran) accounting for 90.2% of the mutant alleles studied. In addition, the causes of HL in some populations, such as Golestani, are likely more homogenous than those in other parts of north Iran. The present study will help in improving genetic diagnosis, cascade screening, genetic counseling, and molecular epidemiology of HL in Irani populations, particularly of northern origin.\n\n    Conflicts of interest\n\n    The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.\n\n    Authors' contribution\n\n    Data curation: Farideh Koohian.

        "Discussion": "    In this study, we reviewed the prevalence and type of GJB2 mutations in 903 deaf families from six provinces in northern Iran. GJB2 mutations accounted for 20.7% of HL cases. The genetic epidemiology of HL is very different in a country even in neighboring provinces because of subtle variations in their ethnic composition and founder effects. The Iranian population is composed of many different ethnic groups; therefore, it is significant to discuss ethnicity-specific data. Accepting the northwest to southeast GJB2 HL gradient throughout Iran, our data showed a north to south gradient among Iranian populations with a GJB2 mutations frequency of 32% in Mazandaran and 9% in Ghazvin. A study performed by Chaleshtori, et al. on 890 ARNSHL families showed that GJB2 mutations account for 14.6% HL cases in the Iranian population, and c.35delG mutation was the most frequent mutation (~75% of the reported GJB2 mutations).\n\n    Our results showed that the contribution of GJB2 mutations to ARNSHL was 32% in Mazandaran (north Iran), which is similar to the data from the Azer Turkish population in northwest Iran. Bonyadi, et al. screened 209 HL families from the Azerbijan and Ardebil provinces in northwest Iran for GJB2 mutations. They reported that GJB2 mutations were detected in 28% of the HL families studied and c.35delG was the most prevalent mutation, accounting for 64.5% of mutations, which is similar to the results reported for the Turkish population.\n\n    In the study performed by Bazazzadegan, et al. on 111 deaf families, GJB2 mutations accounted for 11.5% HL cases in the Semnan province, which is approximately one-third of the frequency of GJB2 mutations in the Mazandaran province. In a previous study, we showed that GJB2 mutations explain the etiology of HL in 3.7% patients from the Hormozgan province in south of Iran. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that the incidence of GJB2 mutations decreases gradually in both west to east and north to south directions (Fig. 1), drawing the migration pathway of the initial founders.\n\n    Another finding of this study was the mutation rate of c.35delG in the Gilan province, which was different from that of Iranian population regions. Chaleshtori, et al. screened 87 deaf families from the Gilan province in north Iran for DFNB1 mutations and reported that GJB2 mutations were found in 27.6% of the deaf families studied. Interestingly, c.35delG mutation was identified in 95.9% of GJB2 mutations in the Gilan province, whereas this mutation was absent in the Baluchi population (southeast Iran). According to our knowledge, this is the highest rate of c.35delG mutation reported from Iran so far. Results obtained for the carrier frequency of c.35delG mutation was 2.8% in the Gilan province, whereas it was 1% in the remaining Iranian groups. However, this population is bounded in the north by the Caspian Sea and remains relatively isolated by mountains from other parts of Iran.\n\n    In our studied populations, the most frequent mutation was c.35delG, accounting for 58.4% of GJB2 mutations. c.35delG (deletion of guanine in position 30-35; rs80338939) is the most common mutation worldwide as well as in many countries in the Middle East, such as Turkey and north and northwest Iran. The study of the geographical distribution of GJB2 mutations showed more allelic heterogeneity in the north compared to that in the south of Iran. The four most frequent mutations of GJB2 in the north of Iran were c.35delG, c.71G>A, c.-23+1G>A, and c.551G>C and are responsible for ~66.3% of all pathogenic alleles in north Iran (Table 3). c.35delG mutation, which is rare among southern regions, accounts for 58.4% of GJB2 mutations in the northern populations. c.71G>A, c.-23+1G>A, and c.551G>C are the second, third, and fourth common mutations, with an occurrence of 2.9%, 2.45%, and 2.45%, respectively, of all pathogenic alleles.\n\n    p.Trp24*, a nonsense mutation, is because of c.71G>A transition, which changes TGG codon for tryptophan residue to a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein with probably no functional properties. c.71G>A is the most common mutation in Slovak Romany, Pakistan, and Indian populations. The rate of carriers of c.71G>A mutation is 4.08% in the Pakistan population. This mutation is observed at a high frequency in the Baluchi group (southeast Iran) and accounts for 80% of the mutant alleles in this ethnicity, whereas this rate was only 2.9% in our study population.\n\n    p.Arg184Pro, a missense variant, is the result of c.551G>C transition, which changes CGC codon for arginine residue to a CCC codon for proline, probably leading to a non-functional protein. This mutation has been reported in an Australian family for the first time. In silico analyses are consistent with the pathogenicity of the mutation (Table 3). p.Arg184Pro is not the common mutation in Iranian populations, but this mutation is observed at a high frequency in north and northwest Iran because of founder effects.\n\n    The present data showed a particular combination of GJB2 mutation diversity in different provinces of north Iran. A higher GJB2 mutation diversity (17 types) was identified in the Tehran province, showing the co-existence of several different ethnic groups and marked immigration to the metropolitan during the last century. In contrast with high diversity in Tehran, we found a very low rate of diversity in some populations, such as Ghazvini who are probably isolated owing to cultural and geographical barriers.\n\n    Chaleshtori, et al. reported that more than 40% of patients were heterozygous carriers for GJB2 mutations in the Gilan province. Hence, these patients are subjected to analysis to investigate GJB6 mutations.",

        "Title": "    Unique Mutational Spectrum of the GJB2 Gene and Its Pathogenic Contribution to Deafness in Tuvinians (Southern Siberia, Russia): A High Prevalence of Rare Variant c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys)",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the main cause for nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness 1A (DFNB1A) in many populations. GJB2 mutational spectrum and pathogenic contribution are widely varying in different populations. Significant efforts have been made worldwide to define DFNB1A molecular epidemiology, but this issue still remains open for some populations. The main aim of study is to estimate the DFNB1A prevalence and GJB2 mutational spectrum in Tuvinians:an indigenous population of the Tyva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia). Sanger sequencing was applied to analysis of coding (exon 2) and non-coding regions of GJB2 in a cohort of Tuvinian patients with hearing impairments (n = 220) and ethnically matched controls (n = 157). Diagnosis of DFNB1A was established for 22.3% patients (28.8% of familial vs 18.6% of sporadic cases). Our results support that patients with monoallelic GJB2 mutations (8.2%) are coincidental carriers. Recessive mutations p.Trp172Cys, c.-23+1G>A, c.235delC, c.299_300delAT, p.Val37Ile and several benign variants were found in examined patients. A striking finding was a high prevalence of rare variant p.Trp172Cys (c.516G>C) in Tuvinians accounting for 62.9% of all mutant GJB2 alleles and a carrier frequency of 3.8% in controls. All obtained data provide important targeted information for genetic counseling of affected Tuvinian families and enrich current information on variability of GJB2 worldwide.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common sensory disorders, affecting one in 500-1000 newborns, and approximately half of congenital HL cases have a genetic etiology. The genetic causes for HL are extremely heterogeneous: over 400 syndromes are associated with HL and over 100 different genes are causally implicated in nonsyndromic HL. Despite the extraordinary genetic heterogeneity of nonsyndromic HL, homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the GJB2 gene (gap junction protein, beta-2, OMIM 121011, 13q12.11) encoding transmembrane protein connexin 26 (Cx26) are the most common cause of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness 1A (DFNB1A, OMIM 220290) in many populations. Six connexin 26 molecules associate to form transmembrane hexameric hemichannels (connexons) which dock with hemichannels of adjacent cells forming gap junctions that are essential for the transport of ions and other low-molecular-weight components between cells. Cx26 plays a crucial role in potassium homeostasis in the inner ear. High prevalence of the GJB2-associated HL was demonstrated in most populations making GJB2 gene testing essential for the establishment of genetic diagnosis of HL.\n\n    Over 300 deafness-associated variations in GJB2 have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database . Many of them have very specific ethno-geographic prevalence patterns being attributed to a founder effect for certain ethnic groups. The variant c.35delG (p.Gly12Valfs*2) is prevalent in deaf patients of Caucasian origin; c.235delC (p.Leu79Cysfs*3) is common in East and Southeast Asians; c.167delT (p.Leu56Argfs*26) is more specific for Ashkenazi Jews; c.427C>T (p.Arg143Trp) was found with high frequency in population of Ghana (West Africa); c.71G>A (p.Trp24*) is widely distributed in Indians and European Gypsies; c.109G>A (p.Val37Ile) prevails in populations of Southeast Asia; splice donor variant c.-23+1G>A (originally named IVS1+1G>A) is widespread among Yakuts (Eastern Siberia, Russia); c.131G>A (p.Trp44*) was found with high frequency among descendants of the ancestral Mayan population in Guatemala.\n\n    Despite significant efforts made worldwide to define the molecular epidemiology of GJB2 pathogenic variants, this issue still remains open for some populations. Establishing a genetic diagnosis of HL is of great importance for clinical evaluation of deaf patients and for estimating recurrence risks for their families.\n\n    The aim of this work is to evaluate previously unknown contribution of the GJB2 mutations to HL in Tuvinians, which is the indigenous population of the Tyva Republic. The Tyva Republic (Tuva), the federal subject of the Russian Federation, is located in Southern Siberia, in the central part of the Asian continent, bordered by Mongolia in the south and the east. The Tyva Republic is divided into 17 administrative districts and includes five small towns, with the capital in the town of Kyzyl. The total population of Tuva (307,930 according to 2010 Russian Federation Census) is mainly (82%) composed of the Tuvinians (Tuvans) who descended from ancient Turkic-speaking Central Asian tribes and Mongolian-speaking groups assimilated by them. Besides the Tyva Republic, relatively small groups of Tuvinians live in Mongolia and in Northwest China.\n\n    In our previous epidemiological study, we created a database (including information about sex, age, ethnicity, place of residence, audiological data, and age of HL onset) for approximately 1400 individuals with various hearing impairments living in the Tyva Republic. The average rate of different HL cases in the Tyva Republic was estimated as 45.5 +- 1.21 per 10,000 residents or 1:220, ranging from 25.5 +- 4.44 (1:392) to 117.9 +- 12.09 (1:85) in different regions of the Tyva Republic. From the total group of registered patients, based on medical history, pedigree data and after exclusion of HL cases probably due to environmental factors, we have identified a group of patients with congenital or early onset sensorineural severe-profound HL (approximately 540 individuals) likely to have genetic HL. In this study, the evaluation of the spectrum and frequency of the GJB2 gene variants was performed in a cohort of Tuvinians mainly recruited from this group of patients.",
        "Methods": "    The cohort of patients with hearing impairment (109 females and 111 males from 1 year to 70 years old at the time of investigation) includes 220 Tuvinians from 184 unrelated families living in the Tyva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia). In total, 76 patients were urban residents (mainly from town Kyzyl) and 144 were rural residents from numerous small settlements located in different areas of the Tyva Republic. The genomic DNA samples of patients were collected from 2010 to 2018. Thorough analysis of pedigrees and family histories of patients was performed. The examined cohort of patients included 140 single/sporadic (the only affected individual in family) and 80 familial (two or more affected family members) HL cases. Hearing status of parents was ascertained for 210 patients: 186 (88.6%) patients have both normal hearing parents (mating N x N), 9 patients (4.3%) have one deaf and another normal hearing parents (mating D x N), 15 (7.1%) patients were descendants of assortative matings (both deaf parents, mating D x D), 10 of which could be considered, according to, as non-complementary matings (noncomp. mating D x D) that is, the families with both deaf parents and all deaf siblings presumably having the same genetic cause of HL.\n\n    Hearing status of affected individuals was evaluated by otoscopic and pure-tone audiometry examinations that patients underwent at different times in the specialized audiological services located in town Kyzyl. Severity of hearing loss was defined as mild (25-40 dB), moderate (41-70 dB), severe (71-90 dB) or profound (above 90 dB). The majority of examined patients (210 subjects) suffered from congenital or early onset bilateral severe-to-profound HL, nine patients have moderate HL, and one patient - unilateral severe HL. Other concomitant information was collected from local unspecialized medical services and by direct interview with the patients and their relatives.\n\n    The ethnically matched control sample comprises 157 unrelated Tuvinians from different regions of the Tyva Republic (84 females and 73 males, aged from 10 to 73 years old). None of them were registered by the audiological services and had no complaints of hearing impairments.\n\n    Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals or their legal guardians before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Bioethics Commission at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia (Protocol No. 9, 24 April 2012).\n\n    Genomic DNA was isolated from the buffy coat fraction of blood by a standard phenol-chloroform extraction method. The GJB2 coding region encompassing exon 2 and the non-coding GJB2 region (exon 1 with flanking regions) were amplified in all patients and controls. Primer pairs designed to amplify corresponding PCR products and also used for Sanger sequencing are presented in Table 1. The PCR products were purified by sorption on Agencourt Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and subjected to Sanger sequencing using a BigDye Terminator V.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) with subsequent unincorporated dye removal by the Sephadex G-50 gel filtration (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The Sanger products were analyzed on an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) in the SB RAS Genomics Core Facility (Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia). The DNA sequence variations were identified by comparison with the GJB2 gene reference sequence NG_008358.1 . Screening of common large deletion GJB6-D13S1830 (~309 kb) was performed according to only for the group of patients with monoallelic GJB2 recessive mutations. In this group of patients, we also sequenced a region of about 0.7 kb immediately upstream of GJB2 exon 1 which includes the GJB2 basal promoter using primers PF1, PF2, and PR1 as previously described (Table 1).\n\n    GJB2 variants c.79G>A (p.Val27Ile, rs2274084) and c.341A>G (p.Glu114Gly, rs2274083) are located 260 bp from each other in the GJB2 coding sequence. The phase (cis or trans) of these variants was assessed in all individuals who were heterozygous for both of these variants (deaf patients, their relatives and individuals from the control sample) by either pedigree analysis or by molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing of the syntenic variants (Figure S1). Molecular cloning was performed for 27 individuals heterozygous for both of these variants by use of the CloneJET  PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fragment of the GJB2 coding region (837 bp) including both variants c.79G>A and c.341A>G was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using Phusion Hot Start II polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and primers 835-F and 835-R (Table 1) and then cloned into the pJET1.2/blunt vector followed by transformation in competent E.coli strain Mach-1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Presence/absence of variants c.79G>A and c.341A>G in examined positive clones was verified by Sanger sequencing with the same primers (Figure S1).\n\n    The functional effects of the c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) variant were predicted using PolyPhen-2 , PROVEAN , PANTHER , MutationTaster , and FATHMM .\n\n    The three-dimensional (3D) molecule structure of the wild type and the p.Trp172Cys-mutant connexin 26 (Cx26-WT and Cx26-p.Trp172Cys, respectively) was visualized by DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer v.4.1.0 . The protein template 2ZW3.1 was found by the SWISS-MODEL .\n\n    Two-tailed Fisher's exact test with significance level of p < 0.05 was applied to compare allele frequencies between patients and controls. To avoid probable bias due to the presence of related individuals in the total cohort of patients, only unrelated patients (184 out of 220 selected by pedigree analysis) were used for allele frequency calculation.",
        "Results": "    Five pathogenic recessive GJB2 variants: c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys), c.-23+1G>A, c.235delC (p.Leu79Cysfs*3), c.299_300delAT (p.His100Argfs*14), c.109G>A (p.Val37Ile), and also several known benign GJB2 variants were found in examined patients. The GJB2 genotypes due to the combination of GJB2 gene sequence variations observed in patients and in the control sample are presented in Table 2.\n\n    Twenty-two different GJB2 genotypes found in patients can be subdivided into four groups: (1) seven genotypes with biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) recessive pathogenic GJB2 variants (22.3%, 49 out of 220 patients); (2) six genotypes with single recessive pathogenic GJB2 variants in compound with a benign variant or wild type allele (8.2%, 18 out of 220 patients); (3) eight genotypes with only benign GJB2 variants (24.5%, 54 out of 220 patients); (4) wild genotype (without any changes in the GJB2 gene sequence) (45.0%, 99 out of 220 patients).\n\n    Twelve different GJB2 genotypes (including wild genotype) were found in the control sample: five genotypes included a single recessive pathogenic GJB2 variant in compound with a benign variant or wild type allele (9.6%, 15 out of 157 individuals); six genotypes:only benign GJB2 variants (33.7%, 53 out of 157 individuals); wild genotype (56.7%, 89 out of 157 individuals) (Table 2).\n\n    The contribution of the GJB2 pathogenic variants in HL of patients defined as the proportion of patients from the first group of GJB2 genotypes among all examined Tuvinian patients was estimated as 22.3%. The c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) variant was the most frequent (62.9%) out of all GJB2 pathogenic variants detected in patients followed by c.-23+1G>A (27.6%), c.235delC (5.2%), c.299_300delAT (2.6%), and c.109G>A (p.Val37Ile) (1.7%). Total carrier frequency of the GJB2 pathogenic variants in Tuvinian control sample was estimated as 9.6% (p.Trp172Cys - 3.8%, c.-23+1G>A - 3.8%, and p.Val37Ile - 1.9%).\n\n    The c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) variant makes a significant contribution to deafness in Tuvinian patients since 38 (from 27 unrelated families) out of 220 examined patients are either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for p.Trp172Cys, and also 10 patients (from seven unrelated families) have only a single allele with p.Trp172Cys (Table 2). The p.Trp172Cys variant (in compound with c.235delC) was initially found in our previous study in one deaf patient belonging to Altaians:indigenous Turkic-speaking people of the Altai Republic neighboring the Tyva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia). Later, Tekin et al. (2010) detected p.Trp172Cys in compound with mutation c.299_300delAT in one deaf patient from Mongolia.\n\n    The c.516G>C substitution leads to a replacement of aromatic non-polar tryptophan by a small polar cysteine at amino acid position 172 in the second extracellular loop (E2, 155-192 amino acid residues) of the connexin 26 protein (Cx26) (Figure 1). The loop E2 is known to be essential for Cx26-hemichannel subunits connection. Multiple in silico programs (scores: PolyPhen2:'probably/possibly damaging', PROVEAN:'deleterious', PANTHER:'probably damaging', MutationTaster:'disease causing', FATHMM:'damaging') predict a deleterious effect of p.Trp172Cys. For now, variant p.Trp172Cys is only presented in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD: ) with reference to our previous work.\n\n    All 38 examined patients having p.Trp172Cys (biallelic or in compound with known pathogenic GJB2 variants c.-23+1G>A, c.235delC, or c.299_300delAT) were affected by nonsyndromic congenital or early onset HL. To investigate the segregation of p.Trp172Cys with HL, we have screened this variant in all available relatives of these patients and revealed a distinct segregation of homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for p.Trp172Cys with HL in affected Tuvinian families (Figure 2 and Figure S2). Moreover, the frequency of p.Trp172Cys calculated in unrelated patients (0.1386, 51/368 chromosomes) was significantly higher compared with the control sample (0.019, 6/314 chromosomes) (p < 10-8) (Table 3).\n\n    The splice donor site variant c.-23+1G>A (rs80338940) located in the GJB2 non-coding region (intron 1) is the second common pathogenic GJB2 mutation (after p.Trp172Cys) in Tuvinian patients and controls. The c.-23+1G>A is apparently not a rare GJB2 mutation since it was found among deaf patients of different origins around the world although not all laboratories are screening for this particular mutation since it is located outside the GJB2 coding region. The extensive accumulation of c.-23+1G>A was reported in Yakuts, indigenous Turkic-speaking people living in the subarctic region of Russia (the Sakha Republic/Yakutia). Extremely high prevalence of c.-23+1G>A could be explained by a founder effect and a probable selective advantage for the c.-23+1G>A heterozygotes in severe subarctic climate. The c.-23+1G>A was reported as the most common GJB2 mutation in deaf Mongolian patients from Mongolia.\n\n    The GJB2 frameshift mutations c.235delC (rs80338943) and c.299_300delAT (rs111033204) found in Tuvinian patients are well known deleterious GJB2 variants associated with deafness. In many extensive studies, c.235delC and c.299_300delAT have been confirmed to be the most common GJB2 mutations in the East Asian (Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean) populations as well as in Mongolian patients living in Mongolia and in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China.\n\n    Mutation c.109G>A (p.Val37Ile, rs72474224) which is predominant in Southeast Asian populations was rare in Tuvinian patients:only two of them had compound heterozygous and heterozygous p.Val37Ile (Table 2).\n\n    The GJB2 variants c.79G>A (p.Val27Ile, rs2274084) and c.341A>G (p.Glu114Gly, rs2274083) found in Tuvinian patients and control individuals (Table 2) are known to be common in many Asian populations. The p.Val27Ile can be detected as a single variation as well as together with p.Glu114Gly, while p.Glu114Gly is very rarely found alone. These variants are mainly considered as benign polymorphisms due to their presence in deaf patients and controls; however, some studies have not excluded a possible association of these variants combination (in particular, related to their configuration - cis or trans) with HL. In vitro functional analyses were performed to clarify the possible role of p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in HL. Choung et al. (2002) investigated HeLa cells expressing single variant p.Glu114Gly and revealed their gap junction functioning similar to wild type cells. Tekin et al. (2010) showed that p.Val27Ile + p.Glu114Gly can significantly impair the function of the gap junctions but there were no differences in the p.Val27Ile + p.Glu114Gly haplotype frequencies between patients and control group. Choi et al. (2011) showed reduced activity of the p.Glu114Gly and the p.Val27Ile + p.Glu114Gly channels and suggested that only the p.Glu114Gly homozygote or compound heterozygote for p.Glu114Gly and other GJB2 pathogenic variant can cause HL. Thus, the pathogenicity of these variants remains controversial and is widely discussed in literature.\n\n    In our study, 17 Tuvinian patients and 15 control individuals were heterozygous for both p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly and none of the examined individuals had p.Glu114Gly separately from p.Val27Ile (Table 2). We investigated the phase (cis or trans) of p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in all individuals heterozygous for these variants by analysis of pedigrees of patients (if relevant data were available) or by sequencing of cloned fragments spanning the variants (Figure S1). In this way, we proved their cis-configuration in all cases where p.Glu114Gly was found. Thus, we postulated the presence of allele p.[Val27Ile;Glu114Gly] in our examined samples and estimated its frequency in patients and controls as 0.0408 and 0.0478, respectively. Since the frequency of p.[Val27Ile;Glu114Gly] was slightly higher in controls than in patients (although the difference was not statistically significant, p = 0.3969), we believe that there is no association of allele p.[Val27Ile;Glu114Gly] with HL, at least in our sample of patients.\n\n    Other GJB2 benign variants found in Tuvinians were c.571T>C (p.Phe191Leu, rs397516878, c.457G>A (p.Val153Ile, rs111033186), and c.608T>C (p.Ile203Thr, rs76838169). They are listed as rare polymorphisms preferentially detected in South Asian populations (dbSNP: ).\n\n    We found that 18 among all 220 examined patients (8.2%) are the carriers of a single recessive GJB2 pathogenic variant: 10 patients have single c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys), 6 patients - c.-23+1G>A, 1 patient - c.235delC, and 1 patient - c.109G>A (p.Val37Ile) (Table 2). We analyzed the pedigree and family data of patients with GJB2 monoallelic mutations. These patients represented eleven sporadic and seven familial HL cases. Among familial cases, four patients were descendants of both deaf parents (mating D x D), two patients had normal hearing parents (mating N x N), and one patient was from mating D x N (Table S1 and Figure S3).\n\n    A relatively large proportion of deaf individuals carrying only one pathogenic recessive GJB2 variant has been reported in many previous studies. Two main assumptions have been made to resolve this issue: (1) HL of such patients could be caused by an uncertain impact of the GJB2 gene (the presence of yet undetected other pathogenic GJB2 variants or variable penetrance of pathogenic GJB2 variant due to any modulating factors); (2) these patients are only the coincidental carriers of one pathogenic GJB2 allele and other factors (other genes or environmental impacts) cause their HL.\n\n    The coding region of the GJB2 gene and the region where splice donor variant c.-23+1G>A is located were routinely analyzed in majority of studies while the involvement of other GJB2 noncoding regions in HL has not been extensively investigated. The GJB2 gene has a 128 bp basal promoter including a TATA-box (TTAAAA) at -19 to -24 and 2 GC-boxes (CCGCCC) at -76 to -81 and -88 to -93 proximal to the transcriptional start site.\n\n    Several studies have reported that some noncoding GJB2 variants found in upstream and basal promoter regions, exon 1, and in splice acceptor site may contribute to HL. In addition, large deletions which either eliminate a hypothesized cis-acting regulatory element located far upstream of GJB2 or encompass the complete GJB2 and GJB6 genes have been reported.\n\n    We tried to clarify the cause of HL in Tuvinian patients with monoallelic GJB2 mutations. To search additional (probably missed in routine GJB2 analysis) alterations in the potentially regulatory region of GJB2, for 18 DNA samples of these patients we sequenced the 1009 bp region immediately upstream of GJB2 exon 1, which includes the basal promoter according to. We also reanalyzed the GJB2 region where the acceptor splice site of the only GJB2 intron is located.\n\n    All variations found in these GJB2 regions are presented in Table S1. No known pathogenic variants, including c.-684-675del (previously named as -493del10), were found in patients with monoallelic GJB2 mutations. We had also screened the most common deletion GJB6-D13S1830 in GJB2 heterozygous patients. None of these patients had this deletion.\n\n    Moreover, at the time of this study, our group began to test the SLC26A4 gene (OMIM 605646, 7q22.3) as a potential candidate gene for HL in GJB2-negative patients including 18 GJB2 heterozygous patients. Our preliminary results of SLC26A4 testing suggest that HL of at least 4 out of 18 (22%) patients with monoallelic GJB2 mutations was caused by homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for SLC26A4 pathogenic variants (Table S1), and consequently these patients are definitely the coincidental carriers of one pathogenic GJB2 allele.\n\n    Assuming that HL in patients with monoallelic GJB2 mutations is not associated with the GJB2 gene, the frequency of GJB2 mutations in a sample of non-DFNB1A patients (that is, patients that do not have biallelic GJB2 mutations) should be the same as the frequency in control samples. To test this hypothesis, we compared the frequencies of GJB2 pathogenic variants among non-DFNB1A patients and controls. To avoid probable bias due to the presence of related individuals in the cohort of Tuvinian patients, only unrelated patients selected by pedigree analysis (in total, 146 patients including 14 GJB2 heterozygous patients and 132 patients without the GJB2 mutations) were used for this calculation. Overall frequency of monoallelic GJB2 mutations among this group of patients was calculated to be 0.0479. Among control samples, 15 individuals were heterozygous for one of any GJB2 mutations (Table 2), and thus the total frequency of the GJB2 mutations was estimated as 0.0478 (Table 3). As a result, there were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of monoallelic GJB2 mutations among patients compared to the control sample.",
        "Conclusion": "    The data on spectrum and frequency of GJB2 gene variants were obtained for the first time for a large cohort of 220 deaf Tuvinian patients from the Tyva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia) and ethnically matched cohort of 157 subjects with normal hearing. The GJB2 biallelic pathogenic variants were found in 22.3% patients. We suggest that patients with monoallelic GJB2 mutations (8.2%) are coincidental carriers. High prevalence of rare pathogenic variant p.Trp172Cys was found in Tuvinians while other GJB2 mutations are shared by nearby populations. All obtained data provide important targeted information for genetic counseling of affected Tuvinian families and enrich current information on variability of GJB2 worldwide.",
        "Discussion": "    A high variability in the GJB2 mutation spectrum and frequencies has been reported among different worldwide populations. Nevertheless, the contribution of the GJB2 gene to HL (DFNB1A) remains unknown for certain ethnic groups in different regions of the world.\n\n    In this study, we present for the first time data on the spectrum and frequency of the GJB2 gene variants in a large cohort of Tuvinian patients with HL (n = 220) and also in unrelated normal hearing Tuvinians (n = 157) living in the Tyva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia). As the result of sequencing the GJB2 coding (exon 2) and non-coding (exon 1) regions with flanking sequences, a genetic diagnosis \"Nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness 1A (DFNB1A)\" due to the presence of biallelic GJB2 pathogenic variants was established for 22.3% (49 out of 220) patients. In total, 8.2% (18 out of 220) of patients were the carriers of a single recessive GJB2 pathogenic variant, and 69.5% (153 out of 220) of patients were GJB2-negative (without GJB2 pathogenic variants).\n\n    In total, 26 out of 49 DFNB1A-patients represent sporadic HL cases and 23-familial cases. Thus, the DFNB1A prevalence among all sporadic cases (n = 140) could be estimated as 18.6%, whereas the proportion of DFNB1A among familial cases (n = 80):as 28.8%. A lower frequency of DFNB1A in sporadic cases compared with familial cases may partly be explained by the inclusion of potential nongenetic HL cases. Based on the pedigree data, we found that 20 out of 23 familial DFNB1A-patients were from 11 unrelated families with two and more deaf siblings representing typical autosomal recessive type of HL inheritance, and although not all affected individuals in these families were examined by us, untested siblings in these Tuvinian families obviously have the same type of HL (DFNB1A). Two familial DFNB1A-cases were represented by patients who were descendants from non-complementary assortative matings (noncomp. mating D x D); therefore, HL of their untested deaf parents and siblings is also highly likely due to the GJB2 mutations. The last familial DFNB1A-patient was from mating D x N, representing a pseudo-dominant type of inheritance. Thus, based on pedigree data, we suggest that contribution of the GJB2 mutations to HL in deaf Tuvinians may be more than 22.3% due to probable DFNB1A-cases in untested affected relatives of examined patients, making our results applicable in genetic testing and counseling for a larger number of deaf patients in the Tyva Republic.\n\n    A large number of deaf individuals with a single recessive GJB2 pathogenic allele was detected in different studies, which complicates the molecular diagnosis for their HL. These findings may partly be explained by the fact that only the GJB2 coding region (exon 2) was tested in some older studies; therefore, potential pathogenic variations in the GJB2 non-coding or regulatory regions could be missed.\n\n    We thoroughly analyzed a group of 18 Tuvinian patients with a single recessive GJB2 pathogenic variant (8.2% out of all examined patients) and concluded that they are most likely the coincidental carriers of one pathogenic GJB2 allele and the cause of their HL could be attributed to mutations in other genes associated with HL or environmental impacts. The absence of differences in the frequency of monoallelic GJB2 mutations in patients and in the control sample may be additional evidence for this conclusion.\n\n    Ten GJB2 sequence variations including five pathogenic (p.Trp172Cys, c.-23+1G>A, c.235delC, c.299_300delAT, and p.Val37Ile) and five benign (p.Val27Ile, p.Glu114Gly, p.Phe191Leu, p.Val153Ile, and p.Ile203Thr) variants were identified among 220 examined Tuvinian patients.\n\n    A striking finding was the discovery of common GJB2 variant c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) found with frequency 62.9% among all GJB2 mutated alleles detected in deaf Tuvinian patients. The p.Trp172Cys carrier frequency in Tuvinian control group was estimated as 3.8%.\n\n    The c.516G>C substitution leads to a replacement of aromatic non-polar tryptophan by a small polar cysteine at conservative amino acid position 172 (p.Trp172Cys) in the second extracellular loop (E2, 155-192 amino acid residues) of protein Cx26 (Figure 1). Both extracellular loops (E1 and E2) of Cx26 molecules contain six conserved cysteines (C53, C60, C64 in E1 and C169, C174, C180 in E2) which form intramolecular disulfide bonds, playing an essential role in Cx26 hemichannel subunits docking. To our knowledge, the only other substitution of tryptophan at position 172 to arginine (p.Trp172Arg) caused by substitution c.514T>A has been described in the study by Mani et al. (2009) where two deaf patients from India were found to be homozygous for p.Trp172Arg. Mani et al. showed that Trp172Arg-mutated Cx26 exhibited normal plasma membrane localization but defective gap junction channel activity and the authors suggested that replacement of tryptophan 172, located in close proximity to at least two of three cysteine residues in E2, could result in defective docking of two opposing connexon hemichannels.\n\n    Other lines of evidences also support pathogenicity of c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys). A distinct segregation of homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for p.Trp172Cys with HL was revealed in affected Tuvinian families, and the p.Trp172Cys frequency among Tuvinian patients (0.1386) was significantly higher than in Tuvinian controls (0.019) (p < 10-8). Multiple in silico tools (PolyPhen2, PROVEAN, PANTHER, MutationTaster, FATHMM) predict a deleterious effect of p.Trp172Cys.\n\n    The p.Trp172Cys variant is yet unreported in the world human genome databases (dbSNP, Exome Variant Server, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), 1000 Genomes Project). Recently, we submitted c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) to ClinVar  as a 'likely pathogenic' variant (ClinVar accession number SCV000852065) because p.Trp172Cys meets main genetic criteria for such classification: (i) strong segregation of homozygosity for p.Trp172Cys with recessive HL in multiple affected subjects from unrelated families; (ii) significantly higher frequency of p.Trp172Cys in patients compared with ethnically matched controls; (iii) multiple computational predictions of deleterious effect of p.Trp172Cys; (iiii) extreme rarity of p.Trp172Cys.\n\n    Chronologically, the p.Trp172Cys variant was initially found in our previous study in one patient belonging to Altaians - indigenous Turkic-speaking people of the Altai Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia) neighboring the Tyva Republic and later Tekin et al. (2010) detected p.Trp172Cys in one Mongolian deaf patient from Mongolia. Our recent data obtained on extended sample of Altaian deaf patients revealed slightly elevated prevalence of p.Trp172Cys in Altaians whereas recent studies did not detect p.Trp172Cys among deaf Mongolian patients from Mongolia as well as in Mongolian patients living in China. Therefore, we suggest that p.Trp172Cys is the GJB2 mutation endemic to Tuvinians, indigenous Turkic-speaking people of the Tyva Republic, since apart from them p.Trp172Cys has only minor incidence in indigenous peoples living in the neighboring Altai Republic and Mongolia.",

        "Title": "    A novel nonsense variant in SUPT20H gene associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis identified by Whole Exome Sequencing of multiplex families",
        "Abstract": "    The triggering and development of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is conditioned by environmental and genetic factors. Despite the identification of more than one hundred genetic variants associated with the disease, not all the cases can be explained. Here, we performed Whole Exome Sequencing in 9 multiplex families (N = 30) to identify rare variants susceptible to play a role in the disease pathogenesis. We pre-selected 77 genes which carried rare variants with a complete segregation with RA in the studied families. Follow-up linkage and association analyses with pVAAST highlighted significant RA association of 43 genes (p-value < 0.05 after 106 permutations) and pinpointed their most likely causal variant. We re-sequenced the 10 most significant likely causal variants (p-value <= 3.78*10-3 after 106 permutations) in the extended pedigrees and 9 additional multiplex families (N = 110). Only one SNV in SUPT20H: c.73A>T (p.Lys25*), presented a complete segregation with RA in an extended pedigree with early-onset cases. In summary, we identified in this study a new variant associated with RA in SUPT20H gene. This gene belongs to several biological pathways like macro-autophagy and monocyte/macrophage differentiation, which contribute to RA pathogenesis. In addition, these results showed that analyzing rare variants using a family-based approach is a strategy that allows to identify RA risk loci, even with a small dataset.",
        "Introduction": "    Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is one of the most frequent autoimmune disease, affecting 0.3 to 1% of the worldwide population. Since the discovery of HLA locus as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases and specifically HLA-DRB1 for RA, more than 100 RA genetic factors were identified by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs). However, the effect of these genetic risk factors is too weak to explain the entire RA genetic component. Indeed, the heritability attributed to HLA-DRB1 shared-epitope (SE) alleles was estimated between 11% and 37%. While GWASs loci identified outside the HLA locus only explain an additional five percent of RA heritability.\n\n    Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the unknown part of this complex disease genetic component. One of these hypotheses relies on the fact that rare variants, which are poorly detected by GWASs, contribute to the risk of complex diseases. During the last decade, the development of Next Generation Sequencing has facilitated the detection of such variants. Hence, several studies used exome sequencing to identify rare to low frequency variants and evaluate their contribution to RA risk. For this purpose, two studies used a candidate gene approach based on exome sequencing. A first study, based on a population of European ancestry, showed an aggregation of non-synonymous rare variants contributing to RA risk into IL2RA and IL2RB loci. Another one, which studied Korean RA cases and healthy controls, allowed the identification of a weak association of rare missense variants in 17 different genes. In this latter group, the VSTM1 gene gave rise to an over-expression of its mRNA product in RA cases. However, both studies restricted their analysis to a limited number of candidate genes. Thus, they may have missed variations contributing to RA risk present outside the loci of those candidates. Other studies succeeded at identifying new RA risk loci by analyzing rare coding variants extracted after Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). Thus, an association between RA and PLB1 gene and several other genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as NDUFA7 and SCO1 has been observed using respectively a familial-based strategy and a case-control analysis. Both studies, conducted in non-European populations, support the strategy of sequencing the whole exome of RA cases to identify new RA candidate variants.\n\n    In our study, we aimed at identifying new loci associated with RA in the French population by focusing our research on rare coding variants. For this purpose, we sequenced RA cases and healthy relatives from 9 multiplex families which carried HLA-DRB1 risk alleles. However, even in the cases who carried the SE alleles, we can observe some clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Hence, we should be able to identify both genetic factors modulating the effect of HLA-DRB1 SE and acting independently from HLA loci.",
        "Methods": "    We studied 16 French RA multiplex families with at least 4 affected individuals per family carrying one or two HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) allele. Half of the families had only RA cases, whereas the other half had RA and/or other Autoimmune Diseases (AID: Lupus Erythematosus, Vitiligo, Sjogren syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) cases. Among the 110 recruited individuals within these families, 33 (30%) were reported as only affected by RA, 17 (15%) by RA and another AID, 15 (14%) by an AID different from RA and 45 (41%) were reported as unaffected. As discovery set, we selected 30 individuals belonging to 9 of the 16 previously described pedigrees, with a sufficient quantity of DNA for WES. This sample set consisted in 19 individuals with RA and 11 relatives not affected by RA (at least one per pedigree). All the remaining samples were included in the validation set.\n\n    Our study was approved by ethics committees of Hopital Bicetre and Hopital Saint Louis (Paris, France; CPPRB 94-40). Everyone provided a written informed consent for the participation in the study.\n\n    For statistical analysis with the Rare Variant Association Test (RVAT), we added 98 healthy controls extracted from the 1000 genomes project database. We chose CEU individuals (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry) for which whole exome sequences were generated using an Illumina platform.\n\n    The exons were captured in the discovery set with Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon kit (V5) which target the exome of more than 20,000 genes. Then, we sequenced those regions on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and mapped the reads to the human reference genome hg19 using BWA-MEM algorithm. Finally, we marked and removed the duplicates with Picard toolkit. The observed variance being low, we did not apply the recalibration to the WES data.\n\n    We called the variants using Haplotype Caller (HC) algorithm from the GATK suite in the targeted regions plus 150 bp up and downstream. Then, we filtered out SNVs and small indels (maximum length of 50 bp) according to the following criteria: total read depth DP < 12, mapping quality MQ < 30, variant confidence QD < 2 and strand bias FS score > 25. We annotated genotypes with an individual DP < 10 as missing before filtering out variants with call-rate < 95% with Plink1.9. Finally, we removed variants located in segmental duplications and repeated regions, such as described in RepeatMasker from UCSC.\n\n    We classified the remaining variants into rare variants (MAF < 1%), low frequency variants (1% <= MAF < 5%) and common variants (MAF >= 5%) according to their frequency in public databases. To evaluate these frequencies, we worked on 4 datasets extracted from: (1) the 1000 Genomes Project (2015 August); (2) the Exome Aggregation Consortium project (ExAC); (3) the Exome Sequencing project (ESP6500-6500 exomes); (4) the Complete Genomics project (CG69-69 individuals). We extracted the allele frequency in population with European ancestry when the information was available.\n\n    To investigate the predicted effect of the genetic variants on proteins, we annotated them with CADD phred-like score using ANNOVAR and with variant effect defined in SNPeff. The former is a score obtained from a model trained to separate evolutionary conserved variants, likely deleterious, from simulated variants, likely benign. And the latter evaluate the putative variant impact at the transcript level by using sequence ontology.\n\n    To identify possible genetic population stratification between the discovery set and the 98 CEU controls, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA). For this analysis, we used a subset of variants located on autosomes classified as neutrals and frequents. We defined as neutral a variant annotated \"LOW\" by SNPEff and with a CADD phred-like score < 5. Those variants were considered frequent if their MAF was superior or equal to 5%. In addition, we processed the selected variants prior to performing the PCA analysis to remove those not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HW) and those in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) with each other. We used Plink1.9 to remove variants with HWp-value < 0.01 and/or with LD >= 0.2. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated on unaffected individuals only. We finally applied the PCA on these variations with the R package SNPRELATE.\n\n    We first selected the rare variants (MAF <= 1%) observed in only one family with an in-house python script. Further, we chose variants segregating with RA within families and being absent from healthy relatives.\n\n    We tested the association of genes carrying at least one rare candidate variant using pVAAST. This software extends the rare variant association test (RVAT) VAAST to offer more power in the context of family-based studies. It provides a linkage-association score and a p-value for each evaluated gene and, a score for each variant carried by the gene to help the prioritization of these variants.\n\n    Considering the heterozygous nature of our candidate SNVs, we tested the candidate genes under a dominant model and set the maximum disease prevalence to 0.01, the world-wide prevalence of RA. In addition, we provided to pVAAST a file containing for each variant included in the analysis the maximum frequency observed in the four public databases described above. To evaluate the significance of the test, we authorized genotyping error and did not restrain penetrance value for gene-drop simulations. We estimated p-values by allowing pVAAST to perform up-to 106 permutations.\n\n    We ran a first time pVAAST for each of our candidate genes by including all the variants, rare and frequent, identified in our discovery set and/or in the 98 controls from 1000 genomes project). The genes significantly associated with RA (p-valuerun1 < 0.05) were selected for a second run of pVAAST using the same parameters plus a control of the sex co-variable. Then, for each gene with p-valuerun2 < 0.05, we selected the variant with the highest score. We ran pVAAST on this variant alone (run 3) and then on the gene without this variant (run 4).\n\n    The top 10 candidate variations, selected with the lowest p-values in the 3rd run of the pVAAST analysis, were re-sequenced in the validation set by using PGM System (Ion Personal Genome Machine). Primers were designed with the Ion AmpliSeq Designer to target the selected variants. We mapped the reads to the reference genome with BWA and recalibrated base score with BQSR tool from GATK suite. We then called variants in the strict limits of the targeted regions with HC and applied the same quality filters used for WES to the observed variants. For samples in both discovery and validation sets, we checked the concordance with whole exome data using VCFtools program package.\n\n    The candidate rare variant was also genotyped using a custom assay with a FAM or VIC reporter Dye at the 5'end of each TaqMan MGB probe and a non-fluorescent quencher at the 3'end of each probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Digital PCR (QX200 Droplet Digital PCR, Bio-Rad Laboratories, California, USA) was used to detect variant alleles. First, we analyzed members of the family in which the variant was characterized. Second, an independent sample of 188 trio families (one RA patient and his/her two parents from French European origin) was investigated to search for the variant, along with a positive and a negative control.",
        "Results": "    In this study, we sequenced the whole exome of 19 RA cases and 11 healthy individuals belonging to 9 multiplex families (discovery set). We applied a three steps strategy (Fig 1) to prioritize the sequenced loci and identify RA risk variants. First, we selected genes carrying rare variants which were family specific and with a high damaging predicted effect. Then, we assessed the potential combined effect of rare and low-frequency variants in these genes on RA risk using pVAAST. Finally, for the 10 genes with the strongest genetic association, we re-sequenced the leading effect variant in the validation set. This final step allowed us to validate their family specific co-segregation with RA.\n\n    The male: female ratio was 6:13 in the discovery set selected for WES (described in Table 1), which is similar to the ratio observed in RA affected populations. All the RA-affected individuals carried at least 1 shared epitope allele of HLA-DRB1 (18 of 19 had 2 SE alleles). Fifteen affected participants (79%) were positive for Anti-Citrullinated Peptide Antibodies (ACPA) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF), one (5%) was positive for the RF alone and two (11%) were negative for both. These two seronegative cases belonged to the same family (referred as family 5). The affected members of families 3, 4 and 9 were diagnosed with early RA (the mean age at diagnosis was of 31, 36 and 26 years old, respectively).\n\n    To check whether the 98 selected controls would not inflate the type I error during the burden test, we performed a PCA based on these samples and the discovery set. The genetic variability (<2.12% of the total variability) observed in the PCA (Fig 2) was due to the variability between the selected families and not between families and controls.\n\n    More than 91% of the targeted regions were sequenced with a coverage >= 30X. We extracted from these sequences 154,644 high-quality variants, including 64,747 (42%) in exons. We observed a mean of 26,679 exonic variants per sample and a SNV transition/transversion ratio equal to 3.01 which is consistent with previous studies.\n\n    Under the hypothesis that rare genetic variants linked to RA would segregate with the affected phenotype within the multiplex families, we selected in the pool of 21,507 rare variants (MAF < 1%), 2223 family-specific variants shared by all the RA-affected relatives (but absent from unaffected members). Knowing that rare variant with high predicted biological effect may contribute to the genetic predisposition of common disease, we extracted, from the 2223 variants, 77 SNVs with a high deleterious predicted effect on protein. We based our evaluation of this impact on SNPeff (\"HIGH\" or \"MODERATE\") and CADD phred score (>=30). All these 77 rare family-specific variants were heterozygous in affected carriers. They were detected in 77 different genes, not previously associated with RA.\n\n    We reduced the set of candidate loci to 49 genes (64% of the genes tested with pVAAST) which were significantly associated with RA (pVAASTp-value < 0.041 after 106 permutations). Considering the difference in RA prevalence rate between men and women, we performed pVAAST test while controlling for the variable \"sex\". A total of 43 genes still had a significant association with RA (pVAASTp-value < 0.05- see Table 2).\n\n    We categorized the 43 genes into two groups by looking at the association scores of their variants (Table 3). Sixteen genes (group 1) carried several variants, including our best rare candidate SNV, which contributed to the score of the gene (SNVscore >0). In the other twenty-seven genes (group 2), only the family-specific variant participated to the gene score. In all the 43 genes, the variant with the highest score is the rare family-specific SNV that was selected previously. Thereafter, we will refer to this variant as the candidate variant. To validate the leading effect of the candidate variants, we performed again the burden test by including first, only the candidate SNVs, and then, all variants except these candidates (results in Table 3). All the 43 candidate SNVs, except SUSD5: c.526C>T (pVAASTp-value = 0.21) and SMYD5: c.662G>A (pVAASTp-value = 0.067), were significantly associated with RA (pVAASTp-value <= 0.037). Concerning the test without the candidate SNV, three genes in the first group (20%), SUSD5, SMYD5 and MNS1, were still significantly associated with RA (pVAASTp-value <= 0.036). So, several rare variants in our dataset contributed to the association of these genes with RA. However, none of the genes in the second group were associated with RA after excluding the candidate variant. This observation confirmed that the observed RA-association within these genes was in fact due to the family-specific variant.\n\n    We selected the top 10 RA candidate variants, with the strongest association with RA, for re-sequencing to confirm their family specificity and their co-segregation with RA (Table 4). We analyzed further 8 out of 10 variants for which we were able to produce sequences and, we validated the familial specificity for all of them except PCCA. Four variants (in SUPT20H, SLC9A6, TIMM44 and NEK1 genes) were shared by all affected members in the families who carried them. However, only one candidate variant showed a complete segregation with RA. This variant is a heterozygous non-sense SNV, c.73A>T (p.Lys25*), located in SUPT20H gene which introduces a premature codon stop at the beginning of the gene (in the fourth exon) (Fig 3). This variant, not reported to date, has been deposited in ClinVar database prior to publication.\n\n    The SNV c.73A>T (p.Lys25*) carried by SUPT20H was genotyped using a customized assay and digital PCR. First, genotyping results in family 3 validated the presence of the rare A allele in affected members of the family and, its absence in unaffected members (Fig 4). Second, we investigated 188 RA patients (characteristics described in supplementary S1 Table) and 362 healthy parents from trio families using one affected member of family 3 as a positive control. No one of these samples showed the rare allele of this SNV.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we identified a novel SNV associated with RA, SUPT20H: c.73A>T(p.Lys25*), by performing WES in 9 multiplex RA pedigrees associated with HLA-DRB1 SE risk alleles. This nonsense variant had a complete penetrance in a family with rather young age at RA onset (meanonset-age = 31 years old). In addition, we showed with the RVAT pVAAST, that this variant was significantly associated with RA (pVAASTp-value = 3.78*10-3).\n\n    The SUPT20H gene, which has not been reported yet as a RA risk gene, is a member of the SAGA complex (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) gene family. It encodes for the p38 interacting protein (p38IP) which is predicted to contain a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), a PEST domain (Proline Glutamic acid Serine Threonine) and 2 serine rich domains. The SNV identified in this study occurring in the NLS domain, the truncated protein that could result from this variation would not have any functional domain.\n\n    Previous studies reported p38IP interactions with 3 different proteins. Indeed, the protein p38IP was shown to bind to and stabilize the protein GCN5, member of the SAGA complex, and thus stabilize the complex itself. In addition, in vitro analysis by Nagy and his colleagues showed that this p38-GNC5 SAGA complex binds to the promotor of Endoplasmic Reticulum stress-induced genes, such as GRP78, enhancing their transcription. Interestingly, previous studies have noted the role of the GRP78 gene in the pathogenesis of RA: the expression of this gene is increased in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and it promotes their proliferation. The protein p38IP, as indicated by its name, interacts also with p38 MAPK, a key protein for the development of RA. And it has previously been reported that this interaction inhibits monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Macrophages, present in a high concentration in inflamed synovial membrane and cartilage/pannus junction, contributes to the maintenance of the inflammation in RA patients. Finally p38IP interacts with the protein Atg9 and is required for its translocation from trans-Golgi system to endosome during starvation induced macro-autophagy. The protein p38 MAPK, which has higher affinity for p38IP than Atg9 inhibits this interaction and thus inhibits the autophagy process. This implication of p38IP in autophagy process is another argument that highlights the interest of studying the role of p38IP in the development of RA. Indeed, different studies reviewed by Dai and Hu demonstrated the role of autophagy in RA.\n\n    In addition to SUPT20H gene, we identified 42 genes significantly associated with RA (p-value < 0.05). We evaluated their association with the test implemented in pVAAST. This software combines a rare variant association test (RVAT) with a linkage score, thus it takes into account for the familial structure of our data. It allowed us to provide all the variants called in our samples without any a priori filtering based on biological knowledge, avoiding loss of information. Indeed, the RVAT incorporates a score evaluating for each variant the amino acid substitution impact and phylogenetic conservation information, allowing it to be robust in the presence of neutral and common variants. Indeed, depending on the chosen test, variants with opposite effects can lead to a decreasing power for the association test.\n\n    Among these 42 genes, we observed a variable number of variants contributing to the association signal: 16 genes with more than one contributing variant and 26 with only one. In the first group of genes, the potentially pathogenic variants covered the rare to low frequency spectrum. Three of these genes (named SMYD5, SUSD5 and MNS1), remained significantly associated with the disease without the candidate variants (pVAASTp-value < 0.036). The fact that the signal for the other genes was not significant anymore, when tested without the candidate SNV, could be explained by the lower number of contributing variants identified in these genes that reduce the RVAT power compared to genes with more causal variants (Table 2). In the second group, 8 genes (CCDC189, CDKN2B, SLC9A6, PHOX2A, SLC25A16, TMOD2, INTS5 and KCNA3) contained only one variant. So, as expected, the score of the association test with all identified variants (familial data and control data) and with the candidate variant only were identical (see Table 1).\n\n    We can highlight two limitations in this association analysis. First, we added as controls the variants of 98 individuals extracted from the 1000 genomes project database. And, although we chose individuals from the same population as our pedigrees (European) and sequenced on the same platform (Illumina), two aspects could have introduced bias: the exome capturing kit and the variant calling workflow. The first aspect can introduce variants specific to one of the dataset because not targeted by the kit used for the other one. To partially overcome this issue, we filtered out variants from the 1000 genomes dataset present outside the boundaries of our targeted exomes. But, due to the wide range of capturing kits used to produce the data presents in the 1000 genomes database, we did not filter the variants according to the regions targeted by the 1000 genomes project. For the second aspect, it has previously been shown that despite a few variant specific to a variant calling software, the concordance between the called variants is high (92% between HaplotypeCaller, Samtools and FreeBayes). In addition, the PCA, performed on all the individuals included in the association test (Fig 2), shows that the observed genetic variability is mostly related to the intra-family specificity, not to the choice of the 98 CEU controls, comforting our choice of controls. Second, individuals of the discovery set have different clinical characteristics (such as sex, age at diagnostic, and ACPA status). These differences, if not controlled, could have introduced bias in the association analysis. Since, the sex was the sole information known for both discovery set and CEU controls, we were only able to control for this co-variable.\n\n    Finally, we previously suggested that rare variations present in the genome of RA cases in addition to HLA-DRB1 SE could modulate the effect of this latter, leading to RA cases with different clinical characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we could investigate the interactions between HLA-DRB1 and new RA risk genes, such as SUPT20H. For this analysis, we would need to perform a study including both individuals carrying and not carrying HLA-DRB1 risk alleles.\n\n    Further work is also needed to identify new RA risk genes that may have been missed in this study because we used stringent criteria to select the candidate SNVs. Indeed, we removed variants: with incomplete penetrance, segregating in several families and not shared by all affected relatives of a given family.\n\n    In conclusion, we identified a new rare nonsense SNV, SUPT20H: c.73A>T (p.Lys25*), associated with RA, by combining linkage and association analysis with pVAAST. Neither the gene nor the variant was previously associated with the disease. But the review of the literature about SUPT20H gene and its product, p38IP, supports the idea that this gene is involved in the pathogenesis of RA. Further work, with in vitro functional studies, needs to be done to evaluate the pathogenic effect of this new SNV and to validate its role in the different processes previously described in the context of RA. In addition, further studies need to be done to validate the other RA risk loci identified in this study, in particular SMYD5, MNS1 and SUSD5 genes in which we observed an aggregation of rare variants.",

        "Title": "    Characteristics of maturity onset diabetes of the young in a large diabetes center",
        "Abstract": "    Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by a mutation in a single gene, often not requiring insulin. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency and clinical characteristics of MODY at the Barbara Davis Center. A total of 97 subjects with diabetes onset before age 25, a random C-peptide >=0.1 ng/mL, and negative for all diabetes autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2, ZnT8, and IAA) were enrolled, after excluding 21 subjects with secondary diabetes or refusal to participate. Genetic testing for MODY 1-5 was performed through Athena Diagnostics, and all variants of unknown significance were further analyzed at Exeter, UK. A total of 22 subjects [20 (21%) when excluding two siblings] were found to have a mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (n = 4), glucokinase (n = 8), or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (n = 10). Of these 22 subjects, 13 had mutations known to be pathogenic and 9 (41%) had novel mutations, predicted to be pathogenic. Only 1 of the 22 subjects had been given the appropriate MODY diagnosis prior to testing. Compared with MODY-negative subjects, the MODY-positive subjects had lower hemoglobin A1c level and no diabetic ketoacidosis at onset; however, these characteristics are not specific for MODY. In summary, this study found a high frequency of MODY mutations with the majority of subjects clinically misdiagnosed. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for MODY in youth with antibody-negative diabetes.",
        "Introduction": "    Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by a mutation in at least one of the genes known to affect insulin production or secretion. There are at least 13 genes whose mutations have been associated with specific subtypes of MODY. The most commonly occurring MODY subtypes are caused by mutations in glucokinase (GCK) (MODY2) and in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) (MODY3) 1. GCK- and HNF1A-MODY each account for approximately 20-50% of all MODY cases. Approximately 10% of MODY cases are from mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A) (MODY1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B (HNF1B) (MODY5). An additional 20% of MODY cases are because of newly discovered or as yet unknown gene mutations for which testing is not yet commercially available 2.\n\n    Typically, GCK-MODY presents clinically as stable, asymptomatic, mild hyperglycemia 3 while HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY present with hyperglycemia and the typical symptoms of diabetes such as polyuria/polydipsia, weight loss, and rarely diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) 4, 5. In addition to hyperglycemia, patients with HNF1B-MODY may have renal abnormalities 6, 7. The clinical diagnosis of MODY has been based upon the following criteria: family history of diabetes, insulin independence, and onset by age 25 yr. However, there can be significant clinical overlap of the MODY subtypes with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) 1.\n\n    Recently, some studies have attempted to determine clinical and biochemical markers that are specific and sensitive for subtypes of MODY in children. Gandica et al. found HNF1A and GCK mutations in 5 of 10 (50%) subjects who met a clinical diagnosis of T1DM and at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: negative autoantibodies to at least 1 of either GAD65, IAA, or ICA, hemoglobin A1c level (HbA1c) <7% with an insulin requirement of <0.5 U/kg/day, or at least 3 consecutive generations of family members with diabetes 8. Pihoker et al. evaluated 586 subjects with diabetes, not selected for by referral type or family history, and found that the MODY-positive group had fewer T2DM features such as lower body mass index (BMI) z-score, lower prevalence of acanthosis nigricans, and a higher insulin sensitivity, but no significant differences in parental history of diabetes or symptoms at presentation 9. As genetic testing for MODY can be cost prohibitive for many patients, it is necessary to determine which clinical and biochemical characteristics would be more predictive of a positive MODY diagnosis in a given patient 10.\n\n    It is important that the diagnosis of MODY be established in affected patients, as there can be significant treatment and hereditary implications depending on the subtype. HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY can be successfully treated with oral sulfonylurea medications as opposed to injected insulin 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and GCK-MODY, caused by an altered set point for glucose sensing, may not require any treatment or alterations in diet 16. However, during pregnancy, insulin therapy may be recommended to prevent obstetric complications caused by maternal hyperglycemia 17. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware of the complications associated with the specific subtype of MODY a patient has in order to implement appropriate monitoring and subsequent treatments. Once a mutation is identified in an index case, affected family members should be tested to guide their treatment and clinical monitoring.\n\n    The goal of this study was to estimate the frequency of MODY at the Barbara Davis Center (BDC), University of Colorado, among antibody-negative subjects with diabetes onset less than age 25 and conserved C-peptide, as well as to assess the clinical characteristics that could distinguish those with genetic mutations for MODY from those without pathologic MODY mutations.",
        "Methods": "    The BDC is a large, university-affiliated diabetes center that sees approximately 4000 patients with the diagnosis of T1DM and 180 patients with the diagnosis of T2DM in a year. Subjects actively followed at the BDC who had onset of diabetes before the age of 25 yr, a random C-peptide >=0.1 ng/mL, and were negative for all diabetes autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2, ZnT8, and, if performed within 14 d of onset, IAA) were eligible for this study and offered genetic testing. Patients typically have diabetes autoantibodies measured at diagnosis or with their first visit to the BDC, if they had been diagnosed elsewhere. C-peptide values were measured for this study, once a subject was determined to have negative autoantibodies. Of the 118 potential participants, 21 were excluded because of iatrogenic diabetes from medications or diabetes secondary to cystic fibrosis, Prader Willi, Fanconi's anemia, other syndromes, or refusal to participate. A total of 97 participants were therefore recruited into the study. At the study visit, subjects and/or parents completed a questionnaire to provide additional information on diabetes, medications, and family history of diabetes or autoimmune disorders. Participants had their height and weight measured, and for all those less than 20 yr old, BMI was calculated and converted to a Z-score via the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) algorithm. Using Z-scores for subjects less than 20 yr of age and the raw BMI for subjects over 20 yr of age, the subjects were then classified as 'underweight', 'normal weight', 'overweight', and 'obese', as per the CDC's standard guidelines 18. Blood samples were obtained, and a HbA1c was measured by a DCA Vantage Analyzer (Siemans, Munich, Germany). Informed consent and assent when applicable were obtained from each study subject. The Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board approved all study protocols. A retrospective chart review of the electronic medical record was used to obtain additional clinical data, such as initial HbA1c, initial blood sugar, presence or absence of ketones, DKA and weight loss at diagnosis, and initial pharmacologic treatment.\n\n    Autoantibodies to insulin, GAD65, IA-2, and ZnT8 were measured in the Clinical Immunology Laboratory at the BDC using previously described radio-immunoassays 19. Random serum C-peptide (ng/mL) was measured by ELISA immunoassay (ALPCO, Salem, NH, USA) in the BDC Clinical Immunology Laboratory.\n\n    Genetic testing for mutations in HNF1A, HNF4A, GCK, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), and HNF1B was performed for all participants through Athena Diagnostics. DNA sequencing was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of purified genomic DNA, followed by Sanger DNA sequencing of the gene's coding region. In addition, at least 10 bases of intronic DNA on either side of each exon containing the highly conserved exon-intron splice junctions were also sequenced. All abnormal sequence variants were confirmed using bi-directional sequencing. The panel used for this study did not include multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for deletions, which was not available at the beginning of this study.\n\n    All variants of unknown significance (VUS) were further analyzed for potential pathogenicity by the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, UK. Variants were checked for inclusion in the Human Gene Mutation Database Professional database, dbSNP, the Exome Sequencing Project, the 1000 genomes project, NCBI's PubMed, and the Exeter Laboratory's MODY gene mutation database. Substituted nucleotides and amino acids were checked for conservation across a minimum of five mammalian species, birds, frog, and fish. In silico analysis of missense variants was undertaken using the SIFT, PolyPhen2, Align GVGD, and Grantham distance programs (accessed through Alamut v2.3, Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France). Synonymous and intronic variants were assessed for potential pathogenic effect on splicing using the splicing prediction programs SpliceSiteFinder-like, MatEntScan, NNSPLICE, GeneSplicer, and Human Splicing Finder (accessed through Alamut v2.3, Interactive Biosoftware). Variants were classified as benign, likely benign, uncertain, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic based on an assessment of all available evidence obtained, according to practice guidelines for the evaluation of pathogenicity and reporting of sequence variants published by the UK's Association for Clinical Genetic Science 20.\n\n    Analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism  6 and SAS. Statistical comparisons were made between the MODY-positive and MODY-negative groups using the Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. A two-tailed p-value with an alpha level for significance was set at 0.05. In addition, we performed analyses excluding the two related siblings and found similar results (data not shown).",
        "Results": "    A total of 20 (21%) subjects, excluding siblings, were found to have pathogenic mutations causative of MODY (MODY-positive). There were an additional two siblings of MODY-positive subjects who were also found to be MODY-positive. Mutations in HNF1A (MODY3) were the most commonly found mutations in the MODY-positive subjects (46%), followed by mutations in GCK (MODY 2) at 36%, and mutations in HNF4A (MODY1) at 18% (Table 1). None of the subjects tested positive for pathologic mutations in PDX1 (MODY4) or HNF1B (MODY5). Of the 22 total MODY-positive subjects, 9 (41%) were found to have VUS determined to be likely pathogenic, including one sibling pair. Additionally, one of these nine subjects had two VUS in GCK (MODY 2). A total of 4 MODY-positive subjects (18%) had been clinically diagnosed with MODY at the time of the study, but only 1 of the 22 MODY-positive subjects had the correct MODY subtype diagnosis (4.5%).\n\n    Table 2 compares the clinical characteristics between MODY-positive and MODY-negative subjects at their initial diagnosis of diabetes. At onset of diabetes, the MODY-positive subjects were significantly older (mean age 13.8 vs. 10.6 yr, respectively, p = 0.008) and had a lower HbA1c [7.9 vs. 10.6% (62.5 vs. 92.2 mmol/mol), respectively, p < 0.0001] compared with the MODY-negative subjects. MODY-positive subjects were less likely to present at diagnosis with ketones (14 vs. 60%, respectively, p < 0.0002) or weight loss (9 vs. 59%, respectively, p < 0.0001). None of the MODY-positive subjects had DKA at diagnosis while 27% of the MODY-negative subjects presented with DKA (p = 0.053). Most subjects who were MODY-negative were started on insulin at diagnosis (84%), while the MODY-positive subjects were more likely to not be started on any pharmacologic treatment at diagnosis (52%).\n\n    Characteristics between MODY-positive and MODY-negative subjects at study visit are shown in Table 3. Diabetes duration at study visit was similar between the MODY-positive and MODY-negative subjects (mean 4.2 vs. 4.0 yr). Both the HbA1c at study visit and the maximum HbA1c recorded, from diagnosis to study visit, were lower in the MODY-positive group compared with the MODY-negative group [6.5 vs. 7.7% (48.0 vs. 60.1 mmol/mol), p = 0.004, and 8.4 vs. 10.7% (68.0 vs. 93.2 mmol/mol), p < 0.0001, respectively). Ninety-five percent of MODY-positive subjects had a first-degree relative diagnosed with diabetes compared with 35% of the MODY-negative subjects (p < 0.0001). At the time of the study visit, the MODY-positive subjects were significantly more likely to be prescribed only oral agents (27%) or no pharmacologic therapy (36%) compared with the MODY-negative subjects who were taking insulin in 82% of the cases. The MODY-positive subjects at the study visit were more likely to have a clinical diagnosis of unspecified diabetes (50%) or MODY (18%), whereas the MODY-negative groups were mainly diagnosed as T1DM (76%) or T2DM (15%). However, only one of the 22 MODY-positive subjects had the correct MODY subtype diagnosis (4.5%).\n\n    In total, 27 VUS were reviewed. Nine novel variants were considered to be likely pathogenic mutations, while 17 variants were considered likely benign polymorphisms (Table 4), and one variant (HNF1A p.Glu508Lys) was determined as uncertain pathogenicity. As the subject's mother had the same mutation and a diagnosis of diabetes as well, a trial of sulfonylureas while weaning insulin was attempted without success, suggesting that this variant is not pathogenic.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In a large diabetes center, we found a high (21%) incidence of mutations associated with MODY in subjects with negative diabetes antibodies and preserved serum C-peptide levels at a mean 2.2 yr after diabetes diagnosis. This is a higher incidence than has been described in prior studies which found incidence rates of MODY to be <10% 8, 9. These prior studies only tested for three diabetes autoantibodies (GAD, IAA, and IA-2); however, this study also tested for ZnT8 antibodies, the presence of which increases the sensitivity of diagnosing T1DM 22, 23. The higher incidence of MODY in this study may be reflective of different inclusion criteria with the necessity of having three to four negative diabetes antibodies and a preserved C-peptide. Another factor that may have contributed to the higher incidence of MODY in this study is that the population was predominantly white, while the SEARCH population, which found an incidence of 8%, had a higher percentage of minority ethnicities 9. As T2DM is found to occur more often in minority ethnicities than in Caucasians, this study may have included less T2DM subjects 24.\n\n    MODY subtype frequencies vary by regions based on screening policies, ethnicity, and age 4, 25, 26. As has been described previously in the UK as well as in the USA, mutations in HNF1A were the most commonly occurring MODY subtype, followed by mutations in GCK and then by mutations in HNF4A 2, 9, 27. No mutations in HNF1B or PDX were found in this population. Nine subjects had novel mutations considered highly pathologic for MODY, including one sibling pair with the same mutation and one subject having two novel GCK mutations. Interestingly, one subject had an HNF1A variant (c.1522G>A; p.Glu508Lys) that could not be classified as benign or likely pathogenic. With the subject and family's informed consent and very close monitoring, we attempted to transition the child to an oral sulfonylurea and off of injected insulin; however, 3 months later, while on 0.16 mg/kg/d of glipizide, the subject's average blood glucose was 300 and HbA1c increased to 12.7% (115.3 mmol/mol), necessitating the re-institution of insulin and suggesting that this variant is not causative of MODY.\n\n    While we had 22 subjects who were genetically diagnosed with MODY through this study, only 4 had previously been clinically diagnosed with MODY (18%), and only 1 of these was diagnosed with the correct subtype of MODY (4.5%). Accurate diagnosis is necessary to direct care for the patient, facilitate appropriate diagnosis of relatives, and predict possible future complications and prognosis. Patients with HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY are sensitive to sulfonylureas and can be transitioned from insulin onto sulfonylureas with improvement in glycemic control and quality of life 11, 12, 14, 28, 29.\n\n    MODY-positive participants were significantly more likely to have a first-degree relative with diabetes as is consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance of MODY. We had one subject with negative diabetes antibodies and a preserved C-peptide who was found to have a mutation in HNF4A despite having no family history of diabetes. This likely represents a de novo mutation, which has been estimated to occur in approximately 1.2% of referrals for MODY testing 30.\n\n    There was no difference between the MODY-positive and MODY-negative subjects in regards to gender, ethnicity, or weight. Participants who were MODY-positive were significantly more likely to be older at diagnosis of diabetes and to have lower HbA1c levels. However, the ranges overlapped for each characteristic, and there was not an absolute age or HbA1c level for which the diagnosis of MODY was excluded. A notable exception however is that none of the subjects with GCK mutations had a HbA1c level over 7% (53 mmol/mol), indicating that HbA1c may be used to rule out GCK-MODY. Similarly, Steele et al. have determined that none of their patients with GCK-MODY under the age of 40 yr had a HbA1c level over 7.3% 3. At diagnosis of diabetes, none of the MODY-positive subjects had DKA compared with 27% of MODY-negative subjects. The frequency of DKA at onset in our MODY-negative participants is similar to the frequency described in youth with T1DM at diagnosis 31. One subject found to have a mutation in HNF1A subsequently went on to develop DKA. As patients with HNF1A-MODY continue to make endogenous insulin for years, they have a low likelihood of developing DKA; however, this study, in addition to prior published reports of DKA in patients with HNF1A-MODY, confirms that the presence of a history of DKA does not rule out HNF1A-MODY 1, 32.\n\n    Some of the strengths of this study include a systematic, unbiased method of selecting subjects for genetic testing of MODY, rather than a referral system, and genetic testing for all current clinically available MODY subtypes (MODY 1-5). Limitations of this study include a relatively small number of subjects with MODY, and the fact that random C-peptide was used instead of fasting or peak C-peptide from a mixed meal tolerance test. However, random C-peptide is clinically easier to obtain and has been shown to correlate well with fasting and stimulated C-peptide 33. In addition, random C-peptide has been used in several studies to classify types of diabetes in children 34, 35.\n\n    In conclusion, in this population of subjects with preserved C-peptide and negative diabetes autoantibodies, we found a high incidence of MODY with the majority of subjects clinically misdiagnosed. Additionally, a high proportion of genetic mutations were novel. As none of the clinical characteristics alone were sufficient to confirm or rule out MODY, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for MODY in youth with antibody-negative diabetes and preserved C-peptide.",

        "Title": "    A novel nonsense mutation in the NOG gene causes familial NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder",
        "Abstract": "    The human noggin (NOG) gene is responsible for a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder (NOG-SSD), which include proximal symphalangism, multiple synostoses, stapes ankylosis with broad thumbs (SABTT), tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome, and brachydactyly type B2. Some of these disorders exhibit phenotypes associated with congenital stapes ankylosis. In the present study, we describe a Japanese pedigree with dactylosymphysis and conductive hearing loss due to congenital stapes ankylosis. The range of motion in her elbow joint was also restricted. The family showed multiple clinical features and was diagnosed with SABTT. Sanger sequencing analysis of the NOG gene in the family members revealed a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation (c.397A>T; p.K133*). In the family, the prevalence of dactylosymphysis and hyperopia was 100% while that of stapes ankylosis was less than 100%. Stapes surgery using a CO2 laser led to a significant improvement of the conductive hearing loss. This novel mutation expands our understanding of NOG-SSD from clinical and genetic perspectives.",
        "Introduction": "    The human noggin (NOG) gene consists of a single exon and encodes a secreted protein that is critical for normal bone and joint development. Noggin binds to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily and prevents its binding to the cognate receptor. This interaction affects a number of developmental processes such as morphogenesis and body patterning, middle ear formation, and apoptosis in digital and interdigital regions. Mutations in the NOG gene result in aberrant functioning of the noggin protein, which is linked to various autosomal dominant syndromes characterized by proximal symphalangism (SYM1: MIM #185800), multiple synostosis syndrome (SYNS1: MIM#186500), tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome (TCC: MIM#186570), brachydactyly type B2 (BDB2: MIM#611377), and stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes (SABTT: MIM#184460) (i.e., Teunissen-Cremers syndrome). Precise diagnosis is complicated by the overlapping clinical features of these syndromes. Given the variable phenotypic manifestations within and among families with the same mutations, the term NOG-related symphalangism spectrum disorder (NOG-SSD) has been proposed.\n\n    In the present study, we describe a novel nonsense mutation in the NOG gene causing familial NOG-SSD and report the associated clinical and molecular findings as well as the results of surgery for conductive hearing loss.",
        "Methods": "    Medical history including hearing loss, symphalangism, dactylosymphysis, brachydactyly, and hyperopia as well as results of a clinical examination were obtained for four members of a Japanese family, three of whom were affected (proband, father, and grandmother), and one who was unaffected (mother). Auditory function was assessed by pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and the stapedius reflex test. High-resolution computed tomography scans were carried out to identify any middle and inner ear abnormalities, and X-rays images of the hand were obtained to identify any fusion of the bones. Stapes surgery was performed in the proband to restore hearing. The father had undergone stapes surgery in the right ear at a different hospital in his childhood.\n\n    Study participants and the parents of the child provided written, informed consent. The research protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Sapporo Medical University, Japan.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using the Gentra Puregene Blood kit (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany). PCR primers specific for the NOG exon (GenBank NG_011958.1) and the amplification program were as previously reported. Sanger sequencing data were analyzed using SeqScape software v.2.6 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and DNASIS Pro (Hitachisoft, Tokyo, Japan). The variant allele frequency was evaluated using the dbSNP 146 public database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), 1000 Genome Browser (http://browser.1000genomes.org/index.html), Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) (http://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SnpDB/index.html), NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500) (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), and Exome Aggregation Consortium v.0.3 (ExAC) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org). The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) v.2015.4 (BIOBASE, Beverly, MA, USA) was searched to determine whether the variant had been previously reported as being associated with diseases.",
        "Results": "    The family had five affected individuals (Figure 1). The proband (IV: 1) was a 6-year-old girl of non-consanguineous Japanese parents. She was referred to our hospital at the age of 5 years because of bilateral hearing loss that had starting in early childhood. Physical and X-ray examinations of the hands showed symphalangism and short intermediate phalanges (brachydactyly) in both fifth fingers (Figure 2a). The range of motion in her elbow joint was restricted, and she was unable to touch her shoulders with her hands (Figure 2f).\n\n    She had undergone surgical treatment for dactylosymphysis in the second and third toes of both feet in her early childhood. An ophthalmologic examination revealed hyperopia. She had experienced bilateral progressive hearing loss from early childhood, and pure tone audiometry at age 6 showed bilateral conductive hearing loss (Figure 3a). At this time, she also underwent stapedotomy using a Teflon piston, which detected ankylosis of the stapes footplate with hypertrophy of the anterior and posterior crus; the footplate was also distant from the facial nerve (Figure 4). The patient's postoperative hearing threshold improved to 25 dB in the operated ear, and her hearing level has remained stable for more than 3 years since the surgery (Figure 3b).\n\n    The proband's father (III: 3), who underwent right stapedotomy at 13 years old at another hospital, had bilateral hearing loss since early childhood, and pure tone audiometry showed conductive hearing loss on the left side and an improvement of hearing level in the operated ear (Figure 3c). His hearing condition had not worsened for 15 years. Physical examination of his hands showed brachydactyly in both fifth fingers (Figure 2b), and he could not touch his shoulders with his hands due to a restricted range of motion in his elbow joints (Figure 2d). He had undergone surgical treatment in his early childhood for dactylosymphysis in the second and third toes of both feet. An ophthalmologic examination revealed hyperopia.\n\n    The proband's grandmother (II: 2) did not show conductive hearing loss (Figure 3d); however, she had also had surgery during childhood for dactylosymphysis in the second and third toes of the both feet. Physical examination of her hands did not reveal brachydactyly (Figure 2c). As in the case of the other two patients, she was unable to touch her shoulders with her hands due to restricted range of motion of the elbow joint (Figure 2e). An ophthalmologic examination showed hyperopia.\n\n    Pilonidal cysts were found in the proband (IV: 1) and her father (III: 3).\n\n    A genetic analysis detected a heterozygous c.397A>T (p.K133*) variant of the NOG gene in the proband (IV: 1) as well as in II-2 and III-3 (Figure 5), which has not been previously reported according to the HGMD and is not registered in other databases such as dbSNP, 1000 Genome Browser, HGVD, ESP6500, or ExAC. Given that other nonsense mutations such as p.Q110* (rs104894614) and p.L129* (rs104894613) have been reported to be pathogenic, the p.K133* variant is presumed to produce a truncated noggin protein (132 of 232 amino acid residues) with disrupted function.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The present study identified a novel nonsense mutation in the NOG gene in a family with NOG-SSD. The clinical features included proximal symphalangism in one of the fingers, dactylosymphysis of the toes, brachydactyly, pilonidal cyst, hyperopia, and conductive hearing loss as a result of stapes ankylosis. The most common phenotypes in the family were dactylosymphysis (5/5), hyperopia (5/5), and hearing loss (4/5).\n\n    Heterozygous NOG mutations have been identified in several syndromes including SYM1, SYNS1, TCC, BDB2, and SABTT. To date, a total of 45 human variations in NOG have been reported; the term NOG-SSD was put forth to describe these syndromes, which exhibit shared but also some distinct clinical features. In our patients, the prevalence of dactylosymphysis and hyperopia was 100% while that of stapes ankylosis was less than 100%.\n\n    Mutations reported in the literature to date are shown in Table 1. NOG gene mutations including frameshift, missense, and nonsense mutations as well as deletions and insertions have been previously identified in patients with NOG-SSD. NOG gene mutations are mainly dominant; however, de novo mutations have also been reported in sporadic cases. Therefore, genetic investigations are sometimes needed to clarify the pathogenesis of conductive hearing loss due to stapes ankylosis with stiffness of the proximal interphalangeal joints in patients with no familial history. NOG gene mutations are autosomal dominant, and is presumed to be manifested as either haploinsufficiency:which can lead to an aberrant gradient during development:or may have a dominant-negative effect due to the defective protein. The NOG gene has a critical role in joint formation and bone development, and mutations in noggin compromise the folding stability of the protein and cause defective binding to BMP. Noggin-mediated inhibition of BMP signaling is regulated by a two-step process: noggin binds to BMP and prevents its binding to the BMP receptor, with the complex binding instead to heparin sulfate proteoglycan, a major cell surface and extracellular matrix proteoglycan. Sulfate induces the release of the noggin-BMP complex at the cell surface, increasing the accessibility of BMP to its receptor and thereby activating BMP signaling. A docking simulation of noggin to heparin analog and estimation of the change in interaction with p.R136C mutation demonstrated that the positively charged R136 in the heparin-binding site is required for retention of the noggin-BMP complex by negatively charged heparin sulfate proteoglycan at the plasma membrane. The altered binding of mutant noggin and heparin sulfate proteoglycan may lead to hyperactivation of BMP signaling, ultimately leading to ankylosis of the joints and stapes.\n\n    Stapes surgery for conductive hearing loss due to NOG mutations leads to an improvement in hearing for most patients, as confirmed in the present study. However, it is necessary to exercise caution when performing stapes surgery for this syndrome due to the risk of bony reclosure of the oval window after surgery. It was previously reported that the hearing level of patients who underwent stapes surgery deteriorated during the follow-up period for this reason, which resulted in a dislocated piston. Therefore, partial or total stapedectomy has been proposed as an alternative procedure to prevent reclosure of the oval window. In the present case (IV: 1), we performed stapedotomy using a CO2 laser. There have been no reports to date of CO2 laser-assisted stapedotomy for treatment of stapes ankylosis due to NOG mutations; therefore, the surgical outcome must be carefully assessed after long-term follow-up.\n\n    In conclusion, we identified a novel nonsense mutation in the NOG gene (p.K133*) in a NOG-SSD family. NOG gene mutations lead to aberrant functioning of the noggin protein, giving rise to a large spectrum of clinical features. Our patients exhibited a phenotype that included proximal symphalangism, dactylosymphysis, brachydactyly of the toes, pilonidal cyst, hyperopia, and conductive hearing loss. Stapes surgery for conductive hearing loss is a good therapeutic option; however, patients should be carefully monitored over the long term. This novel mutation and clinical manifestations contribute to a better understanding of NOG-SSD.\n\n    The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

        "Title": "    Identification of Channel-lining Amino Acid Residues in the Hydrophobic Segment of Colicin Ia",
        "Abstract": "    Colicin Ia is a bactericidal protein of 626 amino acid residues that kills its target cell by forming a channel in the inner membrane; it can also form voltage-dependent channels in planar lipid bilayer membranes. The channel-forming activity resides in the carboxy-terminal domain of ~177 residues. In the crystal structure of the water-soluble conformation, this domain consists of a bundle of 10 alpha-helices, with eight mostly amphipathic helices surrounding a hydrophobic helical hairpin (helices H8-H9). We wish to know how this structure changes to form a channel in a lipid bilayer. Although there is evidence that the open channel has four transmembrane segments (H8, H9, and parts of H1 and H6-H7), their arrangement relative to the pore is largely unknown. Given the lack of a detailed structural model, it is imperative to better characterize the channel-lining protein segments. Here, we focus on a segment of 44 residues (573-616), which in the crystal structure comprises the H8-H9 hairpin and flanking regions. We mutated each of these residues to a unique cysteine, added the mutant colicins to the cis side of planar bilayers to form channels, and determined whether sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate reagents could alter the conduction of ions through the open channel. We found a pattern of reactivity consistent with parts of H8 and H9 lining the channel as alpha-helices, albeit rather short ones for spanning a lipid bilayer (12 residues). The effects of the reactions on channel conductance and selectivity tend to be greater for residues near the amino terminus of H8 and the carboxy terminus of H9, with particularly large effects for G577C, T581C, and G609C, suggesting that these residues may occupy a relatively constricted region near the cis end of the channel.",
        "Introduction": "    The colicins compose a family of proteins, made by Escherichia coli bacteria, which can kill competing strains of E. coli. Each colicin has three functional domains: the central R domain binds to a receptor in the outer membrane; the amino-terminal T domain interacts with target cell proteins to move the carboxy-terminal domain (C domain) to the inner membrane; and the C domain carries the lethal activity. Colicins kill either by an enzymatic mechanism or by forming a voltage-dependent channel in the inner membrane. All channel-forming colicins have, near the carboxy terminus, a distinctive hydrophobic segment of 31-49 consecutive uncharged amino acid residues, which stands out from the otherwise highly charged sequence. Several crystal structures have shown that this segment is roughly equivalent to the helix 8-helix 9 (H8-H9) hydrophobic hairpin, which is enclosed by the other eight helices of the C domain in its water-soluble conformation.\n\n    We have determined some of the steps in channel formation by colicin Ia in planar lipid bilayer membranes, which most likely apply, at least qualitatively, to the other channel-forming colicins as well. First, after colicin that was added to the aqueous solution bathing the cis side of the membrane binds to the membrane, the H8-H9 hairpin inserts into the membrane in a voltage-independent manner to form two transmembrane segments. Then, in response to a cis-positive voltage, an additional portion of the C domain inserts, so that parts of helices H1 and H6-H7 contribute the third and fourth transmembrane segments. Concomitantly, helices H2-H5 are translocated across the membrane to the opposite, trans side. This voltage-dependent insertion results in the opening of a conductive channel through the membrane.\n\n    Despite the delineation of the four transmembrane segments, the structure of the open colicin channel remains obscure. This is primarily due to the paradox of too little protein to make the channel, as discussed previously. In brief, it appears that a single colicin monomer forms the channel with four transmembrane segments, and the pore diameter is at least 8-9 A. Furthermore, under some conditions colicin Ia C domain can form a channel with only three transmembrane segments, yet the channel diameter apparently remains large (unpublished data). It is even possible for large, folded peptides (up to 26 A diameter), attached to the amino terminus of C domain, to be translocated across the membrane. On its surface, this seems impossible. The most appealing proposal to resolve this paradox is that the membrane lipids may form a substantial part of the channel lining; however, the supporting evidence is indirect at best. Given these uncertainties, we cannot predict the locations of the four transmembrane protein segments a priori:whether all, some, or none line the pore:much less their proximity to one another, or the shape of the pore. There is evidence for colicin E1 channels, however, that mutations or chemical modifications that change the charge of certain residues in or near the hydrophobic segment, as well as in another position, produce changes in ionic selectivity, suggesting that the modified side chains may line the channel. Of course, there is always the concern that the mutations acted by perturbing the channel structure. Although the hydrophobic segment appears to insert as a helical hairpin, no clear alpha-helical periodicity was established.\n\n    To clarify the situation, we now turn to the substituted cysteine accessibility method, which has been used to identify pore-lining residues in many channel proteins. In this method, a series of unique cysteine residues in a membrane channel is probed with a water-soluble, sulfhydryl-specific reagent. If the reaction influences the channel conductance or other properties, it indicates that the cysteine residue is exposed to the aqueous solution, rather than being buried in the lipid or the protein interior. In some cases, the pattern of reactivity has allowed the secondary structure of the channel-lining segments to be deduced. Here, we examine the 40 residues, 573-612, in the hydrophobic segment of colicin Ia (plus the four succeeding residues, 613-616, for reasons that shall be made clear). In the colicin Ia crystal structure, residues 573-575, 580-594, 597-612, and 614-616 constitute the end of helix H7, all of H8, all of H9, and the start of H10, respectively; the intervening residues 576-579, 595-596, and 613 belong to interhelical loops. We shall attempt to determine to what extent these secondary structural elements are preserved in the open channel state.",
        "Methods": "    All of the single cysteine mutants in colicin Ia were made using a plasmid, pKSJ101, which has the colicin Ia operon (the colicin promoter region, colicin gene and immunity protein, from residue 711 to 3,347 of the Col Ia sequence), cloned between the unique EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC19. Mutations were created using Agilent Technologies' QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The notation we use throughout for the mutant proteins, e.g., T573C, means that the threonine at residue 573 was mutated to cysteine.\n\n    Wild-type colicin E1 and the mutant C505A were purified from plasmids described previously. Plasmid pKSJ331 was used for mutagenesis, using the QuikChange kit, to create colicin E1 mutant D473N. pKSJ331 was pUC19 with the colicin E1 operon cloned by PCR between the unique KpnI and BamHI sites of pUC19. The forward primer for the colicin operon included residues 5,015-5,035 of the ColE1 plasmid sequence, and the reverse primer included residues 499-479. Thus, the kil or lysis gene of the E1 operon was not included, so the mitomycin C-induced cultures did not lyse.\n\n    Both colicin Ia and colicin E1 wild-type and mutant proteins were purified essentially as described previously, generally from 250- or 500-ml cultures. Dialyzed streptomycin-sulfate supernatants in 50 mM sodium borate, pH 9.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 2 mM EDTA were purified on 1- or 5-ml pre-packed HiTrap CM FF columns (GE Healthcare). After washing the column extensively with the loading buffer, colicin was eluted with 0.3 M NaCl in the same buffer. All of the mutant proteins were expressed at wild-type levels and exhibited normal cytotoxic activity, as determined by spot-testing serial dilutions on sensitive indicator lawns. Yields were usually ~6 to 7 mg/250 ml culture. Stock solutions of proteins were stored frozen at -80 C. Aliquots thawed for use in the experiments were refrozen and kept at -20 C and were stable for months.\n\n    Planar bilayers were formed from asolectin lipid using the Montal-Mueller technique, as described previously. For most experiments, the bathing solution in the cis and trans compartments (1 ml each) was either 100 mM or 1 M KCl, with 5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. This pH was chosen empirically as one at which reactions of mutant colicin Ia channels with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives could be readily observed. In a few experiments, we used a gradient of 500 versus 50 mM TEACl, along with 5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM HEPES, and TEAOH to pH 7.1. TEACl (Fluka) was used without purification, and TEAOH (Sigma-Aldrich) was purified as described previously. The voltage-clamp recording system was as described previously. The voltage is defined as the potential of the cis compartment, relative to that of the trans compartment. Ag/AgCl electrodes were connected to the bath compartments by 3 M KCl/3% agar bridges. DTT solutions were prepared daily from 1 M stock, which was stored at -20 C. For macroscopic experiments, the colicin stock solution (~1 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of 1% octylglucoside, plus DTT to 5 mM, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. For single-channel experiments, the octylglucoside was frequently omitted. However, low-conductance channels were sometimes observed that resembled the channels formed by C domain fragments. In this case, incubating with octylglucoside preferentially increased the number of normal-conductance channels, and single-channel experiments could be performed using high dilutions.\n\n    The addition of even low concentrations of DTT to the bath compartment sometimes destabilized the membrane, causing a noisy increase in conductance or membrane breakage. This problem could be solved by reforming the membrane. Consequently, as a preemptive measure, 5 muM DTT was typically added to one compartment before colicin addition. (This is comparable to the amount of DTT added with the colicin.) In a few experiments, tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), another sulfhydryl-reducing agent, was used in place of DTT.\n\n    In specified experiments, colicin channels were held open with a positive voltage while the cis compartment was perfused with fresh bath solution to remove excess colicin. To avoid the possibility of cysteine oxidation (due to interaction between two colicin molecules, for instance), 5 muM DTT was typically included in the perfusing solution.\n\n    The MTS reagents used were [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] MTS bromide (MTSET), sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) MTS (MTSES; Toronto Research Chemicals and Biotium), methyl MTS (MMTS; Sigma-Aldrich), and N-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-N'-[(2-methanethiosulfonyl) ethyl] urea (MTS-glucose; Toronto Research Chemicals). The chemical formulas for the MTS reagents have the form CH3(SO2)S-R, where R is CH2CH2N(CH3)3+ for MTSET, CH2CH2SO3- for MTSES, CH3 for MMTS, and CH2CH2NH(CO)NH(C6H11O6) for MTS-glucose. The product of reaction with Cys-SH is Cys-S-S-R. Stock solutions of 20 mg/ml were stored at -20 C. Typically, the final concentrations in the bath solution were 200 mug/ml for MTSET and MMTS and 600 mug/ml for MTSES and MTS-glucose (i.e., all ~1-2 mM).\n\n    Hg(C6F5)2 was used as a Cl- carrier to determine the Cl- potential in experiments with a TEACl gradient.\n\n    The program Acquire (5.0.1; Bruxton Corp.) was used for data acquisition with a PCI-1200 A/D board (National Instruments); the sampling interval was 6 ms, but only every 10th point was plotted in the figures. Igor Pro (5.0.5.7; WaveMetrics, Inc.) was used for data analysis.",
        "Results": "    The aim of this paper is to identify the residues in helices 8 and 9 that line the channel lumen. To this end, only the single-channel MTS experiments are relevant. To rationally proceed with these, however, we first screened the residues in helices 8 and 9 with macroscopic MTS experiments. Any residues not giving a macroscopic effect were excluded from single-channel scrutiny, and even some of those giving a macroscopic effect were also excluded for reasons given below. In a sense, we could have presented just the single-channel data, but we feel it is useful to include the macroscopic data so that the reader can fully appreciate the issues involved in determining the channel-lining residues.\n\n    Each of the 40 colicin Ia mutants with a single cysteine in the hydrophobic segment, 573C through 612C, generated a voltage-dependent macroscopic conductance in planar bilayers, similar to that of wild-type colicin Ia. We wanted to test each of these mutants for sensitivity to MTS reagents. Colicin Ia channels are moderately selective for cations over anions at pH 7.2, so we chose the cationic MTSET for the initial series of experiments, in 100 mM KCl buffer. The typical experimental protocol was to open channels quickly at +70 mV, step to +50 mV, at which the opening rate was slow, wait a couple of minutes to establish a steady trend, and then add MTSET to one of the bath compartments. Fig. 1 shows a representative experiment with N578C, in which trans MTSET caused a decrease in conductance of ~25%. The effects of trans and cis MTSET on all the mutant channels are summarized in Fig. 2. Not surprisingly, wild-type colicin Ia, which has no cysteine residues, showed no effect of cis or trans MTSET.\n\n    Before proceeding further, we need to make a few observations about the likely causes of these macroscopic effects: namely, changes in single-channel conductance versus effects on channel gating. In the simplest case, we expect an effect on the single-channel conductance to satisfy the following conditions. (1) The change in current should have a quasi-exponential time course (after a stirring delay), corresponding to the rate of reaction. With two exceptions (G593C and S594C, see below), all the responsive mutants satisfied this condition. (2) MTSET should cause a decrease in conductance if it acts by either a direct electrostatic effect or a steric effect on K+ permeation. (3) Cis and trans MTSET should have similar effects if the cysteine residue is accessible from both sides. All three conditions were satisfied by G577C, N578C, T581C, A585C, I598C, G602C, M605C, G609C, and possibly L586C (which had a very small trans MTSET effect); these are likely candidates for single-channel conductance effects of MTSET. If we relax condition 3 to allow for reaction from only one side, we can add A582C and F588C on the trans side and T573C, I574C, A606C, T608C, and I612C on the cis side. (We caution the reader on the interpretation of the cis side-only effects: MTSET may have reacted with colicin in the cis solution, thereby preventing new channels from forming, or it may have reacted in a closed state in which the hydrophobic hairpin is accessible to the cis side of the membrane [see, for example, ].) Mutants satisfying neither condition 2 nor 3 were S589C, G593C, S594C, G597C, and Y601C. For these, trans MTSET caused a conductance increase, whereas cis MTSET either caused a decrease or had no effect. At this point, a change in channel gating seems the most likely explanation for these MTSET effects. (For instance, reaction with trans MTSET may trap the hydrophobic hairpin in a transmembrane orientation, whereas cis MTSET may trap it near the cis side of the membrane, thus favoring an open or closed channel state, respectively.) This applies in particular to G593C and S594C, which did not even satisfy condition 1; the main effect of trans MTSET was, apparently, to produce a large, steady increase in the channel opening rate. As we shall see, these preliminary assignments are not perfect, but they make a good starting point. The remaining 19 mutants showed no effect of MTSET from either side.\n\n    In preparation for single-channel experiments, selected mutants were tested with MTSET in 1 M KCl buffer (Table I). The effects were generally comparable to the effects in 100 mM KCl buffer, although for several mutants (T573C, G577C, N578C, A582C, and A585C) they were smaller in magnitude. This is to be expected, due to the increased screening of the appended positive charge by the electrolyte. For several other mutants (T581C, F588C, M605C, G609C, and I612C), the effects in 0.1 and 1 M KCl were similar in magnitude, and for Y601C the effect appeared to be somewhat larger in 1 M KCl.\n\n    These mutants were also tested with MTSES; some showed an increase in conductance, whereas others showed a decrease (Table I). We expect a conductance increase from the electrostatic effect of the appended anionic group on K+ conduction; a decrease suggests that steric effects dominate. Thus, the decreases seen with G577C, T581C, and G609C indicate that their cysteine residues are situated in a narrower part of the pore than the other residues.\n\n    The issue of the relative pore diameter was further pursued by using the smaller, uncharged reagent MMTS. (Unlike MTSET and MTSES, MMTS is membrane permeant, but that will not affect our conclusions.) The effects of MMTS on all of these mutants are summarized in Table I. The larger conductance decreases observed for G577C and G609C support the notion that they are in a more constricted region of the pore. Significant decreases were also seen for T581C, M605C, N578C, and A585C, ordered from greatest to least effect, as well as an increase for Y601C. We also determined the effects of trans MTS-glucose, a larger, uncharged reagent, on G577C, T581C, and G609C (Table I). In each case, MTS-glucose caused a large decrease in conductance, exceeding the effect of MMTS, as expected.\n\n    Colicin Ia channels have a rather broad distribution of conductance values (see, e.g.,). All of the mutants listed in Table I had, before reaction, a more or less normal single-channel conductance in 1 M KCl buffer, typically in the range of 40-60 pS at +50 mV and slightly larger at higher voltages. For example, we measured the G609C single-channel conductance (from the initial series of channel openings at the beginning of macroscopic experiments) as 52 +- 6 pS (n = 33 channels in eight experiments). Of the other channels that we inspected, I574C had the largest conductance, ~80 pS at +50 mV.\n\n    The mutant channels that displayed macroscopic MTSET effects were examined at the single-channel level. 11 of these mutants responded to MTSET, MTSES, or MMTS with a step change in the single-channel conductance (Table I; red bars in Fig. 2). Representative examples are shown of the reactions of F588C channels with MTSET (Fig. 3 A), A585C with MTSES (Fig. 3 B), and G609C with MMTS (Fig. 3 C). The single-channel effects were more or less in line with the macroscopic effects for these mutants, although the single-channel effects were typically somewhat larger in magnitude. Consistent with our a priori expectations, MTSET caused a conductance decrease for almost all of the channels listed in Table I. The exception was Y601C, which, rather surprisingly, showed an increase in single-channel conductance, comparable to the increase seen in macroscopic experiments. This indicates that reaction with MTSET caused a change in the channel conformation. The increases and decreases induced by MTSES matched the macroscopic results. The mutants showing the largest macroscopic effects of MMTS gave quite similar decreases in single-channel conductance. Although we have not made an extensive study of the issue, all the reactions were manifested as single-step conductance changes, suggesting that there was only one reaction, and hence only one cysteine residue, per channel; i.e., the channel is a colicin monomer.\n\n    In contrast to the 11 mutants in Table I that displayed a single-channel conductance change upon reaction, several other mutants that showed macroscopic MTSET effects did not readily reveal an effect on single-channel conductance. These included L586C, S589C, G593C, and G602C. In addition, the response to MTSET of several mutants was inconsistent with a simple electrostatic or steric mechanism of action. This suggested that the macroscopic effects might be due instead to changes in the rate of channels opening or closing. (In experiments with mutant G593C at the single-channel level, we could see that trans MTSET indeed caused a marked increase in the channel opening rate.) We sought to minimize these effects on channel gating by means of the following experimental modifications. (1) We perfused the cis compartment with fresh bath solution to remove excess colicin, as described in Materials and methods. (2) We held the membrane potential at larger values (60-80 mV) to ensure that open channels would stay open. (3) If the effect persisted in 100 mM KCl buffer, we also tried 1 M KCl buffer, with the idea that greater screening of the charge on MTSET might reduce its effect. This was justified because we ultimately wanted to use the 1 M buffer for single-channel experiments. For several of these mutants, cis perfusion at +50 mV led to a slow decrease in conductance, confirming the need to use larger voltages to keep the channels open. When the following mutants were tested using this protocol, the MTSET effects were eliminated: in 100 mM KCl buffer, L586C (cis and trans), S589C (cis), G593C (cis), S594C (trans), G597C (trans), and A606C (cis); and in 1 M KCl buffer, I574C (cis), S589C (trans), G593C (trans), I598C (cis and trans), G602C (trans), and T608C (cis) (Fig. 2, blue bars). Even with this protocol, mutant G602C showed a large, extremely slow decrease (t1/2 ~400 s) in response to cis MTSET at potentials up to +80 mV. Because this effect was so slow, we did not pursue it further in single-channel experiments. As positive controls, F588C channels gave their usual trans MTSET effect and M605C channels their usual cis MTSET effect with this protocol in 1 M KCl buffer, and T573C, A585C, and I612C showed their cis MTSET effects when they were tested in 100 mM KCl buffer.\n\n    In general, the effects of cis MTSET that we have now eliminated provide no information about the structure of the open channel because they could have been due to reaction with colicin in the cis solution. On the other hand, the effects of trans MTSET on S589C, G593C, S594C, and G597C are more informative. Although these residues are not located where they can influence the single-channel conductance, they are accessible to trans MTSET in some membrane-inserted state of the colicin. Presumably, trans MTSET reaction with closed channels was able to trap the H8-H9 hairpin in a transmembrane orientation, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward channel opening; cis perfusion eliminated this effect by removing the pool of closed channels.\n\n    The effect of MTSET on the colicin Ia channel's selectivity for K+ versus Cl- was assayed by measuring the reversal potential (Vr) with a KCl gradient across the membrane of 100 mM cis/1 M trans, both sides at pH 7.2. An example with G577C is depicted in Fig. 4. The Vr changed from +30 mV before MTSET addition to -18 mV after, reflecting a large change in selectivity from favoring cation permeation to preferring anions. The results of a more extensive series of measurements are shown in Table II. Although many of the reactive positions showed only minor changes in selectivity upon reaction with MTSET, quite large effects were observed for G577C, T581C, and G609C channels. Significant but smaller effects were also seen for T573C, N578C, Y601C, and I612C; a marginal effect was observed for I598C, which had also shown a marginal conductance effect. The G577C, T581C, and G609C channels were also probed with MTSES and MTS-glucose. Reaction with MTSES increased the selectivity for K+ over Cl-, as expected, but the effects were small and in most cases not statistically significant. Reaction with MTS-glucose caused a moderate decrease in K+ selectivity. Although it is not clear why attaching glucose, via a thioethylurea linker, should have this particular effect on selectivity (or any effect, for that matter), the effect indicates that these residues are part of the selectivity-determining region of the channel, at least after their reaction.\n\n    We also examined whether an uncharged MTS reagent placed in this apparently constricted region of the channel could reduce the permeability of a larger cation, TEA+. With a salt gradient of 500 mM cis/50 mM trans TEACl, pH 7.1, G577C channels gave a Vr of 18 +- 1 mV (n = 5), indicating greater permeability for Cl- than for TEA+. Reaction with MMTS or MTS-glucose caused significant conductance decreases, but the effect on Vr was minimal, with at most a 5-mV increase. Similar results were obtained for G609C channels. For comparison, the anion carrier Hg(C6F5)2 gave a Cl- potential of 40 mV. Thus, surprisingly, inserting a bulky group into the channel did not substantially reduce the permeability to TEA+.\n\n    Because the pattern of reactivity exhibited an alpha-helical periodicity extending to residue 612 at the end of the hydrophobic segment (see Discussion), we tested the next four residues, representing an additional turn of the putative helix, to see if the helical pattern continued. We found that in 0.1 M KCl, pH 7.2 buffer, cis MTSET had a small effect on D613C and E614C channels; the percentage decreases in macroscopic conductance were 7 +- 1 and 9 +- 4, respectively, with n = 3 experiments for each mutant. S615C and L616C channels were not affected by cis MTSET, and none of the four mutant channels showed any effect of trans MTSET. These results brought the helical pattern to an end (see Discussion).\n\n    Wild-type colicin E1 has a cysteine at residue 505, in helix H9 of the channel-forming domain; using a standard sequence alignment, this is seen to correspond to residue G609 of colicin Ia (Fig. 5). If the colicin Ia and E1 channels have a similar structure, we would expect MTS reagents to have similarly large effects on colicin E1 as on colicin Ia mutant G609C. We found that, indeed, MTSET (unpublished data) and MMTS (Fig. 6 A) caused a large conductance decrease in macroscopic experiments with wild-type colicin E1 channels. (As a control, we checked that trans and cis MMTS and MTSET had no effect on the channels formed by colicin E1 mutant C505A, which has no cysteine residue.) Fitting the decay as a sum of two exponential components, we obtained percentage decreases in conductance Af = 28 +- 6 and As = 61 +- 9, with respective time constants tauf = 138 +- 26 s and taus = 1,222 +- 164 s (n = 3). (We have defined the parameters so that Af + As equals the total percentage conductance decrease, rather than 100%.) This reaction of MMTS with wild-type colicin E1 was remarkably slow compared with colicin Ia G609C, for which single-exponential fits gave tau = 7 +- 2 s (n = 2). We hypothesized that the slow reaction of MMTS with colicin E1 residue C505 might be due to the proximity of a negatively charged side chain from residue D473. (The corresponding residue in colicin Ia, G577, is not charged; Fig. 5.) That is, the negative charge might shift the pKa of cysteine 505, so its sulfhydryl group would spend less time in the reactive, ionized state. To test this conjecture, we examined the reaction of MMTS with colicin E1 mutant D473N, in which the negatively charged aspartate is replaced by a neutral asparagine. We found that the rate of reaction was much faster (Fig. 6 B). Two-exponential fits gave percentage decreases in conductance Af = 36 +- 2 and As = 29 +- 6, with respective time constants tauf = 12 +- 2 s and taus = 1,231 +- 587 s (n = 3). The main effect of the mutation was to speed up the faster component of the decay by more than a factor of 10. (There was also a significant decrease in the amplitude of the slower component.) It seems likely that the faster component represents the rate of MMTS reaction, which instantly reduces the single-channel conductance, whereas the slower component corresponds to an alteration in gating of the reacted channels. Under this interpretation, MMTS caused quite similar decreases in the open channel conductance of wild-type colicin E1 (28%), D473N (36%), and colicin Ia G609C (35%; see Table I). Furthermore, the time constants of reaction were similar for colicin E1 D473N (12 s) and colicin Ia G609C (7 s), whereas it was slower for wild-type colicin E1 (138 s). These results support our hypotheses that colicins Ia and E1 have similar open channel structures, and that E1 residue D473 is close enough to residue C505 to influence its reactivity.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We have used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to identify channel-lining residues in the colicin Ia hydrophobic segment. A series of mutant colicins was prepared, with each residue (573-612) substituted by a unique cysteine. (Wild-type colicin Ia has no cysteine.) Of these 40 positions, 11 exhibited a step change in single-channel conductance upon reaction with MTSET: T573C, G577C, N578C, T581C, A582C, A585C, F588C, Y601C, M605C, G609C, and I612C (Fig. 3 and Table I). MTSET also caused significant changes in ionic selectivity for seven of these mutant channels (T573C, G577C, N578C, T581C, Y601C, G609C, and I612C; Table II). In particular, G577C, T581C, and G609C channels showed large effects on selectivity. Reaction with MTSES, MMTS, and MTS-glucose also points to these three residues as part of a relatively constricted region of the pore. For most of these mutant channels, the sign of the conductance change caused by MTSET, MTSES, and MMTS was consistent with the attached group having a direct electrostatic or steric effect on the permeant ions. Considering the short Debye length in a 1-M salt solution (3 A), this indicates that the cysteine residue is located in the channel. The exception was Y601C, for which each of these reagents produced a conductance increase; this presumably reflects an alteration in the channel structure upon reaction. For each reactive mutant, different MTS compounds produced different effects on the channel conductance (Table I). This demonstrates that the MTS compounds acted directly upon the colicin's cysteine residue, as opposed to having some indirect action, such as scavenging the small amount of DTT in the bath compartment and thereby allowing the cysteine to oxidize.\n\n    In the crystal structure of colicin Ia, the hydrophobic segment consists largely of an alpha-helical hairpin formed by helices H8 (580-594) and H9 (597-612) of the C domain. It is natural to ask whether these segments remain helical in the open channel state. In helical-wheel diagrams for H8 and H9, the reactive positions cluster on one face of each helix, suggesting that the answer is yes (Fig. 7). This pattern extends from G577C to F588C in H8 and from Y601C to I612C in H9, in each case a stretch of 12 residues representing three turns of a helix. (We cannot be certain that the cysteine residue in mutant Y601C actually lines the channel, due to the anomalous effects of MTS reaction at this position. However, the kinetics of its response to MTS reagents [unpublished data] were comparable to those of the other mutants listed in Table I, and were much faster than those of its neighbor, G602C, so it seems reasonable to tentatively suppose that Y601 does, in fact, line the channel). This corresponds to a rise of 11 x 1.5 A = 16.5 A along the helical axis. We suppose that residues I574 and S589 are outside the limits of H8, in the open channel state, so they do not interrupt the helical face in Fig. 7. Residue V584 lies within the postulated helical region, however, so, in the simplest interpretation, its failure to show a reaction defines one boundary of the water-accessible face of H8. Assuming a simple geometry for the exposure of H8 to the aqueous channel, this implies that residue T573 cannot be part of H8 in the open channel state. (If, alternatively, V584C failed to react due to some local steric factor, such as occlusion by Y601, then T573 might be part of H8, although the lack of an MTS effect on I574C argues against this.)\n\n    It is worth mentioning two additional mutants that displayed suggestive, but not conclusive, effects of MTSET. Cis MTSET affected the macroscopic conductance of G602C, even after excess colicin was perfused away, and when a large holding potential was used to discourage channel closing. This could be interpreted as evidence for an effect on the single-channel conductance; however, the extreme slowness of the effect raises suspicion that the reaction might actually have occurred during brief sojourns in the closed state. In selectivity experiments, the reaction of MTSET with I598C appeared to produce a small change in Vr. Although the change was not statistically significant, it is possible that further experiments could show it to be a real effect. In any case, it is not critically important to our channel model whether or not these two mutants had MTS effects; we can say I598 is outside the limits of H9, and G602 is at or near the boundary of the water-exposed face of the helix.\n\n    Up to this point, we have not identified the end of helix H9 in the open channel structure. Our macroscopic experiments on mutants D613C through L616C help to provide an answer. Mutant D613C reacts with cis MTSET, but this does not provide much information because residue D613 is located on the boundary of the reactive face of H9 in Fig. 7; either a reaction or a failure to react could be rationalized in terms of the helical model. If residue E614 were part of H9, it would be located on the opposite face of the helix, relative to the other reactive residues (Fig. 7), so the reaction of E614C with cis MTSET suggests that it is not part of H9. Thus, there is no evidence that H9 extends beyond residue I612 in the open channel state, and there is evidence against its extending as far as residue E614. For both D613C and E614C, of course, single-channel experiments would be required to conclusively show that MTSET reacts in the open channel state; however, because of the small magnitude of the macroscopic effects we did not attempt this. If we consider extending H9 farther, the failure of mutant S615C to show an effect of MTSET is consistent with the helical model. If H9 extended as far as L616, this residue would be located on the reactive face of the helix (at the same position as I598C in Fig. 7); the failure to observe any MTSET effect with L616C suggests that this is not part of the helix.\n\n    Since the first crystal structure of a colicin C domain was determined, most researchers have accepted that the H8-H9 alpha-helical hairpin inserts in a transmembrane orientation, with the H8-H9 loop moving to the trans side of the membrane. A mutational study of colicin E1 provided convincing evidence that the hydrophobic segment maintains a hairpin structure during channel formation in vivo. Our model for the colicin Ia hydrophobic segment, based on the accessibility of an attached biotin to streptavidin, placed residue 594 on the trans side and residue 577 on or near the cis side of the membrane in the open channel state, as well as in at least one closed state. In the present work, the pattern of reaction with cis and trans MTSET supports and refines this model. Mutants T573C and I612C react only with cis MTSET; G577C, N578C, T581C, A585C, M605C, and G609C react from either side; and A582C, F588C, and Y601C react only with trans MTSET.\n\n    Fig. 8 shows our model for the secondary structure and orientation of the hydrophobic segment in the open channel state. The residues that (when mutated to cysteine) showed an effect of MTS reagents on the single-channel conduction properties are colored according to their accessibility to cis or trans reagent. For the most part, the arrangement of reactive residues makes sense, with those near the cis interface reacting only with cis MTS, those in the middle reacting with either cis or trans MTS, and those near the trans interface reacting only with trans MTS. The main anomaly is that A582C reacts only with trans MTS, whereas A585C, which should be nearer to the trans side, reacts from either side. Perhaps this could be explained if A582C is actually not exposed to the pore, but instead is accessible from the trans side via an aqueous crevice that does not extend to the cis side.\n\n    We cannot specify the secondary structure of the segment between H8 and H9, that is, residues S589 through G597, because MTSET reaction at these positions does not appear to affect the single-channel conductance or selectivity. At several of these positions, however (S589C, G593C, S594C, and G597C in particular), reaction with trans MTSET appeared to increase the number of open channels, most likely by trapping the H8-H9 hairpin in a transmembrane orientation, thereby increasing the opening rate (compare with). This implies that these residues either line the channel or are otherwise exposed to the trans solution.\n\n    Our model for helices H8 and H9 in the open channel state has some similarity to their arrangement in the aqueous crystal structure. The reactive positions fall not only on one face of each helix, but essentially on one side of the helical hairpin from the crystal structure (Fig. 9). This suggests that the two helices may remain packed together when the channel forms. Whether they retain their relative position in the axial direction is not so clear. Our results with MMTS suggest that residues 577 and 609 are both located in the narrowest part of the pore. If these two residues are in register, H8 and H9 would have to shift by two helical turns, relative to the crystal structure, which has residue 609 in register with 585.\n\n    As the site of reaction is moved from the cis side toward the trans side, there appears to be a smooth trend in the magnitude of MTS-induced changes in the single-channel conductance: first, for a short stretch, there is an increase in magnitude (from I612C to G609C in helix 9) and then a decrease in magnitude over a longer stretch of protein (from G577C to T581C to A585C to F588C in helix 8, or from G609C to M605C in helix 9). (We are only counting the residue that gives the largest MTS effect in each helical turn, so 578C and 582C are neglected here. 601C is also omitted because its reaction appears to alter the channel structure.) This suggests that the pore may have an hourglass shape, with the narrowest part near residues G577 and G609. Our model places this constricted region near the cis end of the pore (Fig. 8). We note that this is the opposite of a previously proposed model for the colicin Ia channel, based on the effects of nonelectrolytes on the single-channel conductance, which places the constricted region nearer the trans end of the channel (75% of the distance from cis to trans). Conceivably, the two models could be reconciled if we found some additional material to form a wide cis-side entrance, such as the other transmembrane protein segments (H1 and H6-H7) or membrane lipids.\n\n    As mentioned above, the reactive stretch in each of the putative helices, residues 577-588 and 601-612, corresponds to a length of 16.5 A along the helical axis. If we include residue 598, that would extend one helix to 21.0 A. Either way, this is much too short to span the typical 30-A thickness of the bilayer hydrocarbon region. One possible explanation is that helices H8 and H9 extend farther into the loop region (residues 589-597), as drawn in Fig. 8, but we do not detect MTS reactions here because the pore is too wide.\n\n    It appears that the cysteine residues of G577C, T581C, and G609C occupy a relatively narrow region of the pore, given the substantial conductance decreases attributable to the steric effects of reaction with MMTS, MTS-glucose, and MTSES. Hence, one might reasonably expect that such a reaction would completely block the permeation of a larger ion. Contrary to this expectation, we found that reaction of G577C and G609C with MMTS or MTS-glucose had little effect on the permeability of TEA+, relative to that of Cl-. A possible explanation is that, as suggested previously, the channel has both small- and large-diameter open states. The predominant small-diameter state would mostly determine the single-channel conductance, whereas the rarer large-diameter state would account for the low permeability to large ions. (In single-channel experiments, however, we have not been able to identify such states directly, suggesting that the rate of transition between the states would have to be too fast for our recording system to resolve.)\n\n    In this context, we note some intriguing parallels between colicin and P2X receptor channels. The selectivity of P2X receptor channels appears to change with prolonged activation by ATP: only small ions permeate initially, but later larger ions such as N-methyl-d-glucamine can pass. Whether this phenomenon is due to the dilation of a single pore or the gating of separate conductive pathways has not been settled. There is also evidence that the trimeric P2X receptor channel is lined only by the second transmembrane segment, TM2, for a total of three transmembrane segments per channel, similar to the low-conductance state of the colicin Ia C domain channel.\n\n    Fig. 5 shows an amino acid sequence alignment of the colicin Ia hydrophobic segment with those of colicins Ib, E1, and K. These colicins are well aligned throughout their entire C domains, so we can reasonably imagine that their channel structures may be essentially identical. A preliminary way to test this hypothesis is to examine which residues in the colicin Ia-uncharged segment correspond to charged residues in other colicins. We would expect the charged side chains to reside in an aqueous environment, and hence the corresponding positions in colicin Ia should be accessible to MTS reagents. The residues in colicin Ia are T573, I574, G577, N578, and A582. Four of the five are positions at which the single-channel conductance is sensitive to MTS reaction. Our model places the exception, I574, in a loop between H8 and the upstream segment, where it would be exposed to the cis solution. Thus, we conclude that all of these positions are exposed to an aqueous milieu in the colicin Ia channel, in support of the hypothesis. A more direct approach is to test positions in the other colicins for MTS reaction. The conspicuous starting point is C505 of wild-type colicin E1, which corresponds to G609C in colicin Ia. We found that MMTS caused a large conductance decrease in macroscopic experiments with wild-type colicin E1 (Fig. 6 A). In contrast to colicin Ia mutant G609C, however, the reaction rate was very slow. With colicin E1 mutant D473N channels, on the other hand, MMTS caused a fast conductance decrease, comparable in rate and magnitude to its effect on colicin Ia G609C (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the slow reaction of wild-type E1 was due to the influence of D473. Most likely, it raises the pKa of C505 by an electrostatic mechanism, so the cysteine sulfhydryl group spends less time in the ionized state with which MTS compounds prefer to react. This indicates that colicin E1 residues D473 and C505 are close together in the open state of the channel, even though they are 24 A apart in the crystal structure. By an independent argument, involving the large steric effects of MTSES and MMTS on channel conductance, we arrived at a model for the colicin Ia channel that has the corresponding residues G577 and G609 located close together; this lends support to the idea of a precise structural homology between colicin Ia and E1 channels.\n\n    It is a curious result that reaction of colicin Ia G577C and G609C channels with MMTS causes a substantial decrease in single-channel conductance (>30%), but the mutation itself, which replaces glycine with cysteine, does not have a measurable effect on the conductance, relative to that of wild-type channels. It is as if the pore diameter is fluid while the channel is forming, with a preferred range of sizes, but the diameter becomes fixed once the channel has formed. This picture is consistent with the fact that the single-channel conductance varies considerably from channel to channel, but the conductance for an individual channel is stable, aside from temporary flickers to other conductance states. This may be related to the observation that colicin E1, labeled (in 6 M urea) at residue C505 with 5, 5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid), can subsequently induce Cl- efflux with the same kinetics as unmodified channels. Because we have shown that C505 is part of the channel lining, in an apparently constricted region of the pore, it is surprising that attaching such a bulky group did not have a measurable effect.\n\n    It has been previously noted that the channel-forming colicin C domain and the DT T domain show similarities in both aqueous crystal structure and membrane channel topology; it is even possible to form functional channels from chimeric proteins with the hydrophobic segments swapped (unpublished data). Because of this, we are obliged to compare our present results on colicin Ia with an earlier, single-channel study of MTS effects on DT T domain cysteine mutants. Although it still burns fiercely in our memories, we review, for the reader's sake, the unusual pattern of reactive residues in the DT T domain hydrophobic segment: a stretch of 13 residues with 11 reacting, five nonreacting residues, a stretch of 13 residues with 12 reacting, and 17 nonreacting residues. This pattern does not suggest either an alpha-helical or a beta-sheet secondary structure.\n\n    Although the pattern we have seen in the colicin Ia hydrophobic segment is quite different, the lengths of the reactive stretches are actually rather similar: a stretch of 12 residues, 577-588, with some reacting, a loop of 12 nonreacting residues, 589-600, and a stretch of 12 residues, 601-612, with some reacting. It is tempting to conjecture that the reactive stretches in DT T domain have an alpha-helical structure similar to that in colicin Ia channels. The unusual pattern of reaction might be explained if two channel states of DT (for instance, the open state and the brief flicker-closed state) were imperfectly resolved, and the transition between these states involved a rotation of the helices about their axes. Thus, one face of each helix might be exposed to the aqueous channel, and hence react with MTS reagents, in the open channel state, whereas the opposite face might be exposed in the flicker-closed state.",

        "Title": "    Mutations in the NOG gene are commonly found in congenital stapes ankylosis with symphalangism, but not in otosclerosis",
        "Abstract": "    Human noggin (NOG) is a responsible gene for multiple synostosis syndrome (SYNS1) and proximal symphalangism (SYM1), two conditions that are recently known to be within a wider range of clinical manifestations of stapes ankylosis with symphalangism. This study was performed to determine the range of phenotype caused by NOG mutations, using Japanese patients with various phenotypes including sporadic inherited SYM1, dominantly inherited SYM1, stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes (Teunissen and Cremer syndrome). In addition, 33 patients with typical otosclerosis (without symphalangism) were studied. Direct sequencing analysis disclosed three novel mutations of the NOG gene in three SYM1 families. None of the otosclerosis patients without symphalangism had NOG mutations, indicating that NOG mutations may be restrictively found within patients with various skeletal abnormalities. These results together with the literature review indicated that there are no clear genotype-phenotype correlations for NOG mutations. With regard to surgical outcome, most of the patients in these three families with NOG mutations showed remarkable air-bone gap recovery after stapes surgery. Molecular genetic testing is useful to differentiate syndromic stapes ankylosis from otosclerosis, and even mild skeletal anomalies can be a diagnostic indicator of NOG-associated disease.",
        "Introduction": "    Human noggin (NOG) is a responsible gene for a wide range of clinical manifestations of stapes ankylosis with symphalangism. Proximal symphalangism (SYM1: MIM #185800) is known as an autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance. The most common clinical features are the immobility of the proximal interphalangia (PIP) joints of the hands and toes, and congenital conductive hearing loss due to stapes ankylosis. Multiple synostosis syndrome (SYNS1: MIM#186500) is characterized by a more severe phenotype of the proximal symphalangism, such as progressive and expanded bony fusion of joints and unique facial manifestations. In addition, mutations in NOG have been identified in Tarsal-Carpal Coalition syndrome (TCC: MIM#186570), stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes (MIM#184460) (Teunissen and Cremer syndrome), and Brachydactyly type B2 (BDB2: MIM#611377).\n\n    Otosclerosis (MIM#166800) is known as the single most common cause of progressive conductive hearing loss, characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the otic capsule. Although there are a small number of familial cases that are likely to be monogenic, the majority of cases are sporadic. A series of studies has suggested that this condition involves both genetic and environmental factors.\n\n    Typical otosclerosis was included in this study because it is an interesting question as to whether some of the typical otosclerosis is a continuum of a category of disease caused by NOG mutations. We thought this may be true because (i) within SYM1, NOG mutations were found in patients with minor skeletal anomalies without symphalangism, and (ii) stapes ankylosis is an important phenotype of the animal model for NOG+/- mice.\n\n    To date, no detailed survey was available for NOG mutations in the stapes ankylosis patients with symphalangism in Asian populations. Therefore this study was undertaken to address whether NOG mutations are also causative and commonly found in those populations and if so, whether there is a different mutation spectrum.\n\n    In addition, previously reported NOG mutations were reviewed to determine their spectrum as well as whether there are any particular genotype-phenotype correlations caused by NOG mutations.",
        "Methods": "    We ascertained three Japanese families to be associated with conductive hearing loss and symphalangism, including an autosomal dominant SYM1 family, a sporadic SYM1 case with normal parents, and an autosomal dominant stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes (Teunissen and Cremer syndrome) family. Thirty-three Japanese otosclerosis patients, who underwent stapes surgery, were also screened for mutations in the NOG gene. Their clinical symptoms, including ages at surgery (36-77 years old: average 54.4 years old), onset age (15-57 years old: average 37.3 years old), gender (10 male and 23 female), laterality (9 unilateral and 24 bilateral), and hearing threshold (average 63.1 dB), are summarized in Table 1. Average onset age, was hearing threshold, was evaluated using pure-tone audiometry classified by a pure-tone average over 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. By detailed anamnestic and medical examination, no patients had any associated skeletal abnormalities. All of the patients were sporadic cases and no similar condition was observed within their familial members. Satisfactory outcomes after stapes surgery were obtained in all 33 subjects.\n\n    We obtained informed consent for participation in this project from each subject and also from 192 normal control subjects who were unrelated Japanese individuals without any noticeable hearing loss evaluated by auditory testing. Otologic examination, audiometric analysis, and radiologic imaging were carried out for each patient.\n\n    As shown in the pedigree (Fig. S1a), patient #991 was diagnosed with symmetric conductive hearing loss of 50 dB (Fig. 1b) at the age of 6 years. Tympanography indicated type A sclerosis and absence of the stapedius reflex, whereas otomicroscopy results were normal. Temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no inner or middle ear malformations. Her hearing level was stable and non-progressive, and she received hearing aids in both ears. At the age of 17, exploratory tympanotomy of the left ear showed bony fixation of the footplate without any other deformities in the middle ear and stapedotomy using a Teflon piston and wire was performed, resulting in a remarkable improvement in hearing. One year later, stapedotomy was undertaken in her right ear also. After the surgery, the postoperative hearing levels showed 20-30 dB and she did not use her hearing aids. The X-ray presented in Fig. 1 shows symphalangism in the PIP joints of the second to fifth fingers of both hands and in the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the left second and fifth fingers and of the right fifth finger. There was symphalangism in both hands, resulting in limited mobility of the fingers. Symphalangism (fixation of the proximal interphalangeal joint) in both feet was also found. The ankylosis was confirmed by X-ray examination (Fig. 1a). Congenital hyperopia (only in this patient within the family) was also present.\n\n    As shown in the pedigree (Fig. S2a), a girl and her father (patients #3925 and #3926) visited our hospital due to bilateral hearing loss. Audiograms indicated bilateral mixed hearing loss (Fig. 2b). Anamnestic evaluation suggested that the hearing loss was non-progressive without any associated symptoms such as ear fullness, tinnitus or vertigo. Patient #3926 underwent stapedotomy at the age of 42, achieving significant recovery of his hearing. There was symphalangism in the PIP joint of both fifth fingers, resulting in limited mobility of the fingers. Fixation of the proximal interphalangeal joint was not found in either foot. The ankylosis was confirmed by X-ray examination (Fig. 2a). Congenital hyperopia was not present in this family.\n\n    The pedigree shows hearing loss was inherited in four generations, indicating autosomal dominant inheritance (Fig. S3a). In addition to conductive hearing loss (Fig. 3b), the family members were associated with the following clinical phenotype in various degrees: hyperopia, broad thumbs and first toes, symphalangism, syndactyly, and fused cervical vertebrae (Fig. S3a). The clinical diagnosis was therefore stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes or Teunissen and Cremer syndrome. Patient #4351 had conductive hearing loss, hyperopia, broad thumbs and first toes, symphalangism, and syndactyly. She noted her hearing loss around age 10. Stapedotomy was performed when she was 37 (right) and 38 (left) years old, achieving significant recovery of hearing. Patient #4106 had conductive hearing loss, hyperopia, broad thumbs and first toes, and fused cervical vertebrae. His hearing loss was noted around age 3 and was diagnosed at the age of 8. Stapedotomy was performed when he was 9 (right) and 10 (left) years old, achieving significant recovery of hearing.\n\n    Human NOG gene coding is constituted of one single exon, in which an open reading frame of 696 nucleotides encodes a NOG polypeptide of 232 amino acids. A sequence obtained from GeneBank U31202 was used to design primers containing the entire coding region of NOG. Two fragments to entirely cover the coding region of NOG were amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and two specific primer pairs, as follows: F1, 5'-CTTGTGTGCCTTTCTTCCGC-3'; R1, 5'-TACTGGATGGGAATCCAGCC-3'; and F2, 5'-TACGACCCAGGCTTCATGGC-3'; R2, 5'-TAGCACGAGCACTTGCACTC-3'.\n\n    PCR reactions were carried out in 25 microl total volume containing 40 ng of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 2 mM dNTPs, x10 PCR buffer and 0.2 U of ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). PCR conditions were denaturing at 94 C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 96 C for 30 s, 60 C for 30 s, 72 C for 1 min extension, with a final extension step at 72 C for 5 min in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). PCR products were purified with a Suprec filter (Takara) and sequenced directly, using four primers (F1, R1, F2, and R2) and ABI BigDye terminators, on an ABI 3100 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer).",
        "Results": "    Three novel mutations of the NOG gene were found by direct sequencing analysis in three families, whose common clinical features were compatible with SYM1, i.e. immobility of the PIP joints of the hands and toes, and congenital conductive hearing loss due to stapes ankylosis. Patient #991 of family 1 had a heterozygous G>T transversion at nucleotide 551 (Fig. S1b), predicting a cysteine (C) for phenylalanine (F) substitution at amino acid 184 (C184F) in the coding region of NOG. Since the C184F mutation was not found in either parent and was found only in the proband (patient #991), it was suggested that the mutation arose de novo in only the affected individual. Patients #3925 and #3926 of family 2 had a heterozygous T>A transversion at nucleotide 463 (Fig. S2b), predicting a cysteine (C) for serine (S) substitution at amino acid 155 (C155F) in the coding region of NOG. Patients #4106 and #4351 had a heterozygous C215X mutation.\n\n    None of the otosclerosis patients had NOG mutations. These three mutations were not observed in any of the other family members nor in the 192 unrelated Japanese controls (384 chromosomes).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study identified three novel mutations in the NOG gene in families with symphalangism, being consistent with the previous work showing that NOG is the responsible gene for SYM1 and stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes/Teunissen and Cremer syndrome. One mutation was a nonsense mutation (C215X), leading to a truncated protein, and was likely to be a pathologic mutation. The other two mutations are also likely to be pathologic rather than functionally neutral polymorphic changes because: (i) none were found in any of the controls, (ii) the alignment of NOG sequences from human, mouse, chicken, Xenopus laevis and zebrafish showed that C155 and C184 are well-conserved amino acids in all species (data not shown), and (iii) all affected subjects showed similar phenotypes.\n\n    To date, 36 NOG mutations have been reported in SYM1, SYNS1, TCC, BDB2 and TCS families (Table 2). Although the NOG mutations have been reported mainly in dominant families (Table 2), de novo NOG mutations have also been reported in sporadic SYM1 and sporadic SYNS1. Therefore, genetic investigation may be needed for determining pathogenesis of congenital stapes ankylosis with stiffness of the PIP joints, even in sporadic cases. A milder phenotype as well as the present case with minor joint anomalies in family 2 indicated that it may be clinically important to check such skeletal abnormalities when diagnosing and treating patients with stapes ankylosis, because it may be difficult to differentiate congenital stapes ankylosis from otosclerosis when conductive hearing loss is delayed to adulthood.\n\n    Whether NOG mutations can be found more frequently in sporadic conductive hearing loss patients is an interesting question. In this study, mutations were not found in any otosclerosis patients who did not have any associated abnormality. Therefore, typical otosclerosis is not a continuum of the category of diseases associated with NOG mutations. These results, together with the previous literature, indicate that the NOG mutations are restrictively found within patients with various skeletal abnormalities regardless of severity. It is noted that the reported NOG mutation in mild cases (patients with stapes ankylosis without symphalangism) have minor skeletal abnormalities such as broad thumbs and great toes, but these cases had symphalangism in the little fingers only.\n\n    A review of the reported 41 mutations showed that, interestingly, the majority of NOG mutations are located in the evolutionally well conserved and therefore functionally critical region (Table 2), suggesting that this region might be functionally relevant in NOG polypeptides. This study added three novel NOG mutations in conserved cysteine residue within the cystine knot motif and confirmed that NOG is a causative gene for this category of disease. In addition, there was no particular racial-specific founder mutation within this gene (Table 2). With regard to a genotype-phenotype correlation, phenotypes seem to be independent of the location of the mutation and type of mutations (Table 2). Other genetic factors and/or interacted proteins may also be involved in determining clinical phenotypes.\n\n    With regard to surgical outcome, stapes surgery for conductive hearing loss due to NOG mutations may be a good therapeutic option for most cases. In fact, two of these seven patients who underwent stapes surgery (#991 and #4106) had hearing deterioration 3-10 years after the initial surgery, in accordance with a previous report, hypothesizing that excessive bony overgrowth and refixation of the ossicle chain may occur after initially successful surgery. The other cases in this study maintained good hearing even after long-term follow-up periods (more than 10 years). Therefore, surgical outcome should be carefully evaluated after long-term observation. Careful explanation of possible limitations of surgical treatment and alternative treatment options such as a bone-anchored hearing aid may be appropriate for such patients with this genetic background.\n\n    The identification of the causative genes responsible for various middle/inner ear diseases will enable us to classify new congenital deafness groups in the future, and lead to clinical application in the diagnosis of middle ear disorders and better counseling for the selection of ideal intervention.",

        "Title": "    EXCEPTIONAL AGGRESSIVENESS OF CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATION DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH PDCD10 MUTATIONS",
        "Abstract": "    The phenotypic manifestations of cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) disease caused by rare PDCD10 mutations have not been systematically examined, and a mechanistic link to Rho kinase (ROCK) mediated hyperpermeability, a potential therapeutic target, has not been established.\n\n    We analyze PDCD10-siRNA treated endothelial cells for stress fibers, ROCK activity and permeability. ROCK activity is assessed in CCM lesions. Brain permeability and CCM lesion burden is quantified, and clinical manifestations are assessed in prospectively enrolled subjects with PDCD10 mutations.\n\n    We determine that PDCD10 protein suppresses endothelial stress fibers, ROCK activity and permeability in vitro. Pdcd10 heterozygous mice have greater lesion burden than other Ccm genotypes. We demonstrate robust ROCK activity in murine and human CCM vasculature, and increased brain vascular permeability in humans with PDCD10 mutation. Clinical phenotype is exceptionally aggressive compared to the more common KRIT1 and CCM2 familial and sporadic CCM, with greater lesion burden and more frequent hemorrhages earlier in life. We first report other phenotypic features including scoliosis, cognitive disability and skin lesions, unrelated to lesion burden or bleeding.\n\n    These findings define a unique CCM disease with exceptional aggressiveness, and they inform preclinical therapeutic testing, clinical counseling and the design of trials.",
        "Introduction": "    Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are clusters of grossly dilated brittle capillaries, predisposing patients to a lifetime risk of hemorrhagic stroke, epilepsy and other sequelae. Familial forms account for about a third of cases, involving autosomal dominant inheritance at one of three gene loci. No current treatment exists for CCM, except highly invasive surgical procedures for resecting symptomatic lesions. Despite promising pharmacotherapeutic targets, progress to clinical trials has been hindered by the relatively benign manifestations of CCM disease in general, a low rate of new lesion development, and the unpredictability of serious clinical events.\n\n    Few studies have examined any special features of the rarest cases with programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) mutation (also known as the CCM3 locus), constituting <15 % of probands genotyped by sequential mutation screening, and <2% of CCM cases at large. Our group and others have suggested different disease aggressiveness with various CCM genotypes, and bleeding at young age and meningiomas were recently associated with PDCD10 cases. But there has been no systematic assessment of lesion burden, hemorrhage risks per lesion and per patient, nor other comprehensive phenotypic survey in probands with this mutation. The potential link of Rho kinase (ROCK) activity to the loss of PDCD10 protein had been suggested previously, but it has not been linked to vascular hyperpermeability as with other CCM genotypes. ROCK activity has not been previously examined in vascular lesions from these patients, nor their brain permeability in vivo. And other reports have suggested that PDCD10 mutations might cause CCM via distinct Rho independent mechanisms.\n\n    Herein we confirm that PDCD10 loss is associated with increased ROCK activity, stress fiber induction and endothelial permeability in vitro, rescued by ROCK inhibition. And we demonstrate ROCK activity in CCM vasculature in mouse and humans, defining a mechanistic link and a potential therapeutic target. We show that Pdcd10/PDCD10 mutations result in significantly greater lesion burden in mouse and humans than other CCM disease, more severe clinical manifestations, and document several novel clinical associations. We first report that the brain of PDCD10 patients manifests vascular hyperpermeability, confirming the expected impact of ROCK activity in vivo. The exceptionally high rates of lesion formation and symptomatic hemorrhage motivate novel hypotheses for mechanistic studies, and provide an opportunity to focus preclinical optimization and early therapeutic trials on this small but seriously affected subgroup of CCM cases.",
        "Methods": "    Details for human subjects, cell culture, the Pdcd10+/-Trp53-/- heterozygous murine model, genetic testing in subjects, transfection, immunofluorescence, western blotting, RhoA activation assay, permeability assay in vitro, sample preparation and histology, immunohistochemistry, lesion burden and in vivo brain permeability in humans, lesion burden and clinical features, and statistical methods and control comparisons are provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods online. Methods have been described previously for assessment of endothelial barrier function in vitro, preparation of murine brain sections and ROCK activity assays.",
        "Results": "    Knockdown efficacy was approximately 80% reduction in PDCD10 message in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) transfected with PDCD10 siRNA (Figure 1A). Control and PDCD10 si-RNA-treated HUVECs were stained for f-actin to show the extent of stress fiber content (Figure 1B). Stress fiber content was increased with PDCD10 depletion. This increase was reversed by the ROCK inhibitor, H-1152. These effects were confirmed in human brain microvascular cells (hbmvEC), when KRIT1, CCM2 or PDCD10 si-RNA was used (Supplementary Figure S1 online). A consequence of ROCK activation is phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC). To monitor ROCK activity, control and PDCD10 si-RNA-treated HUVECs were stained for phosphorylated MLC (pMLC) after Western blotting (Figure 1C). PDCD10 depletion increased ROCK activity, which was suppressed by H-1152. These effects were confirmed in hbmvEC, while total MLC levels were not affected by PDCD10 depletion or H-1152 (Supplementary Figure S2 online). Rho-GTP activity was increased after KRIT1, CCM2 or PDCD10 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S3 online). Stability of endothelial cell junctions was measured by permeability of control and PDCD10 si-RNA-treated HUVEC monolayers (Figure 1D). Upon PDCD10 depletion the monolayers became more permeable. This increased leakage was reversed by H-1152, indicating rescue of the hyperpermeable endothelial phenotype by ROCK inhibition, despite PDCD10 loss.\n\n    Total lesion burden per mouse was significantly greater (P<0.001) when comparing 15 Pdcd10+/- sensitized animals in the Trp53-/- background, to 53 mice with other heterozygous CCM genotypes (Krit1+/- or Ccm2+/-) in the same backgrounds (Supplementary Table S1 online). The sensitized Pdcd10+/-Trp53-/- model had over sevenfold more prevalent CCM lesions, than similarly sensitized models of Krit1+/-Trp53-/- or Ccm2+/-Trp53-/- genotypes, and also a greater burden of mature stage 2 lesions.\n\n    Even non-sensitized Pdcd10+/- mice (without Trp53 loss) manifested typical CCM lesions (mean 1.6 lesions/mouse), while no such lesions were documented in non-sensitized heterozygotes of other CCM genotypes (P<0.001). The mean area for the stage 2 lesions was larger in the Pdcd10+/-Trp53-/- model (0.94 mm2 per lesion) than in other sensitized genotypes (0.34 mm2/lesion) (P<0.01). From these mouse models, it is clear that heterozygous loss of Pdcd10, with or without genetic sensitization, leads to a more severe and penetrant CCM phenotype than loss of either Krit1 or Ccm2.\n\n    ROCK activity was present in CCM lesions and in background capillaries in both sensitized and non-sensitized Pdcd10 models as assessed by staining of pMLC and phosphorylated myosin binding substrate (pMBS) (Supplementary Figure S4 online), whereas no such activity is seen in capillaries of wild type control mice. The prevalence of pMLC immunopositive caverns was the same in CCM lesions regardless of sensitized or non-sensitized background (95.4% of 1111 caverns counted in 79 lesions present in five Pdcd10+/-Trp53-/- mice versus 96.5% of 142 caverns counted in 23 lesions in eleven non-sensitized Pdcd10+/- mice), indicating that ROCK activity in CCM lesions is related to the Pdcd10 mutations and not the background sensitizer. These results complement our in vitro experiments by demonstrating the impact of Pdcd10 mutations on ROCK activity in vivo.\n\n    We demonstrated ROCK activity in human PDCD10 CCM lesions, as in murine lesions. Human PDCD10 CCM lesions had twice as many caverns with ROCK activity than human KRIT1, CCM2 and sporadic CCM lesions (P<0.05) (Figure 2).\n\n    The allelic series of PDCD10 mutations is catalogued in Table 1. All mutations are predicted to lead to a loss of function allele. In 12 of 13 probands, mutations included nonsense and splice site altering mutations. Proband number 12 carried a missense mutation, c.131T>C; p.Leu44Pro. This helix-breaking mutation is predicted to result in loss of function by disrupting helix alphaC of the PDCD10 protein, thereby inhibiting both PDCD10 homo-dimerization and binding to the GCKIII kinases. Sixteen of the 18 patients underwent parental screening for their index PDCD10 mutation. Seven of the 16 cases with parental screening (44%) harbored a spontaneous, de novo mutation not inherited from either parent.\n\n    The mean age of first clinical symptom was 12.6 years (range 0.25-52). Symptomatic CCM bleed was the most common presenting event, affecting ten of 18 subjects (56%), who suffered 37 overt hemorrhages. Estimated incidence of hemorrhage was 7.9% (CI 5.6 - 11) per patient per year based on exposure risk since birth, and 20% (CI 14 - 28) per patient per year based on risk since first symptom onset. The risk of recurrent bleed after a first bleed was 24% per patient per year (CI 16 - 35). There were significant associations between the annual bleed rate and a younger age at first symptom onset, age at first bleed and a younger age at diagnosis (P<0.001, respectively), but no significant difference between sexes. Life tables of hemorrhage risk from birth, from first symptom, and from first bleed are presented in Figure 3A and 3B.\n\n    The first overt hemorrhage occurred most often in the first decade of life (mean age 5.9, range 0.33-12). This is significantly earlier than the age at first bleed in KRIT1 and CCM 2 familial cases evaluated in our clinic (mean age 30, range 1-52, P<0.05), and in the clinical dataset for the Angioma Alliance DNA/Tissue Bank (mean age 32, range 3-55, P<0.001) (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S5 online).\n\n    Lesion burden on susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) was exceptionally high, with 33% of PDCD10 cases harboring >100 lesions and 78% harboring > 20 lesions. The mean number of lesions per patient on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was 31.33 (CI 20.64 to 47.57) in PDCD10 cases, significantly greater than the mean lesion count of 5.25 (CI 2.38 to 11.59) in familial KRIT1 and CCM2 cases (P<0.001). When adjusted for age, the SWI lesion burden was also significantly greater in the PDCD10 cohort than in control familial cases with KRIT1 or CCM2 mutations (2.03 SWI lesions/year of life in PDCD10 versus 1.08 in KRIT1 and CCM2 cases, P<0.01). PDCD10 patients form 2.36 new lesions on T2 per year of follow up compared to 0.30 new lesions per year of follow up in KRIT1 cases (P=0.002). Among nine cases that underwent 19 prospective repeated MRI scans with comparable technique, there were 2.7 (CI 1.8-3.9) new SWI lesions per patient per year of follow up. An MRI scan from one such case with exceptionally high SWI lesion burden is shown in Figure 3D.\n\n    Bleeding rate per lesion per year after first symptom onset was 0.3 % (CI 0.2-0.4), similar to that previously reported in other CCM genotypes. The rebleeding rate per lesion after a first bleed from any lesion was only slightly higher at 0.4 % (CI 0.23-0.52). This suggests that the high bleeding rate in PDCD10 subjects is due to the exceptional lesion burden, rather than any particularly higher hemorrhagic propensity of individual CCM lesions. CCM lesions in SWI scans formed at a rate of 2.03 lesions (CI 1.89 - 2.16) per patient per year of life.\n\n    Using dynamic contrast enhanced quantitative perfusion (Supplementary Figure S6 online), patients with PDCD10 mutations exhibited increased permeability in white matter far from the lesions compared to sporadic CCM cases without germline mutations (P<0.05). This finding was also observed in other familial cases (unpublished data). Lesional permeability in PDCD10 cases was found to be higher than in KRIT1 cases. This confirms a functional impact of ROCK activity associated with PDCD10 mutations in vivo.\n\n    Figure 4 illustrates each symptomatic bleed noted during the lifespan of each subject, groups the cases by their respective proband, and presents relevant information about each subject's lesion burden and clinical associations.\n\n    Skin lesions were noted in five cases (28%). Two patients had cafe-au-lait lesions, one had a scalp hemangioma, and two patients had cutaneous cavernous malformations (both confirmed by biopsy). Scoliosis was documented in seven cases (39%). Three of these patients had spinal fusion due to severe scoliosis. Of those seven cases, two underwent spinal MRI scans, and one was noted to harbor a spinal cord CCM lesion. The presence of scoliosis was significantly associated with the rate of recurrent bleed per year after a first documented hemorrhage (P=0.001), and with the rate of bleed per lesion per year after a first bleed (P=0.001). There was no association between the presence of skin lesions or scoliosis and lesion burden, cumulative bleeds per case, the annual bleeding rate, the age at onset of first symptoms, nor the age at first bleed.\n\n    A brain tumor was found in five cases (28%). Based on MRI features, this had the dural-based appearance of meningioma in two subjects, and the intra-canalicular nodular appearance of acoustic neuroma in two subjects. An additional subject had a biopsy-proven cerebellar astrocytoma. The presence of brain tumor was significantly associated with the rate of recurrent bleed per year after a first documented hemorrhage (P<0.001), and with the rate of bleed per lesion per year after a first bleed (P<0.001). However, there was no association of tumor with lesion burden, cumulative bleeds per case, the annual bleeding rate, the age at onset of first symptoms, nor the age at first bleed. After Bonferroni correction, scoliosis and brain tumor association with bleeds per year after a first bleed, and with bleeds per lesion per year after the first bleed were all significant at P<0.01.\n\n    Cognitive disability was present in 11 cases (61%) including a learning disorder most commonly noted in eight pediatric cases. Surprisingly, we documented no association between the presence of cognitive disability and lesion burden, cumulative bleeds per case, the annual bleeding rate, the age at onset of first symptoms, nor the age at first bleed. Lesion burden may not necessarily result from increased loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the PDCD10 gene. PDCD10 protein may act through a different mechanism than KRIT1/CCM2 proteins.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Two critical questions were answered in this study, establishing that PDCD10 mutations result in vascular permeability mediated by ROCK activity, and a particularly severe clinical phenotype with previously unappreciated features. Other mechanistic questions remain unanswered, with current results generating a number of novel hypotheses.\n\n    It was shown in recent years that mutations in CCM genes KRIT1 and CCM2 result in stress fiber expression and endothelial barrier leak, mediated by ROCK activation. In fact, ROCK or broader Rho inhibition have been advocated as potential therapeutic strategies. Although there is no in vivo confirmation that RhoA is associated with disease manifestations, our data suggest ROCK may be involved in PDCD10 disease. But it has been suggested that PDCD10 mutations may cause CCM disease via a different mechanism. Vascular permeability and ROCK activity had not been systematically explored as a result of PDCD10 loss. Brain permeability by MRI with ROCK activity is presently being investigated in our laboratory in humans with familial CCM. We now confirm the expression of stress fibers, endothelial hyperpermeability, and increased ROCK activity with loss of PDCD10, as we had shown previously with the more common KRIT1 gene . We also demonstrate phenotype rescue in vitro with ROCK inhibition, despite PDCD10 loss, consistent with a report by Borikova et al..\n\n    We add other pieces of critical information, including the demonstration of increased ROCK activity in normal background vessels and in CCM lesions in man and mouse in sensitized background. Mice heterozygous for CCM genes have been shown to manifest hyperpermeability in several vascular beds, including the brain of murine models . For the first time, we document increased brain permeability in the white matter of humans with heterozygous PDCD10 mutations.\n\n    Interesting information was gleaned by comparing lesion burden in Pdcd10 heterozygous mice and our previously reported heterozygous Krit1 or Ccm2 murine models recapitulating the human disease. We had previously shown no detectable CCM lesions in Krit1 or Ccm2 heterozygous mice, except when sensitized with the loss of tumor suppression (Trp53) or DNA point mutation repair (Msh2) genes, consistent with enhanced lesion genesis as a result of Knudsonian second-hit somatic mutations. In contrast, Pdcd10 heterozygous mice manifest typical CCM lesions without such sensitization, suggesting a much more penetrant phenotype. Indeed, comparably sensitized heterozygous Pdcd10 models manifest a tenfold greater lesion burden that other CCM genotypes.\n\n    Other studies had indicated bleeding earlier in life with this genotype. We now provide a systematic correlation with lesion burden, the rate of lesion formation, and hemorrhagic risk. These discoveries would not have been possible, without the concerted efforts of Angioma Alliance at facilitated referral of every known case of PDCD10 mutation in the United States, to a single specialized clinic performing systematic genotyping, phenotypic screening, advanced imaging and biomarker studies. This represents a model of studying rare diseases, although we acknowledge potential bias despite best currently available controls. As with mice, we show that patients affected with PDCD10 mutations have an exceptionally greater lesion burden, and more frequent bleeding episodes than other CCM genotypes. They form new small SWI lesions at about twice the rate per year of life, and more clinically relevant T2 lesions on MRI at more than six-fold. Remarkably, each CCM lesion is associated with a very low risk of hemorrhage per year, in the 0.3% range, as was reported with other genotypes. Hence the bleeding tendency in the PDCD10 genotype appears to result from a much greater number of lesions, rather than any special lesional vulnerability to hemorrhage. This favors therapeutic targeting of lesion burden, or the prevention of lesion development early in life. Patients who have had a first documented symptomatic CCM hemorrhage are often in the first decade of life, and are predisposed to recurrent bleeds at a rate greater than 20% per year, higher than any reported with other CCM genotypes.\n\n    We document a high frequency of spontaneous mutation in this disease, reflecting in part the very severe phenotype (disability at young age preventing procreation), and consistent with the previously reported less numerous affected relatives as compared to other familial CCM cases . Two mutations, c.474+5G>A and c.474+1G>A were present respectively in three and two unrelated families. A potential founder effect with these mutations will need to be examined.\n\n    The high rates of CCM lesion formation, assuming each lesion represents a separate somatic mutation event, implies that the PDCD10 locus may be prone to deleterious mutations, possibly representing a mutation hotspot. Many of the second-hit somatic mutations are likely due to LOH generated by mitotic recombination. The location of the three CCM genes on their respective chromosomes in both human and mouse supports a higher frequency of mitotic recombination for the CCM3/Ccm3 genes. For the human, the KRIT1/CCM2 gene is located on the q arm approximately 32 Mb from the centromere of chromosome 7, the CCM2 gene is located approximately 15 Mb from the same centromere on the p arm of chromosome 7, whereas the PDCD10/CCM3 gene is located on the q arm approximately 76 Mb from the centromere of chromosome 3 (GRCh38 assembly). In the mouse, the Krit1/Ccm1 gene is located approximately 3.8 Mb from the telocentric centromere on chromosome 5, the Ccm2 gene is located approximately 6.6 Mb from the telocentric centromere on chromosome 11, whereas the Pdcd10/Ccm3 gene is located approximately 75 Mb from the telocentric centromere on chromosome 3 (GRCm38 assembly). The larger distance from their respective centromeres to the CCM3/Ccm3 gene in both species provides the genetic template for an increased opportunity for mitotic recombination, leading to LOH and the initiation of CCM lesion development. Further study of the molecular genetic cause of this phenomenon is needed, potentially explaining the exceptional disease aggressiveness. There was substantial variability in lesion burden, bleeding and associated phenotypic features among subjects, among families and even within respective probands. Factors impacting disease aggressiveness, including potential genetic and epigenetic modifiers merit further investigation.\n\n    It may be questioned whether the each CCM lesion in these patients is the result of a separate and unique somatic mutation. The number of cell divisions and spontaneous mutations necessary during each replication cycle to generate the abundance of lesions many not be possible during the short timeframe of lesion genesis in many of these patients' lifespan. While somatic biallelic loss of PDCD10 has been shown in human lesions from familial cases with germline PDCD10 heterozygocity, this may not be a requirement for the genesis of every lesion, particularly in the setting of this highly prolific genotype. This will require further investigation, including the sequencing of multiple lesion samples from the same patient or mouse. It is also possible that PDCD10 may act as a tumor suppressor, inherently sensitizing patients to somatic mutations, and this could also explain the association of tumors with this CCM genotype (see below). This mechanism will require further investigation.\n\n    Other phenotypic features are intriguing. An association with skin lesions had been reported primarily with KRIT1 cases. We now report it with PDCD10 cases, although the lesions are different (more cafe-au-lait lesions, for example, rather than keratotic angiomas). Associated meningiomas have also been reported, but we herein document other brain tumors as well. Finally, scoliosis and cognitive impairment are first reported here, in association with this unique cohort. Scoliosis may or may not be due to associated spinal lesions, it was not associated with myelopathy, as would be expected with spinal CCMs, and one of two cases with severe scoliosis who underwent spinal MRI had no evidence of spinal CCM lesions. The frequency of disabling cognitive impairment is equally sobering. These novel phenotypic features require further investigation, yet we note no specific relationship of scoliosis or cognitive disability with lesion burden or hemorrhage. This motivates hypotheses about the impact of PDCD10 loss on skeletal integrity and neurocognitive development or function. These effects might be related to other postulated fundamental roles of PDCD10 in cell orientation and Golgi assembly, DLL4-Notch signaling, and more recently neuronal migration. We herein note that cognitive impairment in senescence has also been correlated with vascular permeability and ROCK activity .\n\n    In contrast to most CCM patients with other genotypes, who often live normal lives with infrequent and rarely disabling clinical events, patients with PDCD10 mutations are frequently devastated by lesion burden and repeated hemorrhages, and these most often start in childhood. Therapeutic strategies will need to target children with this disease, perhaps upon evidence of a first bleed. At the same time, the high lesion burden in murine models provides an opportunity to detect and optimize therapeutic benefit in the preclinical setting. And fewer subjects would be needed to demonstrate a treatment effect in clinical trials in view of the high rate of lesion genesis in man, and the frequency of clinically significant hemorrhages (particularly rebleeds). ROCK inhibition therapy is particularly promising, and should be explored along with broader Rho inhibition, documented in pleiotropic effects of statins. There has been increasing experience with statin use in childhood, making this therapeutic venue quite realistic, if a therapeutic effect and safety of statins are demonstrated in animal models. Brain permeability and other ROCK activity biomarkers may help with detecting treatment effect, and with calibrating therapy. The association of brain permeability by MRI with ROCK activity is being investigated in human with familial CCMs. Other therapeutic venues with immune modulation and other signaling targets may realistically be screened given the penetrance of disease in murine models recapitulating the human disease. And these may be carefully optimized for clinical trials.",

        "Title": "    Carrier frequency of the GJB2 mutations that cause hereditary hearing loss in the Japanese population",
        "Abstract": "    Hearing impairment is one of the most common sensory disorders that affect ~1 in 1000 children, and half of them are considered to be hereditary. Information about the carrier frequencies of mutations that underlie autosomal recessive disorders is indispensable for accurate genetic counseling to predict the probability of patients' children's disease. However, there have been few reports specific to the Japanese population. GJB2 mutations are reported to be the most frequent cause of hereditary hearing loss, and the mutation spectrum and frequency of GJB2 mutations were reported to vary among different ethnic groups. In this study, we investigated the carrier frequency of GJB2 mutations and the mutation spectrum in 509 individuals randomly selected from the general Japanese population. We show that the carrier frequencies of the two most common pathogenic mutations are 1.57% (8/509) for c.235delC and 1.77% (9/509) for p.Val37Ile. In addition to these mutations, we found two pathogenic variants (p.[Gly45Glu;Tyr136*] and p.Arg143Trp), and the total carrier frequency was estimated to be around 3.73% (19/509). We also detected six unclassified variants, including two novel variants (p.Cys60Tyr and p.Phe106Leu), with the former predicted to be pathogenic. These findings will provide indispensable information for genetic counseling in the Japanese population.",
        "Introduction": "    Inherited diseases are frequently found worldwide and a major group of inherited diseases is autosomal recessive disorders such as non-syndromic hereditary hearing impairment, Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, Wilson disease and xeroderma pigmentosum. The carrier frequencies of these diseases are estimated to be 0.9% for Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, 1.1% for Wilson disease and 0.9% for xeroderma pigmentosum (see the Japan Intractable Disease Information Center's website: http://www.nanbyou.or.jp/entry/112). The mutation spectrum of these diseases is reported to be population specific. Among these autosomal recessive disorders, non-syndromic congenital hearing impairment is reported to be the most frequent. Approximately 1 in 1000 new-born children are affected by congenital hearing impairment, and 50-60% cases of them are attributable to genetic causes. Hereditary hearing loss has considerable genetic heterogeneity and, to date, more than 100 genetic loci have been discovered to be the cause. Genetic testing for congenital hearing impairment has become more important for accurate diagnoses, prediction of severity of hearing loss, estimation of associated abnormalities, selection of appropriate habilitation options, prevention of hearing loss and better genetic counseling. Recently, the panel screening of multiple mutations by invader assay was reported to be very efficient. Genetic testing by invader assay is now performed throughout Japan, and the Japanese National Health Insurance began to cover its costs from April 2012. Currently, hearing-impaired patients can easily access clinical diagnostic screening by genetic testing, which should be accompanied by the appropriate genetic counseling that includes an estimation of the next generation's incidence (or recurrence) of hearing difficulty.\n\n    Most hereditary impairment is caused by recessive mutations in genes such as GJB2 and SLC26A4. In the case of autosomal recessive disorders, patients have mutations in both the paternal and maternal alleles. Therefore, to estimate the next generation's incidence ratio, the carrier frequencies of the mutations in these genes must be ascertained. However, there are only a limited number of reports about the carrier frequencies of autosomal recessive disorders, such as hearing impairment, in the Japanese population.\n\n    The GJB2 gene is the most prevalent for congenital hearing loss and the mutation spectrums are known to vary among different ethnic groups. It is vital to study the carrier frequency and mutation spectrum of each genetic background to enable more precise genetic counseling. The GJB2 gene encodes connexin26, a member of the connexin family of proteins that are constituents of the intercellular gap junction. The first GJB2 mutation was reported by Kelsell et al. in 1997 and since then more than 100 pathogenic variants have been reported worldwide (see the Connexin-deafness website: http://davinci.crg.es/deafness/). In a previous report, GJB2 mutations were estimated to be responsible for about 15-20% of the cases of deafness in the US, and 12.5% (33/264) of those in Japan. The c.35delG mutation is the most common in the Caucasian population, and the c.235delC and p.Val37Ile mutations are the most prevalent in the Asian population. The carrier frequency of GJB2 mutations in the control population is reported to be 2-4% in the US, in Europe, and in Korea, but the carrier frequency in the Japanese population has not yet been reported. The information about both the carrier frequency and spectrum with respect of GJB2 mutations in Japan is very important because GJB2 mutations were reported to have a phenotype-genotype correlation.\n\n    The purpose of this study is to investigate the carrier frequency of GJB2 mutations and the mutation spectrum in the Japanese population to provide more accurate information for genetic counseling. This is the first study in Japan to estimate the carrier frequency of the GJB2 mutations causing hereditary hearing loss, the most frequent autosomal recessive disorder in Japan.",
        "Methods": "    Experiments were approved by the Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, Ethics Committee (Permit number: G294), and written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to genetic analysis. Blood samples were collected from 509 healthy Japanese people (201 males and 308 females) at annual health checks in Yakumo, Hokkaido in Japan. Their ages ranged from 40 to 91 years, and the average was 67.8 years. According to the questionnaire filled in by the subjects, 56/509 (11.0%) had subjectively experienced hearing difficulty, and in terms of vestibular function, 106/509 (20.8%) had experienced vertigo or dizziness. From the blood sample, we measured HbA1c (NGSP; National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program) levels and 36 out of 509 people (7.1%) were over 6.5, revealing a risk of diabetes, which is compatible with Japanese general population. The result from our questionnaire are consistent with Japan Trak report in which 10.8% of the randomly selected 15 036 respondents reported experiencing hearing difficulty (see the Japan Trak website: http://www.atpress.ne.jp/view/32264). Therefore, the subjects enrolled in this study are thought to be representative of the population in Japan.\n\n    To identify GJB2 mutations, a fragment containing the entire coding region were amplified from genomic DNA sample by PCR using the primer pair 5'-GGTGAGGTTFTFTAAGAGTTGG-3'/5'-CTACGGTGTTACTCGAGACGA-3', and the amplicon were used as a template for direct sequencing. Direct sequencing analysis was performed using an ABI PRISM Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA), and the data were analyzed using ABI Variant Reporter v1.1 (Applied Biosystems).",
        "Results": "    Table 1 summarizes the variants identified in this study. Among the mutations screened by the invader assay, which are covered by Japanese health insurance, we found six previously reported pathogenic variants within the coding region of GJB2. In detail, we detected nine alleles for p.Val37Ile, eight for c.235delC, one for p.[Gly45Glu;Tyr136*], one for p.Arg143Trp, one for p.Ile71Thr and one for p.Phe191Leu; p.Gly45Glu and p.Tyr136* mutations are on the same parental allele. Among these mutations, the pathogenicity of p.Ile71Thr and p.Phe191Leu has been controversial, and they are considered to represent non-pathogenic polymorphisms. We also found previously reported variants, p.Thr8Met and p.Arg127His, and two novel variants, p.Cys60Tyr and p.Phe106Leu, which were not included in the Invader assay-based mutation screening. The pathogenicity of p.Thr8Met, and p.Arg127His variants is unknown.\n\n    We found 19 previously reported pathogenic variants, and 5 variants found in this study were unclassified, so the carrier frequency of the GJB2 mutations is estimated to be at least 3.73-4.72% (19-24/509). We believe that the screening (including the four variants, p.Thr8Met, p.Ile71Thr, p.Arg127His and p.Phe191Leu, and other novel variants) will be very important for more accurate genetic testing. The pathogenicity of novel variants is not clear and requires further studies for clarification.\n\n    The two novel variants mentioned above, p.Cys60Tyr and p.Phe106Leu, and one silent variant, p.Val63Val (c.189G>T), were identified in this study. Figure 1 shows amino acid sequences of Homo sapiens and other species' connexin26 and the two novel variants, p.Cys60Tyr and p.Phe106Leu. Cys60 is evolutionarily conserved, while the leucine residue of p.Phe106Leu is found in Xenopus laevis. To predict the effect of the variants, we carried out computer analysis using the Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT: http://sift.jcvi.org/) and Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen2: http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/). The functional prediction of p.Cys60Tyr was Damaging (1.0) by SIFT, and Damaging (1.0) by PolyPhen2. On the other hand, that of p.Phe106Leu was Tolerated (0.23) by SIFT and Benign (0) by PolyPhen2. Considering these data, p.Cys60Tyr is expected to be pathogenic and p.Phe106Leu to be a non-pathogenic polymorphism.\n\n    Synonymous variants are usually non-pathogenic unless the nucleotide change alters the splicing of the RNA. Analysis of the p.Val63Val (c.189G>T) synonymous variant using the prediction program NNSPLICE (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html) indicates that this variant is not expected to be either a donor or an acceptor site for splicing and is, therefore, likely to be non-pathogenic. The three subjects carrying p.Cys60Tyr, p.Phe106Leu or p.Val63Val had no experience of hearing difficulty or tinnitus.\n\n    We found six alleles of the p.Thr123Asn mutation, but we did not consider them to be pathogenic variants; p.Thr123Asn has been considered to be a rare non-pathogenic variant because it was found with equal frequency in patients and controls in Ohtsuka. In contrast, the non-pathogenic variants, p.Val27Ile, p.Glu114Gly and p.Ile203Thr, that are frequently found in the Japanese population were also frequently observed in this study. The most common GJB2 mutation in Caucasian people, the c.35delG mutation, was not found in these subjects, indicating differing variants among ethnic groups. All things considered, the GJB2 carrier frequency in the Japanese population was estimated to be at least 19/509 (3.73%). We did not find any subjects who carry homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations in this study.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    There are several reports on carrier frequency and the mutation spectrum of GJB2 mutations. In Europe, the carrier frequency of c.35delG was reported to be around 2-3%. Green et al., reported that 14 out of 560 general people carried the c.35delG variant, so they estimated that the carrier rate of c.35delG was about 2.5% in the Midwestern USA.\n\n    In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, it was reported that the carrier frequency of c.167delT variant was 4.03% (22/546). In the Thai population, p.Val37Ile was the most frequent variant and the carrier frequency of this variant was 17.1% (35/205) in healthy controls. In the Korean population, the carrier frequency of p.Val37Ile was 1.35% (28/2072), and that of c.235delC was 1.25% (26/2072), and no c.35delG mutants were detected in their study.\n\n    The majorities of studies have focused only on hearing-impaired patients and their allele frequency and have not focused on the carrier frequency. Ohtsuka et al.6 reported that the frequency of the mutant alleles among hearing-impaired patients was 3.9% (96/2454) for the c.235delC mutation, and 2.5% (61/2454) for the p.Val37Ile mutation. Tsukada et al.19 reported that the mutation spectrum and frequency in a large number of Japanese hearing-impaired patients, and the c.235delC mutation allele frequency was 5.3% (142/2686), and that of p.Val37Ile was 1.8% (47/2686).\n\n    In this study, we found eight alleles of the c.235delC mutant (8/1018, 0.79%) and nine alleles of the p.Val37Ile mutant (9/1018, 0.88%) in the control population. Based on our observation, the carrier frequency of c.235delC was 1.57% (8/509), and that of p.Val37Ile was 1.77% (9/509). In addition to these two most common mutations, we found two other pathogenic variants (p.[Gly45Glu;Tyr136*], and p.Arg143Trp) in this study, and the carrier frequency was estimated to be around 3.73% (19/509). Furthermore, we identified two novel variants (p.Cys60Tyr and p.Phe106Leu) whose pathogenic nature is unknown. Amino-acid conservation information and prediction by computer analysis (SIFT and PolyPhen2) indicated that p.Cys60Tyr may be pathogenic and that p.Phe106Leu would be a non-pathogenic polymorphism. In addition to these prediction method, functional studies would shed light on the pathogenesis on these variants.\n\n    In this study, we also detected two p.Thr8Met variants, one p.Ile71Thr variant, one p.Arg127His variant and one p.Phe191Leu variant, all with uncertain pathogenicity; p.Ile71Thr and p.Phe191Leu were first reported in Japanese patients. Ohtsuka et al. found four p.Ile71Thr and four p.Phe191Leu variants in 2454 alleles, but p.Ile71Thr and p.Phe191Leu were only found to be heterozygous with no other mutations being detectable; therefore, it remains a possibility that they were non-pathogenic rare polymorphisms. To date, the pathogenicity of p.Ile71Thr and p.Phe191Leu mutations has not been proven, so they may be non-pathogenic variants. The functional prediction of p.Ile71Thr was Damaging (1.0) by SIFT and Damaging (0.972) by PolyPhen2. That of p.Phe191Leu was Damaging (0.99) by SIFT and Damaging (1.0) by PolyPhen2. The p.Thr8Met variant was first reported by Kenna et al. from hearing loss patients in the US population, and it was also reported to be found in hearing-impaired patients in Japan. The functional prediction of p.Thr8Met was Damaging (0.97) by SIFT and Possibly Damaging (0.775) by PolyPhen2. The pathogenesis of the p.Arg127His variant is controversial as this variant was detected in one family with congenital deafness but the variant was found in a homozygous state in individuals with normal hearing in another study. In addition this variant was predicted to be Tolerated (0.85) by SIFT and Benign (0.001) by PolyPhen2. Considering these prediction analyses, p.Thr8Met, p.Ile71Thr and p.Phe191Leu could be pathogenic.\n\n    The carrier frequency and mutation spectrum of the Japanese population was different from those of Caucasian populations; the carrier frequency of c.35delG and c.235delC mutation is reported to be 2-3% and 0% in Caucasian, whereas 0% and 1.57% in the present study, respectively. In addition, p.Val37Ile is revealed to be common in Asian countries; the carrier frequency was 1.77% in Japanese, 1.35% in Korea and 17.1% in Thai population, respectively. In patients with impaired hearing, GJB2 mutations were reported to have a phenotype-genotype correlation. For example, the c.235delC homozygous mutation and the c.235delC/p.Arg143Trp compound heterozygous mutation show severe hearing impairment, while the p.Val37Ile homozygous mutation has a mild phenotype.\n\n    Among hearing-impaired patients in Japan, the c.235delC mutation is reported to be the most prevalent mutation. However, in people with normal hearing, the p.Val37Ile mutation was more frequent than c.235delC in our study, as with previous studies. This apparent contradiction may be because patients with the p.Val37Ile mutation have a milder phenotype and may therefore be excluded from the research on hearing loss.\n\n    Generally, in the case of autosomal recessive diseases, if the parents are related, the probability of a homozygous mutant allele increases. However, even if the parents are not related, it is still possible for both to be GJB2 mutation carriers because the GJB2 carrier frequency is estimated to be as high as around 3.7%.\n\n    In conclusion, we estimate that the GJB2 carrier frequency of the Japanese population would be about 3.7%. Almost half of these would have the p.Val37Ile mutation, whereas individuals homozygous for this mutation have a relative mild phenotype. The other major mutation allele would be c.235delC. Our study is the latest and the largest report on carrier frequencies of GJB2 mutations in the Japanese general population to date. This is indispensable information for predicting the next generation's incidence of hearing difficulty. We believe that information from this study will be useful in genetic counseling in Japan.",

        "Title": "    Genetic and clinical analysis of nonsyndromic hearing impairment in pediatric and adult cases",
        "Abstract": "    Previous studies have linked GJB2 gene and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI), but no study in China has yet investigated these mutations across all age groups. To fill the gap, this study ascertained 263 patients with NSHI between ages 2 months and 60 years and analyzed the presence of GJB2 gene and mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. A total of 20 types of mutations were detected for the GJB2 gene. The GJB2 gene and mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 18.63 and 11.41% cases, respectively. At the first hospital visit, GJB2 gene mutations were detected in 5.97% of adult patients (>18 years) and 22.96% pediatric patients (<18 years) (chi2 =9.506, p = 0.002), and mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 31.34% of adult patients and 4.59% of pediatric patients (chi2 = 35.359, p <0.001). When patients were classified by age at onset of deafness, significantly more (20.68%) pediatric patients had GJB2 gene mutations than did adult patients (0.0%) (chi2 = 4.685; p = 0.006). Mitochondrial DNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 15.38% of adult-onset and 8.86% pediatric-onset patients, respectively. Interestingly, most GJB2 gene mutation carriers experienced NSHI onset within the first year of life (65.31%), while mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutation carriers experienced onset at any age. Therefore, GJB2 gene mutations appear to contribute to congenital deafness, while mtDNAA1555G/C1494T mutations contribute mainly to acquired deafness in Chinese individuals. Both newborn hearing screening and genetic testing are important to diagnose and treat deafness.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing impairment, or deafness, results from varying degrees of auditory dysfunction that is caused by lesions in the auditory nerve and other nerve centers that perceive and transmit sounds to the brain. Approximately 60.0% of hearing impairment is associated with genetic factors, and these cases are categorized as either syndromic hearing loss (SHL) or nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI). Nonsyndromic hearing impairment can present at any age and can result from various inheritance patterns, including autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked and mitochondrial transmission of genetic alterations. For example, autosomal recessive mutations in the GJB2 gene have been linked with NSHI in Caucasians, and alterations in the mitochondrial genome [mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) A1555G/C1494T] mutations have been associated with NSHI in East Asian individuals.\n\n    Interestingly, studies in Chinese individuals have linked NSHI with both the GJB2 gene and the mtDNA A1555G and C1494T mutations. However, the mutation rates for these known alterations differ in NSHI patients across various regions. Additionally, the previous studies focused primarily on pediatric NSHI patients ages 6 to 18 years, thereby excluding other age groups and without any investigation of age-related differences in mutation type and onset of NSHI. To fill these gaps, the current study assessed both pediatric and adult NSHI patients and explored the correlations between the age of onset and clinical phenotypes and the GJB2 gene and mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutation status. These findings provide a scientific basis for developing improved guidelines for the genetic diagnosis of deafness.",
        "Methods": "    This prospective study included 263 NSHI patients who first visited the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Department at the Central Hospital of Zhumadian, Zhumadian City, Henan Province, People's Republic of China (PRC) between March 2008 and March 2013. The 168 males (63.9%) and 95 females (36.1%) had a mean age of 13.1 + 10.8 years (range: 2 months to 60 years). The mean age of NSHI onset was 5.72 years. The study excluded SHL patients and patients with complications resulting from causes such as tympanitis, meningocephalitis, late-stage Meniere's disease, trauma, acoustic neuroma and ototoxic drugs. The subjects were divided into age groups according to their ages at the first hospital visit and at onset of NSHI: adult group (>18 years old) and pediatric group (<18 years); the pediatric group was subdivided into infants (<3 years), preschool (3-6 years) and school-age (7-18 years) groups. The age of onset was defined as the age at which a patient or patient's family discovered the patient's deafness, or the age at which objective audiometry identified the condition. This study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their families.\n\n    All the patients were assessed by audiometry, including pure tone audiometry (PTA) or auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests and multiple-frequency auditory steady-state response (ASSR). The criteria for analysis and classification of deafness were in accordance with published guidelines as follows: 1) hearing loss was classified by frequency measurements as full-frequency hearing loss (0.25-8.0 kHz), high-frequency hearing loss (2.0-8.0 kHz), mid-frequency hearing loss (0.5-2.0 kHz), or low-frequency hearing loss (0.25-0.5 kHz); 2) according to the stages of speech development, deafness was classified into post-linguistic deafness (>3 years) or pre-linguistic deafness (<3 years); and 3) the severity of hearing impairment was judged by the better-hearing ear as being mild [20-40 decibels (dB), hearing level (HL)], moderate (41-70 dB HL), severe (71-95 dB HL), or profound (>95 dB HL).\n\n    Peripheral venous blood (4 mL) was collected from each subject. The Universal DNA Isolation Kit (BioTeke Corporation, Beijing, PRC) was used to isolate genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the GJB2 gene for mutation analysis. The PCR primers, synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, PRC) were as follows: downstream primer (5'-GGG CAA TGC TTA AAC TGG C-3'); upstream primer (5'-TAT GAC ACT CCC CAG CAC AG-3'). The PCR product was recovered for sequence determination. The sequencing results were compared with the published GJB2 gene sequence (GenBank accession number M86849) to determine the presence of deafness-related sequence variants.\n\n    Primers for PCR amplification covered mtDNA 1988-2007 and mtDNA 618-635, and PCR amplification involved all fragments of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. Twenty-four sets of primers, covering the whole mitochondrial genome with partially overlapping fragments, were used to perform PCR amplification for mtDNA from patients with the A1555G/C1494T mutations. After the PCR-amplified DNA was recovered from gel with the Agarose Gel DNA Purification Kit Ver. 2.0 (Code No. DV805; TaKaRa Biotech Co. Ltd., Dalin, PRC), the BigDye  Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Microread Genetics, Beijing, PRC) was used to perform sequencing on the ABI PRISM  3700 DNA automated sequencer (Biocoen Biotechnology, Beijing, PRC). Sequencing results were compared with the Cambridge Reference Sequence (GenBank accession number NC_001807).\n\n    EpiData version 3.1 was used to create a data bank using double data entry, and logic checks were performed. SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to analyze data by the chi2 test. A value of p <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.",
        "Results": "    In the 263 patients with NSHI, a total of 20 types of sequence changes were detected. These included 15 published mutations in GenBank, of which 10 were known pathogenic mutations (G4D, R32C, 35delG, E47X, W77X, 176-191del16, Q80R, 235delC, S139N and 299-300 delAT), five were previously described polymorphisms (T18I, T86R, G160S, Y38C and 50N) and five were novel sequence variations located in a highly conserved region. Table 1 lists the variations and number of affected alleles.\n\n    Of the 263 NSHI patients, 49 (18.6%) exhibited a GJB2 gene mutation: 29 cases were homozygous for a mutation, eight had compound heterozygous mutations and 12 had a single heterozygous mutation (Table 2). The types of mutation included 235delC, 176del6bp, 512insAACG, and 299delAT; 235delC was the most common type of GJB2 gene mutation, occurring in a total of 42 cases, 30 of whom were homozygous and the other 12 were heterozygous. Thirty patients (11.4%) carried mtDNA mutations; 28 cases had the C1494T mutation and two cases had the A1555G mutation.\n\n    Patients were categorized by age at the ENT Department visit (Figure 1, Table 3), resulting in 67 adults and 196 pediatric cases (72 infants, 54 preschool cases, and 70 school-age cases). The GJB2 gene mutations were detected in 5.97% adults and 22.96% pediatric cases; this difference was statistically significant (chi2 = 9.506, p = 0.002). In contrast, mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 31.34% adults and 4.59% pediatric cases; this difference was also statistically significant (chi2 = 35.359, p <0.001). Within the pediatric group, the distributions of both GJB2 gene and mtDNA mutations among the subcategories were statistically similar (each p value >0.05).\n\n    Patients were divided by age of onset of NSHI, resulting in 26 adult cases and 237 pediatric cases (186 infants, 21 preschool cases, and 30 schoolage cases) (Figure 2, Table 4). The GJB2 gene mutations were not detected in any of the adult-onset cases, but were present in 20.68% of pediatric cases; this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.006). In contrast, mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 15.38% of adult-onset patients and 8.86% of pediatric cases; this difference was not statis-tically significant (p = 0.288). Differences in mutation distributions in the pediatric subcategories were not statistically significant for either the GJB2 gene or mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations (each p value >0.05).\n\n    For the pediatric cases, hearing loss was further classified as either pre-lingual or post-lingual (Table 5). The difference in GJB2 gene mutation between these two groups was statistically significant (chi2 = 4.683, p = 0.031); in contrast, the difference in mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations between these groups was not statistically significant (chi2 = 0.695, p = 0.404).\n\n    Patients who were positive for any mutation were subdivided into three age categories by mutation status and age of onset (Table 6). Patients with the GJB2 gene mutation primarily experienced onset within the first year of life (65.31%). Those with mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were nearly evenly divided between the three onset age groups. However, the difference in onset age distributions between those with GJB2 gene mutations and those with mtDNA mutations was statistically significant (p <0.05).\n\n    Finally, patients were categorized according to their hearing loss phenotypes and mutation status. Patients with mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations generally exhibited mild-to-moderate hearing loss. In contrast, most patients with GJB2 gene mutations exhibited profound hearing loss. This difference in phenotypic distributions was statistically significant (p <0.05) (Table 7). Of the 30 patients with mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations, 22 underwent complete PTA. Severity of hearing loss was again judged according to the multiple grading standards: published recommendations, ISO-1964 criteria, and ISO-1997 criteria, as well as the mean hearing thresholds at 0.25-8.0 kHz (full frequency band), 1.0-4.0 kHz and 4.0-8.0 kHz (Table 8). The difference between hearing loss judged according to the ISO-1964 criteria and the one judged according to the mean hearing threshold at 4.0-8.0 kHz, was statistically significant (p <0.001); however, the differences between hearing loss judged according to the mean hearing threshold at 4.0-8.0 kHz and the one according to the other criteria were not statistically significant (each p value >0.05).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Genetic diagnosis can help determine the etiology of NSHI for most patients with genetic deafness. The GJB2 gene mutation is the most common cause of genetic deafness of nuclear origin. In this study, the GJB2 gene mutation was detected in 18.63% of cases, which was lower than the report from Gabriel et al. (22.0%). The mutations included 235delC, 76dell6bp, 512insAACG, and 299delAT. The 235delC was most common, and comprised both the homozygous mutation and the compound heterozygous mutation. This finding supports a previous report that a heterozygous mutation of a GJB2 gene could cause deafness. Furthermore, GJB2 gene mutations were more common in pediatric cases, both by age of onset and age of first hospital visit, than in adult cases. Interestingly, a GJB2 gene mutation was most common in cases of pre-lingual deafness, suggesting that a GJB2 gene mutation is a significant contributor to pre-lingual deafness in Chinese individuals. Moreover, the age of deafness onset in patients with GJB2 gene mutations was typically within the first year of life; therefore, clinicians should perform routine tests for GJB2 gene mutations in pediatric NSHI patients. The GJB2 gene encodes the gap junction-connexin 26 (CX26) protein. The 235delC mutation encodes a defective CX26 that results in an ineffective gap junction disrupting potassium homeostasis in the inner ear, particularly of the Corti's organ, which subsequently leads to sensorineural deafness.\n\n    The hot-spot of mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations is located at the highly conserved coding region of the 12S rRNA gene. In this study, 11.41% cases had mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations, mostly comprising the C1494T mutation. The age of onset of hearing loss did not differ by mtDNAA1555G/C1494T mutation status, suggesting that these mutations can result in congenital deafness or acquired progressive deafness. Thus, clinicians should perform genetic screening for newborns with a matrilineal history of deafness.\n\n    Interestingly, the findings of this study also indicated that patients with mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations more often exhibit mild hearing loss, often with some residual hearing. In contrast, most patients with GJB2 gene mutations exhibited profound hearing loss. However, the findings suggest that progressive aggravation of deafness is caused by mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations. The 22 patients with mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations who underwent complete PTA had more distinguishable hearing loss phenotypes. Previous studies reported differences in the deafness phenotypes of matrilineal family members carrying A1555G/C1494T mutations, in which the age of onset, the severity of hearing loss, and the hearing threshold curves differed despite shared genotypes. The grading results suggest that deaf patients can be more easily discovered earlier by judging the severity of hearing loss according to the mean hearing threshold at 4.0-8.0 kHz. Clinically, most matrilineal family members carrying mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations have no self-felt hearing loss, but hearing tests can show that the high frequency decreases, and the low frequency and the stages of speech development are mostly normal. Therefore, when judging the severity of hearing loss in patients, clinicians should pay attention to the hearing frequency at 4.0-8.0 kHz and perform genetic susceptibility testing for those with decreased high-frequency hearing.\n\n    In summary, a GJB2 gene mutation typically results in congenital deafness, while mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations can result in congenital deafness or acquired and progressive deafness. Thus, newborn hearing screening combined with genetic screening is of great significance for early discovery, and appropriate interventions, for genetic deafness.",

        "Title": "    Common Molecular Etiologies Are Rare in Nonsyndromic Tibetan Chinese Patients with Hearing Impairment",
        "Abstract": "    Thirty thousand infants are born every year with congenital hearing impairment in mainland China. Racial and regional factors are important in clinical diagnosis of genetic deafness. However, molecular etiology of hearing impairment in the Tibetan Chinese population living in the Tibetan Plateau has not been investigated. To provide appropriate genetic testing and counseling to Tibetan families, we investigated molecular etiology of nonsyndromic deafness in this population.\n\n    A total of 114 unrelated deaf Tibetan children from the Tibet Autonomous Region were enrolled. Five prominent deafness-related genes, GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB6, POU3F4, and mtDNA 12S rRNA, were analyzed. Inner ear development was evaluated by temporal CT. A total of 106 Tibetan hearing normal individuals were included as genetic controls. For radiological comparison, 120 patients, mainly of Han ethnicity, with sensorineural hearing loss were analyzed by temporal CT.\n\n    None of the Tibetan patients carried diallelic GJB2 or SLC26A4 mutations. Two patients with a history of aminoglycoside usage carried homogeneous mtDNA 12S rRNA A1555G mutation. Two controls were homozygous for 12S rRNA A1555G. There were no mutations in GJB6 or POU3F4. A diagnosis of inner ear malformation was made in 20.18% of the Tibetan patients and 21.67% of the Han deaf group. Enlarged vestibular aqueduct, the most common inner ear deformity, was not found in theTibetan patients, but was seen in 18.33% of the Han patients. Common molecular etiologies, GJB2 and SLC26A4 mutations, were rare in the Tibetan Chinese deaf population.\n\n    The mutation spectrum of hearing loss differs significantly between Chinese Tibetan patients and Han patients. The incidence of inner ear malformation in Tibetans is almost as high as that in Han deaf patients, but the types of malformation vary greatly. Hypoxia and special environment in plateau may be one cause of developmental inner ear deformity in this population.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder in humans, with an incidence rate of approximately 1 in 1000 children. Nonsyndromic deafness accounts for 60-70% of inherited hearing impairment cases and involves 114 loci and 66 different genes with autosomal dominant (DFNA), autosomal recessive (DNFB), X-linked (DFN), and maternal inheritance patterns.\n\n    In China, there are 27.80 million people with hearing and speech disabilities; of these, 20.04 million have simple hearing disability, with genetic factors accounting for about 55% of the Chinese deaf population of Han ethnicity. Worldwide, the most common causes of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss are mutations in connexin 26, a gap-junction protein encoded by the GJB2 gene. Defects in SLC26A4, which encodes the anion (chloride/iodide, chloride/bicarbonate) transporter Pendrin, can cause nonsyndromic DFNB4 deafness with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and Pendred syndrome. A mutation of SLC26A4 mutation is the second most common cause of deafness in China. Although the majority of cases of hereditary hearing loss are caused by nuclear gene defects, it has become clear that mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can also cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. The best studied mutations related to aminoglycoside suscepterblity are A1555G and C1494T in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. Nonsyndromic inherited hearing impairment caused by mutations in GJB2, SLC26A4, or mtDNA 12S rRNA typical accounts for 33.8% of the cases of deafness in areas of China.\n\n    China is a multiethnic country. Tibetans live mainly on the Tibetan Plateau, an area of southwest China with an average altitude of 4000 m above sea level, making it one of the highest region in the world. High-altitude hypoxia (reduced inspired oxygen tension owing to decreased barometric pressure) exerts severe physiological stress on the human body. Populations living on the Tibetan Plateau exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude, and these responses have been well characterized physiologically. Recent studies of the genetics associated with high-altitude adaptation have facilitated the genotype-phenotype studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-determined candidate genes and gene regions involved in adaptation to altitude. Although hearing and vestibular disorders at high altitude have been reported since 1938, the etiologies of these disorders are still unknown. The mechanisms by which the auditory system adapts to high altitude have not been elucidated in detail, and the molecular etiology of hereditary hearing loss in populations on the Tibetan Plateau remains unknown.\n\n    In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed five prominent deafness-related genes, i.e., GJB2, SLC26A4, mtDNA 12S rRNA, GJB6, and POU3F4, in 114 Tibetan patients from unrelated families in the Tibetan Plateau who experienced early-onset, nonsyndromic hearing impairment, to investigate the molecular etiology of hereditary hearing loss in this region. All of the patients underwent temporal computed tomography (CT) to evaluate inner ear development. In addition, detailed genotype and phenotype analyses were performed in the Tibetan hearing loss patients.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 114 Tibetan deaf subjects from unrelated families were included in this study. They were all from Lhasa Special Education School, which is the only special education school in Tibet Autonomous Region. This cohort consisted of 57 males and 57 females ranging in age from 8 to 21 years, with an average age of 12.10+-2.75 years. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their parents prior to blood sampling. Parents were interviewed with regard to age at onset, family history, mother's health during pregnancy, and patient's clinical history, including infection, possible head or brain injury, and the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics.\n\n    All subjects showed moderate to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment on audiograms. Careful medical examinations revealed no clinical features other than hearing impairment. None of the Tibetan patients with hearing impairment in our study showed any sign of vestibular dysfunction in their case history. Using a commercially available DNA extraction kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc., Shanghai, China), DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of the 114 patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss and the 106 region- and ethnicity-matched controls with normal hearing.\n\n    For all patients, the GJB2 coding region plus approximately 50 bp of the flanking intron regions and the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene (nt611 to nt2007) were amplified by PCR, followed by sequence analysis using the Big Dye sequencing protocol with an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer and analysis software v.3.7 NT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Patients with a monoallelic GJB2 coding region mutation were further tested for the GJB2 IVS1+1G>A mutation or defects in exon 1 and the promoter of GJB2. The specific promoter region of GJB2 includes 128 bp.The basal promoter,exon 1 and donor splice site of GJB2 gene can be found in GenBank (accession number U43932.1); the GJB6 309-kb deletion; and the mutations of the entire GJB6 coding region. The presence of the 309-kb GJB6 deletion was analyzed by PCR. A positive control (provided by Balin Wu, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) was used to detect GJB6 gene deletions.\n\n    The exons of SLC26A4 of all 114 patients were sequenced individually, starting with the frequently mutated exons, until two mutant alleles were identified. The patients verified with an inner ear malformation on a temporal bone CT scan were further tested for a POU3F4 gene mutation.\n\n    Similarly, the GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 12S rRNA genes from 106 Tibetan controls with normal hearing were sequenced to determine the presence of mutations and exon variants. As no POU3F4 variants, with the exception of two silent mutations, were found in the individuals with hearing loss, POU3F4 was not sequenced in the control group.\n\n    All 114 patients were examined by temporal bone CT for diagnosis of EVA or other inner ear malformations, at the General Hospital of Tibet Military District. The diagnosis of EVA was based on a diameter of >1.5 mm at the midpoint between the common crus and the external aperture. For radiological comparison, the temporal CT results in 120 patients, mainly of Han ethnicity, with sensorineural hearing loss were analyzed at the Genetic Testing Center for Deafness of PLA General Hospital.",
        "Results": "    Among the 114 cases included in this study, 88 had prelingual hearing loss, including 56 cases of congenital hearing loss. Eight cases showed postlingual hearing loss, with an average age of onset of 2.97+-1.37 years. The age of onset was unclear in the remaining 18 cases. Thirteen cases (8 prelingual and 5 postlingual), with an average age of onset of 2.01+-1.18 years, had a clear history of aminoglycoside administration. Patients with no history of aminoglycoside usage showed a significantly earlier average age of onset (0.92+-1.03 years; P<0.001).\n\n    Sequence analysis of the GJB2 gene indicated that none of the Tibetan patients carried two pathogenic mutations. Only two Tibetan patients carried a confirmed GJB2 heterozygous pathogenic mutation, c.235delC and c.299_300delAT mutation, respectively (Table 1). One Han patient carried a heterozygous c.235delC mutation.\n\n    The allele frequency of p.R127H, classified as a pathogenic GJB2 mutation, was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (P<0.05), indicating that p.R127H may be a mutation in the Chinese Tibetan hearing loss population. However, all 15 patients with the p.R127H mutation were heterozygotes. The pathogenic GJB2 mutation p.R32H was carried by a control subject, but was not found in the patients. An unclassified variant, p.T123N, had been counted as a mutation in a previous Japanese study, but as a polymorphism in studies performed in Taiwan and Turkey. We found two p.T123N alleles in our Tibetan control subjects, but none in the Tibetan patient group (P>0.05), suggesting that it may be a neutral variant. The frequency of p.V37I was higher in the deaf group than in the controls in the present study, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). The p.V37I variant was considered a pathogenic mutation in Japanese, Iranian, Korean, Moroccan, Malay, Israeli, Australian, and Italian studies, but was reported as a variant in African-American, Caribbean Hispanic, French, Chinese, and Thai individuals with hearing impairment. There was no significant difference in the allele frequency of p.V153I, classified previously as a polymorphism, between the Tibetan patient group and the controls in the present study (P>0.05), and we regarded it as a polymorphism. The p.V27I, p.E114G, and p.I203T variants were polymorphisms in the Chinese populations of Han and Tibetan ethnicity. The GJB2 IVS1+1G to A mutation was not detected in patients with a heterozygous GJB2 mutation, and no novel nucleotide alterations were identified in the Tibetan hearing loss patients or control subjects.\n\n    Six nucleotide changes in the SLC26A4 gene were verified through sequencing of all 20 exons of the gene from 114 Tibetan patients (Table 2). None of the Tibetan patients carried an SLC26A4 mutation on two alleles. Four patients exhibited the heterozygous c.1826T>G (p.V609G) variant. In addition, four c.1826T>G heterozygotes were verified in the control group. As there was no significant difference between the patient and control groups, we considered this a polymorphism in the Tibetan population, although Pryor et al. classified it as a mutation in 2005. The IVS13+9 C>T variant was first reported as a splice site mutation by Yong et al. in 2001. The IVS13+9 C>T variant was carried by one patient in the heterozygous state in our study population, and it did not predict a gain or loss of a splice site when analyzed using the Neural Network Splice Site Prediction Tool NNSPLICE0.9 (available at http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html). Therefore, we considered this to be a benign variant.\n\n    Two patients carried novel unclassified missense variants of SLC26A4, c.757A>G (p.I253V) and c.1522A>G (p.T508A), respectively. We found four p.I253V heterozygotes, but no p.T508A carriers in the control group. The frequency of p.I253V was higher in the control group than in the patient group (P>0.05). No p.I253V allele was found in 100 normally hearing individuals of Han ethnicity (unpublished data). Thus, we considered it to be a polymorphism typical of the Tibetan Chinese population.\n\n    Both c.273A>T (p.G91G) and c.753C>T (p.L251L) are silent variants of SLC26A4. The intron18-56delCAAA was considered to be an intron variant.\n\n    Two Tibetan patients and two normal hearing Tibetan controls carried a homogeneous mtDNA 12S rRNA A1555G mutation. Neither the C1494T mutation nor any other 12S rRNA mutation associated with hearing impairment, including nucleotide changes at positions 961 and 1095, were found in the Tibetan patient or control groups.\n\n    No POU3F4 mutations, with the exception of the two polymorphisms 708A>G (E236E) and 710G>C (E236E), were identified in the 23 patients with inner ear malformation.\n\n    Nine types of inner ear malformations were verified on temporal bone CT scans in 23 Tibetan patients (a total of 37 ears) (Table 3). The frequency of inner ear malformation in the Tibetan hearing-loss patients was 20.18% (23/114). EVA, the most common type of inner ear malformation in China reported in previous studies, was not detected in the Tibetan deafness patients in the present study. The results of temporal CT in 120 patients, mainly of Han ethnicity, with sensorineural hearing loss revealed that 21.67% (26/120) had an inner ear malformation, 18.33% (22/120) had EVA, and only 3.33% (4/120) showed other types of inner ear malformations, including hypoplastic cochlea, hypoplastic vestibular aqueduct, incomplete partition type I, and common cavity (Fig. 1).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    According to the second nationwide survey of the disabled Chinese population performed in 2006, there were 27.80 million people with hearing and speech disabilities in China. The number of Chinese with hearing disability alone is 20.04 million, representing 1.54% of the population (20.04 million/1300 million). The percentage of the population with hearing disability in the Tibet Autonomous Region is 1.65%. More than 92% of the whole population in the Tibet Autonomous Region is Tibetan, and 93.4% of the patients in our study population were Tibetan. Despite a similar incidence of moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the Tibetan and Chinese populations, the molecular etiology in Tibetan patients appeared differ markedly from that in the Chinese population as a whole based on the present results. We found no homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the GJB2 or SLC26A4 gene. The mtDNA 12S rRNA A1555G homogeneous mutation and the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics were responsible for hearing loss in 1.75% (2/114) of the Tibetan patients. In typical areas of China, GJB2 gene mutations account for the etiology in about 18.31% of patients with hearing loss, SLC26A4 mutations account for about 13.73%, and the 12S rRNA A1555G mutation accounts for 1.76%. There is no significant difference in the 12S rRNA A1555G mutation rate between the Tibetan patients with hearing impairment and the patients mainly of Han ethnicity.\n\n    The pathogenicity of the GJB2 p.V37I mutation is controversial. In a multicenter study, p.V37I was shown to be associated with mild to moderate hearing impairment (median, 25-40 dB). Our recent study indicated p.V37I had an allele frequency of 6.7% (185/2744) in a Han patient group (excluding all cases with two clearly pathogenic mutations), and this was significantly higher than that in a control population (2.8%, 17/602; P = 0.0003), supporting Wu's suggestion that p.V37I should be reassigned from an allele variant to a pathogenic mutation. In the present study, the frequency of p.V37I was higher in Tibetan patients with hearing loss than in ethnicity-matched controls, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). Since our sample size was still too small to reach a confident statistical conclusion.and only two of our Tibetan patients carried GJB2 p.V37I (table 1), our results didn't support that p.V37I was pathogenic in Tibetan Chinese patients. Alternative explanation may be another unknown mutation associated with the V37I mutation is responsible for the etiology of Tibetan Chinese patients with hearing loss.\n\n    POU3F4 has been identified only for the Locus DFN3. The clinical features of DFN3 often include mixed progressive hearing loss, temporal bone anomalies, and stapes fixation. POU3F4 belongs to a subfamily of transcription factors characterized by two conserved DNA-binding domains, a POU and a HOX domain, containing a helix-turn-helix structural DNA-binding motif. Several reports have described POU3F4 mutations in patients with hearing loss and temporal bone abnormalities. Temporal bone CT scans of DFN3 patients as well as the Pou3f4 knockout inner ear phenotypes have suggested that most of the inner ear malformations were in structures derived from the mesenchyme. However, no variants or mutations were found in Tibetan patients recruited in this study with inner ear malformation.A series of transcription factors, including Pax2, Six, Eya1, Dlx, Hmx2-3, GATA3, RA, Otx1-2, IGF-1, and Tbx1, are related to the development of the mammalian otic capsule, and defects in these factors were reported to cause inner ear deformities in mice. As the phenotype and genotype correlations for these genes in human patients with inner ear malformation are not clear, we did not screen for these genes in our patients.\n\n    The inner ear malformations in our Tibetan patients were diverse and severe. EVA, the most common inner ear deformity, was not found in our cases. This radiological finding was consistent with the genetic analyses, as no diallelic mutations were found in the open reading frame of SLC26A4. A novel SLC26A4 variant, p.T508A, was identified in the Tibetan patient group. The location of this amino acid in an evolutionarily conserved region implies that its substitution may result in a structurally and/or functionally different protein. We then carried a SIFT analysis on SLC26A4 p.T508A variant.The SIFT score was 0.17 and the SIFT prediction result was that the amino acid change was tolerated,which indicated it may be only a variant or be less likely a pathogenic mutation.There are two types of inner ear malformation: osseous labyrinth deformity and membranous labyrinth deformity. We assessed only the osseous labyrinth shape by high-resolution temporal bone CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and water image of the inner ear may be valuable for assessment of membranous labyrinth deformity. However, we did not perform these two radiological examinations and could not evaluate the membranous labyrinth. Whether malformation of vestibular and/or semicircular canals can cause hearing-related phenotypes is not certain, but imbalances of the ion environment in the cochlea as well as structural abnormalities can result in hearing impairment. Hearing loss caused by EVA is an example of a pathology with normal cochlear structure, but with a suggested cochlear ion imbalance.\n\n    To our knowledge, there have been no previous studies of the genetic etiology of hearing loss in Tibetan patients. The distinct mutational spectrum of common hearing-related genes in the Tibetan patients compared with typical patients in other areas of China may be explained by ethnic and regional factors. According to archeological data, the Tibetan Plateau was first populated approximately 25,000 years ago. Compared with low-altitude populations, the populations indigenous to the high-altitude zones possess unique physiological characteristics. Some of the environmental hardships at high altitudes include, but are not limited to, decreased ambient oxygen tension, increased solar radiation, extreme diurnal ranges in temperature, arid climate, and poor soil quality. The incidence of congenital heart disease including patent ductus arteriosus,ventricular septal defect,ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect and valvular insufficiency in the Tibetan plateau is 0.615%.It is higher than that in lower altitude areas in China,which is 0.31% in Chengdu from Sichuang Province, 0.239% in Hefei from Anhui Province and 0.28% in Fuzhou from Fujian Province,respectively. And with the increase of altitude in the same province,the incidence of congenital heart disease is increasing,which indicated that anoxia in high altitude area was regarded as one of the enviromental factors related with congenital heart disease. Several studies have shown that Tibetan populations have lower hemoglobin concentrations than lowland Chinese populations. Related studies have explored the heritability of specific altitude-related phenotypes, such as arterial oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration. One heritability study concluded that there is a major autosomal dominant locus for high oxygen saturation, and Tibetan women carrying this high oxygen-saturation allele had higher offspring survival than those with a low oxygen-saturation allele. In addition, positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype unique to this highland population. The genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet suggests that epigenetic regulation may play a greater role in the physiopathological process in Tibetans, although this has yet to be confirmed. High-altitude hypoxia exerts severe physiological stress on the human body, including embryonic auditory organ development.\n\n    The results of the present study indicate that the mutation spectrum of Tibetan Chinese patients with hearing loss is significantly different from that seen in patients of Han ethnicity. The incidence of inner ear malformation in the Tibetan Chinese population is almost as high as that in Chinese Han patients, but the types of malformation vary greatly in the Tibetan population. The most common inner ear deformity, enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), is rare in the Chinese Tibetan hearing-loss population. Hypoxia may be one of the causes for the development of inner ear deformity, but further studies are required to determine the genetic etiology of hearing loss in Tibetan patients.\n\n    Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\n    Funding: This work was supported by Chinese National Nature Science Foundation Research Grant (30572015, 30728030, 31071109), State 863 High Technology R&D Key Project of China(SQ2010AA0221634001) and grant from the Minister of Science and Technology (2012BAI09B02) to Dr. Pu Dai, Chinese National Nature Science Foundation Research Grant (30801285) and Beijing Nova programme (2009B34) to Dr. Yongyi Yuan, Chinese National Nature Science Foundation Research Grant (81000415) and Beijing Nova programme (2010B081) to Dr. Guojian Wang.

        "Title": "    Association between the p.V37I variant of GJB2 and hearing loss: a pedigree and meta-analysis",
        "Abstract": "    Pathogenic variants in the gap junction protein beta-2 (GJB2) gene are the most common cause of hearing loss. Of these, the p.V37I variant of GJB2 has a high allele frequency (up to 10%) in East Asians. Characterization of the phenotypic spectrum associated with p.V37I, as well as the role of this variant in the onset of hearing loss could have a remarkable effect on future diagnostic strategies. Here, we performed a pedigree analysis of unrelated families exhibiting various hearing phenotypes, and then conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the association between the p.V37I and the risk of hearing loss. Pedigree analyses showed that both homozygous p.V37I variants, as well as compound heterozygous p.V37I with other GJB2 pathogenic variants, contributed to various phenotypes of hearing loss. Meanwhile, meta-analysis demonstrated that, compared with those in the wild type group, both p.V37I homozygotes and compound heterozygous p.V37I variants were at significantly higher risk of developing hearing loss (odds ratios = 7.14 and 3.63; 95% confidence intervals = 3.01-16.95 and 1.38-9.54, respectively). Conversely, heterozygous p.V37I variants alone did not increase the risk of hearing loss. Given the high allele carriage rate of p.V37I (up to 10%) within the general population, our work not only provides information that might influence future genetic screening policies, but also offers insight into clinical risk evaluation and genetic counseling regarding hearing loss.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss (HL) is the most sensory defect that affects 1-3 in every 1,000 newborns worldwide, and half of these cases are attributed to genetic factors. Notably, while a large number of HL-related genes have been identified, the gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) gene accounts for nearly 20% of all cases of HL, as well as 50% of autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL, in many populations. GJB2 encodes the connexin 26 protein, which comprises a critical component of cochlear gap junctions, and is important to cell communication. To date, greater than 300 variants within GJB2 have been found to be associated with HL (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/), including c.35delG, c.235delC, and c.176_191del16.\n\n    In particular, the p.V37I (c.109G>A) variant of GJB2 has a high allele frequency (up to 10%) among East Asian populations. This variant, harboring a missense substitution from valine to isoleucine at codon 37, was first identified by Kelley et al. in 1998. Early studies regarded the p.V37I as a benign polymorphism, as it was observed in unaffected heterozygous controls. However, the identification of increasing numbers of HL patients that are homozygous for p.V37I, or compound heterozygous for p.V37I and other GJB2 pathogenic variants, indicates that p.V37I likely increases the risk of HL, particularly for mild-to-moderate cases. Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis reported an insignificant association between the carriage rates of p.V37I and HL, which aroused wide concern regarding the pathogenicity of this variant.\n\n    Given the high allelic frequency of the p.V37I variant (up to 10%), it is estimated that greater than five million East Asians suffer from HL due to homozygous or compound heterozygous carriage of this allele. It is therefore imperative to evaluate the risks associated with p.V37I for clinical genetic counseling and public health assessment purposes. In this study, we performed a pedigree analysis of families with probands exhibiting various HL phenotypes, and then conducted a meta-analysis of sporadic HL to comprehensively evaluate the role of p.V37I in the risk of HL.",
        "Methods": "    For this study, we recruited seven unrelated probands with non-syndromic, sensorineural hearing loss, and their family members. Each participant provided written informed consent. For underage participants, written informed consent was obtained from their parents. Our study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. All procedures were performed according to the ethical guidelines for human subjects research.\n\n    All participants were subjected to physical and neurological examinations to exclude syndromic deafness. Each participant's level of hearing was assessed via a comprehensive auditory evaluation, such as by otoscope examination, tympanometry, or pure-tone audiometry (PTA). For very young participants, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and/or auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) were recorded. Degree of hearing loss was estimated as the average hearing levels at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz for the better ear. Severity of hearing loss was categorized as normal (<25 dB), mild (26-40 dB), moderate (41-70 dB), severe (71-95 dB), or profound ( >95 dB). In addition, we defined sudden deafness as over 30 dB of sensorineural hearing loss involving at least three frequencies occurring less than 72 hours.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from anticoagulant peripheral blood by the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). For mutation screening, the entire coding region and flanking sequences of four commonly mutated genes, GJB2, SLC26A4, 12S rRNA, and GJB3, were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and then subjected to bidirectional sequencing with an ABI 3500 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The primers and PCR conditions used for these analyses are described in detail in Supplementary Table 1. Sanger sequencing results of pedigree analyses were shown in Supplementary Figure 4.\n\n    We further performed a meta-analysis to determine the detrimental effects of p.V37I on sporadic HL, according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A structured literature search was conducted of articles published through November 2016 using the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases and the following search items: \"GJB2 OR connexin 26\", \"polymorphism OR variant OR mutation\", \"hearing loss OR deafness\", and \"case-control OR cohort OR population\". Only English language articles were included. The inclusion criteria were: (i) studies that investigated the association between p.V37I and HL under a case-control or cohort design; (ii) studies that reported genotypes or allelic data for p.V37I to estimate OR and 95%CI. In cases of overlapping populations, the study with the largest sample size was included. We used OR as the effect measure and combined data using a random-effects model. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the controls was checked by chi2 test. Meanwhile, Cochran chi2 test and I2 values were used to evaluate the heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias assessment were also conducted. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), and P <= 0.05 was considered significant for all tests.",
        "Results": "    Seven families carrying the p.V37I variant were included for pedigree analyses (Table 1 and Figure 1). There were five male and two female probands. Six probands were children (7 months-9 years) and one proband was an adult (33 years). These probands exhibited both congenital and delayed-onset non-syndromic HL, and one member had sudden deafness. Bilateral and unilateral non-syndromic HL were also observed, with HL degrees of mild to moderate. Families 1-5 had probands that were homozygous for p.V37I (S1-S5), while the probands of Families 6 and 7 had compound heterozygous p.V37I variants (H1-H2). In this study, compound heterozygous p.V37I variants were defined as the p.V37I allele in a trans configuration with another pathogenic mutant allele of GJB2 gene. Pedigree analyses revealed that p.V37I was transmitted from heterozygous parents to their children, who suffered HL if he/she inherited two affected alleles (p.V37I homozygotes or compound heterozygous p.V37I variants). Meanwhile, siblings that inherited one affected allele retained normal hearing. These analyses strongly suggest that p.V37I increases the risk of HL through an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n    To further determine the detrimental effects of p.V37I, we performed a meta-analysis. A flow chart of the literature search is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. A total of 1,085 potentially relevant records were initially identified in our search. Of these, 391 duplicates and 644 irrelevant records were removed upon reviewing titles and abstracts, yielding 50 full-text articles for further evaluation. Seventeen studies were subsequently excluded because they provided no genetic data regarding the p.V37I variant (n = 7), they lacked sufficient information to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (n = 7), they lacked a parallel control group (n = 2), or their data overlapped with that of another study (n = 1). Of the 33 remaining studies eligible for meta-analysis, 10 also provided genotypes of compound heterozygous p.V37I variants.\n\n    As shown in Table 2, a total of 14,398 HL cases and 8,699 controls were included to evaluate the association between p.V37I and HL risk. Twenty of the studies were conducted in Asia (China, Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia), while six were conducted in North America (United States and Canada), five in Europe (Portugal, Italy, Finland, France and Spain), one in Latin America (Argentina), and one in Oceania (Australia). Overall, there was a significant association between the p.V37I variant and increased risk of developing HL (Figure 2). Specifically, the A allele of p.V37I was associated with a 2-fold higher risk of developing HL than the G allele (Figure 2A; OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.42-2.56; Pheterogeneity < 0.001; I2 = 74.9%). Moreover, compared with individuals with wild type, p.V37I homozygotes (Figure 2C; OR = 7.14; 95% CI = 3.01-16.95; Pheterogeneity < 0.001; I2 = 70.9%), but not p.V37I heterozygotes (Figure 2B; OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.92-1.52; Pheterogeneity = 0.034; I2 = 35.5%), had a significantly higher risk (7.14-fold greater) of developing HL. Similar results were obtained using the recessive model (Figure 2D; OR = 7.02; 95% CI = 2.95-16.66; Pheterogeneity < 0.001; I2 = 71.1%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that our results were quite stable (Supplementary Figure 2A-2D) and no obvious publication biases were found (all P > 0.10).\n\n    Furthermore, we evaluated the association between compound heterozygous p.V37I variants on HL risk. Ten eligible studies comprising of 6,762 cases and 4,211 controls were included (Table 3). Notably, our results suggest that people harboring compound heterozygous p.V37I variants have a 3.63-fold higher risk of HL than those without these variants (Figure 3; OR = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.38-9.54; Pheterogeneity = 0.060; I2 = 44.9%). These results were strongly supported by sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Figure 3), and no publication bias was found (P = 0.152).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we demonstrated that bi-allelic or compound heterozygous p.V37I variants are associated with increased risk of various HL phenotypes, and quantified the risk associated with these variants and development of HL.\n\n    Our pedigree analyses indicated that p.V37I can cause HL as either a homozygous variant or as compound heterozygous with other pathogenic variants in GJB2. Functional studies performed in cells and mouse models support this conclusion. In consistent with previous reports, we observed that the HL phenotypes associated with p.V37I varied by onset type, disease site, and degree of HL, implying that other causes, especially environmental factors, influence p.V37I-mediated onset of HL. Notably, we also found that homozygous p.V37I might give rise to sudden deafness in children. Indeed, similar results were reported in a recent study. As such, p.V37I might be considered as a potential cause of sudden onset of deafness in future cases.\n\n    To quantify the pathogenic association between p.V37I and HL risk, we performed a meta-analysis. In keeping with previous cohort studies and functional experiments, our results supported the conclusion that the p.V37I variant significantly increases an individual's risk of developing HL. Compared with wild type individuals, the p.V37I homozygote group, but not the heterozygote group, showed a significantly greater likelihood of developing HL. This could explain why p.V37I heterozygotes are prevalent among the general healthy population, while bi-allelic p.V37I variants are found predominantly in patients with HL. Notably, our results also indicate that the compound heterozygous p.V37I variants are associated with a nearly four-fold greater risk of developing HL, compared to wild type individuals. In view of the high prevalence of p.V37I and the large number of other GJB2 pathogenic variants, our findings indicate that previous reports have likely underestimated HL risk in human populations. Compared with the previous meta-analysis, our work included more eligible studies and quantified the risky effects of p.V37I on HL in more detail.\n\n    The major strengths of our work were the variable phenotypic spectrum associated with p.V37I and that a large population (23,097 participants) was used to evaluate the association between this variant and HL risk. However, our results should be interpreted with caution. First, only commonly known HL-related variants (variants within the GJB2, SLC26A4, 12S rRNA, and GJB3 coding regions) were screened in our pedigree analysis. Second, the number of studies regarding compound heterozygous p.V37I variants evaluated herein was insufficient to further explore the concrete effects of particular compound variant types on HL risk. Third, although both our study and previous reports found that p.V37I is associated with various HL phenotypes, the specific mechanism by which this variant promotes HL, such as interactions between p.V37I and other genetic or environmental factors, remains unclear. Further studies are therefore needed to address these issues.\n\n    In summary, our work strongly suggests a pathogenic role for p.V37I in various HL phenotypes and provides a quantitative assessment of the risk associated with carriage of this variant and development of HL. Considering the high carriage rate of p.V37I within the general population, these findings provide compelling information that should influence future genetic screening policy and that offer insights into clinical risk evaluation and genetic counseling.",

        "Title": "    Modulation of TonEBP activity by SUMO modification in response to hypertonicity",
        "Abstract": "    TonEBP is a DNA binding transcriptional enhancer that enables cellular adaptation to hypertonic stress by promoting expression of specific genes. TonEBP expression is very high in the renal medulla because local hypertonicity stimulates its expression. Given the high level of expression, it is not well understood how TonEBP activity is modulated. Here we report that TonEBP is post-translationally modified by SUMO, i.e., sumoylated, in the renal medulla but not in other isotonic organs. The sumoylation is reproduced in cultured cells when switched to hypertonicity. Analyses of site-directed TonEBP mutants reveal that K556 and K603 are independently sumoylated in response to hypertonicity. DNA binding is required for the sumoylation. Functional analyses of non-sumoylated mutants and SUMO-conjugated constructs show that sumoylation inhibits TonEBP in a dose-dependent manner but independent of the site of SUMO conjugation. Sumoylation inhibits transactivation without affecting nuclear translocation or DNA binding. These data suggest that sumoylation modulates the activity of TonEBP in the hypertonic renal medulla to prevent excessive action of TonEBP.",
        "Introduction": "    TonEBP (tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein), also known as NFAT5 (nuclear factor of T cell 5), was originally identified as the key transcription factor that enables the cellular survival under hypertonic conditions (Miyakawa et al.,). TonEBP is a DNA binding protein that stimulates the transcription of a variety of genes involved in the survival under hypertonic conditions (Kwon et al.,). While some of these genes encode proteins involved in organic osmolyte accumulation, how other genes promote cellular adaptation to hypertonicity is poorly understood (Lee et al.,). Animals deficient in TonEBP activity display severe renal atrophy which is preceded by massive cell death in the renal medulla as cells fail to adapt to the local hypertonicity (Lopez-Rodriguez et al.,).\n\n    TonEBP is activated by hypertonicity in multiple pathways:nuclear translocation, enhanced transactivation, and increased abundance. Tonicity-sensitive nuclear localization signal in the TonEBP molecule is described for the hypertonicity-induced nuclear translocation (Kwon et al.,). Although domains of TonEBP involved in the hypertonicity stimulation are defined (Lee et al.,), it remains unclear how tonicity regulates these domains. Increased stability or half-life of TonEBP mRNA has been described to explain the enhanced expression of TonEBP in hypertonicity (Cai et al.,).\n\n    SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is structurally related to ubiquitin. SUMO modification or sumoylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates protein functions including transcription, signal transduction, and DNA repair (Geiss-Friedlander and Melchior,). In mammals, SUMO2 and SUMO3 are 97% identical to each other and about 50% identical to SUMO1 (Saitoh and Hinchey,).\n\n    In the kidney medulla, expression of TonEBP stays very high due to local hypertonicity. Here we found evidence that the TonEBP activity was modulated by sumoylation in the renal medulla. TonEBP is sumoylated on two lysine residues in a manner dependent on ambient hypertonicity. Sumoylation inhibits the transactivation of TonEBP in a dose-dependent manner.",
        "Methods": "    Male Sprague-Dawley rats weight 180 g were purchased from Harland Sprague Dawley Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA. All the procedures had been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland. The animals were allowed to free access to water and food before they were euthanized for collection of kidneys and urine samples.\n\n    HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). 0.25 mug of plasmid DNA in 250 mul of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was mixed with 5 mul of Lipofectamine2000 dissolved in 250 mul of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was added to a 1.5 ml of trypsinized cell suspension containing 3.5 million cells in antibiotics-free culture medium, and seeded in a well of a 6-well cluster. After a day, the cells were cultured in isotonic or hyperosmotic medium made by addition of NaCl, sorbitol, or urea.\n\n    All the expression constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. A cDNA encoding the c-form of human TonEBP mRNA (Maouyo et al.,) was cloned into a mammalian expression vector pCMV-Tag2 to produce FLAG-tagged TonEBP. Site-directed mutants were made using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). SUMO fused TonEBP constructs were made by insertion of PCR amplified SUMO fragments (without the C-terminal di-glycine residues) between FLAG and TonEBP. Expression plasmids for Ubc9, Xpress-tagged SUMO isoforms, PIAS1, PIASxalpha were described previously (Choi et al.,; Wei et al.,). Expression vectors for mPIASy and mPIAS3 (Sramko et al.,) were kindly provided by Juraj Bies (NIH, Bethesda).\n\n    For immunoblot detection of sumoylated TonEBP, prevention of proteolytic removal of SUMO was critical. Fresh rat tissues including brain, kidney, and lung were immediately homogenized for 30 s at full speed using Polytron (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY) in 30 volumes of hot (90-95 ) lysis buffer (1.0% SDS, 1.0 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). An aliquot was saved for protein assay using the BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Concentrated Laemmli buffer was mixed and boiled for 5 min. As for HEK293 cells, washed and pelleted cells were homogenized in the hot lysis buffer by passing through a 24-G needle several times. TonEBP (Miyakawa et al.,) and FLAG antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used for immunoblot analysis {1:2000}. For immunoprecipitation of TonEBP conjugated to the Xpress-tagged SUMO's, transfected HEK293 cells were homogenized in the hot lysis buffer and diluted 1:10 in IP buffer [150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5]. The diluted homogenate was incubated overnight with Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) at 4  and the antigen-antibody complex was recovered using Protein G/A-agarose (Upstate, Billerica, MA).\n\n    To assay the TonE-driven transcription, 0.8 x 106 cells in suspension were transfected with 50 ng of TonE-driven Photinus luciferase expression construct (Colla et al.,) along with 100 ng of various combinations of empty vector plus TonEBP expression vectors in a well of 24-well cluster. After 20 h, the cells were switched to hypertonic medium or isotonic medium and cultured for an additional 4 h. Activity of luciferase from cell lysates was measured using a commercial kit, the Luciferase  Reporter Assay system (Promega, Madisone, WI). To analyze the transactivation of TonEBP, suspended cells were transfected with 200 ng of Gal4 upstream activation sequence-driven photinus luciferase expression construct (pFR-Luc), 50 ng of expression vector for GAL4-DBD (Gal4 DNA binding domain) fused to wild type or mutant TonEBP. The cells were treated and expression of luciferase was analyzed as above.\n\n    RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells using TriZol (Invitrogen). RPA probes were synthesized using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase from the following cDNA's cloned in pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen): human SMIT (nucleotides 1618-1967 of NM_006933) and human AR (corresponding to nucleotides 608-992 of NM_020299). The plasmid for synthesis of human beta-actin probe was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). A commercial kit (Ambion) was used for RPA. Radioactivity of protected bands was visualized and quantified using a phosphorImager (BioRad, Hercules, CA). In each sample, the radioactivity of the SMIT or AR mRNA band was corrected for RNA loading by dividing with that of the beta-actin mRNA band.\n\n    Cell extracts were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with various TonEBP mutants using IP buffer (see above). Double-stranded DNA containing \"hTonE\" sequence (Miyakawa et al.,) was end-labeled using gamma-[32P]-ATP. The cell extract (5 mug protein per reaction) was incubated for 10 min with 1 mug of poly(dA dT) in 20 mul containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol. Where indicated 100 nM unlabeled hTonE was added. After addition of 1 nM [32P]-hTonE, the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was electrophoresed for 2.5 h on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA at 150 V. Radioactivity of the TonEBP bands were visualized and quantified using PhosphorImager.\n\n    Where indicated data are expressed in Mean and s.e.m. with the number of independent experiments (n). T-test was performed using Microsoft Excel software.",
        "Results": "    While performing immunoblot analysis of TonEBP in animal tissues, we found that TonEBP was highly susceptible to proteolysis. To minimize the proteolysis, we have adopted the use of strong (1%) SDS in combination with immediate boiling for sample preparation as described in Materials and Methods. The new procedure yielded increased and reliable immunoblot signals for TonEBP. In addition, it came to our attention that two slow bands emerged in addition to the normal TonEBP band when samples from the outer (not shown) and inner medullae (Figure 1A) of kidneys were used. The slow bands were not seen in other tissues such as brain and lung (Figure 1A). Because the renal medulla is hyperosmotic, we tested whether hyperosmolality induced the slow TonEBP band. When HEK293 cells were cultured in hyperosmotic medium made by addition of 100 mM NaCl, the slow bands appeared clearly after 4 h and increased slowly over the course of 24 h (Figure 1B). The slow bands were also observed in other cell lines such as MDCK, HepG2, MEF, and RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). While NaCl or sorbitol was effective, urea was not effective in inducing the slow bands (Figure 1C) demonstrating that hypertonicity (effective hyperosmolality that causes water efflux from the cell) rather than hyperosmolality per se was the signal for the induction of the slow bands.\n\n    Since the slow TonEBP bands were ~16 and ~32 kDa larger than TonEBP, we asked whether they were TonEBP molecules conjugated to SUMO, i.e., sumoylated TonEBP molecules. We found that overexpression of Ubc9, the only known E2 ligase for SUMO, promoted the formation of slow bands from endogenous TonEBP or transfected TonEBP (not shown; longer exposure the immunblot shown in Figure 2A revealed the slow bands in the first six lanes). Simultaneous overexpression of TonEBP, Ubc9, and Xpress-tagged SUMO isoforms resulted in a dramatic enhancement of the slow bands (Figure 2A). When the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the Xpress tag, the slow bands were found in the pellets with TonEBP immuno-reactivity (Figure 2B) directly demonstrating that the slow bands were indeed sumoylated TonEBP molecules. The data in Figure 2 showed that SUMO3 and SUMO2 were far more efficient in sumoylation of TonEBP, and the sumoylation was stimulated by hypertonicity.\n\n    The majority of lysine residues conjugated to SUMO fit the consensus sequence: PsiKxE (Psi is a large hydrophobic residue and x is any residue). There are six lysines in the human TonEBP molecule that fit the consensus as shown in Figure 3A. When individually mutated to arginine residues, only K556R and K603R mutants showed one slow bands while other mutants displayed two slow bands. When both residues were mutated (K556R/K603R), the remaining slow band disappeared demonstrating that TonEBP were di-sumoylated on K556 and K603. The activity of TonEBP increased in the single mutant and even higher in the double mutant (Figure 3C) suggesting that sumoylation inhibits TonEBP in a manner dependent on the stoichiometry of sumoylation (see more below). In addition, we concluded that sumoylations on the two lysine residues were independent of each other because mutation of one site did not affect sumoylation of the other. The sequence around K556 and K603 is conserved in all species from human to zebrafish suggesting that sumoylation of TonEBP is an important aspect of TonEBP regulation.\n\n    Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation is required for sumolyation in several transcription factors such as heat-shock factors, GATA-1, and myocyte enhancer factor two (Gregoire and Yang,; Hietakangas et al.,). This is mediated by the phsophorylation-dependent sumoylation motif: PsiKxExxSP. The sequences around the two sumoylation sites of TonEBP appear to conform to the consensus: VK556KEISS601P and IK603SEDVT608P. Since TonEBP is phosphorylated in response to hypertonicity (Dahl et al.,; Lee et al.,), we examined the role of S600/S601 and T608. For this, we made phosphorylation-negative mutants:S600A/S601A and T608A:as well and phosphorylation-mimicking mutants S601D and T608E. However, sumoylation and transcriptional activity of these mutants were not affected by any of the mutations individually or in combination (data not shown). We conclude that phosphorylation of S600/S601 or T608 has no bearings on the sumoylation of TonEBP.\n\n    Like NFkappaB, TonEBP forms a dimer and the dimerization is required for DNA binding (Lee et al.,; Stroud et al.,). We made site-directed mutants incapable of dimerization (DIM:dimer interface mutant: F464A/I466A) and incapable of DNA contact (DBM:DNA binding mutant: T298A/E299A/R302A). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that DIM was monomeric in solution while WT formed dimers (data not shown). As expected from the crystal structure of the Rel-homology domain of TonEBP (Stroud et al.,), DIM as well as DBM failed to bind DNA (Figure 4A). It should be pointed out that the sumoylation-negative mutant (MT in Figure 4B) bound DNA normally (see below). Interestingly, sumoylation was dramatically reduced in DIM and DBM as in MT (Figure 4B). These data provide evidence that DNA binding is required for the sumoylation of TonEBP. This raises the possibility that sumoylation of TonEBP takes place on the surface of chromatin when TonEBP is bound to DNA.\n\n    The data shown in Figure 3C indicate that sumoylation leads to inhibition of TonEBP. To explore the functional consequence of the sumoylation further, we examined transcriptional activity of several TonEBP mutants along with WT (wild type TonEBP): SUMO-WT (SUMO3 was fused to WT to mimic sumoylated TonEBP), MT (K556R/K603R mutant that is incapable of sumoylation as shown in Figure 3), and SUMO-MT (MT fused to SUMO3) as schematically depicted in Figure 5A. WT stimulated the expression of TonE-driven reporter in a dose dependant manner in isotonic and hypertonic condition, as reported previously (Maouyo et al.,). SUMO-WT is practically inactive except for a small activity in isotonicity, while MT was two times more active than WT. Interestingly SUMO-MT displayed activity comparable to that of WT suggesting that WT was normally mono-sumoylated. Essentially the same effects were observed on the mRNA expression of TonEBP target genes, SMIT (Figure 5C) and AR (not shown), especially under isotonic conditions. Taken together, the data in Figure 5 demonstrate that sumoylation inhibits TonEBP in a manner dependent on the stoichiometry of sumoylation.\n\n    The data in Figure 2 showed that the efficiency of TonEBP sumoylation differed depending on the isoform of SUMO:SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3:involved. Here we examined the different isoforms of SUMO on the efficiency of TonEBP inhibition. We made more SUMO fusion constructs using SUMO1 and SUMO2 in addition to SUMO3 as depicted in Figure 6A. While the conjugation of SUMO2 led to almost identical results to that of SUMO3, the conjugation of SUMO1 resulted in a smaller inhibition of TonEBP (Figure 6B). This is not surprising because SUMO2 and SUMO3 share 97% of amino acids while SUMO1 shares only 50% with SUMO2 or SUMO3 (Saitoh and Hinchey,). Combined with the data in Figure 2, these results show that SUMO2 and SUMO3 are more effective in inhibiting TonEBP compared to SUMO1 as well as being more efficient in the sumoylation of TonEBP.\n\n    We asked how sumoylation inhibited TonEBP using the non-sumoylated and sumoylation-mimicking TonEBP mutants discussed above. First, we examined the nuclear translocation of TonEBP in response to hypertonicity. We found that all the mutants displayed normal nuclear translocation (data not shown). Second, we found that the mutants bound TonE containing DNA like wild type TonEBP with comparable efficiency and affinity (Figure 7). Thus, sumoylation of TonEBP did not influence the nuclear translocation or DNA binding.\n\n    Next, we examined the transactivation of TonEBP by employing fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (G4DBD). To eliminate potential complications of dimer formation by TonEBP, dimer interface mutations (see Figure 4) were introduced into TonEBP as indicated in Figure 8A. We later found that introduction of these mutations did not affect the results, i.e., the results were the same without or with the dimer interface mutations (not shown). As shown in Figure 8B, wild type TonEBP displayed a strong transactivation, which was stimulated by hypertonicity as reported earlier (Lee et al.,). The transactivation was inhibited more than 80% by SUMO fusion (G4DBD-SUMO-WTDIM), but stimulated by several folds in the mutant incapable of being sumoylated (G4DBD-MTDIM). These data demonstrate that sumoylation is a powerful negative regulator for the transactivation of TonEBP.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In order to understand the slow TonEBP immunoreactive bands observed in the renal medulla, we investigated sumoylation of TonEBP. The slow bands are not observed in isotonic tissues like brain and lung. On the other hand, the slow bands are reproduced in cultured cells when the cells are subjected to hypertonicity. Because of the transient nature of sumoylation in general, we used overexpression of SUMO E2 ligase Ubc9 in combination with SUMO isoforms to demonstrate that TonEBP is di-sumolyated on lysine 556 and lysine 603. The sumoylation appears to take place in the nucleus because DNA binding is required. This is supported by the time course of sumoylation in response to hypertonicity which mirrors the previously reported time course of binding to the TonE sites (Miyakawa et al.,). Studies using site-directed TonEBP mutants incapable of sumoylation and SUMO-conjugated TonEBP constructs reveal that TonEBP is inhibited by sumoylation in a dose-dependent manner regardless of the position of SUMO conjugation on the TonEBP molecule. Sumoylation inhibits TonEBP by reducing its transactivation without affecting nuclear translocation or DNA binding. From these data we can envision the following scheme of events after a cell is exposed to hypertonicity. Initially the nuclear TonEBP abundance rises due to enhanced expression in combination with nuclear translocation leading to DNA binding and expression of TonEBP target genes. Later, the TonEBP molecules bound to DNA are sumoylated and their transactivation decreases. Such tempering of TonEBP activity might be important for homeostasis in the renal medulla where TonEBP expression is very high most of the time. It was reported previously that the high concentration of nitric oxide in the renal medulla also inhibits TonEBP by direct S-nitrosylation (Neuhofer et al.,). Thus, the high level of TonEBP expression in the renal medulla is counterbalanced by inhibitory post-translational modifications including sumoylation and S-nitrosylation.\n\n    In many other transcription factors whose transactivation is inhibited by sumoylation, the underlying mechanism involves recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC's) and interaction with co-repressors (Gill,). Indeed, we found that TonEBP was co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC1 (data not shown). However, the interaction was intact in non-sumoylated and SUMO-fusion constructs suggesting that sumoylation did not lead to recruitment of HDAC1. In addition an inhibitor of HDAC1, trichostatin A, did not affect the transactivation of non-sumoylated and sumoylation-mimicking mutants (not shown). It appears that the inhibition of transactivation by sumoylation is mediated by factors other than deacetylation.\n\n    The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.",

        "Title": "    GJB2 Mutation Spectrum and Genotype-Phenotype Correlation in 1067 Han Chinese Subjects with Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations in Gap Junction Beta 2 (GJB2) have been reported to be a major cause of non-syndromic hearing loss in many populations worldwide. The spectrums and frequencies of GJB2 variants vary substantially among different ethnic groups, and the genotypes among these populations remain poorly understood. In the present study, we carried out a systematic and extended mutational screening of GJB2 gene in 1067 Han Chinese subjects with non-syndromic hearing loss, and the resultant GJB2 variants were evaluated by phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis. A total of 25 (23 known and 2 novel) GJB2 variants were identified, including 6 frameshift mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, 16 missense mutations and 2 silent mutations. In this cohort, c.235delC is the most frequently observed pathogenic mutation. The phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis showed that 2 novel variants c.127G>T (p.V43L), c.293G>C (p.R98P) and 2 known variants c. 107T>C (p.L36P) and c.187G>T (p.V63L) are localized at highly conserved amino acids. In addition, these 4 mutations are absent in 203 healthy individuals, therefore, they are probably the most likely candidate pathogenic mutations. In addition, 66 (24 novel and 42 known) genotypes were identified, including 6 homozygotes, 20 compound heterozygotes, 18 single heterozygotes, 21 genotypes harboring only polymorphism(s) and the wild type genotype. Among these, 153 (14.34%) subjects were homozygous for pathogenic mutations, 63 (5.91%) were compound heterozygotes, and 157 (14.71%) carried single heterozygous mutation. Furthermore, 65.28% (141/216) of these cases with two pathogenic mutations exhibited profound hearing loss. These data suggested that mutations in GJB2 gene are responsible for approximately 34.96% of non-syndromic hearing loss in Han Chinese population from Zhejiang Province in eastern China. In addition, our results also strongly supported the idea that other factors such as alterations in regulatory regions, additional genes, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical manifestation of deafness.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory defects, affecting one in 700-1000 newborns. It can be classified as syndromic hearing loss (hearing loss with other symptoms such as diabetes), and non-syndromic hearing loss (hearing loss is the only obvious clinical phenotype). Approximately 50% of all cases of hearing loss have a genetic etiology or predisposition with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked or maternal patterns of inheritance. To data, over 140 loci have been mapped for non-syndromic hearing loss, and 82 deafness-causing genes have been identified (The Hereditary Hearing loss Homepage. http://hereditaryhearingloss.org).\n\n    Mutations in the GJB2 gene, which encodes the connexin 26 (Cx26), are a major cause of non-syndromic hearing loss in many populations worldwide. More than 150 different GJB2 variants have been identified, including missense, nonsense and frameshift mutation (The Connexin-deafness Homepage. http://davinci.crg.es/deafness). The spectrums of GJB2 mutations vary among different ethnic groups. Of these variants, the c.35delG is the most prevalent GJB2-deafness-causing mutation in European populations, while c.235delC and c.167delT are the most frequent variants in Eastern Asian populations and Ashkenazi Jewish families, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of GJB2 mutations differs among various populations, which varied from 7.9% to 44.1% among Caucasian cohorts and 4.5% to 34.7% in several Asian populations. However, the spectrum and frequency of GJB2 mutations in the Chinese population are still poorly understood, and the prevalence of various GJB2 genotypes among different Chinese populations is less studied. In addition, it is anticipated that there are additional GJB2 mutation(s) associated with hearing loss among Chinese population.\n\n    In the present study, a systematic and extended mutational screening of GJB2 gene was carried out in a cohort of 1067 Han Chinese hearing-impaired subjects from Zhejiang Province, in Eastern China. We found 25 variants in this large cohort including missense mutation, nonsense mutation and frameshift mutation, which could be attributed to 66 genotypes. By phylogenetic analysis, structure-function relation and allelic frequency of these variants in the 203 Han Chinese healthy individuals from the same region, 4 putative pathogenic mutations were identified.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 1067 genetically unrelated hearing-impaired Chinese subjects were recruited from Zhejiang Province in Eastern China. The subjects were composed of 509 students from Schools for Deaf Children and Hearing and Speech Rehabilitation Centers, and 558 patients from the ENT Clinics of Zhejiang Province. A comprehensive history and physical examination were performed on these participants, so as to identify any syndromic findings, the history of the use of aminoglycosides, environmental and genetic triggers related to the hearing loss. Age-appropriate audiological evaluation was carried out as previous report. Briefly, the pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was calculated from average of the audiometric thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz. The severity of hearing loss was then classified into five grades: normal (<26 dB), mild (between 26 and 40 dB), moderate (between 41 and 70 dB), severe (between 71 and 90 dB), and profound (>90 dB). Auditory brainstem response (ABR), immittance testing and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were also performed. The control DNA samples were obtained from 203 healthy Han Chinese subjects in the same region of China. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committees of both Zhejiang University and Wenzhou Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n    Genomic DNAs were isolated from the blood samples of all participants using Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit Ver.3.0 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The DNA fragments spanning the entire coding region of GJB2 gene were amplified by PCR using the oligodeoxynucleotides: forward-5'TATGACACTCCCCAGCACAG3' and reverse-5'GGGCAATGCTTAAACTGGC3'. Then the purified GJB2 fragments were analyzed by direct sequencing as detailed previously. Subsequently, the mutations were identified by comparing the resultant sequence with wild type GJB2 sequence (GenBank accession No: NM_004004.5). The sequence of each amplicon was confirmed by sequencing in both directions.\n\n    A total of 23 species Cx26 amino acid sequences were used in the inter-species analysis (S2 Table). The conservation index (CI) was defined as the percentage of species with amino acid residues identical to that of human at that position. Alignments and analysis were performed using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/).\n\n    In order to predict the effect of the putative GJB2 mutation on protein function, the pathogenic potential of these missense mutations was evaluated by PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/index.shtml) and SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/) programs.",
        "Results": "    The study samples were Han Chinese recruited from Schools of Deaf Children and ENT clinics of Zhejiang Province. Subjects who had a history of exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics, or other clearly identifiable cause(s) of hearing loss (such as bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, temporal bone fracture involving the cochlea, active chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma), or syndromic deafness were excluded from this study. A total of 1067 subjects (609 males and 458 females), who exhibited sensorineural hearing loss as the sole symptom, were analyzed. The age of subjects ranged from 1 year old to 41 years old, with a median age of 17 years. The age-at-onset of the hearing loss in these subjects ranged from congenital to 41 years old, with a median age of 8 years. Audiological studies showed that there was a wide range of different degrees of hearing loss in these subjects: 485 subjects exhibited profound hearing loss, 403 patients had severe hearing loss, 145 individuals suffered moderate hearing loss, and 34 cases with mild hearing loss. In addition, 203 Han Chinese subjects (112 males and 91 females) recruited from the same region, exhibited normal hearing and didn't have a family history of hearing loss. The age of these participants ranged from 8 years old to 27 years old, with a median age of 16 years (S1 Table).\n\n    DNA fragments spanning the entire coding region of GJB2 gene were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA samples of 1067 hearing-impaired and 203 control subjects, and each fragment was sequenced. As shown in Table 1, 25 (2 novel and 23 known) nucleotide changes in GJB2 gene were identified when comparing the resultant sequence with the wild type sequence (GenBank accession NM_004004.5). Among these mutations, 2 novel variants (p.V43L and p.R98P) were identified in heterozygous state. When looking at the allelic frequency of GJB2 gene in healthy individuals, we found 3 variants (p.V27I, p.V37I and p.E114G) in 203 Chinese controls with the frequencies of 22.91%, 4.93% and 15.02%, respectively. Furthermore, the missense mutations were evaluated with phylogenetic analysis by comparing the human GJB2-encoding connexin-26 (Cx26) amino acid residues with other 22 species in data bank. As shown in Table 1, all the 16 missense mutations observed in our study changed amino acids which are well conserved in evolution with the conservation index (CI) ranged from 39.13% to 100%. In particular, CI of 13 variants were >90%, CI of other 2 variants including p.G4D and p.R98P were between 80% and 50%, and CI for p.T123N variant was 39.13%. In addition, localization of these mutations in the secondary structure of Cx26 protein was exhibited in S1 Fig The variants p.V43L, p.V63L and p.G160S reside at the extracellular loops of Cx26, the variants p.V27I, p.I30V, p.L36P, p.V37I, p.R143W, p.E147K and p.I203T occur in transmembrane domains, and the variants p.G4D, p.G12V, p.V95M, p.R98P, p.E114G and p.T123N are located at amino termini and intracellular loop of the protein. Moreover, both the PolyPhen-2 and SIFT programs showed that 9 of these missense mutations were damaging (Table 1).\n\n    The p.G4D, p.V27I, p.E114G and p.T123N variants were considered as polymorphisms to comply with the standard of whose frequency >5% in controls or CIs<60%. In addition, the p.I30V, p.G160S and p.I203T variants were also classified as benign since they were reported in controls in other populations. On the other hand, the frequency of p.V37I variant in hearing-impaired subjects was much higher than in our control cohort. Furthermore, this variant has been reported to be associated with mild hearing loss among Chinese and Japanese populations. Taken together, we identified 9 GJB2 variants in this large cohort of Han Chinese population to be pathogenic, including the 5 known deafness-associated mutations (p.G12V, p.V37I, p.V95M, p.R143W and p.E147K). The allelic frequency of pathogenic mutations in GJB2 gene among this Chinese cohort was 27.13%. In particular, c.235delC was the most frequent mutation with the allelic frequency of 13.96%, followed by c.299_300delAT (2.25%).\n\n    As shown in S3 Table, a total of 66 (24 novel and 42 known) genotypes of GJB2 was observed in the studied cohort of 1067 hearing-impaired subjects, including 44 (16 novel and 28 known) genotypes carrying at least one of pathogenic mutation(s), 21 (8 novel and 13 known) genotypes harboring only polymorphism(s) and a genotype lacking any copy of variants. In this study, we found 34.96% (373/1067) of the hearing-impaired cases carrying at least one pathogenic mutation, among which 153 (14.34%) were homozygous for pathogenic mutations and 63 (5.91%) were compound heterozygotes, while the other 157 (14.71%) subjects only had one heterozygous mutation. In particular, c.235delC homozygote was the most common pathogenic genotype, accounting for 70.59% (108/153) of the homozygotes group, and 10.12% of the entire subjects. Furthermore, the [c.235delC]/[c.299_300delAT] was found to be the most frequent genotype with a frequency of 30.16% (19/63) in compound homozygotes group. Among the 216 subjects with biallelic pathogenic mutations (Table 2), 65.28% (141/164) of these cases exhibited profound hearing loss.\n\n    Among the 18 genotypes of single heterozygotes, 16 (4 novel and 12 known) genotypes carried pathogenic mutations (c.35delG, c.176_191del16, c.235delC, c.299_300delAT, c.512_513insAACG, p.V37I, p.V95M and p.R143W) and 2 novel genotypes harbored the putative deafness-associated mutations (p.L36P and p.V63L). In addition to the genotypes contained pathogenic mutation(s) mentioned above, there were 22 genotypes did not carry any deafness-associated mutation(s), involving 65.04% (694/1067) cases of this cohort. Of these nonpathogenic genotypes, 21 genotypes were found only harboring polymorphisms including 2 genotypes with silent variants (c.81C>T, p.V27 and c.444C>T, p.A148) and 19 genotypes carrying missense variants (p.G4D, p.V27I, p.I30V, p.E114G, p.T123N, p.G160S and p.I203T).\n\n    A genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was performed among 4 probands carrying the 4 putative deafness-associated GJB2 mutations. The comprehensive history and physical examination including audiological assessment indicated that hearing impairment was the sole clinical phenotype in these subjects, and no other clinical abnormalities was observed in members of their families such as diabetes, muscular diseases, visual loss and neurological disorders. All the 4 subjects did not have a history of exposure to neither aminoglycosides nor other ototoxic drugs. Moreover, there was no evidence that the 4 cases had encountered any other external cause to be responsible for hearing loss. Audiological assessments indicated that they all exhibited profound hearing loss at ages younger than 2 years old, with flat-shaped pattern of audiometric configuration.\n\n    As illustrated in Table 3 and Fig 1, 2 of the 4 subjects had a family history of hearing loss. Proband NS063-III-5, whose genotype was in a heterozygous state of c.127G>T (p.V43L) and c.235delC mutations, suffered profound congenital hearing loss. Among the other family members, only his father exhibited moderate hearing defect (45 dB at right ear, 42 dB at left ear; sloping-shaped pattern). In addition, the proband WL111-IV-1, bearing the [c.293G>C]/[c.109G>A] genotype, showed profound congenital hearing loss. Among this pedigree, the c.293G>C (p.R98P) variant was also detected in III-3, III-9 and IV-3 in heterozygous state. Audiological examinations showed mild hearing loss in III-3 with sloping-shaped pattern, and the III-9 and IV-3 exhibited profound congenital hearing loss.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    GJB2 is the most common causative gene for hereditary hearing loss in many populations worldwide, and most of the GJB2 sequence variations described to date were localized in the coding region (The Connexin-deafness Homepage. http://davinci.crg.es/deafness). In fact, the GJB2 mutation spectrums and frequencies vary among different ethnic population. In the present study, we analyzed the spectrum and frequency of GJB2 variants in 1067 Chinese non-syndromic hearing loss subjects from Zhejiang Province in eastern China, and investigated the clinical and genetic characterization of patients with putative GJB2 mutations. A total of 25 different nucleotide changes in the GJB2 gene were identified in this cohort, 34.96% of subjects in the cohort harbored GJB2 pathogenic mutations, which can be classified into 44 genotypes, including homozygotes, compound heterozygotes and single heterozygotes (only one mutant allele). These results indicate that GJB2 mutations are the important causes of hearing loss in hearing-impairment Han Chinese population.\n\n    In the present study, we revealed a high prevalence (27.13%) of GJB2 mutations in Chinese hearing loss patients, which is compatible with other reports. Among these variants, c.235delC mutation was observed with a frequency of 13.96% in our cohort. The c.235delC mutation in the GJB2 gene predominantly occurs in people of East Asian, the incidences of the mutation ranged from 6.7% to 22.5% in several other Chinese deaf cohorts according to previous studies, which were 5.3% and 10.9% in two reported Japanese hearing loss cohorts, 1.5% in a cohort from Mongolia, 5.1% and 6.9% in two cohorts of Korean deafness patients. The high frequency of c.235delC mutation in multiple East Asian populations raises the possibility of a common ancestral founder event. Interestingly, c.235delC mutation has not been reported in south Asian populations such as Indian, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis. Instead, p.W24X, p.W77X and p.Q124X are the prevalent GJB2 mutations in these populations. Interestingly, the observed racial divergence of South and East Asian is consisted with the studies of mtDNA haplogroup analysis in that predicting country of ancestral origin (http://www.mitomap.org, 2015). It has been well accepted that haplogroup L3 gave rise to two lineages: M and N. In addition, the major haplogroups B and F in East Asian were rising from macrohaplogroup N, and the mitochondrial haplogroups in South Asian were macrohaplogroup M and its derivatives. These results indicate that c.235delC mutation might have arisen after the racial divergence of South and East Asian occurred. It would be necessary to systematically investigate the GJB2 mutations of remaining Asian countries to precisely elucidate the origin of c.235delC mutation. Of the other GJB2 deletion/frameshift mutations associated with hearing loss, c.176_191del16 and c.299_300delAT were previously reported in Korean and Japanese hearing loss cohorts, and c.512_513insAACG mutation has been also detected in Chinese and Japanese deaf patients but in a much lower frequency.\n\n    The c.35delG mutation of GJB2 was previously reported to be the most prevalent mutation (21%) in a cohort of north Indian population with hearing loss. In particular, among these populations with European ancestry, the c.35delG mutation causes severe to profound hearing loss, accounted for approximately 70% of all recessive mutations of the gene. In fact, the mutations at position 35 are found to be exceptionally low in eastern Asian. Dai et al reported in a large cohort that 12 Chinese patients carried c.35delG mutation; however, the majority of these patients was Uigur from Xinjiang area. In this cohort of Han people from Zhejiang Province in eastern China, the deletion, insertion and G to T mutation at position 35 were respectively detected in 5 unrelated subjects, with all the 3 mutations found in compound heterozygous state. Of the 5 cases, 4 subjects also carried c.235delC mutation, and the other one patient had c.79G>A polymorphism.\n\n    Fifteen additional missense mutations (13 known and 2 novel) were detected among these hearing loss patients, including 4 pathogenic mutations, 7 polymorphisms and 4 unknown variants. To identify putative pathogenic mutation, the unknown variants were further evaluated using following criteria: (1) conservation index greater than 75%, (2) absent in the 203 controls, (3) potential structural and functional alterations, predicted by their locations, PolyPhen-2 and SIFT programs, and (4) pedigree analysis if possible. The p.L36P, p.V43L, V63L and p.R98P variants, which occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues and absent from the control group, were predicted as pathogenic mutations by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT programs. The p.L36P mutation was first described in trans with 35delG in a hearing loss patient of African descent. This putative disease-causing mutation locates at the transmembrane domain of Cx26 protein, which is involved in the oligomerization of hexameric connexon hemichannels. The resultant changed protein may lead to the reduction of junctional permeability in cells that is essential for ions and small metabolites exchange. Variants p.V43L and V63L, which reside at the first extracellular loop of Cx26, may result in gap-junction channels dysfunction among adjacent cells. The Val at 43 position changed to Met in Cx26 was previously observed in a hearing loss cohort from Taiwan and considered to be associated with the disease. Here, we report the novel p.V43L variant as a potential deafness-associated mutation in Han Chinese population from Zhejiang province. The p.V63L mutation was first reported in a Taiwan cohort, and then it was also found in other Chinese population with hearing loss. However, the pathogenic potential of this variant is difficult to define since it has been reported only in the heterozygous state without accompanying other mutations. Another novel GJB2 variant we found in this study was the p.R98P mutation which occurred in amino termini and intracellular loop, it is proposed that this mutation may impair the gap junctional intercellular communication in cochlea and finally lead to hair cell dysfunction. More interestingly, we found that the p.R98P variant co-segregates with the phenotype of hearing loss in the WL111 pedigree (Fig 1). But based on the current data, it is not possible to determine whether this variant is a dominant or a recessive mutation. Taking together, these 4 amino acid changes are very likely to be the possible causes of hearing loss. However, the functional impact of these putative causal variants remains speculative, the establishment of recombinant expression systems and animal models would be necessary for further investigation.\n\n    The p.V37I variant was originally reported as a polymorphism. Subsequently, a series of studies reported that this variant exists in deafness patients in homozygous or compound heterozygous state among different populations. However, its pathogenicity is still controversial. Ethnic differences were observed in the allele frequency of p.V37I variant, as it was not detected in the control subjects from Italy, Spain, Germany, Greece, Israel, Ghana, and Austria in spite of a high prevalence of the mutation in Eastern Asian population such as Chinese and Japanese descent. In addition, the p.V37I mutant protein has normal subcellular localization and membrane expression as the wild type protein. In this study, we found that the V37I allele was identified in 8.86% and 4.93% of the Chinese patient and control alleles, respectively. The p.V37I variant is located at transmembrane domain of Cx26, and the Valine residue at position 37 is highly conserved among different species. Moreover, functional analysis has proved that the coexpression at equimolar levels of wild type and mutant Cx26 proteins (p.V37I) in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a dominant-negative effect of the mutation. In general, this variant results in a rather mild phenotype, which is consistent with previous reports that p.V37I missense mutation leads to a less severe hearing loss phenotype than frameshift mutations such as c.35delG and c.235delC mutations. Taking into consideration the analysis of clinical, genetical and functional data regarding p.V37I available in the publications, this variant could also be a primary cause that leads to predisposition for hearing loss depending on genetic background and/or environmental factors.\n\n    In this report, we found 66 genotypes of GJB2 in the large cohort of 1067 hearing-impaired subjects including 24 novel genotypes. Totally, 20.25% of the subjects harbored two GJB2 pathogenic alleles, either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, and there was a fairly high frequency (14.71%) of single heterozygosity in this cohort. More interestingly, patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous for the same pathogenic mutation exhibit a wide variation in the phenotypic expression of hearing loss. These data strongly supported the hypothesis that other factors may contribute to the clinical manifestation of GJB2-related deafness, such as alterations in regulatory region, additional mutations in other genes such as GJB6 and GJB3, and environmental factors. Accordingly, identification of GJB2 mutations can yield considerable helpful information to those hearing impaired population and their families. Understanding of the cause of hearing loss will effectively promote genetic counseling and implementation of various intervention strategies such as early rehabilitation and fitting of hearing aids, which is particularly important for infants in affected families. In addition, further studies emphasize on the disease associated factors are very important that would enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the complex molecular pathogenic mechanisms of hearing loss.",

        "Title": "    The conserved oligomeric Golgi complex is involved in double-membrane vesicle formation during autophagy",
        "Abstract": "    COG subunits localize to the phagophore assembly site where they interact with autophagy proteins and are required for double-membrane Cvt vesicle and autophagosome formation.\n\n    Macroautophagy is a catabolic pathway used for the turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles in eukaryotic cells. The morphological hallmark of this process is the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that sequester cytoplasm. Autophagosome formation is the most complex part of macroautophagy, and it is a dynamic event that likely involves vesicle fusion to expand the initial sequestering membrane, the phagophore; however, essentially nothing is known about this process including the molecular components involved in vesicle tethering and fusion. In this study, we provide evidence that the subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex are required for double-membrane cytoplasm to vacuole targeting vesicle and autophagosome formation. COG subunits localized to the phagophore assembly site and interacted with Atg (autophagy related) proteins. In addition, mutations in the COG genes resulted in the mislocalization of Atg8 and Atg9, which are critical components involved in autophagosome formation.",
        "Introduction": "    Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy), an evolutionarily conserved catabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells, is involved in the degradation of long-lived proteins, organelles, and a large portion of the cytoplasm in response to internal and external stresses such as nutrient starvation. In addition, autophagy is involved in development and cellular remodeling and plays a cytoprotective role by removing protein aggregates and damaged or superfluous organelles, which may contribute to a role in life span extension. Defects in autophagy are associated with various diseases, such as cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, and neurodegeneration. The hallmark of autophagy is the sequestration of bulk cytoplasm into a double-membrane vesicle termed an autophagosome, which then fuses with the lysosome/vacuole, releasing the inner vesicle for degradation. Genetic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi have identified >30 ATG (autophagy-related) genes that are involved in autophagy, and orthologues of many of the yeast ATG genes have been identified in higher eukaryotes.\n\n    Although autophagy is generally considered to be a nonselective process, several selective autophagic pathways for specific cargo delivery have been reported in both fungi and mammalian cells. One example in the yeast S. cerevisiae is a constitutive biosynthetic pathway that occurs under vegetative conditions, termed the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, in which certain vacuolar hydrolases such as precursor aminopeptidase I (Ape1 [prApe1]) are enwrapped in double-membrane Cvt vesicles, which fuse with the vacuole. The Cvt pathway shares similar morphological and mechanistic features with bulk autophagy and requires most of the same Atg proteins. Therefore, the study of the Cvt pathway and the analysis of the roles of the various Atg proteins have provided important information for understanding the molecular basis of autophagy; however, many questions remain to be addressed.\n\n    One of the unsolved mysteries with regard to autophagy is the origin of the membrane used to form the double-membrane sequestering vesicles and the mechanism of vesicle expansion. The autophagosome and Cvt vesicle are thought to form de novo, meaning they do not bud off intact from preexisting organelles as occurs with transport vesicles that function in the secretory pathway. Instead, the double-membrane vesicles appear to expand via the addition of membrane through vesicular fusion; this mode of formation is critical in allowing these sequestering vesicles to accommodate essentially any sized cargo. However, very little information is available regarding the presumed tethering and fusion components that are involved in this process.\n\n    In this paper, we screened the yeast deletion library and a set of temperature-sensitive mutants and found that mutants of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex subunits were defective in the Cvt and autophagy pathways. In S. cerevisiae, the COG complex contains eight subunits (Cog1-8) and is composed of two lobes: lobe A (Cog2-4) and lobe B (Cog5-8) with Cog1 in the center. Although only six of the yeast COG subunits show high sequence homology with their corresponding mammalian counterparts, the COG complex is structurally and functionally conserved. The current evidence suggests that COG is mainly important for retrograde trafficking within the Golgi complex and possibly for ER to Golgi and endosome to Golgi transport as a tethering factor. Moreover, several pieces of evidence indicate that lobe A may be involved in different and more essential processes than lobe B: defects in any of the COG subunits in lobe A have more severe effects on cell growth than those in lobe B. In this study, we discovered that the lobe A but not the lobe B subunits are essential for autophagy. Additionally, the COG complex is involved in autophagosome formation and is required for correct sorting of various Atg membrane-associated proteins to the phagophore assembly site (PAS), the location of vesicle nucleation. COG subunits localize to the PAS and interact with Atg proteins. Our results show that the COG complex is involved in the formation of double-membrane sequestering vesicles during autophagy.",

For gene disruption, the entire coding regions were replaced with the Kluyveromyces lactis URA3, LEU2, Saccharomyces kluyveri HIS3, Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TRP1, HIS3, and the Escherichia coli kanr genes using PCR primers containing ~50 bases identical to the flanking regions of the open reading frames. For PCR-based integrations of GFP at the 3' end of PEX14, COG1, COG2, COG6, and cog2-1 and RFP tags at the 3' end of VRG4, pFA6a-GFP-HIS3, pFA6a-GFP-KanMX, pFA6a-GFP-TRP1, pFA6a-mRFP-TRP1, pFA6a-mRFP-HIS5 S. pombe, and pFA6a-mRFP-KanMX were used as templates to generate strains expressing fusion proteins under the control of their native promoters. For PCR-based replacement of the GAL1 promoter with an N-terminal HA tag at the 5' end of COG1, COG2, COG3, and COG4, pFA6a-KanMX6-PGAL1-3HA was used as a template. PCR was used to verify the gene fusions. To generate an Atg9-3GFP fusion, the integrative plasmid pAtg9-3GFP(306) was linearized by StuI digestion and integrated into the URA3 gene locus.\n\n    Strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose), SMD (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with vitamins and appropriate amino acids), YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% galactose), or SMG (2% galactose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with vitamins and appropriate amino acids). Nitrogen starvation experiments were performed in synthetic medium lacking nitrogen (SD-N; 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, ammonium sulfate, and vitamins, but containing 2% glucose).\n\n    The plasmids pGAD-Cog1, pGBDU-Cog1, pGAD-Cog3, and pGBDU-Cog3 were generated by PCR amplifying the full-length COG1 or COG3 gene and ligating into BamHI-PstI sites of the pGAD-C1 and pGBDU-C1 vectors. The pGAD-Cog2 and pGBDU-Cog2 plasmids were created by ligating the DNA fragment encoding full-length Cog2 with EcoRI and BglII sites into the pGAD-C1 and pGBDU-C1 plasmids. The pGAD-Cog4 and pGBDU-Cog4 plasmids were generated by amplifying the COG4 gene and cloning as BamHI-BglII fragments into pGAD-C1 and pGBDU-C1 vectors. The plasmids pCuCOG2-HA(416) and pCuCOG3-HA(416) were generated by PCR amplification of full-length COG2 and COG3 genes using primers containing a single HA sequence at the 3' ends and ligated into a CUP1 promoter-driven pRS416 plasmid with EcoRI-XhoI and BamHI-XhoI, respectively. The plasmids pGFP-AUT7(416), pRFP-Ape1(305), pAtg9-3GFP(306), pSpo7-RFP(425), pProtA-CVT13(424), pProtA-APG17(424), pProtA-CVT20(424), pRS424-CuProtA, and pMyc-APG12(426) have been described previously. Plasmids expressing mutant forms of COG4, pBCR115 and pBCR137, were generated by PCR amplification of genomic COG4, including 400 bases of genomic DNA on either side of the gene, ligating the product into the pRS415 URA-CEN plasmid and introducing site-directed mutations. Residues shown to be both surface exposed (by x-ray crystallographic analysis of human Cog4) and well conserved across multiple species were selected for mutation by alanine truncation or charge introduction as appropriate. To create pBCR115, a single QuikChange (Agilent Technologies) reaction was used to generate the double-substitution mutant N607A/T608A. To create pBCR137, six mutations were introduced using the QuikChange Multi kit (Agilent Technologies): N787A, R788A, G795D, C798D, R805A, and E806A. The corresponding residues in human Cog4 constitute a single large, conserved patch on the surface of the protein. To generate an Atg11 integration plasmid, pATG11(414) was made by cloning the PCR fragment containing the ATG11 promoter, ORF, and terminator regions into the XmaI site of pRS414. A NotI-SalI fragment containing ATG11 was cut from pAtg11(414) and inserted into the corresponding sites of pRS307 to generate pATG11(307). pATG11(307) was linearized with PmlI and integrated into the LYS2 locus.\n\n    Cells were grown in SMD at 24 C to OD600 = 0.8. 20 OD600 U of cells were collected and converted to spheroplasts then incubated at 37 C for 20 min. Spheroplasts were harvested and resuspended in 200 microl of spheroplasting medium (1.2 M sorbitol, 2% glucose, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with vitamins and appropriate amino acids) without methionine and cysteine for 5 min at the same temperatures. Cells were labeled with Tran35S-Label ([35S]methionine/cysteine; MP Biomedicals) for 10 min (10 microCi/OD600). Chase was initiated by adding 4 ml of chase medium (SMD containing 0.2% yeast extract, 1.2 M sorbitol, and 2 mM cysteine and methionine). At each indicated time point, samples were collected, and the total cell lysates were prepared by adding ice-cold osmotic lysis buffer (20 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 200 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, and complete EDTA-free proteinase inhibitor cocktail) at a spheroplast density of 20 OD600/ml to lyse the cells. To obtain the prApe1-containing P5 fractions, cell lysates were subjected to a 5,000 g centrifugation for 5 min. The P5 fractions were resuspended in osmotic lysis buffer, split into four aliquots, and subjected to 100 microg/ml proteinase K and/or 0.2% Triton X-100 treatment on ice for 20 min. 10% TCA was added to precipitate the cell lysates and the precipitates were washed twice with 100% acetone and air dried. The pellets were resuspended in Tween immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.1 mM EDTA), PA-Sepharose and Ape1 antiserum were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 C. The PA-Sepharose-bound proteins were washed six times with Tween immunoprecipitation buffer, and the samples were eluted at 75 C for 10 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE.\n\n    For fluorescence microscopy, yeast cells expressing fusion proteins with fluorescence tags were grown to OD600 = 0.8 in YPD or SMD selective medium or starved in SD-N before imaging. To label the mitochondria, Mito Fluor red 589 (Invitrogen) was added to the growing culture with a final concentration of 1 microM for 30 min before imaging. Starved cells were stained with MitoFluor red for 1 h before imaging. For rapamycin treatment, 0.2 microg/ml rapamycin was added to the culture. Cells were visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) with DeltaVision (Spectris; Applied Precision) using a camera (CoolSNAP HQ; Photometrics) fitted with differential interference contrast optics. Images were taken using a 100x objective at the same temperature and in the same medium in which the cells were cultured. 15 z-section images were collected and were deconvolved using softWoRx software (Applied Precision). All fluorescence microscopy images show a single focal z section.\n\n    Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously. For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were frozen in a freezing device (KF80; Leica), and the analysis was performed according to the procedures described previously. Ultrathin sections were stained with anti-YFP antibody or affinity purified anti-Ape1 antiserum. The anti-YFP was labeled with 0.8-nm ultrasmall gold particles (Aurion) that were detected by silver enhancement, whereas the anti-Ape1 was labeled with 10 nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (British Biocell). Ultrathin sections were examined with an electron microscope (H-800; Hitachi High Technologies) at 125 kV. Images were prepared using a film scanner, and scale bars were added in Photoshop (Adobe).\n\n    50 ml of cells grown in SMG medium to OD600 = 1.0 was harvested and resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (PBS, 200 mM sorbitol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Tween 20, 2 mM PMSF, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and lysed by vortex after adding a 2-ml volume of acid-washed glass beads. IgG-Sepharose beads were added to the detergent extracts followed by incubation overnight at 4 C. The beads were washed eight times with 1 ml lysis buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we used the same procedure as PA affinity isolation with only one exception: the cell lysates were incubated with PA-Sepharose beads (50% suspension) and 5 microl monoclonal anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody overnight at 4 C. The resulting immunocomplex was subjected to immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies.\n\n    The GFP-Atg8 processing assay, Pex14-GFP processing to monitor pexophagy progression, and the alkaline phosphatase assay to measure Pho8Delta60 activity were performed as previously described.\n\n    Fig. S1 shows the localization of Atg9-3GFP in wild-type, atg1Delta, cog1Delta, cog6Delta, and double-mutant strains analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Fig. S2 shows an immunoelectron microscopy analysis of wild-type cells as a control for the specificity of the anti-YFP antibody. Fig. S3 is a fluorescence microscopy analysis of Cog1-GFP and Cog6-GFP in wild-type and atg1Delta strains relative to the PAS marker RFP-Ape1.

        "Results": "    Previously, we screened the yeast deletion library to obtain mutants defective in the Cvt pathway. Of the mutants we identified, the cog1Delta strain exhibited a relatively strong block in prApe1 maturation (Fig. 1 A). In rich medium in a wild-type strain, most of the Ape1 is present in the mature form as a result of delivery to the vacuole through the Cvt pathway. In the cog1Delta mutant, all of the Ape1 was present in the precursor form in rich medium conditions, indicating a block in the Cvt pathway.\n\n    Cog1 is one of the components of the COG complex. Therefore, we examined whether the other components of this complex were also involved in the Cvt pathway. Deletion of COG5, COG6, COG7, or COG8 caused an incomplete but substantial block in prApe1 maturation in rich medium (Fig. 1 A). Treatment of yeast cells with the Tor inhibitor rapamycin induces autophagy and causes an increase in prApe1 synthesis, and this cargo protein is now transported to the vacuole through autophagy. In wild-type cells treated with rapamycin, the majority of Ape1 is still detected as the mature form despite the large increase in synthesis. Rapamycin treatment of the COG deletion strains, particularly those of lobe B, largely rescued the defect in prApe1 transport to the vacuole, suggesting that the selective uptake of prApe1 via autophagy occurred in these strains (Fig. 1 A); the cog1Delta strain showed an ~50% block in prApe1 maturation, suggesting a significant block in nonspecific autophagosome formation.\n\n    Because import of prApe1 is a selective process even under starvation conditions, it is not an adequate measure of nonspecific autophagy. Therefore, we measured nonspecific autophagy in the COG deletion cells by two established biochemical analyses, GPF-Atg8 processing and Pho8Delta60 activity assays. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein, which remains associated with completed autophagosomes after phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation. After GFP-tagged Atg8 is delivered into the vacuole, Atg8 is degraded, whereas the GFP moiety remains relatively stable. Thus, autophagy progression can be monitored by free GFP accumulation. As shown in Fig. 1 A, there was essentially no detectable free GFP in rich conditions in the wild-type strain (the level from the Cvt pathway is typically too low to detect), but there was a clear band after rapamycin treatment. All of the cog mutants displayed some level of GFP-Atg8 processing, with the cog1Delta mutant showing the strongest block, suggesting that nonspecific autophagy is severely impaired in this mutant, which is in agreement with the prApe1 processing phenotype. To quantitatively measure autophagy activity, we used Pho8Delta60, a mutant form of the vacuolar alkaline phosphatase in which the N-terminal 60 amino acids including the transmembrane domain are deleted. Pho8Delta60 localizes to the cytoplasm, and its activation by proteolytic removal of a C-terminal propeptide via a vacuolar protease depends on autophagy. To monitor Pho8Delta60-dependent alkaline phosphatase activity, cells were grown in a rich medium and incubated in a nitrogen-starvation medium for 3 h to induce autophagy. Wild-type cells showed a low level of activity in rich medium and a substantial increase after autophagy induction (Fig. 1 B). The negative control atg1Delta cells that are defective in autophagy showed a basal level of Pho8Delta60 activity even after autophagy was induced for 3 h. Autophagic activity in the cog5Delta, cog6Delta, cog7Delta, and cog8Delta cells was comparable with that in the wild-type cells, whereas in the cog1Delta cells, it was significantly decreased even after autophagy induction, which is similar to the atg1Delta cells.\n\n    The COG complex is proposed to be composed of two lobes: lobe A, containing the Cog2-4 subunits, and lobe B, containing the Cog5-8 subunits. Cog1 is the central subunit that connects the two lobes. In yeast, the lobe A components are essential for cell growth. Therefore, we used temperature-sensitive cog2-1 and cog3-2 mutants to assess their requirement in the Cvt pathway and autophagy. The Cvt pathway was measured by monitoring prApe1 maturation by a pulse-chase experiment. Cells were incubated at a nonpermissive temperature for 30 min before labeling and were subjected to a nonradioactive chase at the same temperature for 2 h. The prApe1 processing was significantly affected in the mutant strains at the nonpermissive temperature, although no obvious delay in processing was seen in these mutants compared with the wild type at a permissive temperature (Fig. 1 C). These results suggested a kinetic defect in the Cvt pathway.\n\n    Next, autophagic activities of the cog temperature-sensitive mutants were measured by both GFP-Atg8 processing and the Pho8Delta60 assay. Cells were transformed with plasmid-based GFP-Atg8 and grown in a rich medium at permissive temperature to early log phase. Cell cultures were split into two aliquots: one aliquot was incubated at a permissive temperature and the other at a nonpermissive temperature for 30 min. Rapamycin was added to induce autophagy for 2 h. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to Western blotting using anti-YFP antibody. In the wild-type strain, GFP-Atg8 processing occurred at both temperatures with a greater level of free GFP detected at the elevated temperature (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, in the cog2-1 and cog3-2 temperature-sensitive mutants, GFP-Atg8 processing was blocked at the nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that these mutants had autophagy defects. Transformation of these mutant strains with plasmids encoding the wild-type corresponding COG subunits rescued the GFP-Atg8 processing defects at the nonpermissive temperature (unpublished data). To extend our analysis to Cog4, we tested two temperature-sensitive mutants in the COG4 gene that were designed based on structural experiments of human Cog4 to disrupt binding of Cog4 to other proteins. Similar to the results with cog2-1 and cog3-2, the cog4-1 and cog4-2 mutants displayed defects in GFP-Atg8 processing at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 1 D).\n\n    To make a quantitative measurement of autophagy in these mutants, we performed the Pho8Delta60 assay. Wild-type cells showed the expected increase in Pho8Delta60-dependent alkaline phosphatase activity after autophagy induction, but they displayed a slight decrease in activity at the elevated temperature (Fig. 1 E). When the cog mutant cells were incubated at a nonpermissive temperature, autophagic activity was severely compromised, whereas the level of activity was essentially normal at permissive temperature. As with the GFP-Atg8 processing assay, transformation with plasmids expressing the corresponding wild-type COG proteins rescued the defect seen in the Pho8Delta60 activity at the nonpermissive temperature. These data further suggest that the lobe A COG subunits are needed for nonspecific autophagy.\n\n    Considering the Cvt pathway defects in cog mutants, we decided to test whether COG subunits are required for the specific degradation of peroxisomes. To do this, we monitored the vacuolar delivery of the peroxisomal integral membrane protein Pex14 that was tagged with GFP at the C terminus. Similar to GFP-Atg8, delivery of Pex14-GFP-tagged peroxisomes into the vacuole would result in the release of the GFP moiety, allowing us to monitor pexophagy progression through the appearance of free GFP. Pexophagy was induced as described in Materials and methods. Free GFP was detected in the wild-type cells after being transferred to SD-N medium, whereas no free GFP was seen in the atg1Delta strain (Fig. 1 F). In contrast to the wild-type cells, no free GFP was observed in the cog2-1 or cog3-2 mutant at nonpermissive temperature, even though processing was normal at the permissive temperature. We also tested Pex14-GFP degradation in COG1 and COG6 deletion strains. There was a strong kinetic delay in Pex14-GFP processing in the cog1Delta strain but normal pexophagy in cog6Delta. These results indicated that lobe A but not lobe B of the COG complex was essential for autophagy and pexophagy, although all of the components were required for an efficient Cvt pathway.\n\n    Atg9 is the only transmembrane Atg protein that is essential for double-membrane vesicle formation. Atg9 is also required for organization of the PAS and recruitment of certain Atg proteins to this specialized site. Atg9 localizes to and cycles between the PAS and peripheral sites. Atg9 transport to the PAS is affected in mutants defective in ER to Golgi trafficking, and those mutants have previously been shown to block the Cvt pathway and autophagy. Because Golgi complex structure and function are defective in cog mutants, it is possible that Golgi structure abnormality in cog mutants may result in an Atg9-sorting defect, thus affecting both the Cvt and autophagy pathways. Accordingly, we examined Atg9 localization in the cog2-1 strain.\n\n    When the cog2-1 Atg9-3GFP strain carrying a plasmid expressing RFP-Ape1 was grown in rich medium or 1 h after autophagy was induced at permissive temperature, Atg9-3GFP was present in multiple puncta, one of which corresponds to the PAS as marked with RFP-Ape1 (Fig. 2 A). The frequencies of Atg9-3GFP PAS localization were 51.5 +- 3.08% and 52.3 +- 1.45% (Fig. 2 B). To test whether the COG complex is required for Atg9 transport to the PAS, we examined the Atg9-3GFP PAS localization frequency in cog2-1 at a nonpermissive temperature in both growing and autophagy-inducing conditions. When shifted to a nonpermissive temperature for 1 h, the Atg9-3GFP PAS localization frequency dropped to 16.81 +- 1.44%. Similarly, in the autophagy-induced condition, the PAS localization percentage dropped to 10.88 +- 1.24% (Fig. 2, A and B). These data suggest that the anterograde movement of Atg9 to the PAS was defective in the cog2-1 strain under both growing and autophagy-inducing conditions. Similar results were seen in cog1Delta and cog6Delta strains in vegetative conditions when we used an epistasis assay that relies on the atg1Delta phenotype; Atg9-3GFP localizes only to the PAS in the atg1Delta background unless a secondary mutation interferes with anterograde transport. Atg9-3GFP was present in multiple puncta in atg1Delta cog1Delta or atg1Delta cog6Delta cells in synthetic minimal medium with dextrose (SMD), but single puncta were seen when the cells were shifted to SD-N (Fig. S1).\n\n    The inefficient transport of Atg9 to the PAS may be caused by indirect defects in the secretory pathway in cog mutants. Therefore, we next extended our study to test Atg8 PAS localization. Atg8 is synthesized in the cytosol, and its membrane association is through lipid conjugation; Atg8 does not transit through the secretory pathway. Because Atg8 forms a punctum at the putative Cvt vesicle and autophagosome assembly site and remains associated with the complete double-membrane vesicles, it serves as a marker for both Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. Wild-type and two mutant strains, cog2-1 and cog3-2, were transformed with a GFP-Atg8 plasmid under the control of the CUP1 promoter and were incubated at 24 C and shifted to a nonpermissive temperature for 1 h. When the cells were grown at permissive temperature, the GFP-Atg8 localization in the cog2-1 and cog3-2 mutants was similar to the wild-type pattern, being diffuse in the cytosol and having one prominent PAS punctum (Fig. 3 and not depicted). After 1 h of shifting to the nonpermissive temperature, abnormal GFP-Atg8 fluorescent structures started to appear in the mutant strains. To examine the GFP-Atg8 localization during starvation in the cog2-1 and cog3-2 mutants, the same strains were grown at permissive temperature, either shifted to nonpermissive temperature or maintained at permissive temperature for 1 h, and autophagy was induced by adding rapamycin for 30 min. When grown at permissive temperature after autophagy induction, the localization pattern of the GFP-Atg8 chimera was one single punctum (Fig. 3 and not depicted). In contrast to cells incubated at the permissive temperature, during autophagy at the nonpermissive temperature, a mixture of phenotypes was observed: some cells showed abnormal GFP-Atg8 localization, whereas some had one single GFP-Atg8 punctum. After a shift back to the permissive temperature, GFP-Atg8 regained its normal localization within 30 min for both growing and autophagy-inducing conditions, implying that the aberrant GFP-Atg8 structures that formed during incubation at the nonpermissive temperature were not terminal structures. In contrast to the cog mutant strains, in wild-type cells, GFP-Atg8 remained localized to a single perivacuolar dot during autophagy-inducing conditions regardless of the temperature. The same localization patterns were also observed in wild-type and cog mutant strains when transformed with a plasmid expressing GFP-Atg8 driven by the endogenous ATG8 promoter (unpublished data), indicating that the localization phenotype was not a consequence of overexpressing Atg8. Finally, we tested the survival of the cog2-1 cells after a 1.5-h incubation at the nonpermissive temperature. The cells remained viable, ruling out the possibility that the GFP-Atg8 phenotype was a result of cell death.\n\n    We extended this analysis by examining Atg8 localization through immunoelectron microscopy. In wild-type cells, Atg8 is detected primarily at the phagophore/PAS and on completed autophagosomes. In contrast, in the cog2-1 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, Atg8 was largely dispersed throughout the cytosol in multiple clusters and dots (Fig. 4 A). To verify that the dispersed labeling was not the result of nonspecific binding by the antibody, we performed the same experiment in isogenic wild-type cells not expressing GFP-Atg8. In this strain, essentially no gold particles were observed (Fig. S2). Thus, lobe A cog mutants affect the normal localization of GFP-Atg8 during autophagy-inducing conditions.\n\n    The analyses of Atg8 localization in cog mutants suggested that the COG complex may be involved in double-membrane vesicle formation. To further examine whether double-membrane vesicle formation is defective in cog mutants, we performed a prApe1 protease-sensitive assay. When prApe1 is enwrapped in a completed double-membrane vesicle, it is protected from exogenously added protease after lysis of spheroplasts in osmotic conditions that retain the integrity of the vacuole and other subcellular compartments including autophagosomes and Cvt vesicles. In contrast, when there are defects in vesicle formation and/or completion, the protease-sensitive propeptide domain of prApe1 is proteolytically cleaved, resulting in a molecular mass shift. We used the vam3Delta strain background in which the fusion of the autophagosome with the vacuole is blocked; in vam3Delta cells, prApe1 accumulates in cytosolic vesicles, and the prApe1 propeptide cannot be processed in the vacuolar lumen. Spheroplasts generated from vam3Delta, atg1Delta vam3Delta, and cog2-1 vam3Delta cells were incubated at nonpermissive temperature for 20 min, pulse labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min, and subjected to a nonradioactive chase for 30 min at nonpermissive temperature. The prApe1-containing low speed pellet fractions were prepared and subjected to proteinase K treatment with or without detergent as described in Materials and methods. In vam3Delta cells, prApe1 was protected from proteinase K and was only digested in the presence of detergent (Fig. 4 B, compare lane 2 with lane 4). In contrast, in the atg1Delta strain, which is defective in vesicle formation, prApe1 was sensitive to the proteinase K digestion independent of detergent (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). In the cog2-1 mutant, the prApe1 was partially sensitive to exogenously added proteinase K (Fig. 4 B, lane 10), indicating that the prApe1 was not completely enclosed within a completed autophagosome membrane. As a control, we examined the presence of a cytosolic marker protein, Pgk1, in the total cell lysate, low speed pellet, and supernatant fractions. Pgk1 was predominantly detected in the total and supernatant fractions (Fig. 4 B). The presence of a low level of Pgk1 in the cog2-1 pellet fraction indicated a low level of incomplete spheroplast lysis, which may account for some of the protease-insensitive prApe1 in this sample. Collectively, these results suggest that the COG complex is required for double-membrane vesicle biogenesis.\n\n    To determine the role of the COG complex in autophagosome biogenesis, we examined the ultrastructure of autophagic bodies that accumulated in the cog2-1 mutant strain vacuoles by electron microscopy. After the double-membrane autophagosomes fuse with the vacuole, the single-membrane inner vesicles, termed the autophagic bodies, are released into the vacuole lumen where their degradation is dependent on the activity of Pep4, the vacuolar proteinase A. In pep4Delta cells, the breakdown of autophagic bodies is blocked, allowing them to accumulate in the vacuole. To eliminate background vesicles targeted to the vacuole through the multivesicular body pathway, we also used a vps4Delta background. Wild-type, atg1Delta, and cog2-1 cells additionally carrying pep4Delta vps4Delta mutations were grown in YPD medium at 24 C to OD600 = 0.8, shifted to SD-N at 37 C for 1.5 h, and prepared for electron microscopy as described in Materials and methods.\n\n    After 1.5 h starvation, wild-type (pep4Delta vps4Delta) cells contained about three autophagic bodies in 25% of the vacuoles, with a mean of 3.38 +- 2.23 per vacuole (n = 54; Fig. 5, A and B). As expected, no autophagic bodies accumulated in the control atg1Delta cells. The cog2-1 cells contained no autophagic bodies in 74.8% of the vacuoles, with a mean of 0.4 +- 0.84 per vacuole (n = 75; Fig. 5, A and B). To determine whether the cog2-1 cells accumulated normal-sized autophagic bodies, we quantified their diameters and compared them with the wild-type cells. The autophagic bodies accumulated in cog2-1 cells were smaller in diameter than those in the wild-type cells, being ~202.21 +- 72.17 nm versus 506.27 +- 139 nm, respectively (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that the COG complex is required for efficient autophagosome formation and may explain the observation that rapamycin treatment largely suppresses the prApe1 accumulation phenotype even though nonspecific autophagy still appears to be defective (Fig. 1); the reduced number of smaller autophagosomes was able to sequester prApe1, but the decreased volume resulted in Pho8Delta60 values that were essentially below the detectable range.\n\n    The requirements for COG subunits in localization of Atg8 and Atg9 suggested that the COG complex may have a direct role in the Cvt pathway and autophagy. Therefore, we decided to examine whether the COG complex localized to the PAS. We note that the PAS is poorly defined and is thought to be the precursor to or organizing center for formation of the phagophore; we cannot distinguish between the PAS and the phagophore in these analyses. The chromosomally tagged Cog1-GFP, Cog2-GFP, and Cog6-GFP were distributed in several punctate structures, one of which either colocalized with or formed a cup-shaped structure around RFP-Ape1, the PAS/phagophore marker (Fig. 6 and Fig. S3). We further analyzed the PAS localization frequency of these COG components by quantifying the colocalization percentages from cells with both fluorescence signals. The PAS localization frequency of Cog1-GFP, Cog2-GFP, and Cog6-GFP were 11.1%, 12.3%, and 8%, respectively, in a wild-type strain (Fig. 6 B and not depicted). Next, we examined whether the PAS localization rate could be elevated by additional deletion of ATG1, which causes the accumulation of Atg proteins at the PAS. However, the PAS localization rates of Cog1-GFP and Cog6-GFP were not altered in the atg1Delta strain and were similar to that of the wild type, being 9.7% and 10.1%, respectively (Fig. S3 and not depicted).\n\n    To further verify the PAS localization of the COG proteins, we decided to compare the PAS localization rate between Cog2-GFP and the thermosensitive mutant cog2-1-GFP. cog2-1 bears a transversion mutation at nucleotide 624, thus encoding a truncated protein. To monitor cog2-1-GFP localization, we chromosomally tagged GFP at the COG2 locus, resulting in a 194-amino acid truncated protein with a C-terminal GFP fusion. At the permissive temperature, both Cog2-GFP and cog2-1-GFP were localized to several punctate dots, one of which colocalized with RFP-Ape1 under both growing and rapamycin treatment conditions (Fig. 6). After shifting the cultures to nonpermissive temperature for 30 min, the cog2-1-GFP signal became one or two strong dots with several faint dots. The percentage of PAS localization of this protein dropped after the temperature shift (from 8.76 to 1.98%; Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the temperature shift did not dramatically change the PAS localization of wild-type Cog2-GFP. Similar results were seen when rapamycin was added to induce autophagy (Fig. 6). In this case, the PAS localization frequency of the mutant decreased from 13.54 to 0.85%. This result further verifies the PAS localization of the COG components. To determine whether the COG-GFP chimeras were localizing normally, we tested the Golgi localization of Cog1, Cog2, and Cog6. The majority of the Cog1-GFP, Cog2-GFP, and Cog6-GFP punctate dots colocalized with the Golgi marker Vrg4-RFP (Fig. S4), which does not colocalize with Ape1 (not depicted). At least one of the puncta did not localize to the Golgi complex, suggesting that a portion of the COG complex in the cell is not localized at this site.\n\n    Although the COG complex associates with the Golgi and COPI-containing vesicles, it is still not clear which vesicles it tethers with regard to its role in autophagy. The PAS localization of the COG complex suggested that in addition to maintaining correct membrane flow through the secretory pathway that is important for autophagy, the COG complex may participate directly in double-membrane vesicle formation. To gain more insight into the function of the COG complex in the Cvt and autophagy pathways, we extended our study to test whether COG components interact with Atg proteins by yeast two-hybrid analysis.\n\n    Interactions between Atg24 and the Cog2 and Cog6 subunits as well as an Atg17-Cog2 interaction have been reported in high throughput screening studies. In addition, we found that COG complex components showed weak interaction with Atg9 and stronger binding with Atg12, Atg17, Atg20, and Atg24 (Table I). To explore the physical interactions between COG and Atg proteins, we investigated the protein interactions under physiological conditions. First, we performed coimmunoprecipitation using endogenous COG subunits; however, we were unable to detect the endogenous COG proteins as a result of their low expression levels (unpublished data).\n\n    To overexpress COG subunits, we chromosomally replaced their endogenous promoters with the GAL1 promoter and an N-terminal HA tag and performed a series of protein A (PA) affinity purification experiments. Either a PA-tagged Atg protein or PA alone was coexpressed in combination with HA-COG subunits. Cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium with galactose (SMG) to induce COG subunit overexpression. Cell extracts were prepared, and PA-tagged Atg proteins and associated proteins were affinity isolated. The recovered immunocomplex was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of HA-COG subunits was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. HA-Cog1 bound to PA-Atg17 and PA-Atg20, whereas HA-Cog3 was coprecipitated with PA-Atg17 and PA-Atg24 (unpublished data). HA-Cog4 was able to bind PA-Atg17, PA-Atg20, and PA-Atg24 (Fig. 7 A). HA-COG subunits did not bind to PA alone, indicating that the interactions with HA-COG subunits were dependent on Atg17, Atg20, or Atg24 fused to PA. In addition, these interactions were absent when the affinity isolation was performed with combined cell lysates from two different strains each expressing an individual tagged protein; thus, the interactions we detected did not occur after lysis (unpublished data).\n\n    We also tested the interaction between Cog2 and Atg12. Lysates were prepared from yeast cells expressing HA-Cog2, Myc-Atg12, or both and incubated with PA-Sepharose beads and anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody. The resulting immunocomplex was subjected to Western blot analysis. In the cells expressing either HA-Cog2 or Myc-Atg12 alone, no Myc-Atg12 or HA-Cog2 was detected after immunoprecipitation, indicating that both proteins did not bind nonspecifically to the PA-Sepharose beads. In contrast, when both HA-Cog2 and Myc-Atg12 were coexpressed, Myc-Atg12 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-Cog2 and vice versa (Fig. 7 B). We were unable to detect an interaction between Cog2 and Atg12-Atg5 conjugates. This could be the result of either the absence of this interaction or the relatively low level of Atg12-Atg5 conjugates in our experimental conditions in which Atg12 was overexpressed. Atg9 weakly interacted with Cog3 and Cog4 in the yeast two-hybrid analysis; however, we could not verify these interactions by PA affinity isolation. Thus, the interaction between Atg9 and Cog3 or Cog4 might be transient or too weak to detect reproducibly.\n\n    The COG complex primarily localizes to the rims and tips of the Golgi membrane and their associated vesicles. However, none of the COG subunits have either a transmembrane domain or lipid-binding motif. Thus, it remains unclear whether COG subunits themselves or other factors mediate this membrane association. The interactions between COG and Atg proteins raise a possibility that PAS membrane association of the COG complex is through interaction with Atg proteins. To address this point, we used a multiple knockout (MKO) strain in which 24 ATG genes that are directly involved in autophagy and/or the Cvt pathway have been deleted. We used an MKO strain containing Atg19, the Ape1 cargo receptor, and reintroduced Atg11, an adaptor protein required for prApe1 cargo recruitment, to this strain, allowing the formation of the Cvt complex. In this strain, chromosomally tagged Cog2-GFP and plasmid-based RFP-Ape1 were coexpressed, and the colocalization was examined by fluorescence microscopy. In the MKO (ATG11 ATG19) strain, Cog2-GFP colocalized with RFP-Ape1, the Cvt complex marker (Fig. 7 C). We further quantified the colocalization frequency of Cog2-GFP in the MKO (ATG11 ATG19) strain and found that the colocalization rate was similar to that of the wild type (MKO: 11.11%, n = 225; wild type: 12.5%, n = 152). Therefore, it is possible that the interactions between the COG and Atg subunits that we detected reflect functional interactions that are not involved in localization of the COG complex to the PAS/phagophore; unknown factors or the COG complex subunits themselves may direct the complex to this site.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    An autophagosome is formed through nucleation, membrane expansion, and completion. Because of the similarity between autophagy and the Cvt pathway, the Cvt vesicle is considered as a variant of an autophagosome. However, the Cvt vesicle (~150 nm in diameter) is smaller than an autophagosome (300-900 nm in diameter) in size. Furthermore, during selective types of autophagy, the membrane may form in close apposition to the cargo, using receptors (e.g., Atg19) and adaptor proteins (e.g., Atg11) to link the two, whereas these types of proteins do not play an essential role in nonspecific autophagy. These observations suggest that the nature of Cvt vesicle and autophagosome formation may in part be different. Indeed, some components are involved in the formation of one but not the other, which may explain why lobe A subunits are required for both the Cvt and autophagy pathways, whereas the lobe B subunits of the COG complex are Cvt specific. This idea is supported by the normal Pho8Delta60-dependent alkaline phosphatase activity seen in lobe B but not lobe A mutants of the COG complex (Fig. 1, A, B, D, and E). Similarly, abnormal GFP-Atg8-positive structures were detected in cog2-1 and cog3-2 mutants during vegetative growth and after rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3), indicating that the lobe A subunits of COG may play a role in autophagosome formation.\n\n    There may be two membrane fusion events during the process of double-membrane vesicle formation: the presumed condensation of transient vesicles with the growing phagophore at the PAS and the fusion of the completed double-membrane vesicles with the vacuole. The last event is the best characterized and relies on components that are needed for other vesicle fusion events with the vacuole as well as homotypic vacuole fusion. In contrast, little is known about the role of SNAREs or tethering factors in the phagophore expansion step. Previous experiments were unable to detect any SNAREs that localize to the PAS, possibly as a result of their presence at too low a level. Considering the tethering function of the COG complex in the secretory pathway and the localization of the COG complex at the PAS (Fig. 6), it is possible that the COG complex might participate in membrane tethering events, which are required for Cvt vesicle and autophagosome formation and completion. Although we have not directly shown a role for COG components in tethering, the dispersed localization of Atg8 in the cog2-1 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 A) suggests that it may function in this manner.\n\n    The interactions between the COG complex and Atg proteins suggest a direct involvement of the COG complex in autophagy and the Cvt pathway and also provide insight about the function of these Atg proteins. Atg17 showed strong interactions with many COG subunits by yeast two-hybrid analysis (Table I). Atg17 is an autophagy-specific protein and functions as a scaffold to recruit other Atg proteins to organize PAS formation. Atg17 modulates the timing and magnitude of the autophagy response, such as the size of the sequestering vesicles, through interacting with and regulating Atg1 kinase activity. The interaction between Atg17 and COG subunits provides a link between the autophagy regulatory components and the phagophore expansion/vesicle fusion machinery and may provide a clue as to how the Atg1 kinase activity can be translated into the size of sequestering vesicles.\n\n    The significance of the interaction between Atg12 and Cog2 is not known. The finding that Atg9 interacts with COG subunits by yeast two hybrid is intriguing. Although we were unable to obtain consistent results from PA affinity isolation experiments, it is possible that the interaction between Atg9 and the COG complex is transient. Atg9 is an integral membrane protein that cycles between the PAS and peripheral sites and is directly involved in double-membrane vesicle formation. During its cycling, it remains associated with lipid, which makes Atg9 a prime candidate for a carrier that brings membrane from sources to the PAS. We hypothesize that the COG complex may function as a tethering factor, allowing Atg9-containing vesicles to fuse with the expanding phagophore at the PAS, which might explain the transient interaction between the tether and Atg9. In conclusion, our data suggest that the COG complex is required for the efficient fusion of transient vesicles with the phagophore at the PAS, which is required for Cvt vesicle and autophagosome formation and completion.",

        "Title": "    A Bubble-Free Microfluidic Device for Easy-to-Operate Immobilization, Culturing and Monitoring of Zebrafish Embryos",
        "Abstract": "    The development of miniaturized devices for studying zebrafish embryos has been limited due to complicated fabrication and operation processes. Here, we reported on a microfluidic device that enabled the capture and culture of zebrafish embryos and real-time monitoring of dynamic embryonic development. The device was simply fabricated by bonding two layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures replicated from three-dimensional (3D) printed reusable molds onto a flat glass substrate. Embryos were easily loaded into the device with a pipette, docked in traps by gravity, and then retained in traps with hydrodynamic forces for long-term culturing. A degassing chamber bonded on top was used to remove air bubbles from the embryo-culturing channel and traps so that any embryo movement caused by air bubbles was eliminated during live imaging. Computational fluid dynamics simulations suggested this embryo-trapping and -retention regime to exert low shear stress on the immobilized embryos. Monitoring of the zebrafish embryogenesis over 20 h during the early stages successfully verified the performance of the microfluidic device for culturing the immobilized zebrafish embryos. Therefore, this rapid-prototyping, low-cost and easy-to-operate microfluidic device offers a promising platform for the long-term culturing of immobilized zebrafish embryos under continuous medium perfusion and the high-quality screening of the developmental dynamics.",
        "Introduction": "    The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has become a prominent vertebrate model for disease modeling and drug discovery. Approximately 82% of disease-related human genes have at least one zebrafish orthologue. Zebrafish embryos feature a small size, an optically-transparent body, rapid development, and cost-efficient husbandry, and thus have been increasingly used as ideal model organisms in research areas such as embryogenesis, developmental biology and chemical genetics. To date, most routine experiments with zebrafish embryos are still performed by means of cell-culturing protocols in conventional microplates, which have several drawbacks. For instance, the static culturing environment of embryos in sample wells may cause accumulative surface absorption of chemical compounds and cross-contamination of embryo metabolites. The water flow for embryos developed in a natural fluid environment cannot be imitated by the static culture. Embryos moving in wells may impose restrictions on the resolution and quality of live imaging.\n\n    In the past decade, microfluidics has developed rapidly due to its unique merits, such as small geometric features in micrometer-scale and high surface-to-volume ratio, ability to handle small volume of fluids (microliter to picoliter) in laminar flow regime, and requiring low reagents with a fast response. In addition, the advantages of microfluidics in portability, automation, high throughput, and the ability to integrate multiple functions on a single chip make it an exceptional platform in a variety of fields such as chemical analysis, cell biology, and medicine. Microfluidics can even enhance the propagation, development and potency of some biological organisms, especially in assisted reproductive technology (ART).\n\n    Furthermore, with the development of advanced manufacturing technologies such as microfabrication, laser micromachining and three-dimensional (3D) printing, dedicated microfluidic devices for the immobilization, flow-perfusion culture, dosing and time-lapse imaging of zebrafish embryos have emerged in the past decade. A set of microfluidic devices were presented for zebrafish embryos' culturing and monitoring based on specific modifications in 3D structure design, glass/silicon etching and bonding processes, and medium perfusion. Although these devices have controllable perfusion systems and enable the culturing of single zebrafish embryos in each chamber, complicated fabrication and operation processes that require dedicated clean-room equipment and instruments limit availability in most biological laboratories, and any movement of embryos in chambers may affect the imaging quality.\n\n    To resolve the problem of embryo movement during optical screening, Akagi et al. developed a microfluidic array with horizontal traps for the immobilization and perfusion of zebrafish embryos. The design and operation mechanism of this array was similar to that of the worm-encapsulated droplet trap array, but required a high flow rate of up to 2 mL/min to drag and dock millimeter-scale embryos in traps. Zhu et al. developed a 3D high-throughput microfluidic platform, which enables the stable immobilization of single embryos by combining continuous medium perfusion at a flow rate of 400 microL/min and aspiration via horizontal tunnels embedded between the traps and suction channel. Moreover, in order to avoid the high-flow-rate perfusion that may exert high shear stress on embryos and potentially affect the embryogenesis and embryonic development, laser micromachining was introduced to fabricate a multilayer 3D array of embryo traps with vertical tunnels embedded beneath to immobilize single zebrafish embryos by combined gravitational sedimentation and low-pressure suction. However, the surface roughness of vertical traps processed by laser micromachining limited the image resolution and quality of immobilized embryos. Therefore, an easily fabricated and straightforward-to-handle microfluidic system that enables the gentle immobilization and perfusion, stable culturing, and high-resolution imaging of zebrafish embryos is desirable.\n\n    In this work, we presented a proof-of-concept microfluidic device for the immobilization, culturing and imaging of zebrafish embryos. The device was comprised of a flat glass substrate and two layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures replicated from 3D printed masters. A bottom PDMS layer was constructed with an embryo-culturing channel to load embryos and five traps to capture embryos for long-term culturing and real-time imaging during their development. Taking advantage of the gas permeability of PDMS materials, a degassing chamber patterned in the top PDMS layer was used to remove air bubbles from the fluidic channel and traps in the bottom PDMS layer by applying a vacuum in the degassing chamber. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to estimate the shear stress on the immobilized embryos that were perfused under the continuous medium in the device. Culturing and monitoring of zebrafish embryonic development was carried out over 20 h to verify the performance of the microfluidic device.",
        "Methods": "    The microfluidic device consisted of a glass substrate and two PDMS layers patterned with microstructures (Figure 1). The bottom layer, i.e., the embryo-culturing channel, was designed to trap and culture zebrafish embryos. It was composed of an inlet for embryo loading, an inlet and an outlet for medium perfusion, and five horizontal-funnel-like traps for embryo immobilization. Considering that the diameter of zebrafish embryos with chorion is about 1.2 mm, the embryo inlet was 2 mm in diameter, the embryo-culturing channel was 2.5 mm wide and 2 mm high, and the trap featured a wide opening of 1.8 mm and a narrow opening of 0.6 mm to dock and retain an embryo without being flushed away. After the loading of embryos in the device, the embryo inlet was inserted with a 2 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) plug to avoid liquid leakage during culturing-medium perfusion. The top PDMS layer, which was irreversibly bonded onto the upper surface of the bottom PDMS layer, was a degassing chamber with several posts to support it. The degassing chamber had a height of 1 mm and fully covered the embryo-culturing channel and traps.\n\n    The operation process of the microfluidic device is schematically shown in Figure 2. To load embryos into the device, a 1 mL pipette tip was cut to form a big opening (>1.2 mm) so that embryos could be sucked up and released easily without being damaged. Then, embryos could be transferred into the embryo-culturing channel through the embryo inlet using a pipette (Figure 2A). Afterwards, a 2 mm diameter PTFE plug was inserted into the embryo inlet so that no liquid leakage occurred during medium perfusion (Figure 2B). The medium inflow was then started by controlling a syringe pump. To immobilize embryos, the device was tilted slightly to roll the embryos in the channel and gravitationally dock them in the traps (Figure 2C). The space of each trap could house only one embryo to ensure single-embryo immobilization. After docking, embryos were perfused continuously with the culturing medium to stably maintain the immobilization status by hydrodynamic forces (Figure 2D,E). During the whole process of embryo loading, immobilization and culturing, a vacuum was always applied to the degassing chamber via aspiration to remove any air bubbles from the fluidic channel.\n\n    The microfluidic device was simply fabricated using a glass-PDMS multi-layer process. Since zebrafish embryos have diameters of around 1.2 mm and require a millimeter- and submillimeter-scale feature of microstructures for entrapment, the standard SU-8-based soft-lithography process was not feasible. Herein, we used an affordable 3D printer (MiiCraft+, MiiCraft, Hsinchu, Taiwan) with its proprietary photopolymer resin (BV007, MiiCraft) to fabricate molds for PDMS replication. Masters for both the embryo-culturing channel and degassing chamber were designed using SolidWorks software (Dassault Systemes, Waltham, MA, USA). The printer features an x-y resolution of about 56 mum and a z resolution of 50 mum, which was defined by the minimum upward step of the stage. For each layer of resin with a thickness of 50 mum, the ultraviolet (UV) exposure time was set to 5 s. After printing, the master was soaked in ethanol for 5 min then rinsed with fresh ethanol for another 1 min, followed by UV post-curing for 20 min. After post-curing, the master was soaked in ethanol again for 2 h then baked on a hotplate at 60  C for 12 h to finalize the master fabrication (Figure 3A,B-1). Both masters were then silanized with trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) in vapor phase to prevent PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) from adhering to resin molds (Figure 3B-2). Afterwards, masters were transferred to PDMS with a mixture of 10:1 w/w base to curing agent (Figure 3B-3). After peeling the PDMS replicas from masters, the degassing chamber was first punched with a hole as the inlet for aspiration and subsequently bonded onto the upper surface of the PDMS embryo-culturing channel (Figure 3B-4) through oxygen plasma surface modification (PDC-002-HP, Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY, USA). Then, the bonded PDMS stamp was punched with holes as inlets and outlets for embryo loading and medium perfusion. Lastly, the PDMS stamp was irreversibly bonded to a bare glass slide (Figure 3B-5) to finalize the device fabrication.\n\n    In order to investigate the fluid dynamics for trapping and maintaining embryos and shear stress exerted on the immobilized embryos in the microfluidic device, 3D CFD simulations were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software (COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA, USA) using 'Laminar Flow' physics from the CFD Module. Geometric structures and parameters in the model were derived from the microfluidic device in Figure 1. According to the geometric parameters and applied flow rate of 50 muL/min, the Reynolds number in the embryo-culturing channel was calculated to be 0.37, which confirmed that the microfluidic device followed the laminar flow regime. Embryos immobilized by the traps were simply modelled as rigid and non-deformable spheres in the fluidic domain. Subdomains were assigned with a density of 1000 kg/m3 and a dynamic viscosity of 0.001 Pa s (for water at 20  C). For the incompressible fluid under laminar flow regime that follows the Navier-Stokes equation, the pressure and flow velocity were conducted by the governing equations as follows:  where  is density, u is velocity vector, p is pressure, I is unit matrix, mu is dynamic viscosity, and F is volume force vector.\n\n    A no-slip boundary condition was applied to the channel walls and the sphere surfaces. Laminar inflow with different volumetric flow rates of 25, 50, 100 and 500 muL/min was applied to the inlet boundary of the fluidic channel, and a pressure of 0 Pa was set to the outlet boundary. Due to the limitation of physical memory and time-cost in the numerical calculation, a predefined meshing process with normal element size was applied to all domains. Supplementary Table S1 lists the detailed parameters of element size set for meshing, such as maximum and minimum element size, and maximum element growth rate. Supplementary Figure S1 illustrates the translucent profiles of the microfluidic structures without and with spheres after meshing. The shear stress (tau) over the sphere surfaces was calculated by using the shear stress components in x-, y- and z-directions on the basis of the following equation:\n\n    After simulations, contours and stream lines referring to the flow velocity in the fluidic channel and contours of the shear stress over the sphere surfaces were obtained.\n\n    Embryos were obtained from natural spawning of wild type adult zebrafish and were collected in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, and 0.33 mM MgSO4). After flushing the microfluidic channel with E3 medium, we used a pipette with a modified tip to transfer embryos into the embryo-culturing channel through the embryo inlet, which was then plugged up with a PTFE pillar. The microfluidic device was manually tilted in order to dock embryos in the traps, then fixed on the stage of a stereomicroscope (NSZ-608T, Novel Optics, Nanjing, China) with adhesive tape. For embryo culturing, E3 medium, initially loaded in a 100 mL syringe affixed on a syringe pump, was perfused into the embryo-culturing channel via PTFE tubing at a constant flow rate of 50 microL/min, and the room temperature was kept at 28.5  C. In order to remove any bubbles from the embryo-culturing channel, the degassing chamber was connected to the house vacuum supplied by a vacuum pump (MPC 1201 T, Ilmvac, Germany), which can provide an ultimate pressure of below 2 mbar according to its datasheet. Time-lapse imaging of embryonic development was performed using the stereomicroscope equipped with a digital camera (E3CMOS, ToupTek Photonics, Hangzhou, China) and running its camera control software (ToupView, ToupTek Photonics) for image acquisition at a time interval of 150 s.",
        "Results": "    During the long-term culturing and monitoring of zebrafish embryos, any air bubbles brought to the embryo-culturing channel and traps may squeeze the immobilized embryo out of its original position or obstruct the view of imaging, and thus affect the stability of embryo immobilization and the quality of time-lapse imaging. As such, we took advantage of the gas permeability of PDMS materials and removed air bubbles from the fluidic channel by applying a vacuum to the degassing chamber. Herein, we tested the degassing chamber, which was assigned to remove air bubbles attached to PDMS channel walls in the embryo-culturing channel. Once a low pressure (vacuum) was exerted over the degassing chamber via aspiration, a high-pressure difference was generated between the air in bubbles and the degassing chamber. Thus, air in the bubbles could be aspirated to pass through the gas-permeable PDMS and ultimately removed. Figure 4 shows the experimental results. Initially, there were some air bubbles attached to the surface of the embryo-culturing channel, as indicated by arrows in Figure 4A. After switching on the vacuum supply, bubbles started to reduce in size and number (Figure 4B,C) and finally disappeared within 3 s (Figure 4D). The result demonstrated that the degassing chamber was capable of removing air bubbles highly efficiently, thereby enabling the stable culturing and monitoring of zebrafish embryonic development.\n\n    3D CFD simulations were performed to study the fluidic dynamics for embryo immobilization and the shear stress exerted on the immobilized embryos in the microfluidic device. Figure 5A shows the flow velocity across the embryo-culturing channel immobilized with five embryos. The stream lines indicate that the liquid flowed over each immobilized embryo and became trapped towards the outlet. The contour plots of vertical cross-sections indicate that the maximum value of flow velocity existed in the rightmost trap. As a result, the shear stress over the surface of the rightmost embryo exhibited a maximum value of 5.2 x 10-3 Pa among the five immobilized embryos perfused at 50 microL/min (Figure 5B). Based on the CFD simulations, we then obtained the maximum and mean shear stress over each embryo at different flow rates: 25, 50, 100 and 500 muL/min (Figure 5C,D). With the increase of flow rate, both maximum and mean values of shear stress showed an increase trend. When applying a flow rate of 100 muL/min, the maximum shear stress of the rightmost embryo exceeded 0.01 Pa. At a flow rate of 500 muL/min, the mean shear stress of the same embryo also exceeded 0.01 Pa. The CFD simulations thus indicated that a high flow rate resulted in high shear stress over the surfaces of embryos. Previous studies have verified that the maximum shear stress in the order of 0.01 Pa has negligible influence on developing embryos due to the protection of the robust chorion membrane. In the experiment, we found that immobilized embryos during culturing were occasionally displaced from their original positions when a flow rate of 30 microL/min was applied for medium perfusion. This phenomenon can be elucidated by the fact that a flow rate lower than 30 microL/min cannot provide sufficient hydrodynamic forces to retain the embryos stably in their traps. Considering the required stable embryo immobilization and low shear stress over the embryos during long-term culturing and imaging, we, therefore, set the flow rate of medium perfusion to 50 microL/min in the experiment.\n\n    We then evaluated the microfluidic device as a stable platform to culture the immobilized zebrafish embryos and monitor their dynamic development. The immobilized embryos were perfused with E3 medium at a constant flow rate of 50 microL/min for a long-term culture (over 20 h). Meanwhile the embryonic development was traced by time-lapse imaging at a time interval of 150 s.\n\n    Figure 6 shows photographs every 2 h of the four recorded zebrafish embryos, which developed healthily and uniformly during the recording time course. Image acquisition started around 5 h post fertilization (T = 0 h) and the embryonic development had already entered the gastrula stage. The epiboly displaced the blastoderm margin and remained at 50%. The germ ring and the embryonic shield could be observed. Then, the epiboly continued until the yolk plug was completely covered by the blastoderm, and a tail bud became visible (4 h, bud stage). From this stage onward, the development of embryos entered the segmentation period. During this development period (6-16 h), somites appeared sequentially and developed in the trunk and tail, which elongated and became more prominent, and the early rudiments of primary organs and body movement could be observed. Afterwards, the embryos entered the pharyngula period for further morphogenetic development (18 h). Therefore, the aforementioned experimental results confirmed the capabilities of the microfluidic device for stable immobilization and long-term culturing of zebrafish embryos and monitoring their early-stage development without interfering in the intricate embryogenesis.",
        "Conclusion": "    We have presented a rapid-prototyping, low-cost and easy-to-operate microfluidic device for stable immobilization, long-term culturing and high-quality imaging of zebrafish embryos. The device has been simply fabricated by bonding a glass substrate with two layers of PDMS replicas from the 3D printed reusable masters. Experimental results have demonstrated that zebrafish embryos can be easily loaded into the embryo-culturing channel with a pipette and then rolled into the traps in turn under gravity by manually tilting the device. Suggested by the CFD simulations, we have optimized the embryo-trapping regime and diminished the potential shear stress exerted over the immobilized embryos. Continuous medium perfusion at a low flow rate of 50 microL/min provided adequate hydrodynamic forces to ensure the stable immobilization of the embryos. Air bubbles in the embryo-culturing channel and traps were rapidly and effectively removed by the degassing chamber on top. As a result, the zebrafish embryos were stably immobilized and underwent long-term time-lapse monitoring of their dynamic development. Culturing and monitoring over 20 h during the early stages of the embryonic development of the zebrafish successfully confirmed the functions of the microfluidic device. Therefore, the microfluidic platform promises to perform the stable immobilization, continuous medium perfusion, and long-term culturing of more zebrafish embryos with a potential scaling-up of the device, allowing for high-quality monitoring of dynamic embryonic development.",

        "Title": "    Comprehensive molecular etiology analysis of nonsyndromic hearing impairment from typical areas in China",
        "Abstract": "    Every year, 30,000 babies are born with congenital hearing impairment in China. The molecular etiology of hearing impairment in the Chinese population has not been investigated thoroughly. To provide appropriate genetic testing and counseling to families, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the molecular etiology of nonsyndromic deafness in two typical areas from northern and southern China.\n\n    A total of 284 unrelated school children with hearing loss who attended special education schools in China were enrolled in this study, 134 from Chifeng City in Inner Mongolia and the remaining 150 from Nangtong City in JiangSu Province. Screening was performed for GJB2, GJB3, GJB6, SLC26A4, 12S rRNA, and tRNAser(UCN) genes in this population. All patients with SLC26A4 mutations or variants were subjected to high-resolution temporal bone CT scan to verify the enlarged vestibular aqueduct.\n\n    Mutations in the GJB2 gene accounted for 18.31% of the patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss, 1555A>G mutation in mitochondrial DNA accounted for 1.76%, and SLC26A4 mutations accounted for 13.73%. Almost 50% of the patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss in these typical Chinese areas carried GJB2 or SLC26A4 mutations. No significant differences in mutation spectrum or prevalence of GJB2 and SLC26A4 were found between the two areas.\n\n    In this Chinese population, 54.93% of cases with hearing loss were related to genetic factors. The GJB2 gene accounted for the etiology in about 18.31% of the patients with hearing loss, SLC26A4 accounted for about 13.73%, and mtDNA 1555A>G mutation accounted for 1.76%. Mutations in GJB3, GJB6, and mtDNA tRNAser(UCN) were not common in this Chinese cohort. Conventionally, screening is performed for GJB2, SLC26A4, and mitochondrial 12S rRNA in the Chinese deaf population.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing impairment is the most common neurosensory disorder in humans, with an incidence of approximately one in 1000 children worldwide. About 50-60% of these cases have a genetic cause. In China, it has been estimated that 30,000 babies are born with congenital hearing impairment per 20 million live births every year. Although some mutational hotspots involved in inherited hearing impairment, such as GJB2 235 delC, SLC26A4 IVS7-2A>G, and mitochondrial DNA 1555A>G, have been reported in Chinese deaf populations, the molecular etiology of deafness in Chinese children has not been investigated systematically, and effective genetic evaluation strategies for hearing impairment are not available in most areas of China. China is a large country with a population of 1.3 billion, of which 91% are Han ethnic people. Comprehensive genetic analysis of deaf children in different regions of China should be performed to obtain epidemiological information to provide effective genetic testing and accurate counseling.\n\n    The most common molecular defects in nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness involve Connexin 26, a gap junction protein encoded by the GJB2 gene. More than 150 mutations, polymorphisms, and unclassified variants of GJB2 have been reported to account for the molecular etiology of about 8-40% of patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment . However, almost 79% of patients with nonsyndromic hereditary deafness in China do not have mutations in GJB2 . Indeed, mutations in other connexin genes, such as GJB6 for Cx30 and GJB3 for Cx31, have been identified and shown to cause hearing impairment. Sequence analysis of the GJB2 gene in subjects with autosomal recessive hearing impairment has revealed a puzzling problem in that a high number of patients carry only one mutant allele. Some of these families showed clear evidence of linkage to the DFNB1 locus, which contains two genes, GJB2 and GJB6 . Further analysis demonstrated a deletion truncating the GJB6 gene, encoding connexin 30, near GJB2 in heterozygous affected subjects.\n\n    SLC26A4 also makes appreciable contributions to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness, enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA), and Pendred syndrome. SLC26A4 encodes an anion (chloride/iodide) transporter transmembrane protein, pendrin, which is expressed in the thyroid, kidney, and cochlea. DNA sequence analysis identified more than 100 different mutations in SLC26A4 . It was reported that SLC26A4 mutations accounted for approximately 5% of all cases of prelingual deafness in East Asia, 5% of cases of recessive deafness in south Asia, 3.5% in the UK, and 4% in the Caucasian population with nonsyndromic hearing loss.\n\n    Although the majority of cases with hereditary hearing loss are caused by nuclear gene defects, it has become clear that mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can also cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. The best studied of these mutations is the 1555A>G mutation in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. Another recently identified mutation in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene is the 1494C>T in the conserved stem structure of 12S rRNA . Other nucleotide changes at positions 961 and 1095 in the 12S rRNA gene have been shown to be associated with hearing loss, but their pathogenic mechanisms of action in the predisposition of carriers to aminoglycoside toxicity are much less clear. Several mutations (7444G>A, 7445A>G, 7472insC, 7510T>C, 7511T>C, and 7512T>C) in the mitochondrial tRNAser(UCN) gene are also known to cause maternally inherited nonsyndromic hearing loss by disrupting the tRNA structure and function. The mtDNA 1555A>G mutation accounts for a small fraction of patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss, with frequencies between 0.6% and 2.5% among different Caucasian populations and higher frequencies in Asian countries (3.43%, 3%, and 5.3% in Chinese, Japanese, and Indonesian cohorts, respectively).\n\n    In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of 6 prominent deafness-related genes, GJB2, GJB3, GJB6, SLC26A4, mtDNA 12S rRNA, and mtDNA tRNAser(UCN), in 284 patients with early-onset, nonsyndromic hearing impairment from unrelated families from two typical Chinese areas, Chifeng City in northern China and Nantong City in southern China, to investigate the molecular etiology in order to provide effective risk assessment and genetic counseling for hearing loss patients and their families in China.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 284 deaf subjects from unrelated families were included in this study; 134 were from Chifeng Special Education School in Inner Mongolia, and 150 were from Nantong Special Education School in JiangSu Province, China. The Huanghe River is the demarcation line between northern and southern China. Chifeng is a typical city in northern China with a population of 4.61 million, and Nantong is a typical city in southern China with a population of 7.74 million. Chifeng and Nantong are moderate on the population scales in northern and southern China, respectively. Chifeng and Nantong both have long histories of 8000 years and at least 5000 years, respectively. No significant population immigration has occurred over the history of the two cities, and the genetic backgrounds of the respective populations remain relatively intact. The two cities have relatively stable economic development, and the living habits and cultural background of the populations are characteristic of northern and southern China, respectively. This cohort of patients consisted of 158 males and 126 females from 3 to 20 years old with an average age of 12.30 +- 2.70 years. Ethnically, the patients consisted of 243 Han, 31 Mongolian, 7 Man, and 3 Hui Chinese. The study protocol was performed with the approval of the ethnicity committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to blood sampling. Parents were interviewed with regard to age of onset, family history, mother's health during pregnancy, and patient's clinical history, including infection, possible head or brain injury, and the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics.\n\n    All subjects showed moderate to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment on audiograms. Careful medical examinations revealed no clinical features other than hearing impairment. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of 284 patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss and 200 region- and race-matched controls with normal hearing using a commercially available DNA extraction kit (Watson Biotechnologies Inc, Shanghai, China).\n\n    DNA sequence analysis of the GJB2 coding region plus approximately 50 bp of the flanking intron regions, mitochondrial 12S rRNA (nt611 to nt2007), and tRNAser(UCN) (nt7148 to nt8095) genes were amplified by PCR followed by sequencing using the Big Dye sequencing protocol in all patients. The sequence results were analyzed using an ABI 3100 DNA sequencing machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and ABI 3100 Analysis Software v.3.7 NT, according to manufacturer's protocol. Patients with monoallelic GJB2 coding region mutation were further tested for GJB2 IVS1+1G>A mutation or defects in exon1 and basal promoter of GJB2, GJB6 309-kb deletion, and deletion of the whole GJB6 coding region. The presence of the 309-kb deletion of GJB6 was analyzed by PCR. A positive control (provided by Balin Wu, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) was used for detection of GJB6 gene deletions.\n\n    Patients with two GJB2 mutant alleles, one dominant mutant allele, or mtDNA 1555A>G mutation were not analyzed for SLC26A4 mutations. The exons of SLC26A4 of the remaining 227 patients were sequenced individually starting from the frequently mutated exons until two mutant alleles were identified.\n\n    Patients with two GJB2 mutant alleles, one dominant mutant allele, mtDNA 1555A>G mutation, or verified EVA were not analyzed for GJB3 mutations. The coding exon of GJB3 was sequenced in the remaining 188 patients.\n\n    Two hundred controls with normal hearing were sequenced to determine the presence of mutations and polymorphisms in the GJB2, GJB3, and GJB6 genes and mtDNA 12S rRNA and tRNAser(UCN). In addition, all controls were screened for SLC26A4 mutations by DHPLC followed by sequencing analysis.\n\n    Fifty-six of 59 patients with mutations or variants in SLC26A4 were examined by temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scan for diagnosis of EVA or inner ear malformation based on a diameter of >1.5 mm at the midpoint between the common crus and the external aperture. To evaluate Pendred syndrome, patients positive for SLC26A4 mutations or variants were examined by ultrasound scan of the thyroid and determination of thyroid hormone levels. These procedures were performed at the Second Hospital of Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia and hospitals affiliated with Nantong University, China. As perchlorate discharge testing is not a general clinical practice in China, it was not used in this study.",
        "Results": "    Among the 284 cases included in this study, 139 cases had prelingual hearing loss, including 94 congenital cases. Fifty-six cases showed postlingual hearing loss, with an average age of onset of 3.01 +- 1.86 years. The age of onset was unclear in the remaining 89 cases. In addition, 79 cases (22 prelingual cases and 57 postlingual cases) had clear histories of administration of aminoglycoside, with an average age of onset at 2.23 +- 1.71 years, and patients without a history of aminoglycoside use showed a significantly lower average age of onset of 0.75 +- 1.07 years (P < 0.001).\n\n    Sequence analysis of the GJB2 gene indicated that 51 patients carried two confirmed pathogenic mutations, and 1 patient had an R75W mutation, which has been reported to cause autosomal dominant syndromic deafness with palmoplantar keratoderma (Table 1). Twenty-eight patients, including the 1 patient with autosomal dominant R75W mutation, were heterozygous for one pathogenic mutant allele. Four patients were heterozygous for one unclassified novel variant, the pathogenicity of which has not been determined (Table 1). In addition, 3 patients carried the heterozygous allele V37I, about which there is debate regarding whether it is a pathogenic mutation or a polymorphism. Thus, 29.23% (83/284) of the unrelated families of deaf patients in typical areas in China had molecular defects in GJB2, and 18.31% (52/284) had confirmed molecular etiology of nonsyndromic hearing impairment (51 autosomal recessive and 1 autosomal dominant) in the GJB2 gene.\n\n    Five frameshift (235delC, 299_300delAT, 176_191del16, 560_605ins46, and 155_158delTCTG) and two missense (T86R and R75W) pathogenic mutations were found in this cohort (Table 1). The most prevalent mutation in this patient cohort was 235delC, which has also been reported to be the most prevalent mutation in other Asian populations. Thirty-one patients were homozygous for 235delC mutation, 14 were compound heterozygous with another pathogenic mutation, and 20 were heterozygous for 235delC mutation (Table 1). Four novel alterations were identified, specifically, a frameshift pathogenic 155_158delTCTG mutation and three unclassified missense variants, V198M, V63L, and V153A (Tables 1). Overall, 134 mutant alleles (including the unclassified missense variants but excluding the V37I variant) were identified in 83 unrelated patients. 235delC alone accounted for 71.64% (96/134) of the total mutant alleles. Two mutations, 235delC and 299delAT, accounted for 85.07% (114/134) of the GJB2 mutations in our patients, 91% in another Chinese population, and 97% in a Taiwanese population. These detection rates were higher among all the studies on the Asian deaf populations to date. The V37I variant was considered a pathogenic mutation in Japanese studies, but it was not found in any of the Korean control or patient populations reported previously. The frequency of V37I in our deaf population was lower than that in our control group (P < 0.05). T123N is an unclassified variant, which was counted as a mutation in a previous Japanese study but as a polymorphism in another study in Taiwan. We found three T123N alleles in our control subjects but none in the patient group.\n\n    No variations in the GJB2 gene mutation spectra were found among the different ethnicities of Chinese patients in our study, with 235delC being the most common mutation in all ethnic groups. The 299_300delAT mutation was found in 15 Han, 1 Mon, and 1 Hui patient. The deleterious 560_605ins46 mutation was found in 1 Man patient. The 176_191del16 mutation was detected in 8 Han and 1 Mon patient, and 155_158 delTCTG was detected in 1 Man patient. Four of 7 Man patients (57%) and about 30% of patients from all other races [27.98% (68/243) of Han, 32.3% (10/31) of Mon, and 33.3% (1/3) of Hui] carried GJB2 mutations. No significant differences in GJB2 detection rate were found among these four ethnic groups (chi2 = 2.4893, P = 0.4772).\n\n    We analyzed the GJB2 gene from 200 control subjects with normal hearing and found three types of deleterious mutation, 235delC, 299_300delAT, and 139G>T(E47X), carried by 7 subjects in the heterozygous state. This suggested a GJB2 mutation carrier rate of about 3.5% (7/200) in the general population. Meanwhile, the carrier rates of GJB2 mutation in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, among Ashkenazi Jews, and in the Midwestern United States were reported to be 2%, 2.08%, 2.55%, 4.76%, and 3.01%, respectively.\n\n    None of our patients heterozygous for one GJB2 mutant allele or the controls with normal hearing carried the IVS1+1G>A mutation or variant in exon1 and basal promoter of GJB2.\n\n    None of our patients heterozygous for one GJB2 mutant allele or the controls with normal hearing had the known 309-kb deletion or other variant in the GJB6 gene.\n\n    Five patients were found to carry the 1555A>G mutation, and 4 patients carried the 1095T>C mutation in the mtDNA 12S rRNA gene. Two patients were detected carrying the 7444G>A mutation in the mtDNA tRNAser(UCN) gene. All of the above 11 patients had a clear history of aminoglycoside use. None of the remaining 68 patients with history of aminoglycoside use had mutations in 12S rRNA or tRNAser(UCN) in the mitochondrial genome. One of the 2 patients with 7444G>A mutation was also homozygous for the SLC26A4 IVS7-2A>G mutation and was further verified to have EVA by temporal CT scan. Thus, this patient may be only a 7444G>A carrier, with defects in SLC26A4 being the main cause of hearing loss. Two of the 200 control subjects were found to carry the mtDNA 12S rRNA 1095T>C mutation, giving a carrier rate of 1% (2/200). Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the incidence of the 1095T>C mutation between the patient and control groups. No other mutations were detected in the mitochondrial genome in the controls. All the mutations found in the mitochondrial genome were homogeneous.\n\n    Sequence analysis of the SLC26A4 gene in these 227 patients with hearing impairment identified 28 patients with two confirmed pathogenic mutations (Table 2) and one compound heterozygote for two unclassified variants, Y375C and R470H, which are most likely pathogenic. Twenty-one patients carried one SLC26A4 mutant allele, and 2 patients carried novel unclassified missense variants, I491T and L597S, respectively, which are probably pathogenic due to the changes in evolutionarily conserved amino acids. Two patients carried V659L, including 1 who was verified to have EVA by CT scan. Wang et al. reported the pathogenicity of V659L in Chinese EVA patients. Two unclassified heterozygous missense variants were found, I235V and T67S. The 2 patients carrying these single conserved amino acid changes had normal vestibular aqueducts. These two missense variants are probably benign, or these patients were only carriers of the mutation and their hearing impairment had other etiologies. One patient with normal results on temporal CT scan carried a novel variant, IVS12-6insT, in the heterozygous state. Analysis using the program NNSPLICE available at  did not predict gain or loss of a splice site with this variant, and it was therefore also considered benign. Thus, mutations in SLC26A4 were identified in 18.66% (53/284) of patients with hearing impairment in typical areas of China, 29 with two mutant alleles and 24 with one mutant allele.\n\n    A total of seven different pathogenic mutations (IVS7-2A>G, E37X, K77I, S391R, N392Y, T410M, H723R) and five novel, probably pathogenic variants (Y375C, R470H, I491T, L597S, and H723D) were found. The E37X mutation that results in a premature stop codon and a truncated protein less than 5% of the normal length is predicted to be deleterious. The H723D mutation is caused by nucleotide substitution, c.2167C>G, which was predicted to be deleterious as a milder change at the same amino acid residue, H723R, was shown to be the most common pathogenic mutation in Japanese subjects. Other missense mutations, K77I, S391R, N392Y, T410M, and H723R, have been reported in patients with hearing loss. Y375C, R470H, I491T, L597S, and H723D were considered pathogenic, as they are located in an evolutionarily conserved region. The substituted amino acids are structurally and functionally different from those in the wild-type sequence, and Y375C, R470H, I491T, and H723D have been found in patients with EVA or other forms of inner ear malformation and were not found in our normal controls.\n\n    The most common mutation in our patient cohort was the aberrant splice-site alteration, IVS7-2A>G, for which 16 patients were homozygous, 4 were compound heterozygous, and 17 were heterozygous. The IVS7-2A>G mutation accounted for 64.63% (53/82, counting only the definite pathogenic and most likely pathogenic variants) of all SLC26A4 mutant alleles in this population (Table 2).\n\n    Three novel silent variants were identified in the patients, c.1905C>G (E635E), c.678T>C (A226A), and c.225C>G (L75L), which were not detected in the control group.\n\n    To determine the carrier frequency in the general population, SLC26A4 exons 2-21 of 200 individuals with normal hearing were analyzed by DHPLC. Four IVS7-2A>G heterozygotes and one silent variant, 2217A>G (Q739Q), were found. The carrier rate of the SLC26A4 mutation in China was estimated to be about 2%. Polymorphisms in the SLC26A4 gene appear to be rare in the general population in comparison to those in the GJB2 gene.\n\n    Temporal CT scan revealed EVA and/or other inner ear malformation in 39 patients. Twenty-eight patients had EVA and two pathogenic mutant alleles, consistent with an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic loss of function of pendrin protein. One female patient carrying two novel missense variants, Y375C and R470H, had a common cystic cavity of the cochlea and vestibule without EVA. One male patient carrying a novel I491T variant had enlarged vestibular aqueducts with Mondini dysplasia. Eight patients with one mutant IVS7-2A>G allele had EVA. One patient with one mutant 2168A>G allele had EVA. CT scan results of 3 patients carrying heterozygous IVS7-2A>G, N392Y, and a polymorphism (L75L), respectively, were not available (Table 2). Temporal CT scan results were normal in the remaining patients. Testing of the two most frequent mutations, IVS7-2A>G and H723R, identified 89.74% of patients with EVA or inner ear malformation in this cohort.\n\n    Thyroid ultrasound was performed to determine the presence or absence of goiter. None of the patients with SLC26A4 mutations or variants showed the presence of goiter. Only 1 patient with EVA showed cystoid changes in the thyroid on ultrasound scan, whereas no changes were observed in thyroid hormone levels. Thyroid hormone assays showed that total T3 was slightly elevated in 2 patients, but this was of no clinical significance, according to endocrinologists from Chinese PLA General Hospital.\n\n    Sequence analysis of the GJB3 gene identified five heterozygous variants in 44 patients: 24_49ins26bp (GCCATGGACTGGAAGACACTCCAGGC), 87C>T (F29F), 250A>G (V84I), 357C>T (N119N), and 497A>G (N166S) (Table 3). Both 87C>T and 357C>T are silent variants. Two patients were heterozygous for 250A>G (V84I). To clarify the pathogenicity of the V84I variant, we performed a control study in a group of 200 individuals with normal hearing. The frequency of V84I in the deaf population was not significantly different from that in the controls, but it was shown to be a GJB3 polymorphism in the Chinese population. One patient was heterozygous for 497A>G, which results in replacement of asparagine with serine at position 166 of Cx31. The patient carrying N166S mutation in one allele carried GJB2 235delC mutation in the other allele. The 24_49ins26bp variant is a novel frameshift, which results in a premature stop codon and a truncated Cx31 protein. In addition, 24_49ins26bp and N166S were detected only in patients with hearing impairment and not in the controls, and they are very likely to be deleterious mutations. Only 2 patients with GJB3 mutation were found in this cohort.\n\n    Five types of GJB3 variant were detected in the control group: 357C>T (N119N), 87C>T (F29F), 327C>T (H109H), 250A>G (V84I), and 580G>A (A194T). One control subject was homozygous for 250A>G (V84I). 327C>T is a silent variant. The variant 580G>A was predicted to replace the hydrophobic alanine at position 194 of Cx31 with a hydrophilic threonine (A194T). This variant was first found in 2 patients from China with autosomal dominant hearing loss and was considered to be a genetic cause in these two cases. We regard A194T as an unclassified variant because it was not detected in any of our patients. Long-term follow-up is necessary in the 2 controls with A194T mutation to determine whether their hearing level will show any impairment in future.",
        "Conclusion": "    In this study, a total of 54.93% of Chinese patients with hearing impairment showed evidence of genetic involvement either based on genetic screening or family history, and 18.31%, 13.73%, and 1.76% of the patients were determined to have inherited hearing impairment caused by GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 1555A>G mutations. Mutations in GJB3, GJB6, and mtDNA tRNAser(UCN) are not common. Screening for GJB2, SLC26A4, and 12S rRNA should be considered the first step in genetic testing of deaf Chinese patients. Furthermore, the molecular defects of about 66% of the patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment in China remain to be identified.",
        "Discussion": "    Previous reports suggested that the prevalence of GJB2 mutations varies among different ethnic groups. The most common mutation in Caucasians, 35delG, was not found in our patients. Instead, 235delC accounted for 71.64% of GJB2 mutant alleles in our cohort. This is mutation is detected at the highest rates among Asian populations, with incidences of approximately 41% and 57% in two Japanese reports, 67% in one Taiwanese study, and 73% in one Korean study. The Chinese population is made up of six major ethnicities: Han, Man, Mon, Hui, Zhuang, and Miao. The majority are Han (91.6%), and this was also the predominant ethnicity in the study population (85.56%). No significant differences in GJB2 mutation spectra were found among different ethnicities in the Chinese population, although the numbers in the non-Han populations were too small to allow final conclusions to be reached in our study.\n\n    The missense mutation T86R was found in 1 patient who was also compound heterozygous for 235delC mutation. Although this mutation is not listed in the GJB2 mutation database website , it had been reported in 3 Japanese patients. The 15-year-old Chinese female patient with R75W mutation developed thickening and peeling of the skin at medial and lateral sides of both hands and feet at 1 year of age. Pure-tone audiometry testing showed that her father had moderate high-frequency hearing loss, whereas her mother had normal hearing. Her father and mother did not have similar skin problems. GJB2 sequencing indicated that neither of her parents carried the R75W mutation. Therefore, R75W was a de novo mutation in this subject. This mutation has been reported previously in association with autosomal dominant deafness and palmoplantar keratoderma. Three missense variants, V63L, V153A, and V198M, likely contribute to the pathogenesis of deafness, because they were detected only in the patient group and not in the control group, and they are evolutionarily conserved in Xenopus, mouse, rat, sheep, orangutan, and human. These mutations were heterozygous in 4 unrelated patients who carried only one mutant allele. It is not clear if they represent autosomal dominant mutations or are autosomal recessive with an as-yet unidentified second mutant allele in either the same gene (deep in introns or untranslated regions) or in different genes (digenic synergistic heterozygous mutations). Alternatively, these patients may simply be coincidental carriers whose deafness is caused by non-genetic environmental factors.\n\n    In our study population, 51 patients had two confirmed pathogenic mutations, plus the patient carrying the dominant R75W, and deafness in 18.31% (52/284) of our patients was due to mutations in GJB2. The percentage of GJB2-related hearing loss in other studies was 5.9-7% in Taiwan, 4.8% in Korea, 10.3% in the US, 13.5% in Australia, and 14.3% in Germany. A significant proportion of patients with GJB2 mutations had only one mutant allele. Carriers of a single mutation in the GJB2 gene show evidence of reduced hair cell function. Thus, it is possible that these carriers are more likely than are non-carriers to develop hearing impairment in the presence of other genetic defects or environmental factors. In addition to the common GJB6 309-kb deletion, GJB2 IVS1+1G>A is another mutant DFNB1 allele. Toth et al. reported that 23.4% of Hungarian GJB2-heterozygous patients carried the splice-site mutation IVS1+1G>A in the 5'UTR region of GJB2 . In addition, GJB2 mutations may act synergistically in the presence of mtDNA 1555A>G mutation with aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. Deletions in the GJB6 gene, the IVS1+1G>A mutation, or variants in exon1 and the basal promoter of GJB2 were not detected in any of the patients in the present study.\n\n    SLC26A4 gene mutations were detected in nearly 20% of our nonsyndromic hearing impairment patients, with IVS7-2A>G being the most prevalent mutation. About 14% (39/284) of our cases were due to mutations in SLC26A4. The SLC26A4 gene is another common gene involved in deafness in typical areas in China. To identify Pendred syndrome in the EVA patients, we performed thyroid hormone testing and ultrasound scan of the thyroid to examine the function and structure of the thyroid instead of perchlorate discharge testing, a routine method used for examining thyroid function that is not available in most areas of China. Our results indicated that none of patients had Pendred syndrome. The discrepancy between our results and those of previous studies may be explained by differences in testing methods used; the age of the patients, as those undergoing thyroid ultrasound and thyroid hormone assays in this study (3 to 20, average 12.3 +- 2.7) may have been too young to show symptoms; and/or phenotypic diversity due to differences in genetic background.\n\n    It is interesting to note that the 10 patients with inner ear malformation carried one missense mutation only. Whether the missense mutation causes a dominant negative effect and/or specifies a different phenotype is not clear. It is possible that the second mutant allele has not yet been identified due to the location of mutations deep in introns or promoter regions that were not sequenced, intragenic exon deletions, or the involvement of mutations in genes other than SLC26A4 in the pathogenesis (i.e., digenic synergistic mutations).\n\n    The SLC26A4 mutation spectrum in typical areas in China is similar to that reported in the overall Chinese population but different from that in Japan. Research findings indicate a gradient shift of the most prevalent mutation from IVS7-2A>G to H723R from Chinese to Japanese, respectively, with both mutations being equally prevalent in the Korean population. This observation suggests that IVS7-2A>G and H723R mutations may be ancient mutations in China and Japan, respectively. A recent study by Albert et al. of 100 unrelated patients with EVA in European Caucasian subjects revealed a diverse mutation spectrum without prevalent mutations, and only 40 patients carried SLC26A4 mutations. It is not clear why the mutations in SLC26A4 account for a much lower percentage of patients with EVA in Caucasian populations. Presumably, other genetic factors and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of EVA in Caucasian populations.\n\n    We found no significant differences in the spectrum or prevalence of GJB2 and SLC26A4 between patients from Chifeng City and those from Nantong City.\n\n    All 5 patients with 1555A>G mutation in the present study had a history of aminoglycoside use. Pedigree analysis showed maternally inherited traits, and these patients were diagnosed as having aminoglycoside-induced nonsyndromic hearing loss. We investigated the clinical and molecular characteristics of three of the four mtDNA 1095T>C pedigrees. The extremely low penetrance of hearing loss in the Chinese families carrying the 1095T>C mutation strongly suggested that the 1095T>C mutation itself is not sufficient to produce the clinical phenotype. Therefore, other modifiers, including aminoglycosides, nuclear genes, and mitochondrial haplotypes, are necessary for the phenotypic manifestation of the 1095T>C mutation. Despite the presence of several highly evolutionarily conserved variants in protein-coding genes and the 16S rRNA gene, the extremely low penetrance of hearing loss with the 1095T>C mutation implies that the mitochondrial variants may not have a modifying role in phenotypic expression of the 1095T>C mutation in these Chinese families. However, the history of exposure to aminoglycosides in these 3 hearing-impaired subjects suggested that these agents were probably the cause of hearing loss. Two controls were also found to carry the 1095T>C mutation; they were advised to avoid use of aminoglycosides, and their hearing level is being followed closely.\n\n    The 7444G>A substitution has been described in deaf individuals with and without the 1555A>G mutation, but its pathogenicity has not been established. Yao et al. considered 7444G>A to be a normal polymorphism. The patient with mtDNA 7444G>A mutation, who began suffering bilateral hearing impairment within 3 months after administration of streptomycin, had no relevant family history. We performed PCR amplification of fragments spanning the entire mitochondrial genome, and subsequent DNA sequence analysis in this patient revealed no variants in evolutionarily conserved regions in the mitochondrial genome. The molecular etiology of the patient carrying 7444G>A mutation remains to be identified.\n\n    Richard et al. identified three mutations in the Connexin31 gene (GJB3) in four families with erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV). Independently, Xia et al. reported cloning of the human GJB3 gene on chromosome 1p33-p35 and found mutations in two small families with deafness. The observation that some carriers of GJB3 mutations showed a normal phenotype challenges the involvement of these mutations in dominant deafness. GJB3 has been shown to be related to early-onset autosomal recessive deafness. In the present study, the patient carrying N166S mutation in one allele was verified to carry GJB2 235delC mutation in the other. Direct physical interaction of Cx26 with Cx31 is supported by data showing that Cx26 and Cx31 have overlapping expression patterns in the cochlea. In addition, we identified the presence of heteromeric Cx26/Cx31 connexons by coimmunoprecipitation of mouse cochlear membrane proteins. Furthermore, by cotransfection of mCherry-tagged Cx26 and GFP-tagged Cx31 into human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, we demonstrated that the two connexins were able to co-assemble in vitro in the same junction plaque. The above data indicate that a genetic interaction between GJB3 and GJB2 can lead to hearing loss. A diagnosis of digenic inherited GJB2 and GJB3 hearing loss was made in this patient. The frameshift mutation 24_49ins26bp (GCCATGGACTGGAAGACACTCCAGGC) generates a putative truncated protein of only 18 amino acids. The patient carrying GJB3 24_49ins26bp in our cohort had congenital symmetric hearing loss with no relevant family history. The severity of her hearing impairment was profound. Unfortunately, blood samples from her parents were not available for analysis. If one of the parents with normal hearing carries this mutation, the patient may only be a carrier. Alternatively, if neither of the parents with normal hearing carries this mutation, the 24_49ins26bp mutation in the patient may have arisen de novo and may be the genetic cause or at least one of the factors responsible for her phenotype.\n\n    Taken together, approximately 47.89% (83 + 53/284) of patients with NSHI in typical Chinese areas had molecular defects in the GJB2 or SLC26A4 gene, whereas about 33.1% and 3.5% of European patients with NSHI carried mutations in GJB2 and SLC26A4, respectively, with a total of 36.6% in a patient cohort of 142 sib pairs. MtDNA 1555A>G mutation accounted for the etiology in 1.76% (5/284) of the patients with hearing loss. Ten patients with a family history of hearing loss showed mutations in GJB2, GJB3, GJB6, SLC26A4, mtDNA 12S rRNA, or mtDNA tRNAser(UCN) in our study population. The etiologies of these 10 patients are most likely genetic, although no mutations in common hearing loss genes were found. If the 4 patients with 1095T>C in mtDNA 12SrRNA and 1 patient carrying GJB3 24_49ins26 were all included, hearing loss in 54.93% (156/284) of our Chinese patients was related to genetic factors.\n\n    This is the first comprehensive study of the molecular etiology of nonsyndromic hearing impairment in mainland China. GJB2 and SLC26A4 are the two most common etiologies for deafness in the Chinese population. A preliminary investigation of the mutation spectrum and prevalence of GJB2 and SLC26A4 between typical areas from northern and southern China was performed in this study, and no significant differences were found.",

        "Title": "    Genetic mutations of GJB2 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA in nonsyndromic hearing loss in Jiangsu Province of China",
        "Abstract": "    Hearing loss is caused by several environmental and genetic factors and the proportion attributed to inherited causes is assumed at 50 ~ 60% . Mutations in GJB2 and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 12S rRNA are the most common molecular etiology for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL). The mutation spectra of these genes vary among different ethnic groups.\n\n    To add the molecular etiologic information of hearing loss in the Chinese population, a total of 658 unrelated patients with NSHL from Jiangsu Province of China were selected for mutational screening including GJB2 and mtDNA 12S rRNA genes using PCR and DNA sequencing technology. As for controls, 462 normal-hearing individuals were collected.\n\n    A total of 9 pathogenic mutations in the GJB2 and 7 pathogenic mutations in the 12S rRNA gene were identified. Of all patients, 70 had monoallelic GJB2 coding region mutation in the heterozygous state, 94 carried two confirmed pathogenic mutations including 79 homozygotes and 15 compound heterozygotes. The 235delC appears to be the most common deafness-causing GJB2 mutation (102/658, 15.50% ). No mutations or variants in the GJB2 exon1 and basal promoter region were found. In these patients, 4 subjects carried the m.1494C > T mutation (0.61% ) and 39 subjects harbored the m.1555A > G mutation (5.93% ) in mtDNA 12S rRNA gene. A novel sequence variant at m.1222A > G in the 12S rRNA gene was identified, which could alter the secondary structure of the 12S rRNA.\n\n    The mutation spectrum and prevalence of GJB2 and mtDNA 12S rRNA genes in Jiangsu population are similar to other areas of China. There are in total 31.46% of the patients with NSHL carry deafness-causing mutation in GJB2 or mtDNA 12S rRNA genes. Mutation in GJB2 gene is the most common factor, mtDNA 12S rRNA also plays an important part in the pathogenesis of hearing loss in Jiangsu Province areas. The m.1222A > G was found to be a new candidate mutation associated with hearing loss. Our results indicated the necessity of genetic screening for mutations of these genes in Jiangsu patients with NSHL.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing loss is caused by several environmental and genetic factors, and the proportion attributed to inherited causes is assumed at 50-60%. About 70% of which are nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) since hearing loss is the only symptom. Genetic hearing loss of nonsyndromic form can follow a pattern of autosomal dominant (DFNA), autosomal recessive (DFNB), or X-linked recessive, and mitochondrial inheritance.\n\n    To date, there are 134 genetic loci and 80 different genes that have been described for NSHL in human. It is believed that alterations in several members of the connexin protein family and mtDNA 12S rRNA contribute to the development of the majority of genetic hearing losses, in which connexin 26 (GJB2) gene mutations are particularly an important cause of NSHL and mainly linked to pattern of autosomal recessive, and the single-nucleotide alteration mtDNA m.1555A > G has been identified as a major cause of aminoglycoside-induced NSHL.\n\n    It is estimated that there are approximately 20 million babies born every year in China, of whom about 30,000 are expected to have congenital hearing loss. Carrier frequencies of some mutational hot spots associated with NSHL from different areas and ethnic backgrounds have been reported, but the molecular etiology of NSHL in the Chinese Jiangsu Province population has not been investigated systematically. To further extend the epidemiological data of common gene mutations in Chinese population, we screened the GJB2 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA genes to determine the etiology of hearing loss in Jiangsu Province.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 658 unrelated hearing loss subjects from 6 typical cities of Jiangsu Province, China were collected. All the individuals were recruited to participate in this study by signing a written informed consent as approved by the Ethical Committee of Nanjing Medical University for Human Studies, and to donate a peripheral blood sample. The protocol was reviewed and genetic studies were conducted on two groups: a case group with moderate to profound and NSHL (n = 658) aged 2-45 (11.3 +- 2.6) years, and a control group (n = 462) with normal hearing aged 8-34 (11.5 +- 2.9) years. The female-male ratio of these groups are 344/314 and 235/227, respectively. The blood samples of 658 cases were obtained from a panel of sporadic hearing loss individuals collected in the Otological Clinics between January 2008 and July 2012, and the 462 control blood samples were gotten from a panel of unaffected individuals in Jiangsu province. All subjects were Han Chinese in origin, and were evaluated through otological examination and audiological evaluations including pure-tone audiometry (Madsen Orbiter 922), immittance (Madsen Zodiac 901), auditory brainstem response (ABR) (Interacoustic EP25), and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (Madsen Celesta 503). Hearing loss is defined by the level of hearing loss in the better ear for pure-tone threshold average in the speech frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 k HZ. Hearing loss of 26-40 dB was considered mild; 41-60 dB, moderate; 61-80 dB, severe, and more than 80 dB, profound.\n\n    The mutations on the GJB2 and mtDNA 12S rRNA genes were selected for molecular analysis in all 658 NSHL cases and 462 normal controls. The genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of all participants using Puregene DNA Isolation Kits (Watson Biotechnologies Inc, Shanghai China). The quality and quantity of purified genomic DNA were determined by gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose) and spectrophotometry.\n\n    The coding exon (exon 2) and flanking intronic regions of GJB2 gene were amplified by PCR using primers F (5'TTGGTGTTTGCTCAGGAAGA3') and R (5' GGCCTACAGGGGTTT CAAAT 3'). The GJB2 exon 1, its flanking donor splice site and the GJB2 basal promoter were amplified with the primers F (5' TGGGGGCACTTGGGGAACTCA 3') and R (5' GCAGAAACGCCCGCTCCAGAA 3'). DNA fragments of subjects spanning the mtDNA 12S rRNA gene were also amplified by PCR with primers: P1 F (5' CTCCTCAAAGCAATACACTG 3') and R (5' TGCTAAATCCACCTTCGACC 3'); P2 F (5' CGATCAACCTCACCACCTCT 3') and R (5' TGGACAACCAGCTATCACCA 3').\n\n    All the PCR products were purified on QIA-quick spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subjected to direct sequencing by BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (version v.3.1) and ABI genetic analyzer 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) attached Sequencing Analysis software (version 3.7). The resultant sequence data of GJB2 gene were compared with the reference sequence of wild type GJB2 (GenBank No. NG_008358.1) and the genotypes of GJB2 gene in all subjects were subsequently analyzed. PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) and SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/) were used to predict the effect of previously reported and novel missense changes on protein function. The sequencing data of mtDNA 12S rRNA gene were compared with the updated consensus Cambridge reference sequence (GenBank No. AC_000021.2) to identify mtDNA variants. The uniqueness of each mutation was evaluated by comparison with the MITOMAP, and the Uppsala mtDB database.\n\n    A total of 22 primates' mtDNA 12S rRNA sequences were selected to analyze the interspecific difference by ClustalW. The additional file lists the mammalian species and the accession numbers of the mtDNA 12S rRNA (Additional file 1: Table S1). The conservation index (CI) was calculated by comparing the human nucleotide variants with other 21 primates. The CI was then defined as the amount of species from the list of 22 different primates that have the wild-type nucleotide at that position.\n\n    Pathogenicity of the novel variants was also evaluated by predicting the secondary structures of human mtDNA 12S rRNA transcripts with or without the variant using the RNAdraw program (RNAdraw V1.1, http://www.rnadraw.com).",
        "Results": "    As shown in Table 1, there were totally fifteen kinds of different GJB2 variations detected in the patients and controls. Among these, one variant c.257C > G (T86R) in coding region was novel pathogenic mutation that was identified in two deaf siblings compound with c.605ins46 mutation in the exon 2. The two siblings came from a Chinese Han family and suffered from prelingual and nonsyndromic hearing loss. The c.257C > G (T86R) mutation was also predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. Eight variants including c.35delG, c.109G > A, c.176del16, c.235delC, c.299delAT, c.504insGCAA, c.605ins46 and c.608TC > AA were pathological mutations that has been reported previously. Four nucleotide changes containing c.79G > A, c.101 T > C, c.341A > G and c.608 T > C were polymorphisms. The category of two nucleotide changes (c.368C > A, c.571 T > C) was unknown (http://davinci.crg.es/deafness/).\n\n    The carrier frequencies of deafness-causing GJB2 mutations in our case group were 0.30% for c.35delG, 2.28% for c.109G > A, 3.19% for c.176del16, 15.50% for c.235delC, 4.71% for c.299delAT, 0.30% for c.504insGCAA, 0.30% for c.605ins46 and 0.30% for c.608TC > AA, respectively. Thus, the total carrier frequency of pathogenic GJB2 mutations in the case group was 24.92% (164/658). The 235delC appeared to be the most common deafness-causing GJB2 mutation (102/658, 15.50% ) with the highest allele frequency. While in the control group, only eleven subjects were detected to carry the heterozygous deafness-causing mutations.\n\n    The detailed genotypes of the patients and controls were summarized as Table 2. Of all patients, 70 had monoallelic GJB2 coding region mutations in the heterozygous state, 94 carried two confirmed pathogenic mutations including 79 homozygotes and 15 compound heterozygotes. The genotypes-phenotypes correlations of GJB2 gene mutations in 658 patients were shown in Table 3. In the control group, we detected three c.109G > A, two c.176del16, three c.235delC and two c.299delAT heterozygotes, representing 2.38% of all normal hearing individuals, which coincided with previous study in different control cohorts. No mutations or variants in the GJB2 exon1 and basal promoter region were found in both the case and control groups.\n\n    The two DNA fragments spanning the entire coding region of the 12S rRNA gene were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of all subjects, and each fragment was purified and subsequently analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. The sequencing results were compared with the updated Cambridge consensus sequence. As shown in Table 4, there were totally 30 kinds of nucleotide changes identified in the 12S rRNA gene. All the nucleotide changes were verified by sequence analysis of both strands and appeared to be homoplasmy. Among these, four subjects with severe or profound hearing loss carried the m.1494C > T mutation. Three of them had a history of exposure to aminoglycosides before deafness. Thirty-nine patients harbored the m.1555A > G mutation. These translate to a frequency of 5.93% and 0.61% for the m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations in deafness population of Jiangsu Province, respectively. Meanwhile, 6 subjects harbored the known deafness-associated m.1095 T > C mutation and 18 subjects carried the putative pathogenic mutations at position of 961 (m.961insC, m. 961delT and m.961 T > C).\n\n    A novel sequence variant, m.1222A > G in the 12S rRNA gene, was identified in one patient with profound hearing loss. This variant was not found in 462 controls. Furthermore, we used RNAdraw software to analyze the secondary structure of 12S rRNA to localize m.1222A > G variant with either a stem or a loop and to analyze if the base changes within stems alter. As shown in Figure 1, the secondary structure of the 12S rRNA m.1222A > G variant predicted by RNAdraw indicated that the m.1222A > G induced a marked structural alteration in the transcript.\n\n    In addition, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the human 12S rRNA nucleotide variants with other 21 primates. As shown in Table 4, conservation index (CI) among the variants ranged from 13.6% (m.1009C > T variant) to 100% (m.750A > G, m.752C > T, m.1095 T > C, m.1222A > G, m.1438A > G and m.1598G > A variants). Of 30 variants, 15 had a CI more than 78% , 8 had a CI between 78% and 50% , and the remaining had CIs below 50% . In addition to the m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations, the m.789 T > C and m.1222A > G variants, which were absent in the 462 controls and whose CIs were above 78% , were the putative deafness-associated variants. In contrast, other 9 variants including m.663A > G, m.681 T > C, m.750A > G, m.752C > T, m.827A > G, m.1107 T > C, m.1438A > G and m.1598G > A, which were present in both the case and control groups, appeared to be the polymorphisms even though they had CIs above 78%.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Hearing loss is the most common neurosensory disorder in humans. Approximately half of the cases have a genetic etiology with extraordinary genetic heterogeneity. For many populations, the most common cause for NSHL is mutated Connexin 26, a gap junction protein encoded by the GJB2 gene, which is expressed in the cochlea and may play a role in K+ circulation between different partitions in the cochlea. GJB2 gene is composed of 2 exons separated by an intron. Its coding region is entirely contained in exon 2. The basal promoter activity resides in the first 128 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start point (TSP) and has two GC boxes, at position 281 and 293 from the TSP, which is important for transcription. Previous reports have suggested that the mutation spectrum and prevalence of GJB2 vary significantly among different ethnic groups. GJB2 mutations with the c.35delG, c.167delT, c.235delC and c.427C > T alleles were responsible for a large proportion of NSHL in European, American, African and the Asian. In the Chinese populations, the 235delC is responsible for up to 21% of cases with NSHL.\n\n    Similar to other previous reports of China, our study showed that GJB2 mutations were an important cause of NSHL in Jiangsu deafness populations, and the most common GJB2 mutation detected in our study group was the c.235delC (102/658; 15.50% ). While the c.35delG mutation, which is prevalent in the Caucasians and rarely found in Chinese populations, was identified only in 2 patients. The four most prevalent mutations: c.235delC, c.299delAT, c.176del16, and c.35delG, account for 23.70% (156/658) of all mutant GJB2 alleles identified in Jiangsu Province. However, no mutations were found in GJB2 basal promoter region and exon 1 or splice sites, which suggested extremely low detection rate of GJB2 basal promoter region and exon 1 or splice sites mutation in this area.\n\n    Through genotype analysis in 658 cases of unrelated NSHL of Jiangsu Province, GJB2 mutations were detected in 14.29% (94/658) of patients with biallelic mutation, and 10.64% (70/658) of patients with monoallelic mutation. The reason for the failure to detect a second mutant allele in the 70 cases in the present study claims further clarification.\n\n    One novel nucleotide alteration c.257C > G (T86R) in coding region of GJB2 gene were identified in two deaf siblings compound heterozygotes carrying c.605ins46 pathogenic mutation in the exon 2 of GJB2, this change has not been reported in Connexins and Deafness mutations database at http://davinci.crg.es/deafness/. The heterozygotes were detected from their hearing parents, the father carried c.257C > G (T86R) mutation, while the mother with c.605ins46 mutation, the opposite alleles of the parents were both wild-type.\n\n    Although the majority of cases with NSHL are caused by nuclear gene mutations, it has become clear that mtDNA mutations can also cause deafness. In familial cases of ototoxicity, aminoglycoside hypersensitivity is often maternally transmitted, suggesting that the mutation in mtDNA is the molecular basis for this susceptibility. In the human mtDNA genome, m.1555A > G is the most common mutation in the gene. The 12S rRNA gene was proposed to be the primary targeting site for aminoglycosides. The identified nonsyndromic deafness-causing mtDNA mutations include m.1555A > G, m.1494C > T, m.1095 T > C and mutations at position 961 in the 12S rRNA gene. Currently, it is estimated that these mutations are present in about 3.10% of patients with NSHL, but it is expected that this number will increase as genetic testing becomes more readily available. In this study, 658 patients and all controls were screened for mtDNA 12S rRNA gene by PCR and DNA direct sequencing. We detected 30 variants in 12S rRNA gene. Among these, 39 patients carried the mtDNA 12S rRNA m.1555A > G mutation (5.93% ), which coincided with the previous report. Four patients carried m.1494C > T mutation, 6 patients carried m.1095 T > C mutation, and 18 patients possess mutations at 961 position. A novel sequence variant, m.1222A > G in the 12S rRNA gene, was identified in one patient with profound hearing loss. Comparison of the variant frequencies in controls, assessment of nucleotide conservation among mammalian species, and structural analysis of the transcript were used to analyze the m.1222A > G mutation associated with hearing loss. To our knowledge, the homoplasmic m.1222A > G variant in 12S rRNA gene has not been reported to date. Conservation of the nucleotide among 22 primates and alteration of the predicted secondary structure of the 12S rRNA transcript suggest that the m.1222A > G variant might affect auditory function by changing the function of the 12S rRNA.\n\n    Similar to that of the GJB2 gene mutations, the association between mtDNA mutations and hearing loss has also a special ethnic and regional difference. In the NSHL cases of Jiangsu population, the incidence of the mtDNA mutation including m.1555A > G, m.1494C > T, m.1095 T > C and mutations at position 961 in the 12S rRNA gene appears to coincide with other populations as previous reports.\n\n    In summary, the results of our study indicate that the mutation spectrum and prevalence of GJB2 and mtDNA 12S rRNA genes in Jiangsu patients with hearing loss is similar to other areas of China. There are in total 31.46% of patients with NSHL carry deafness-causing mutations in GJB2 or mtDNA 12S rRNA gene. Mutation in GJB2 gene was the most common factor, mtDNA 12S rRNA also play an important part in the pathogenesis of hearing loss in Jiangsu Province areas. These results indicate the necessity of genetic screening for mutations of these genes in Jiangsu patients with NSHL.",

        "Title": "    Developing regional genetic counseling for southern Chinese with nonsyndromic hearing impairment: a unique mutational spectrum",
        "Abstract": "    Racial and regional factors are important for the clinical diagnosis of non-syndromic hearing impairment. Comprehensive genetic analysis of deaf patients in different regions of China must be performed to provide effective genetic counseling. To evaluate the mutational spectrum of south Chinese families, we performed genetic analysis for non-syndromic hearing impairment in this population.\n\n    Complete clinical evaluations were performed on 701 unrelated patients with non-syndromic hearing impairment from six provinces in south China. Each subject was screened for common mutations, including SLC26A4 c.IVS7-2A > G, c.2168A > G; mitochondrial DNA m.1555A > G, m.1494C > T, m.7444G > A, m.7445A > G; GJB3 c.538C > T, c.547G > A; and WFS1 c.1901A > C, using pyrosequencing. GJB2 and SLC26A4 coding region mutation detection were performed using Sanger sequencing.\n\n    Genetic analysis revealed that among the etiology of non-syndromic hearing impairment, GJB2, SLC26A4, and mitochondrial m.1555A > G mutations accounted for 18.0%, 13.1%, and 0.9%, respectively. Common mutations included GJB2 c.235delC, c.109G > A, SLC26A4 c.IVS7-2A > G, c.1229 T > C, and mitochondrial m.1555A > G. The total mutation rate was 45.1% in all patients examined in south China. Overall, the clear contribution of GJB2, SLC26A4, and mitochondrial m.1555A > G to the etiology of the non-syndromic deafness population in south China was 32.0%.\n\n    Our study is the first genetic analysis of non-syndromic hearing impairment in south China, and revealed that a clear genetic etiology accounted for 32.0% of non-syndromic hearing cases in patients from these regions. The mutational spectrum of non-syndromic hearing impairment in the south Chinese population provides useful and targeted information to aid in genetic counseling.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary deafness is a genetically heterogeneous disease with an incidence rate of approximately 1/1000. Non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) accounts for 60-70% of inherited hearing impairments. Among the plethora of deafness genes discovered in the past decade, certain genes are more important than others from an epidemiologic perspective. Mutations in GJB2, SLC26A4, and the mitochondrial 12SrRNA gene have been shown to have a high prevalence in NSHI.\n\n    China is a multiethnic, large country with a population of at least 1.6 billion, which encompasses 9.6 million square kilometers. Moreover, there are 27.80 million Chinese people with hearing and speech disabilities; of these, 20.04 million have a simple hearing disability. Although a few genetic studies have been conducted on Chinese patients with deafness, the large deafness population and racial differences demand regional and individual genetic analysis; such data cannot be simply inferred from other groups' conclusions. For example, in typical areas of China (Chifeng City in Inner Mongolia and Nangtong City in JiangSu Province), GJB2 gene mutations account for the etiology of approximately 18.31% of patients with hearing loss, SLC26A4 mutations account for approximately 13.73%, and the mitochondrial m.1555A > G mutation accounts for 1.76%. However, common molecular etiologies are rare in non-syndromic Tibetan Chinese patients with hearing impairment. No homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation of the GJB2 or SLC26A4 gene was found, and the mitochondrial m.1555A > G homogeneous mutation were responsible for hearing loss in 1.75% of 114 Tibetan patients.\n\n    Genetic counseling for deafness should fully take into account the differences in regional backgrounds. Therefore, the establishment of a specific mutational database for different regional populations is indispensable. Although there are northern, central region, Xinjiang, Yunnan and Tibet Chinese, the mutation spectrum of NSHI in patients from south China has not been examined (Figure 1). To extend the epidemiological data on common gene mutations in the Chinese population and to provide appropriate genetic testing and counseling for patients with NSHI in south China, we conducted a genetic analysis in this population.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 701 unrelated sporadic or familial cases of NSHI were recruited from six provinces in south China, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hai'nan, Hu'nan, Fujian and Jiangxi (Figure 1). Each patient underwent a complete medical history and physical examination to exclude the possibility of non-genetic causes or any syndromic findings. An age-appropriate audiological examination was performed, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and/or auditory brainstem response (ABR), auditory steady state response (ASSR), immittance testing, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Temporal computed tomography (CT) examination was conducted in 664 patients. Among these patients, 134 patients were diagnosed as enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and 530 patients had normal CT appearance. The rest 37 patients or their guardians refused to receive temporal CT examination. For control purposes, the study included 180 age-matched individuals with normal hearing. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their guardians.\n\n    Blood samples were collected from the subjects, and DNA isolation was performed using a standard chloroform extraction method. Targeted sequences were then amplified by PCR. The coding exon (Exon 2) and flanking intronic regions of GJB2 gene were PCR amplified with forward primer 5'TTGGTGTTTGCTCAGGAAGA 3' and reverse primer 5'GGCCTACAGGGGTTTCAAAT 3'. Patients with monoallelic GJB2 coding region mutations were additionally tested for GJB2 c.IVS1 + 1G > A mutation or defects in GJB2 exon 1 and its basal promoter.\n\n    Pyrosequencing was then utilized to detect SLC26A4 c.IVS7-2A > G, c.2168A > G; mitochondrial m.1555A > G, m.1494C > T, m.7444G > A, m.7445A > G; GJB3 c.538C > T, c.547G > A, and WFS1 c.1901A > C in each subject. The biotinylated PCR primers were designed according to the Pyrosequencing Assay Design Software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Detailed procedures have been provided by the manufacturer and previous study. Briefly, bound biotinylated single-stranded DNA was generated using PSQ 96 Sample Preparation Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After template preparation for pyrosequencing, an automated Pyrosequencing instrument, PSQ96 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), was used to perform genotyping. The resulting sequences were analyzed manually by visual inspection of each pyrogram, automatically by the SNP evaluation software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), or by both approaches.\n\n    Furthermore, 21 exons and flanking sequences from the SLC26A4 gene were directly sequenced using an ABI 3730 Genetic Sequencer as previous study of patients with EVA. Sequences were aligned and compared with published sequences from the NCBI database (GJB2: NG_008358.1; SLC26A4: NG_008489.1).",
        "Results": "    We enrolled 701 unrelated patients (417 males and 284 females) diagnosed with NSHI from south China. The geographical distribution covered six provinces (Figure 1). Specifically, there were 238 cases from Guangdong, 92 cases from Jiangxi, 98 cases from Guangxi, 96 cases from Fujian, 98 cases from Hainan, and 79 cases from Hu'nan. The average patient age was 7.5 years (range: 11 months-47 years), and 97.3% of the patients were Han Chinese. Each individual demonstrated congenital hearing loss or postlingual bilateral deafness that ranged from mild to anacusis. The average onset age of patients with postlingual NSHI was 8.71 +- 7.24 years. No goiter was discovered.\n\n    GJB2 coding region sequencing identified ten known pathogenic mutations (c.11G > A, c.35delG, c.109G > A, c.176-191del16, c.235delC, c.257C > G, c.299-300delAT, c.427C > T, c.512insAACG, and c.605ins46), two unclassified variants (c.187G > T, c.368C > A), and five polymorphisms (c.79G > A, c.341A > G, c.186C > T, c.558G > A and c.608 T > C). All GJB2 mutations identified in this cohort were recessive. Dominant mutation was absent in this cohort.\n\n    In total, 126 patients (18.0%, 126/701) carried a homozygous or compound heterozygous GJB2 pathogenic mutation (Table 1). The mutation c.235delC is also the most prevalent among south Chinese; but c.109G > A is most frequent in south Chinese than in north Chinese. Another prevalent mutation, c.299-300delAT was less common, displaying a discrepant genetic spectrum in south Chinese. As to allele frequency, the c.235delC mutation was most commonly observed (46.8%, 118/252), followed by the c.109G > A (40.1%, 101/252) and c.299-300delAT mutations (4.76%, 12/252).\n\n    GJB2 mono-allelic mutations are shown in Table 2. These patients with were additionally tested for GJB2 c.IVS1 + 1G > A mutation or defects in GJB2 exon 1 and its basal promoter, however, no pathogenic mutation was identified. The proportion of c.109G > A heterozygosity was 10.7% in patients with NSHI compared to approximately 6.1% in 180 normal control samples. GJB3 or GJB6 coding region mutations were further examined in some of these patients and no pathogenic mutation was detected.\n\n    We identified 80 patients from 134 patients with EVA carrying at least one SLC26A4 c.IVS7-2A > G or c.2168A > G allele by pyrosequencing. In contrast, five c.IVS7-2A > G and three c.2168A > G heterozygous alleles were detected in 530 NSHI patients with normal temporal CT appearance. Another 37 patients without temporal CT examination were negative for c.IVS7-2A > G or c.2168A > G mutation. These results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. SLC26A4 exons sequencing further confirmed that 92 patients carried biallelic mutations and five patients exhibited mono-allelic mutations in the 134 patients with EVA. SLC26A4 accounts for approximately 13.1% (92/701) of the cases of NSHI in this population (Table 3), secondary to the contribution of GJB2.\n\n    SLC26A4 exon sequencing confirmed four polymorphisms (c.IVS10 + 27C > A, c.IVS11 + 47 T > C, c.IVS19-24 T > A, and c.IVS17-74G > A); 20 probable pathogenic mutations, including 18 known mutations (c.259G > T, c.413 T > A, c.589G > A, c.679G > C, c.754 T > C, c.IVS7-2A > G, c.1079C > T, c.1229C > T, c.1343C > T, c.1540C > T, c.1547insC, c.IVS14-2A > G, c.1691insA, c.1919G > A, c.1975G > C, c.2000 T > C, c.2086C > T and c.2168A > G) and two novel mutations (c.422 T > C, c.1369A > T). We identified that the c.IVS7-2A > G mutation was most prevalent (54.5%, 103/189), followed by c.1229C > T (11.1%, 21/189, Table 3).\n\n    Pyrosequencing identified an m.1555A > G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA of six patients (Figure 2), and four homoplasmy and two heteroplasmy mutations (the mutational threshold was 92% and 96%, respectively). In addition, a history of aminoglycoside exposure before the onset of deafness was confirmed in these six cases. Additional mutations, such as m.1494C > T, tRNAser(UCN) m.7444G > A, and m.7445A > G, were absent. Therefore, we failed to locate a common mitochondrial DNA mutation in this cohort (0.9%, 6/701).\n\n    In total, 701 patients lacked GJB3 c.538C > T, c.547G > A, and WFS1 c.1901A > C mutations, suggesting that these variants are rare in south Chinese. Moreover, 200 individuals were further examined for GJB3 and GJB6 coding region mutations, including del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) sequences; however, only two subjects were heterozygous for c.250G > A or c.580G > A mutations.\n\n    The total carrier mutation rate constituted approximately 45.1% in our patient cohort, with a clear genetic etiology in 32.0% of the patients with NSHI (Figure 3).",
        "Conclusion": "    We have conducted the first genetic analysis of NSHI in south China, and revealed that a clear genetic etiology accounted for 32.0% of cases. The NSHI mutational spectrum of the south Chinese population provides useful and important information for genetic counseling.",
        "Discussion": "    Based on a relatively large cohort, the present study analyzed the mutational spectrum of NSHI in the population of south China for the first time. It has been established that the common deafness mutations for the Chinese population are GJB2 c.235delC, c.299-300delAT, c.176-191del16, c.35delG; GJB3 c.538C > T; SLC26A4 c.IVS7-2A > G, c.2168A > G; and mitochondrial m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T, whereas the major mutations in the south Chinese population consist of GJB2 c.235delC, c.109G > A, c.299-300delAT, c.176-191del16; SLC26A4 c.IVS7-2A > G and c.1229 T > C; and mitochondrial m.1555A > G. GJB2 exon sequencing is recommended for each individual because it is simple, cheap (25 RMB per sample), and can provide more information (18%) than gene chips. SLC26A4 exons sequencing is suggested for patients with EVA. An extended and systematic study of the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence may provide significant further information for assessment of patients with NSHI.\n\n    China consists of 56 ethnic countries that comprise a population of over 1.6 billion. Given the heterogeneity of genetic deafness, ethnic and regional specific factors are important. Although genetic analysis of patients from the northern, central, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Tibet areas of China have been reported, the mutational spectrum of NSHI in south China - consisting of the Guangdong province and the surrounding areas - remained unclear. A genetic study of the south China population may provide regional-specific mutational information to improve the efficacy of clinical genetic counseling. Therefore, the present results provide useful information for clinical application of mutant gene detection in patients with deafness.\n\n    GJB2 gene mutations are diverse in different ethnic regions (between 10-48.1%). The hereditary deafness website (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org) lists at least 111 GJB2 mutations. The c.35delG mutation is most prevalent in Europe and the United States, compared with c.235delC in East Asian populations and c.167delT in Jewish populations. We observed a GJB2 mutation distribution of approximately 20% that was responsible for NSHI in south China. The GJB2 mutation rate in south China was identical to that of central and northern China. The c.109G > A mutation was very common, although its pathogenicity remains controversial. A study indicated that the c.109G > A mutation had an allelic frequency of 6.7% (185/2744) in a Han patient group (excluding all cases with two clearly pathogenic mutations); this rate was significantly higher than the control population (2.8%, 17/602; P =0.0003). These results support the conclusion that GJB2 c.109G > A should be reassigned to a pathogenic mutation. Our cell-based in vitro functional assays study also indicated that c.109G > A homozygote could impair connexin26 gap junctional coupling and should be assigned to pathogenic mutation (unpublished data). In addition, there is a lack of genetic information for the GJB2 mono-allelic mutation, which makes genetic counseling for these patients more difficult. The frequency of c.109G > A in control group is relatively high (6.1%) in our cohort. This may partially be attributed to the small sample sizes and/or selection bias; However, this frequency might reflect the prevalence of c.109G > A in this cohort and c.109G > A might be ascribed to founder effect in south Chinese. Further population-based and functional studies are recommended.\n\n    SLC26A4 mutations in Western countries and Asian populations show regional and ethnic diversity in their frequency and display mutational hot spots. For example, SLC26A4 mutations account for approximately 4% of NSHI in the Caucasian population. Evaluation of previous Chinese domestic studies indicates that the incidence of the SLC26A4 mutation may be between 12-14% in patients with NSHI. Our finding (13.1%) is consistent with these results, illuminating the feasibility of the SLC26A4 detection strategy inferred from north China. The c.IVS7-2A > G mutation is common in Eastern Asia. Several large cohort investigations have reported a high prevalence of c.IVS7-2A > G in the Chinese population (22.3-64.63%). In Koreans, the c.IVS7-2A > G mutation accounts for 20% of mutant SLC26A4 alleles and is the second most prevalent genetic variant. The c.IVS7-2A > G mutation has a low incidence of approximately 3% in Japanese individuals. The distribution of mutant SLC26A4 alleles revealed by our study suggests that mutation screening of four exons (exons 19, 10, 17 and 15) following c.IVS7-2A > G identification should be a priority for NSHI genetic testing in patients with EVA. Besides, previous studies have revealed the close relationship between SLC26A4 mutations and EVA. The absence of SLC26A4 mutation in 37 patients without temporal CT in our cohort could preliminarily exclude the possibility of EVA in these patients.\n\n    Mitochondrial m.1555A > G mutation was detected at a lower rate in southern China compared with previous reports. The m.1555A > G mutation is observed in approximately 0.6-2.5% of Caucasian patients with NSHI, but more frequently in the Asian population, including China 2.9%, Japan 3%, and Indonesia 5.3%. The tRNAser(UCN) m.7445A > G and m.7444G > A mitochondrial mutations may be involved in clinical phenotype modifications. However, we failed to detect tRNAser(UCN) m.7445A > G and m.7444G > A mutations; therefore, they may be rare in the south China population.\n\n    Previous studies have found that digenic inheritance of NSHI is caused by mutations in the GJB2 and GJB3 genes. However, we observed that both GJB3 and GJB6 exhibited a low mutation rate. In the present study, 701 cases lacked the c.538C > T or c.547G > A mutations in GJB3. Additional screening of 200 subjects for mutations in the GJB3 and GJB6 coding regions did not identify any pathogenic mutations. Meanwhile, lack of WFS1 c.1901A > C, a rare low-frequency mutation, excludes the necessity of routine screening for this allele. Therefore, our preliminary results indicate that the GJB3, GJB6, and WFS1 c.1901A > C common gene mutations may be minor in NSHI and are not recommended as alleles for first-line screening.\n\n    Individualized genetic screening in south China may improve the NSHI diagnostic efficiency and positivity rate, to avoid unnecessary waste of economic and human resources. Therefore, larger epidemiological studies of the genetic etiology of NSHI are recommended due to the sample size limitations of the present study. New genetic technology, such as targeted exon sequencing, may shed further light on the genetic components of NSHI in patients that lack common gene mutations.",

        "Title": "    Hints for Genetic and Clinical Differentiation of Adult-Onset Monogenic Autoinflammatory Diseases",
        "Abstract": "    Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (mAIDs) are inherited errors of innate immunity characterized by systemic inflammation recurring with variable frequency and involving the skin, serosal membranes, synovial membranes, joints, the gastrointestinal tube, and/or the central nervous system, with reactive amyloidosis as a potential severe long-term consequence. Although individually uncommon, all mAIDs set up an emerging chapter of internal medicine: recent findings have modified our knowledge regarding mAID pathophysiology and clarified that protean inflammatory symptoms can be variably associated with periodic fevers, depicting multiple specific conditions which usually start in childhood, such as familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and mevalonate kinase deficiency. There are no evidence-based studies to establish which potential genotype analysis is the most appropriate in adult patients with clinical phenotypes suggestive of mAIDs. This review discusses genetic and clinical hints for an ideal diagnostic approach to mAIDs in adult patients, as their early identification is essential to prompt effective treatment and improve quality of life, and also highlights the most recent developments in the diagnostic work-up for the most frequent hereditary periodic febrile syndromes worldwide.",
        "Introduction": "    Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (mAIDs) are clinical entities characterized by recurrent inflammatory attacks occurring without any evidence of infections, neoplasms, or deregulation of the adaptive immune system. This expanding family of diseases is actually known to be caused by mutations in genes involved in the regulation of innate immunity, inflammation, and cell death, including first-line responses to infectious agents and different tissue injuries. Mutations in the MEFV gene were firstly identified for patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in 1997. Few years later, the genetic basis of three other mAIDs was detected through candidate gene approach, linkage analysis, and/or homozygosity mapping. Familial Hibernian fever, commonly known as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), was found to be caused by mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene. In 1999, Drenth et al. identified mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase (MVK), the key enzyme in isoprenoid and sterol synthesis, which is involved in the pathogenesis of mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS). Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene (also known as CIAS1) were associated with the disease spectrum of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) in 2001.\n\n    Over the last 20 years, the identification of new putative genes following the extensive use of next-generation sequencing technologies and the remarkable progress of molecular techniques have deepened our knowledge about the pathogenesis of mAIDs, providing novel insights of mechanisms involved in innate immunity regulation. In addition, the discovery of gene modifiers and somatic mosaicisms as well as a better comprehension of the role of epigenetic factors have clarified some aspects of the wide phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders.\n\n    Although recurrent high-grade fever represents a common ground for most mAIDs, the clinical presentation may be variable, being all organs and tissues potentially targeted by inflammation. Moreover, atypical or oligosymptomatic presentations are not rare, especially in patients with adult-onset disease. In this regard, recent studies have proved that mAIDs may start off not only in the pediatric age but also during adulthood. A delayed onset of mAIDs is often due to low-penetrance mutations which may be sometimes identified even in healthy carriers. For these reasons, early identification of probands, correct interpretation of low-penetrance mutations, and prevention of overdiagnosis and overtreatment can be challenging. New evidence-based classification criteria for hereditary recurrent febrile syndromes have been recently developed on the basis of international expert consensus and evaluated in a large cohort of patients from the Eurofever registry in 2019 with the aim of recruiting patients for translational and clinical studies, and not misused as diagnostic criteria.\n\n    This review is aimed at describing genetic and clinical clues of the four historical mAIDs in order to suggest an empirical flow chart for diagnosis. Single organ involvement and systemic features will be examined, with particular attention to differential diagnosis with multifactorial AIDs. In addition, the description of the most frequently identified mutations and an overview of genetic data will be provided to facilitate physicians unravel among pathogenic variants, polymorphisms and mosaicisms for genes related to mAIDs. Genetic and clinical features of the four historical mAIDs are summarized in the Table 1.\n\n    An extensive literature search in the Medline database (via Pubmed) was performed up to May 2019. We searched for studies through the following words: \"monogenic autoinflammatory disease\", \"familial Mediterranean fever\", \"mevalonate kinase deficiency\", \"tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome\", \"cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome\", and their synonyms. Papers published in English language over the last ten years were screened for eligibility, based on title, abstract, and keywords. Papers were included if clinical clues to the diagnosis of the four mAIDs, both in children and in adults, were reported. References in the relevant papers were also reviewed. Main reports published before the aforementioned period of time were included as well.\n\n    FMF is the most frequent and best characterized autosomal recessive monogenic AID. Southern European, Northern African, Turkish, and Arabic people are more frequently affected (the prevalence is 1 : 150-1 : 1000 in Turkey); the Middle East and Eastern Europe show a lower prevalence (1 : 10,000,000). Moreover, a growing number of FMF diagnosis were recently established in Japan, USA, and Brazil. Employing positional cloning, genomic sequence analysis, and exon trapping in 1997, two independent FMF consortia (French FMF Consortium and International FMF Consortium) identified and isolated the MEFV gene, located on chromosome 16p13.3, as the causative for FMF. This gene encodes a 781-amino acid protein known as pyrin/TRIM20/marenostrin, which works as a key component of the innate immune system and is expressed by neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Although characterized by an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, the FMF phenotype has been observed also in heterozygous patients, in whom hypothetical modifier genes and/or environmental factors may play a substantial role in inducing inflammatory attacks. Disease onset occurs before the age of 10 in more than 60% of patients and before the age of 30 in 98% of cases. Acute febrile attacks usually last a few hours to 3 days; serositis, articular symptoms, and erysipelas-like erythema in the lower limbs are the most typical manifestations accompanying fever. Although adult-onset patients often manifest a milder phenotype, clinical features are generally similar to those expressed by younger patients, except for a lower frequency of arthritis and skin erythema. Systemic reactive AA amyloidosis represents the most severe long-term complication in untreated FMF patients. In this regard, three different FMF types have been suggested: type 1 FMF refers to the presence of overt clinical inflammatory disease; type 2 FMF presents with systemic amyloidosis in otherwise asymptomatic subjects; and type 3 FMF is related to the absence of inflammatory manifestations and systemic amyloidosis in subjects carrying MEFV mutations.\n\n    Since the identification of the MEFV gene, more than 340 nucleotide variants have been found, half of them being clearly associated with FMF. The majority of FMF-causing mutations are located within exon 10 and are mutational hotspots (including p.M694V/I and p.M680I), which are associated with a more severe clinical phenotype. Milder pathogenic variants, such as p.V726A located on exon 10, have been also reported. Moreover, other mutations, either of unknown or uncertain significance (p.K695R, p.P369S, p.F479L, p.I591T, and p.E148Q) and pathogenic variants (p.R761H, p.A744S, p.I692del, p.E167D, and p.T267I), have been associated with varying degrees of disease severity. Despite extensive studies over the last 20 years, genotype-phenotype correlations in FMF have not been fully understood. Many patients with clinical FMF have no genetic variants or are heterozygous for MEFV, highlighting the possibility of an autosomal-dominant transmission or of a clinical expression depending on additional modifying factors as modifier genes and environmental or epigenetic influences. Regarding FMF patients with a single heterozygous mutation (such as p.H478Y, p.T577S/A/N, p.M694del/I, p.E148Q, and p.L110P), they were associated with a wide clinical variability, including an incomplete or less severe disease phenotype. Moreover, modifier genes encoding components of amyloid A deposits, such as serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), have been significantly and independently associated with renal amyloidosis. In addition, peripheral leukocytes from FMF patients have shown reduced MEFV transcript expression due to a slightly increased methylation of exon 2 compared to healthy controls. Among epigenetic modifications, a differential expression of several miRNAs has been demonstrated both in homozygote and heterozygote quiescent FMF patients, compared to controls and healthy carriers.\n\n    Pyrin is a member of the TRIM protein family playing a pivotal role in the inflammatory response against infections through the regulation of interleukin- (IL-) 1beta production. The protein is formed by N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), zinc finger domain (bBox), coiled-coil (CC), and B30.2/SPRY C-terminal domain: the pathogenetic mechanism which links MEFV gene mutations to the development of the FMF phenotype is not fully clarified. According to Papin et al., pyrin SPRY domain interacts with inflammasome components inhibiting pro-IL-1beta processing; this C-terminal region of the protein is frequently altered as a consequence of pathogenic MEFV mutations. Consequently, macrophages from pyrin knock-out mice show enhanced IL-1beta release in response to inflammatory stimuli. On the contrary, Chae et al. demonstrated that pyrin mutations in FMF-knock-in (KI) mice induce NLRP3-independent IL-1beta activation. In fact, macrophages obtained from KI FMF-associated B30.2 mutations mice (including M680I, M694V, and V726A) showed IL-1beta overproduction after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, while no reduction of IL-1beta production was observed in NLRP3-deficient KI mice (MEFVV726A/V726ANLRP3-/-). These findings suggested that gain-of-function pyrin mutations induce IL-1beta activation through an NLRP3-independent manner. Conversely, monocytes from patients with FMF had LPS-induced IL-1beta oversecretion, which was damped after in vitro NLRP3 downregulation. Interestingly, the same authors observed that hyperproduction of IL-1beta correlated with both number and penetrance of MEFV mutations. In particular, individuals carrying heterozygous p.M694V or p.K695R mutations have shown higher levels of IL-1beta release than healthy controls, but lower levels than FMF patients who were homozygous for the same mutations. In addition, silencing NLRP3 expression led to the inhibition of IL-1beta secretion, suggesting that FMF-associated mutations might also trigger NLRP3-dependent inflammatory response. More recently, the identification of biochemical processes triggering IL-1beta production in response to bacterial modification of the GTPase RhoA shed light on the outstanding role of pyrin in the inflammatory responses. In this model, pyrin is kept inactive by serine-threonine kinases PKN1 and PKN2, through Ser208/Ser242 phosphorylation and subsequent binding to 14-3-3 proteins, which block the pyrin inflammasome. It has been demonstrated that PKN1 and PKN2 are activated by RhoA GTPase and that Rho-modifying bacterial toxins induce inactivation of these kinases, resulting in pyrin-inflammasome formation and IL-1beta production. Interestingly, mutated pyrin from FMF patients displayed a low binding to 14-3-3 proteins and PKN. The latest research on pyrin functions focused on its interaction with the cytoskeletal network, demonstrating its pivotal role in modulating inflammatory cell polarization and migration. Supporting these new data, bioinformatics analyses revealed that mRNAs targeted by miRNAs which are found overexpressed in homozygous FMF patients (such as miR-20a-5p and miR-197-3p) cluster in inflammatory pathways related to cell migration.\n\n    FMF diagnosis does not necessarily require genetic analysis, as it is also driven by clinical evaluation and relies on diagnostic criteria. Several sets of criteria have been suggested over time. However, those established at the Tel Hashomer Medical Center in Israel are currently the most widely used for adult patients. They include two sets of diagnostic criteria, consisting of a complete version and a simplified one: the complete version classifies FMF clinical manifestations into major and minor items and also includes ten supportive criteria, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). Both specificity and sensitivity of these criteria are higher than 95%. The Tel Hashomer group also proposed simplified criteria that include major and minor criteria, as shown in Figure 1(b). In this case, FMF diagnosis is allowed when at least 1 major criterion or at least 2 minor criteria are fulfilled. The simplified version includes atypical attacks with abdominal involvement as a major criterion. Sensitivity and specificity are higher than 95% for simplified criteria as well. More recently, Yalcinkaya et al. have proposed diagnostic criteria specifically tailored for children, as described in Figure 1(c).\n\n    Originally described in 1982 in a family of Irish/Scottish descent and previously named \"Hibernian fever\" from the ancient Latin name of Ireland Hibernia, TRAPS is caused by mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene, inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern. At the end of the '90s, genome-wide association studies and linkage analysis in affected families placed the susceptibility locus on the distal short arm of chromosome 12p13, encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type 1 (TNFRSF1A/TNFR1/p55/CD120a). Afterwards, McDermott et al. identified germline mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene in seven families of Irish, Scottish, English, German, Finnish, and French-Canadian ancestry. Nowadays, TRAPS is considered a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of about 1 : 1,000,000 people. Most patients are of European origin, though some patients from Africa and Asia have been reported as well.\n\n    TRAPS is the most variable and protean among mAIDs in terms of age at disease onset, disease severity, and clinical presentation. Nevertheless, the disease is generally characterized by long-lasting inflammatory attacks that may even reach several weeks of duration. In the clinical practice, high-grade fever, erythematous migratory skin plaques associated with underlying myalgia, and joint and ocular inflammatory signs are prominent manifestations of TRAPS. Although most patients experience an early disease onset, adult-onset TRAPS has been widely reported, especially in subjects carrying low-penetrance mutations and presenting with atypical features, such as inflammatory manifestations affecting unusual sites. To date, no clinical diagnostic criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of TRAPS, which is based on the identification of TNFRSF1A mutations.\n\n    TNFRSF1A is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, constitutively expressed on most cell types, which is composed of an extracellular domain consisting of the tandem repeat of four cysteine-rich domains (CRD1-4), a transmembrane region, and an intracellular death domain (DD) involved in intracellular signal transduction. The extracellular domain is characterized by the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds, which bind TNF-alpha and also mediate the self-assembly of the receptor itself. Upon activation by a TNF ligand, TNFR1 signal transduction leads to several biochemical processes, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway or, alternatively, through other intracellular cascades, such as p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK/MAPK) signaling, and programmed cell death through the activation of cysteine proteases, named caspases. Moreover, activated TNFR mediates the release of the extracellular domain of the receptor itself into the extracellular compartment by means of ADAM17 (TNF-alpha converting enzyme), a key mediator of this \"shedding\" process, which generates a pool of sTNFR1 able to bind circulating TNF-alpha, dampening acute inflammation.\n\n    Currently, more than 150 TNFRSF1A gene mutations have been identified. The majority of disease-associated mutations are missense mutations located in exons 2, 3, and 4, encoding the extracellular domain of the mature TNFR protein. As previously written, low-penetrance variants are associated with milder phenotypes, later onset of disease, and lower risk of AA amyloidosis, if compared to high-penetrance mutations. Among low-penetrance variants, p.R92Q and p.P46L represent the most common mutations found in TRAPS patients; nevertheless, 2% allele frequency is estimated for p.R92Q in Caucasians, while about 10% allele frequency is estimated in the African population for p.P46L. On the contrary, high-penetrance \"structural\" mutations are responsible of severe phenotypes, characterized by early onset, high frequency of disabling inflammatory attacks, and a higher risk of developing AA amyloidosis over time. Cysteine residue substitutions (i.e., p.C30R, p.C33Y, p.C43G, p.C52Y, and p.C55Y) and p.T50M are listed among the structural variants. Moreover, a novel in-frame deletion of 24 nucleotides (c.255_278del) in exon 3 was recently identified in one patient.\n\n    Several pathogenetic mechanisms have been studied in vitro to demonstrate how TNFRSF1A mutations contribute to the development of the TRAPS phenotype: (i) impaired TNFRSF1A cell surface expression; (ii) altered TNF-alpha binding; (iii) defective shedding of the receptor; and (iv) intracellular accumulation of mutated TNFRSF1A proteins. The identification of reduced serum levels of soluble TNFR1 paved the way for the \"defective shedding hypothesis.\" Indeed, activated leukocytes carrying p.C52F, p.C33Y, p.T50M, and p.C88R mutations showed increased TNFR1 membrane expression and, on the other hand, reduced cleavage of the receptor. Interestingly, further studies have demonstrated that intracellular accumulation of misfolded TNFRSF1A proteins increases oxidative stress levels, stimulating proinflammatory signaling pathways. In support of this suggestion, chronic oxidative stress as well as enhanced IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were observed, in response to LPS, in monocytes isolated from patients with TNFRSF1A structural mutations (i.e., p.C33Y, p.T50M, p.C33G, p.C52F, and p.C30Y) in comparison with healthy controls. Moreover, autophagy defects and endoplasmic reticulum stress with consequent X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) hyperactivation were also proposed as pathogenetic determinants in association with TRAPS high-penetrance variants. Interestingly, Pucino et al. observed for the first time a T cell response pattern of activation in TRAPS patients carrying high-penetrance variants compared to healthy controls and, specifically, a lower frequency of peripheral regulatory T cells, a defective suppressive phenotype associated to ERK1/2, STAT1/3/5, mammalian target of rapamycin, and NF-kappaB pathways. Also epigenetic mechanisms have been recently added to TRAPS pathophysiology: in fact, TRAPS patients carrying structural mutations may display a specific serum signature by miRNAs. Moreover, a different expression of specific miRNAs, involving miR-92a-3p and miR-150-3p, has been observed between patients treated with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra and nontreated patients. More recently, Harrison et al. reported that primary dermal fibroblasts from patients carrying the p.T50M, p.C472, and p.C88R mutations showed an impaired regulation of miR-146a and miR-155, which led to increased responsiveness to LPS.\n\n    CAPS is a spectrum of diseases caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene and including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA), the latter also known as \"neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease\" or NOMID. These three clinical entities range from the least to the most severe phenotype, respectively. In particular, FCAS is characterized by recurrent attacks typically induced by generalized cold exposure and consisting of fever, urticaria-like rash, asthenia, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia; in addition to the clinical picture described for FCAS, MWS is also characterized by arthritis, optic nerve head swelling, and inflammation of the vestibule-cochlear nerve, which might lead to progressive visual loss and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, respectively. Early central nervous system involvement with chronic aseptic meningitis, increased intracranial pressure, cerebral atrophy, ventriculomegaly, and severe chronic papilledema are further identified in patients with CINCA/NOMID. Moreover, severe chronic arthritis with conspicuous structural deformities of large joints, bony overgrowth, and loss of articular function are typical manifestations of CINCA/NOMID.\n\n    CAPS are rare diseases with a prevalence of 1-2 per 106 in the United States and 1/360,000 in France, without any gender predilection. Patients are often of Caucasian origin, and disease prevalence seems to be higher for FCAS and MWS in the US and Europe, respectively, while CINCA/NOMID is rarer. The gene responsible for these syndromes was identified at the end of the 20th century after linkage analysis studies on different families of patients showing clinical CAPS pictures. Cuisset et al. applied a genome-wide search strategy to three families, mapping a region closely related to the MWS phenotype within region 44 of chromosome 1. Afterwards, mutations in the NLRP3 gene located on chromosome 1q44 were associated to three FCAS and one MWS families and to several CINCA patients.\n\n    Diagnosis of CAPS relies on genetic research for NLRP3 mutations, though general clinical diagnostic criteria for CAPS have been recently developed: these criteria included the increase of inflammatory markers as a mandatory item and six other CAPS typical signs as additional items. Diagnosis should require the fulfillment of the essential item and at least two out of six additional signs. These criteria, listed in Table 2, are expected to allow the identification of CAPS patients regardless of the evidence of NLRP3 mutations, with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 94%. Genetic analyses carried out in patients with suspected CAPS allowed to identify more than 200 NLRP3 mutations. Most of these are autosomal-dominant or de novo mutations, frequently localized in the exon 3. In addition, several studies described somatic NLRP3 mosaicisms in patients with early- or late-onset severe clinical features, tested negative for germline mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies divided NLRP3 variants into three groups, depending on the associated clinical picture, which can be (i) at the ends of the severity spectrum continuum (i.e., FCAS and CINCA); (ii) contiguous CAPS phenotypes, such as FCAS/MWS or MWS/CINCA phenotypes; and (iii) related to polymorphisms or low-penetrance variants. In this regard, initially reported FCAS-associated mutations (including p.L305P, p.L353P, and p.R488K) as well as p.Y570C, p.F309S, or p.F523L which are commonly associated with the severe CINCA phenotype belong to group I. Other mutations instead are common to contiguous CAPS phenotypes: that is the case of p.R260W found in FCAS and CINCA patients, and the case of p.T348M and p.G569R, identified in MWS and CINCA ones. Other mutations, including those affecting the codons p.A439, p.R260, and p.D303, are related to different levels of disease severity, suggesting the involvement of other unknown genetic factors in the development of the CAPS phenotype. On the other hand, finding mutations such as p.V198M, p.R488K, and p.Q703K in asymptomatic familial cases, in CAPS patients with heterogeneous phenotypes, and even in healthy controls raised the question of whether these variants might be causative mutations or low-penetrance variants. Indeed, allele frequencies of p.V198M, p.R488K, and p.Q703K were 0.7, 1.4, and 5%, respectively, in healthy Caucasian controls and their clinical significance is still under debate. In particular, the most common low-penetrance variant associated with CAPS milder forms, p.Q703K, was initially described as a neutral polymorphism, subsequently considered a gain-of-function mutation and, according to recent suggestions, redefined as a functional polymorphism rather than a low-penetrance variant. More recently, Naselli et al. described the clinical characteristics of 57 patients with the p.Q703K variant: the majority of them displayed a mild CAPS phenotype, characterized by recurrent episodes of urticaria-like rashes and arthralgia. Moreover, monocytes isolated from these patients and stimulated with LPS showed a pattern of cytokine secretion (including IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1 receptor antagonist) similar to that displayed by healthy controls, suggesting that the variant p.Q703K has a limited functional and clinical impact.\n\n    The NLRP3 gene encodes an intracellular sensor protein known as cryopyrin, NALP3, or PYPAF1, which is expressed in several cell types, such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and chondrocytes, and is directly involved in the inflammatory response, being a key component of the multimolecular complex called NLRP3-inflammasome. The identification of the NLRP3 inflammasome was a major breakthrough in the field of innate immunity, and research studies following the identification of the CAPS-associated gene led to the characterization of the molecular platform which activates caspase-1, the enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage and secretion of IL-1beta. In this context, Agostini et al. demonstrated that this molecular platform includes the sensor protein NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC, and the cysteine-protease caspase-1, paving the way for the identification of the molecular basis of NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent disorders. Indeed, CAPS-associated mutations, mostly localized in exon 3 encoding for the central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, induce a spontaneous and excessive production of active IL-1beta. In this regard, monocytes isolated from a p.R260W MWS patient displayed higher IL-1beta secretion after LPS-mediated NLRP3-inflammasome activation. Similar results were obtained without ATP stimulation in monocytes isolated from CINCA patients carrying the p.N477K, p.D303N, and p.T348M variants. Furthermore, studies on monocytes from patients bearing NLRP3 mutations associated with CINCA and MWS suggested that an intracellular environment characterized by a deranged redox homeostasis could induce NLRP3-inflammasome activation and IL-1beta secretion. Interestingly, functional oligomeric NLRP3-inflammasome particles able to amplify extracellular and intracellular caspase-1 proinflammatory activities were detected in the serum of patients with MWS and severe CINCA phenotypes (carrying the p.R260W, p.T348M, p.A439T, and p.D303N mutations) and in CAPS patients with low-grade somatic NLRP3 mosaicism.\n\n    MKD encompasses two distinct clinical phenotypes: the most severe mevalonic aciduria (MEVA) and the milder hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS). This disease was firstly described in 1984 by van der Meer et al. in six Dutch patients with recurrent attacks of fever and elevated IgD levels. Both MKD phenotypes are caused by the deficient activity of a member of the GHMP (galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase) superfamily, i.e., mevalonate kinase (MVK). MVK catalyzes the conversion of mevalonic acid to 5-phosphomevalonic acid in the second step of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which supplies the cell with many bioactive molecules, such as isoprenyl groups and sterols. The MVK gene, identified as causative for MKD in 1999, is located in the long arm of chromosome 12 at position 24.11: its mutations, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, lead to decreased MVK activity, as shown by skin fibroblasts from unrelated MKD patients. MKD is a rare condition with an overall higher prevalence in the Netherland and Western Europe. Indeed, the founder mutation p.V377I has been largely reported in many patients from the Netherlands. HIDS is clinically characterized by fever attacks lasting 4-7 days and recurring every 4-6 weeks. Fever is often accompanied by cervical lymphadenopathy, maculopapular rash, mucosal or genital ulcers, and severe abdominal pain with diarrhea and/or vomiting. For HIDS patients, MVK enzyme activity is reduced until 1-10%, while it is reduced to less than 1% in MEVA, which is characterized by serious neurological impairment, failure to thrive, and early death, in addition to HIDS manifestations.\n\n    Currently, more than 200 MVK variants have been related to MKD. Most of them are missense mutations linked to diverse degrees of disease severity. MVK deletions, insertions, nonsense mutations, and splicing defects have also been reported. MEVA-associated known mutations are found in regions encoding the active sites of the MVK enzyme, while HIDS-associated ones are found throughout the coding sequence, more often in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity with a second mutation. The most common HIDS-associated variants are p.V377I and p.I268T: the first one is responsible for about 50% of MKD cases and usually detected in compound heterozygosity, rarely in homozygous patients, while p.I268T has been reported in association with both HIDS and MEVA. Other rarer variants (p.A148T, p.P167L, p.N205D, and p.T209A) can cause the HIDS phenotype when a second severe mutation such as p.H20P, p.Y114fs, p.L264F, p.I268T, p.V310M, and p.A334T is present as well. Recently, ter Haar et al. described genotype-phenotype correlations and response to treatment in a large international cohort of 114 MKD patients, observing that the most frequent genotypes are p.V377I/p.I268T and p.V377I/p.V377I, with a frequency of 22% and 12% respectively. Moreover, AA amyloidosis was more often associated with the p.V377I/p.I268T genotype, while patients with variants other than p.V377I showed a more severe musculoskeletal involvement.\n\n    Isoprenoids are implicated in several biochemical pathways, and one of their functions is the posttranslational modification of small G proteins involved in the inflammatory response: it has been demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with HIDS have a limited pool of isoprenoids available and show a decreased Rho GTPase activity: as a consequence, sustained activation of Rac1 (a small GTPase) and increased IL-1beta production can be observed. Recent data suggest that intracellular oxidative stress and impaired autophagosome degradation stimulate IL-1beta production. Interestingly, recent discoveries suggest that IL-1beta release after LPS stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from HIDS patients (including homozygous and compound heterozygous p.V377I-positive patients) strictly depends on RhoA inactivation, which triggers the pyrin inflammasome.\n\n    No diagnostic criteria were developed for MKD. However, van der Hilst et al.'s guidelines as well as Eurofever \"clinical\" classification criteria have been proposed for selecting patients with recurrent fevers worthy of being addressed to MVK gene testing. In this respect, it is quite accepted that high serum IgD level is not specific for the diagnosis of HIDS, while intracellular MVK enzyme activity and/or urinary mevalonic acid measured during a fever attack are useful supportive data, especially when genetic analysis is not available or noninformative. Moreover, Steichen et al. suggested that molecular analysis could be avoided when inflammatory attacks arise after the age of 5 years or if febrile flares persist for more than 14 days or if articular pain is absent during inflammatory bouts.",
        "Methods": "",
        "Results": "    In adult patients, periodic fevers may be sustained by autoinflammatory conditions not directly related to Mendelian inheritance. In particular, adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), Schnitzler's disease, and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome should be taken into account for differential diagnosis with mAIDs.\n\n    AOSD is a relatively rare condition of unknown origin in which polygenic predisposition, infectious agents, and other environmental factors induce an autoinflammatory systemic response, which gives rise to daily spiking fevers variably associated with evanescent salmon-colored maculopapular rash, arthralgia, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with or without increase in aminotransferases, sore throat, mono- or polyserositis, pulmonary infiltrates, and myocarditis. The onset occurs often between 15 and 25 years or between 35 and 45 years. Laboratory assessment discloses marked leukocytosis with neutrophilia, elevated inflammatory markers, and highly increased serum ferritin levels. In particular, ferritin may represent a reliable marker of disease activity. Indeed, serum ferritin levels above 1000 mug/L combined with a glycosylated fraction < 20% has shown to be a highly specific clue for the diagnosis of AOSD. In relationship with disease course, AOSD may be alternatively characterized by a unique and self-limited inflammatory bout lasting several weeks to months (monophasic AOSD), but may present a recurrent course with multiple flares (intermittent AOSD) or display a chronic course with persistent polyarthritis and progressive joint destruction (chronic AOSD).\n\n    To date, diagnosis of AOSD is based on sets of classification criteria proposed during the last decades, as shown in Table 3. Those proposed by Yamaguchi et al. are the most widely used and require the preliminary exclusion of infections, cancer, and autoimmune diseases; the criteria proposed by Fautrel et al. are more recent and give a higher weight to ferritin levels and glycosylated ferritin fraction. The Yamaguchi criteria exhibit a sensitivity of 79.2% and specificity of 93.8%; the Fautrel criteria have a sensitivity of 80.6% and specificity of 98.5%.\n\n    Schnitzler's disease is a very rare inflammatory condition presenting with intermittent fever and urticaria-like skin rashes occurring in subjects with monoclonal gammopathy (mostly of the IgM type) and a considerable increase of inflammatory markers. Arthralgia or arthritis, lymphadenopathy, and liver and/or spleen enlargement are frequent manifestations as well. AA amyloidosis represents a potential long-term consequence of an untreated disease, while monoclonal IgM gammopathy progresses toward an overt lymphoproliferative disorder in about 15-20% of patients. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, which have been validated in a cohort of real-life patients, showing a sensitivity for definite and probable diagnosis of 81% and 93%, respectively, with a corresponding specificity of 100% and 97% (see Table 4).\n\n    The periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is an autoinflammatory condition characterized by the clinical features described by the acronym itself. Other various manifestations may occur in addition to cardinal signs, including skin rash, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. This syndrome is currently the most frequent autoinflammatory cause of noninfective recurrent fever among children in the European population. However, although initially confined to the pediatric world, the PFAPA syndrome has been recently identified as a possible cause of periodic febrile episodes also among adults. In this regard, diagnostic criteria specifically tailored on adult patients have been described.  Table 5 illustrates PFAPA diagnostic criteria for both children and adults. In relationship with adult patients, the proposed diagnostic criteria identify the PFAPA syndrome among subjects presenting with an increase of inflammatory markers during attacks, symptom-free intervals between inflammatory bouts, and at least one item among erythematous pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenitis during fevers. These criteria should be applied only after having excluded infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases as well as mAIDs.\n\n    Behcet's disease (BD), recently classified at the crossroad between autoimmune and polygenic AIDs, may also manifest with otherwise unexplained fever: it is clinically characterized by a classical \"triad\" of recurrent oral aphthosis, genital ulcers, and uveitis, especially in the form of posterior uveitis and panuveitis. However, inflammation may involve also (i) the gastrointestinal tract mimicking inflammatory bowel diseases, (ii) the vascular tree with multiple venous thrombosis and arterial aneurysms potentially affecting all body sites, (iii) the nervous system manifesting with a wide array of manifestations, most commonly affecting the brainstem and diencephalic regions, and (iv) the skin with erythema nodosum or pseudofolliculitis. Diagnosis of BD is based on the fulfillment of international diagnostic criteria and the International Study Group Criteria for BD, which are reported in Table 6.\n\n    Recurrent fever and asthenia are the main constitutional symptoms in most mAIDs. However, while asthenia is a nonspecific manifestation identified in many systemic disorders, specific inflammatory features associated with recurrent fever may provide valuable clinical information. In particular, FMF attacks generally last between 6 and 72 hours, while TRAPS patients are characterized by episodes lasting 1 to 3 weeks; CAPS and HIDS manifest with fever generally lasting 4-7 days. Of note, also the PFAPA syndrome is characterized by fever episodes resolving in 4-7 days and this disorder should always be taken into account when considering differential diagnosis. Frequency of fever attacks and body temperature may be extremely variable and are less useful for diagnostic purposes.\n\n    Systemic reactive AA amyloidosis is the most challenging long-term complication of all mAIDs. Nevertheless, MKD patients are less frequently involved, with a frequency ranging between 3 and 5%. Similarly, amyloidosis is infrequent in patients with FCAS, while nontreated FMF, MWS, and TRAPS may be complicated with systemic amyloidosis in up to 50%, 25%, and 20% of the cases over time, respectively.\n\n    The skin is frequently involved in mAIDs, and some cutaneous findings may be pathognomonic for a rapid diagnosis. This is the case of erysipelas-like erythema in FMF patients presenting with tender, warm, and swollen erythematous plaques, generally occurring on the distal extremities and triggered by physical activity. Nevertheless, the prevalence of erysipelas-like erythema varies among populations with FMF and is quite uncommon in Arabs and Armenians. Skin biopsy of this lesion might reveal edema with perivascular and interstitial infiltrate consisting of neutrophils and lymphocytes.\n\n    A centrifugal migratory erythematous rash is the more typical skin manifestation of TRAPS: it is generally accompanied by myalgia due to monocytic fasciitis of the underlying muscles. Although the legs are more frequently involved, the trunk is not spared. A mild perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear cells is usually identified at the skin biopsy, even though a slight deposition of C3 and C4 in the dermis has also been described.\n\n    Patients with CAPS present with urticaria-like skin rashes in almost all cases. Indeed, an urticaria-like rash appears among the diagnostic items recently proposed for the clinical assessment of CAPS patients. This rash is typically induced by cold exposure in FCAS, but it may develop at birth or within a few hours after birth in patients with MWS or CINCA/NOMID, disregarding environment temperature. Noteworthy, patients with FCAS are negative to the ice cube test, unlike those affected by cold physical urticaria. Skin biopsy of urticaria-like lesions in CAPS shows a neutrophilic infiltrate of the dermis, with the absence of vasculitis, scarce eosinophils, and sparing of the epidermal layer. Schnitzler's syndrome should be considered for differential diagnosis in patients with monoclonal gammopathy and skin manifestations.\n\n    Skin lesions are identified in more than two thirds of patients with MKD: they are variable and nonspecific, including maculopapular, morbilliform, erythematous, and purpuric rashes. Oral and/or genital aphthosis can be seen in about half of MKD patients, requiring differential diagnosis with BD, PFAPA syndrome, and FMF.\n\n    Most patients with mAIDs report musculoskeletal manifestations, with FMF and CINCA/NOMID being the most typically involved. Nevertheless, patients with MKD and TRAPS may refer joint and muscle symptoms as well.\n\n    Acute monoarthritis may be the sole disease manifestation in up to 15% of FMF patients. Nonetheless, monoarthritis is less frequent when patients are genetically diagnosed, but do not fulfill clinical diagnostic criteria for FMF. In these cases, symmetrical acute arthritis of large joints of the lower limbs is the most frequent finding. Alternatively, subacute or chronic articular involvement may be identified. Although the knee and hip are more frequently involved, FMF-related arthritis may affect all articular sites, including the elbow, sternoclavicular joints, and metacarpophalangeal joints. Also sacroiliitis may be identified in FMF and seems to be closely related to the M694V MEFV mutation that has been suggested as a susceptibility factor for enthesitis-related arthritis. While myositis is uncommon in FMF, myalgia is reported in up to 25% of the patients and may be classified as spontaneous, induced by exercise, or protracted febrile myalgia. Specifically, protracted febrile myalgia is a debilitating manifestation often accompanied by other symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, arthritis/arthralgia, and transient vasculitic lesions mimicking the Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Electromyography shows only nonspecific changes, while muscle enzymes are generally within the normal range. There is some evidence that musculoskeletal symptoms may occur more frequently in patients with late-onset disease than in those displaying an early onset.\n\n    Articular involvement in CAPS affects approximately 60% of patients and ranges from arthralgia with transient joint swelling during flares to chronic disabling joint disease. Severe joint manifestations including chronic arthritides with structural changes and bony overgrowth are described in patients with CINCA/NOMID and involve especially the knees. These articular affections bring about severe functional impairment since early adulthood.\n\n    With regard to TRAPS, myalgia with monocytic fasciitis in the absence of direct inflammatory involvement of the muscle is a characteristic feature of the disease. Therefore, serum levels of muscle enzymes are usually normal. Myalgia is generally associated with warm and tender patches of the overlying skin, which are recognized as typical features of TRAPS. Regarding joint involvement, TRAPS patients often suffer from arthralgia, while arthritis is an unusual finding that eventually affects large joints in a nonerosive fashion. Despite this, the involvement of small joints and sacroiliitis have been anecdotally reported in subjects carrying low-penetrance mutations.\n\n    Polyarthralgia is observed in approximately 80% of MKD patients, while nonerosive arthritis of large joints and myalgia are reported in about half of the cases. Musculoskeletal manifestations may be severe and disabling in about 7-8% of patients, who might develop flexion contractures, bone erosions, and even deformities. Articular symptoms may persist also during symptom-free intervals of MKD patients.\n\n    Recurrent serosal acute inflammation may be a presenting peculiar manifestation of mAIDs. In particular, recurrent pleuritis and peritonitis represent typical features of FMF and they are counted among the major items in the clinical diagnostic criteria. Similarly, chest pain and abdominal pain, which are possibly due to pericarditis, pleuritis, or peritonitis, appear among the pediatric FMF criteria.\n\n    Notably, although the incidence of pericarditis has been reported to be quite low in FMF, echocardiography may identify a subclinical involvement in up to 27% of patients, especially among subjects with a longer disease duration.\n\n    Recurrent acute pericarditis has been largely described in patients with TRAPS. Of note, recurrent acute pericarditis may be the sole clinical manifestation in subjects carrying low-penetrance mutations. Therefore, clinical clues have been proposed to identify among patients with idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis those who potentially might carry TNFRSF1A gene mutations: a positive family history for either pericarditis or recurrent fevers, a high rate of recurrences beyond the first year of disease, colchicine resistance, and the need for immunosuppressants to achieve control of the disease should induce a clinical suspicion of TRAPS.\n\n    Although not included in the clinical diagnostic criteria, pleuropericarditis is frequently identified also in patients with AOSD.\n\n    Although gastrointestinal symptoms may be found in almost all mAIDs, abdominal pain with or without diarrhea and vomiting are more frequently found in FMF and HIDS. Abdominal pain in FMF is closely related to aseptic recurrent peritonitis and usually represents a prevailing clinical manifestation. For this reason, abdominal pain (with or without peritonitis) appears in all clinical FMF criteria as well as in the more recent Eurofever classification criteria. Although less useful for diagnostic purposes, other gastrointestinal manifestations have been often reported in FMF patients. Noteworthy, inflammatory bowel diseases seem to be more frequent and severe in patients with FMF and, conversely, the rate of MEFV mutations has been found higher in subjects diagnosed with inflammatory bowel diseases.\n\n    Abdominal pain, vomiting, and/or diarrhea along with oral aphthosis are almost constant in HIDS patients during fever attacks. Sterile peritonitis mimicking acute appendicitis can lead to surgical interventions, peritoneal adhesions, and intestinal obstruction. Based on the higher frequency of gastrointestinal affections, the occurrence of diarrhea during fever attacks has been included in the Eurofever classification criteria.\n\n    Notably, abdominal pain and intestinal inflammation may be also manifestations of BD, which should be ruled out during the diagnostic process. Similarly, the PFAPA syndrome may be associated with abdominal pain and various intestinal disorders.\n\n    No specific ocular involvement is reported in FMF. However, fundus abnormalities resembling colloid bodies in the Bruch membrane have been described on routine funduscopic examination during FMF fever attacks. In addition, increased choroidal thickness has been identified inconsistently during attacks. Anterior, posterior, and intermediate uveitis have been occasionally described in FMF patients. Conversely, FMF could represent a predisposing factor for the development of keratoconus, especially in patients carrying homozygous mutations.\n\n    In TRAPS patients, the eye is most commonly affected with periorbital edema or pain and conjunctivitis. Periorbital edema is more common in pediatric patients as well as in adults with an early disease onset. On the contrary, eye manifestations are less frequently encountered in patients carrying the R92Q low-penetrance TNFRSF1A mutation. Nevertheless, bilateral panuveitis has been recently detected in a child with TRAPS carrying the R92Q variant.\n\n    Retinitis pigmentosa and cataract may be recognized in patients with MKD, and in particular retinitis pigmentosa may occasionally represent the presenting feature of the disease.\n\n    Optic disc changes including papilledema and optic atrophy are the most common ocular findings in MWS and CINCA/NOMID. In this regard, the gradual loss of nerve fibers owing to optic disc alterations explains gradual visual loss in such patients. Of note, retinal vasculitis, focal choroiditis, vitritis, band keratopathy, nummular stromal infiltration, corneal vascularization, and cataract are rare manifestations occasionally encountered in CINCA/NOMID, while midstromal changes, episcleritis, keratitis, and uveitis have been reported in MWS. Lastly, eye involvement is mainly represented by conjunctivitis in FCAS patients. Keratitis with bilateral corneal scars have been reported only in severe cases.\n\n    Ocular inflammatory involvement should also pave the attention to BD, which may manifest with recurrent, unilateral or bilateral panuveitis, posterior uveitis, and/or retinal vasculitis; less frequently, anterior uveitis can occur.\n\n    Ophthalmologists should be aware of the possibility of severe ocular manifestations related to mAIDs, and that ocular inflammatory signs might even occur in the context of mild phenotypes.\n\n    Among mAIDs, neurological manifestations are more closely related to severe CAPS phenotypes. Indeed, while headache and drowsiness are the only neurological symptoms of FCAS during inflammatory bouts, MWS is often complicated by sensorineural deafness and progressive visual loss due to the atrophy of the optic nerve over time. The nervous system is severely affected in CINCA/NOMID: suggestive clinical signs include chronic aseptic meningitis, increased intracranial pressure, cerebral atrophy, hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly, sensorineural hearing loss, and chronic papilledema. Sterile meningeal inflammation, which represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality in such patients, is found in almost all cases and contributes to the onset of mental retardation and seizures in at least half of CINCA patients. Hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly are often present at birth or even observed in utero, possibly constituting the initial presentation of the disease. Less common neurological signs include diplegia, hypotonia, or transient episodes of hemiplegia.\n\n    Aseptic meningitis and seizures are neurologic manifestations infrequently occurring in FMF patients. However, myalgia is the most common neurological symptom in FMF. Headache is very frequent in TRAPS and MKD patients. In addition, psychomotor retardation, progressive cerebellar ataxia, hypotonia, and developmental delay may be identified in patients with MEVA.\n\n    Among polygenic AIDs, BD might start with severe signs of neurological involvement, consisting of vascular affections with variable severity inducing stroke-related manifestations.\n\n    Lymphadenopathy is a frequent finding in different inflammatory disorders, including mAIDs. Noteworthy, the enlargement of the cervical lymph node represents a diagnostic clue for patients with the PFAPA syndrome and should be taken into account for patients presenting with laterocervical lymphadenopathy solely during fever attacks. Cervical lymphadenitis is part of diagnostic criteria drafted for both PFAPA children and adults.\n\n    Lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly also appear among minor items of the Yamaguchi criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AOSD. Regarding splenomegaly, no specific diagnostic role has been currently recognized in mAIDs. However, spleen enlargement may be found in more than 60% of patients with MKD and in up to 12.6% of patients with FMF.\n\n    A persistent systemic inflammation may impact on liver function, causing nonamyloid chronic hepatitis and even cryptogenic cirrhosis in some patients with FMF. Conversely, AOSD may show elevated liver enzymes during inflammatory episodes, and increased serum aminotransferases have been included in the diagnostic criteria by Yamaguchi et al. for the clinical diagnosis of AOSD.\n\n    No studies are available to indicate endocrine abnormalities in patients with mAIDs, although growth hormone deficiency has been reported in one CINCA patient with a severe skeletal picture who also displayed a substantial response to recombinant human growth hormone therapy.\n\n    Lung involvement is infrequent in patients with mAIDs. Actually, pleuritis is the most common pulmonary manifestation of FMF. Conversely, regarding atypical manifestations, recurrent pulmonary atelectasis and isolated pulmonary vasculitis have been rarely reported in FMF. Lung amyloidosis is a further rare complication of nontreated FMF, characterized by clinical and radiologic findings that may mimic chronic interstitial lung disease. Nevertheless, lung amyloidosis generally follows amyloid nephropathy. Pleuritis may be found also in patients with TRAPS.\n\n    The diagnostic assessment of adult patients referred for recurrent fevers can be highly challenging. After the exclusion of infectious, immune-mediated, oncologic, and blood diseases, the suspicion should be also directed to the field of autoinflammation and both monogenic or multifactorial (or polygenic) AIDs should be taken into accurate consideration. The spectrum of mAIDs is evolving rapidly, following the availability of more sophisticated and cost-effective genetic sequencing techniques. Over the past decades, many new clinical entities have been disclosed and classified among mAIDs, sometimes at the crossroad of autoinflammation, immune deficiencies, immune deregulation, and autoimmunity; on the other hand, well-known multifactorial diseases, i.e., nonhereditary collagen-like diseases, idiopathic inflammatory disorders, and metabolic diseases, have been reclassified among AIDs in the light of a deeper insight about their pathogenetic mechanisms which included autoinflammation.\n\n    Although mAIDs are rare diseases, a wider awareness of these disorders among physicians from different specialties is bringing about a sizeable increase in the identification of patients, even with noncanonical presentation which varies from atypical unusual or nuanced symptoms to macrophage activation syndrome. The first step for the diagnosis of mAIDs is to review carefully all details of fever episodes and response to treatment, since examination between attacks may be unrevealing, and tailor the potentially enormous laboratory evaluation to a few tests focusing on the most likely diagnoses. For instance, a favourable response to colchicine prophylaxis is a major diagnostic clue to the diagnosis of FMF, whereas constitutive activation of the IL-1 secreting platform is the backstory of CAPS, which dramatically responds to IL-1 antagonists. The discovery of a causative link between autoinflammation and IL-1 release has improved our understanding of the intimate mechanisms of innate immunity, and have likewise led to the identification of extraordinary treatments for many of these disorders. Moreover, during the last years, different diagnostic scores have been proposed to improve the identification of people with mAIDs or optimize their access to genetic testing, and also different scores to measure chronic damage have been developed. The increasing reports of adults with mAIDs have helped clarify the connections between innate immunity and environment, although a specific diagnosis still requires the integration of different clinical and laboratory data, family history, ethnicity, and focused genetic analysis.\n\n    In this review, we have summarized the clinical features shared by the most common monogenic and multifactorial AIDs, with the intent to offer a practical guide to the clinician involved in the management of patients with a history of recurrent fevers (Figures 2-5). With the same purpose, we provided an overview of genetic variants associated with hereditary recurrent febrile syndromes and their pathogenetic significance (Table 7) and we suggested an empirical flow chart for genetic diagnosis (Figure 6). In closing, the clinical judgement of the rheumatologist, in close collaboration with the geneticist and the multidisciplinary equipe experienced in autoinflammation, remains the architrave to unravel the multifaceted complexity of AIDs in real-life scenarios.",
