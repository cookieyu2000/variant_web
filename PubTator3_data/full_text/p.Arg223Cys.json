        "Title": "    Germline Pathogenic Variants in 7636 Japanese Patients With Prostate Cancer and 12 366 Controls",
        "Abstract": "    Genetic testing has been conducted in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) using multigene panels, but no centralized guidelines for genetic testing exist. To overcome this limitation, we investigated the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with pathogenic variants.\n\n    We sequenced eight genes associated with hereditary PCa in 7636 unselected Japanese patients with PCa and 12 366 male, cancer-free control individuals. We assigned clinical significance for all 1456 variants using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines and ClinVar. We compared the frequency of carriers bearing pathogenic variants between cases and control participants with calculated PCa risk in each gene and documented the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients bearing pathogenic variants. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n    We identified 136 pathogenic variants, and 2.9% of patients and 0.8% of control individuals had a pathogenic variant. Association with PCa risk was statistically significant for variants in BRCA2 (P < .001, odds ratio [OR] = 5.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.55 to 9.32), HOXB13 (P < .001, OR = 4.73, 95% CI = 2.84 to 8.19), and ATM (P < .001, OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.63 to 5.15). We detected recurrent new pathogenic variants such as p.Gly132Glu of HOXB13. Patients with pathogenic variants were 2.0 years younger at diagnosis and more often had smoking and alcohol drinking histories as well as family histories of breast, pancreatic, lung, and liver cancers.\n\n    This largest sequencing study of PCa heredity provides additional evidence supporting the latest consensus among clinicians for developing genetic testing guidelines for PCa.",
        "Introduction": "    Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and has the highest incidence rate in developed countries. Among common cancers at 11 anatomical sites, PCa was found to be the most heritable, and genome-wide association studies have identified more than 150 variants associated with PCa. However, the identified variants were common and had low penetrance, limiting the clinical utility of genetic risk scores. Familial clustering of PCa has been reported, and around 5% of PCa cases could be primarily attributable to rare, highly penetrant mutations in genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and HOXB13.\n\n    Genetic testing using multigene panels has the potential to guide PCa screening, targeted treatment, and surveillance for patients and their relatives. Because variants in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with increased risk of multiple cancer types including PCa, identifying pathogenic variants in patients with PCa has implications for surveillance of various cancer types in relatives. Patients with a pathogenic variant in ATM, BRCA2, and CHEK2 are reported to have a higher risk for metastatic PCa. Patients with metastatic PCa who have germline or somatic mutations in DNA-repair machinery have sustained responses to poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy. The ongoing IMPACT study (NCT00261456) is evaluating the use of targeted PCa screening in men with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, no centralized guidelines for PCa genetic testing exist.\n\n    Guidelines for genetic testing serve as a resource to identify individuals who may benefit from cancer-risk assessment and genetic counseling, to guide decisions related to genetic testing, and to facilitate a multidisciplinary approach in managing individuals at increased risk. In contrast to breast, ovarian, and colon cancers, studies on PCa have been limited, and information regarding the clinical significance of genetic variants in ClinVar is much sparser than information available for other cancers. In this setting, a large-scale, case-control study could provide important information on classifications of individual germline variants, PCa disease risk for each gene, and demographic and clinical characteristics of patients bearing pathogenic variants. Although most studies have analyzed only patients with PCa, our previous study on breast cancer showed that population-matched control individuals were indispensable because 5% or fewer variants found in Japanese patients were registered in the most closely matched population in ExAC. Therefore, various types of information from a large-scale, case-control study would help in developing guidelines for genetic testing in PCa.\n\n    In this study, we performed the largest case-control sequencing study on PCa heredity (to the best of our knowledge), involving 7636 unselected Japanese patients with PCa and 12 366 control participants. We sequenced coding regions of eight genes, assigned clinical significance for all variants detected, and calculated PCa risk estimates for presumed pathogenic variants in each gene. We investigated the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with pathogenic variants.",
        "Methods": "    We obtained all study samples from BioBank Japan, which is a multi-institutional, hospital-based registry that collects DNA and clinical information from patients with various common diseases, including PCa, from all over Japan between 2003 and 2018. Clinical characteristics of cases and control individuals were collected by interview or medical record survey using a standard questionnaire at the point of entry to Biobank Japan. These PCa samples are considered likely to be representative of Japanese patients because the age-specific distribution of PCa patients in BioBank Japan was similar to that described in the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare Patient Survey. In this study, we performed a hospital registry-based study in 7744 patients with PCa and 12 520 male controls. Among the 7744 patients with PCa, 7229 individuals were diagnosed before enrollment, and the remaining 515 patients were diagnosed during a follow-up period. We used the same 12 520 male controls age 60 years and older with no personal or family history of cancer from our previous study on breast cancer. Owing to this selection criterion, the control group may exhibit a lower frequency of pathogenic variants than that observed in the general controls individuals, and as a result, disease risk may be calculated to be higher. All participants provided their written informed consent. The study was approved by the ethical committees of the Institute of Medical Sciences, the University of Tokyo, and the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences.\n\n    We selected eight genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 [BRIP1], CHEK2, HOXB13, NBN, and PALB2) whose rare germline variants were reported to show high penetrance for PCa in a review article because there were no guidelines about gene selection for genetic testing. We analyzed the complete coding regions and 2-bp flanking intronic sequences of all eight genes (37 982 bp) by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based target sequence method (Supplementary Methods, available online). Finally, we identified 1456 genetic variants in 7636 patients and 12 366 control individuals, and 99.98% of the target region was covered by at least 20 sequence reads.\n\n    We assigned clinical significance (pathogenic, benign, or uncertain) for all variants as in our previous study (Supplementary Methods, available online). Briefly, we determined clinical significance using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, available online) as well as pathogenicity assertions registered in ClinVar. We used the same procedure for all genes except HOXB13 because a gain-of-function missense variant in HOXB13 was considered pathogenic. We considered variants as pathogenic based on classification as pathogenic by the ACMG/AMP guidelines and/or classification as pathogenic in ClinVar. Specific details are described in Supplementary Methods (available online). Variants not registered in ClinVar on August 1, 2017, were considered novel.\n\n    Case-control association analysis was performed using Fisher exact test under a dominant model. To investigate the association of pathogenic variants with demographic and clinical characteristics, we used t tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests or Cochran-Armitage tests for discrete variables. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P less than .05 was considered statistically significant except when Bonferroni correction was applied for the association analysis between each of the eight genes and PCa (P < .006 = 0.05/8). All analyses were performed using R statistical package (ver. 3.1.3).",
        "Results": "    The mean age at PCa diagnosis was 71.0 years (SD = 6.9) (Table 1). Positive smoking history in cases (69.4%) was statistically significantly lower than that in controls (76.1%, P < .001). This reflects the fact that this proportion was the fifth smallest among 42 male diseases registered in the BioBank Japan, whereas control participants consisted of patients with complex diseases other than cancer in the same biobank. Family history of prostate, breast, or pancreatic cancers was observed in 6.8%, 4.7%, and 3.3% of patients, respectively. Other clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1.\n\n    Sequencing of the eight PCa-relevant genes identified 1456 germline variants in total. We categorized the variants according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines as follows: five pathogenic, 117 likely pathogenic, 49 benign, 90 likely benign, two variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with pathogenic as well as benign evidence, and 1193 VUS with insufficient evidence. When we compared these results with assertions in ClinVar (Supplementary Table 3, available online), there were no apparent discrepancies (variants that were pathogenic in one classification and benign in the other). Finally, we considered 136, 284 and 1036 variants as pathogenic, benign, and VUS, respectively (Supplementary Table 4, available online). Single variant association results are shown in Supplementary Table 5 (available online) for the 136 pathogenic variants and in Supplementary Table 6 (available online) for the 284 benign variants and the 1036 VUS. More than one-half (57.4%) of the pathogenic variants were novel, and 71.4% and 61.5% of pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively, were previously described in ClinVar, whereas more than one-half of pathogenic variants in the other genes were novel (Supplementary Figure 1, available online). We revisited the latest database in ClinVar on February 11, 2019, and other published works to ensure that our data were current. In total, 32 pathogenic variants were reported in four publications or ClinVar. The majority (21 variants) came from our previous large-scale sequencing study on breast cancer. Finally, 46 of 136 pathogenic variants (33.8%) are still considered novel.\n\n    We checked the locations and frequencies of the pathogenic variants (Figure 1). We observed four frequent pathogenic variants shared in five or more patients: p.Asp1540Asp in ATM (n = 12, P < .001, odds ratio [OR] = 19.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.88 to 828.78), p.Gly132Glu in HOXB13 (n = 56, P < .001, OR = 6.08, 95% CI = 3.39 to 11.59), and p.Ile1859fs (n = 11, P < .001, OR = 8.92, 95% CI = 1.95 to 82.99) and p.Arg2318* (n = 19, P < .001, OR = 15.42, 95% CI = 3.72 to 136.50) in BRCA2. The first two variants were novel. Note that we did not observe any association between the carrier status of these four variants and the 10 principal components calculated using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from 6269 of 7636 patients with PCa. This finding suggests that these pathogenic variants may be spread across Japanese populations.\n\n    We compared the frequency of carriers bearing pathogenic variants between cases and controls (Table 2). In total, 2.9% of patients and 0.8% of control participants carried a pathogenic variant (P < .001, OR = 3.66, 95% CI = 2.87 to 4.69). BRCA2 (P < .001, OR = 5.65, 95% CI = 3.55 to 9.32), HOXB13 (P < .001, OR = 4.73, 95% CI = 2.84 to 8.19), and ATM (P < .001, OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.63 to 5.15) were statistically significantly associated with PCa after Bonferroni correction. Only one patient carried two major pathogenic variants (p.Arg2318* in BRCA2 and p.Gly132Glu in HOXB13). He was diagnosed with T2bN0M0 and GS7 PCa at age 61 years and had no previous cancer history but did have a family history of breast cancer.\n\n    Various procedures of the ACMG/AMP guidelines followed in different laboratories have resulted in different interpretations of variants. We performed two types of sensitivity analyses. The first sensitivity analysis compared our method to ClinVar. We performed gene-based association analysis using pathogenic variants registered in ClinVar (n = 58, Supplementary Table 7, available online) and determined by the ACMG/AMP guidelines (n = 122, Supplementary Table 8, available online). The odds ratio of all genes was comparable (ClinVar: OR = 3.99, 95% CI = 2.68 to 6.07; ACMG/AMP: OR = 3.66, 95% CI = 2.84 to 4.74). For each gene, similar odds ratios were observed, with the exception of HOXB13-0/58 pathogenic ClinVar records vs 5/122 ACMG/AMP classifications. These data suggest that our interpretation of the ACMG/AMP guidelines would be comparable with that of ClinVar.\n\n    The second sensitivity analysis involves gene-based association analysis of rare benign variants exhibiting Minor allele frequency less than 0.01 (n = 248, Supplementary Table 9, available online) and of rare VUS (n = 1036, Supplementary Table 10, available online). The gene-based association test using benign variants actually showed no genes possessing a P less than .05. Conversely, the gene-based association test using VUS indicated that CHEK2 exhibited a P less than .001 and an OR = 1.62 (95% CI = 1.30 to 2.00). Three missense variants possessed a P less than .05, and these included p.Ala496Pro (P = .006, OR = 4.22, 95% CI = 1.41 to 15.11), p.Arg223Cys (P = .03, OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.01 to 3.92), and p.His414Tyr (P = .03, OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.04 to 4.99). Although p.Arg223Cys possessed sufficient pathogenic (PS3, PM1, and PP3) as well as benign evidence (BS1 and BP5), the others lacked sufficient evidence. Therefore, certain variants within CHEK2 may be pathogenic, and CHEK2 may contribute to the development of PCa, although additional research, including functional tests, is required to clarify this issue. It might also suggest further improvement of the ACMG/AMP guidelines.\n\n    To investigate the association of pathogenic variants with demographic and clinical characteristics of PCa, we compared these between the 219 carrier patients and the 7417 noncarrier patients (Table 3). The carriers were on average 2.0 years younger at PCa diagnosis (P < .001) and more often had histories of smoking (77.0% in carriers vs 69.2% in noncarriers, P = .02) and alcohol drinking (82.6% vs 69.8%, P < .001). Carriers also more often had a family history of breast (11.9% vs 4.5%, P < .001), pancreatic (8.7% vs 3.2%, P < .001), lung (12.3% vs 7.5%, P = .01), or liver (7.8% vs 4.6%, P = .03) cancers. There was no difference between carriers (8.2%) and noncarriers (6.8%) in family history of PCa (P = .41). The carriers also showed worse clinical characteristics in terms of Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classifications (P = .03 and P = .04 for T and M, respectively), Gleason score of at least 8 (41.0% vs 29.1%, P = .002), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) greater than 10 (64.0% vs 54.1%, P = .02). We also performed logistic regression analysis with carrier status of a pathogenic variant as a dependent variable against these 11 variables because they may be interrelated. We used 2427 of 7636 patients who did not have missing data. Supplementary Table 11 (available online) indicates that only three variables (age at diagnosis, alcohol drinking history, and family history of breast cancer) showed P less than .05, which would be explained by interrelation between some variables and/or the decreased number of samples in this analysis. The other variables should be carefully considered in further studies. We also examined the impact of pathogenic variants on age at PCa diagnosis (Figure 2, A and B). Pathogenic variants were found in 7.9% of patients diagnosed at younger than 60 years old. The proportion of pathogenic variants statistically significantly decreased with advancing age at diagnosis (P < .001) but was stable between 2% and 3% in individuals age 65 years or older.\n\n    We further analyzed these demographic and clinical characteristics in patients with variants in ATM (n = 37), BRCA2 (n = 83), or HOXB13 (n = 61) (Supplementary Table 12, available online). Although some association tests had limited statistical power because of the low number of carriers, associations with age at diagnosis, smoking history, and alcohol drinking history showed similar tendencies among the three genes. Family history of breast cancer was associated with both variants in BRCA2 (15.7% in BRCA2 carriers vs 4.5% in noncarriers, P < .001) and in HOXB13 (16.4%, P < .001). Family history of pancreatic cancer was associated with variants in BRCA2 (16.9% in BRCA2 variant carriers vs 3.2% in noncarriers, P < .001). Patients bearing pathogenic variants of BRCA2 alone showed worse clinical characteristics as shown by TNM classifications (T: P = .001, M: P = .008), Gleason score of at least 8 (51.7% in BRCA2 carriers vs 29.1% in noncarriers, P < .001), and PSA greater than 10 (70.2% vs 54.1%, P = .03).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We identified 136 pathogenic variants in eight genes in 7636 patients with PCa and 12 366 control individuals. Finally, 33.8% of the pathogenic variants were newly identified in this study. Pathogenic variants were found in 2.9% of unselected Japanese PCa patients; HOXB13, BRCA2, and ATM were the statistically significant causative genes. Patients with pathogenic variants showed specific demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\n    The Philadelphia Prostate Cancer Consensus 2017 (the Consensus) was recently published to establish a genetic evaluation framework for inherited PCa. We investigated if our study results could add more evidence to the Consensus. Regarding gene selection, the Consensus considered that both BRCA1 and BRCA2 had high-grade evidence for being related to PCa. However, our results revealed that only BRCA2 showed a statistically significant contribution to PCa, and patients carrying a pathogenic variant in this gene showed worse clinical characteristics. BRCA1 pathogenic variants, altogether or considering only the most frequent pathogenic variant observed in patients with breast cancer, p.Leu63*, showed no statistically significant association with PCa risk. PCa disease risks were calculated as 5.65 for BRCA2 and 2.27 for BRCA1. This is consistent with results of previous studies (BRCA2: 4.7-8.6 and BRCA1: 1.1-3.8). Therefore, our results suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 should be separately considered in genetic testing among Japanese patients with PCa.\n\n    We validated the importance of HOXB13, although its main pathogenic variant in our population, p.Gly132Glu, was different from those in European (p.Gly84Glu) and Chinese (p.Gly135Glu) populations. According to the Genome Aggregation Database, p.Gly84Glu was also observed in African, Ashkenazi Jewish, and Latino populations, but p.Gly132Glu and p.Gly135Glu were found only in East Asian populations. However, p.Gly132Glu and p.Gly135Glu may be subpopulation specific, given that p.Gly132Glu was not observed in 96 Chinese patients and p.Gly135Glu was not found in our Japanese cohort, suggesting that the existence of frequent pathogenic variants in each subpopulation would strongly affect the importance of HOXB13 in genetic testing for PCa.\n\n    We also provided additional support regarding the contribution to PCa of ATM with emerging evidence in the Consensus. NBN also had the same level of evidence, but we did not observe any contribution from this gene in this study of Japanese individuals. The primary evidence supporting a role of NBN came from 657del5 (p.Lys219Asnfs, rs587776650) in a Polish population, but this variant was not observed in our Japanese population. Therefore, the lack of association in this study indicates less importance of this gene in Japanese PCa rather than evidence against association in other populations. We did not observe the importance of CHEK2 and PALB2 with low or insufficient evidence in the Consensus. Taken together, the Japanese data provide evidence about the contribution of each gene to PCa and also highlight the importance of population-specific data for genetic testing.\n\n    Regarding the selection of patients for genetic testing in the Consensus, we validated the importance of family histories of breast and pancreatic cancers. Our results also showed weaker associations with family history of lung and liver cancers. Note that we did not detect a statistically significant association with family history of PCa, although it is recognized as an established risk factor. Because the proportion of patients with a family history of PCa was lower (6.8%) in Japan than that reported elsewhere at 10-15%, this finding might be explained by a lower incidence of PCa in the Japanese population. However, because incidence of PCa and life expectancy are rapidly increasing in Japan, family histories of PCa would presumably become useful for the next generation to be aware of. The importance of age at diagnosis was confirmed because patients who were younger at diagnosis were more likely to carry pathogenic variants. We also observed associations between smoking and alcohol drinking histories with carrier status, although its importance was not previously recognized. Taken together, our results provide a series of additional and unexpected evidence above and beyond the Consensus, which should inform genetic testing in PCa and promote studies about specific questions in other populations internationally.\n\n    This study had some limitations. First, risks associated with pathogenic variants might be overestimated because we selected controls age 60 years and older with no individual or family history of cancers, although the disease risk for BRCA1/2 variants was comparable with that found in previous studies. Second, we focused on eight genes based on a review article because the Consensus did not exist when this study started. The Consensus proposed DNA mismatch repair genes for Lynch syndrome, although they have less support than BRCA1/2 and HOXB13. Third, we derived the variant classifications against ACMG/AMP criteria using an automated approach and recognize that additional manual curation is required to ensure \"clinical-grade\" classifications. Finally, we considered gain-of-function missense variants in HOXB13 as pathogenic based on the previous publications examining European and Chinese populations. Further functional studies are required to confirm that the pathogenic missense variants found in this study are indeed gain-of-function variants.\n\n    In conclusion, variants predicted to alter function of BRCA2, HOXB13, and ATM were associated with PCa, and patients with a pathogenic variant showed specific demographic and clinical characteristics. The findings reported in this study may inform future genetic testing for PCa.",

        "Title": "    Clinical whole Exome Sequencing Reveals Novel Homozygous Missense Variant in the PMPCA Gene causing Autosomal Recessive Spinocerebellar Ataxia",
        "Abstract": "    Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) are rare heterogenous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum and spinal cord with an early onset before the age of 20 years. PMPCA (MIM: 613036), is a key enzyme in mitochondrial protein processing which is critical for cell survival and growth. Our objective was to investigate Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Alpha (PMPCA) mutations linked with Spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive 2 (SCAR2).\n\n    In the current study, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was done followed by Sanger sequencing for the validation of the WES results.\n\n    WES results identified a novel homozygous variant, NM_015160.2: c.802C>T p.(Arg268Trp) in PMPCA gene. Mutation in this gene leads to progressive cerebellar ataxia with fine motor skills difficulties, intentional tremors, slow slurred speech and learning difficulties in a 12-year-old Saudi patient. WES results were further validated by Sanger sequencing technique.\n\n    Identified phenotype in our case was similar as previously described for SCAR2 related conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first reported mutation in PMPCA gene leading to SCAR2 in Saudi Arabia. These findings will enrich the scarce literature, further provide a new insight on the role of PMPCA gene-related disorders leading to SCAR2 and expand the disease concept. In addition, this will help to establish a database for the disease and its causative factors will further help in controlling diseases resulting from consanguinity in Saudi population.",
        "Introduction": "    Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) are rare heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders involving the central and peripheral nervous systems; it is characterised by degeneration of the cerebellum and spinal cord; although the onset of ARCA can vary widely depending on the specific subtype and is characterised by the early onset before the age of 20 years. Clinical presentation, severity and disease progression vary between patients. Clinical phenotype ranging from cerebellar syndromes to sensorimotor neuropathy, ophthalmological disturbances, sensorineural hearing loss, motor developmental delay, involuntary movements, seizures, skeletal anomalies, skin disorders, and cognitive impairment. ARCA is challenging during diagnose, however it involves multifaceted approach including a thorough clinical history, neuroimaging, particularly Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect cerebellar atrophy, and genetic testing. Currently, there is no cure for ARCA and management primarily focuses on symptomatic relief. However, significant advancements have been made in the molecular and pathological understanding of mechanisms underlying ARCAs. These breakthroughs have unveiled novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities, reshaping the landscape of patient care and research in this field.\n\n    Type 2 autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAR2) (MIM:213200) is type of slow or non-progressive ARCA. In early childhood SCAR2 is categorized by beginning of decreased motor development and ataxic gait. Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias are complex, heterogeneous, disabling inherited neurodegenerative diseases connecting both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Studies over the past few years have illuminated the genetic underpinnings of SCAR2, linking it to mutations in the PMPCA gene.\n\n    PMPCA, located in 9q34.3 (MIM:613036), is a key enzyme in mitochondrial protein processing which is critical for cell survival. PMPCA encodes the alpha subunit of mitochondrial processing peptidase (alpha-MPP), which cleaves off the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences from precursor proteins upon their import into mitochondria. The mRNA transcript from PMPCA undergoes translation to produce a protein that forms a heterodimer with the beta subunit encoded by PMPCB. This heterodimer cleaves targeting sequences from mitochondrial precursor proteins, enabling their proper maturation and function. PMPCA is highly expressed in tissues with significant mitochondrial activity, such as the brain and muscles. Localized in the mitochondrial matrix, it plays a vital role in the mitochondrial protein import pathway, impacting cellular energy metabolism.\n\n    Therefore, PMPCA mutation causes an abnormal mitochondrial protein processing leading to the accumulation of abnormal nuclear-encoded mitochondrial precursor proteins and ultimately disrupting mitochondrial function. Over the past few years, PMPCA mutation was linked with SCAR2. In 2015, Jobling and colleagues were the first to identify variants in PMPCA from 17 subjects spanning four different families, all of whom were affected with autosomal recessive non-progressive cerebellar ataxia.\n\n    In one of the study French patient has two compound heterozygous mutations (p.Ser96Leu and p.Gly515Arg), while the other 16 Lebanese patients have homozygous missense mutations p.(Ala377Thr). These patients had gait ataxia, dysmetria and nystagmus; they presented with hypotonia and delayed gross motor, which gradually improved. Similarly, two French Canadian brothers with SCAR2 caused by a homozygous mutation in PMPCA p.(Val256Met), presented with different severity of gait impairment, dysarthria, dysmetria and distal atrophy without intellectual deficiency. On the other hand, one reported extremely severe clinical features with diffuse parenchymal volume loss as viewed on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with PMPCA variants. More recently, Takahashi et al reported a novel compound heterozygous PMPCA variants, c.667C > T p. (Arg223Cys) and c.853del p. (Asp285llefs*16), in a Japanese girl of 15 years old, who presented with a severe phenotype of a progressive developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia, and extrapyramidal symptoms.\n\n    Recently we have reported novel variant in CWF19L1 gene in a family with late-onset autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia 17 and a novel mutation in ATM gene in a female with ataxia telangiectasia. In another study, we reported autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with spasticity due to a rare mutation in GBA2 gene. Further we also reported novel mutation in CACNA1A gene with episodic ataxia type 2 and rare mutation in the SETX gene in a Saudi patient.\n\n    SCAR2 is a rare neurodegenerative disorder, and is thus for not reported in Saudi Arabia. In the current study, we report a novel homozygous variant in PMPCA gene in a 12-year-old Saudi boy with progressive cerebellar ataxia with frequent falls, slow slurred speech, learning difficulty and fine motor skills difficulties started during his childhood. The identified mutation will add value to the literature of the related disease, provide a new insight into PMPCA gene-related disorders and expand the disease concept that will further help to tackle the causative factors leading to SCAR2.",
        "Methods": "    The current study reported a 12-year-old male IV-1 proband with SCRA2 who presented since early childhood with progressive cerebellar ataxia, fine motor skills difficulties, slow slurred speech and learning difficulty without intellectual deficits. On examination, the patient was conscious and oriented with no dysmorphic features. Ophthalmic examination revealed normal ocular movement no squint or nystagmus, and normal pupillary reflex in addition to the normal cranial nerves function. Sensory examination was normal. Motor examination showed good power, dystonia, +3 deep tendon reflex, positive dysdydokinesia and intentional tremors with bilateral dysmetria. MRI examination of the patient showed abnormal intensity of the posterior limb of bilateral internal capsule, crus cerebri, pons and medulla with normal cerebellum. The patient is a product of three generations of consanguine marriages. The grandparents and the parents were first-degree cousins with three children. After the clinical details and phenotypical analysis WES was recommended for the affected proband to understand the disease genetics.\n\n    The study received approval from the local ethical committee at the Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King AbdulAziz University in Jeddah (Ref# 013-CEGMR-02-ETH). Written informed consent for laboratory and genetic tests was obtained from the patient's legal guardians. This research work done in CEGMR, King AbdulAziz University Hospital in 2022 and 2023. Blood samples from the patient and their family were taken post-DNA extraction. The experiments adhered to international guidelines following the Declaration of Helsinki 2013. DNA was extracted from the patient's blood, and preserved in EDTA tubes from Roche Life Science, following previously established methods. The DNA concentration and quality were assessed using NanodropTM 2000/2000c spectrophotometers.\n\n    After the DNA from the patient WES was done for the coding region and splice site junctions of the diseased genes. Illumine NextSeq state of the art instrument with 2x76 paired end reads was used. Reference sequences from hg19, GRCH37/UCSC was used. All sequence alterations are defined under the guidelines of Human Genome Variation society nomenclature rules. Various bioinformatics tools were used for variant calling. The products were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 2 x 76 paired-end reads as previously described.\n\n    After WES, (FASTQ) files were generated and then these files were further converted to BAM than to variant call format (vcf) files having all identified variants. Identification of variants those leading to the disease phenotype was established through rare, ulta rare, novel (MAF+0.01%) frequency, homozygosity or heterozygosity settings, structure changes and functional (predicted damage by Polyphen/SIFT), genomic position, pathogenicity, protein damaging effects etc. Moreover, online available tools and filters were applied using different Bioinformatics application, reference sequence from GRCh37 database were used.\n\n    The list of obtained variants were filtered to find out the disease linked with the identified variants in public databases, such as Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), for allele frequencies <5.0% in the http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), and nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants in disease-associated genes with a minor allele frequency <=1.0% were observed in gnomAD in dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP), HapMap (https://www.genome.gov/international-hapmap-project), 1000 Genomes Project (http://www.internationalgenome.org). We also filter candidate SNPs with the following criterion: snp quality  20, sequencing depth  4-fold, estimated copy number  2 and the distance between two SNPs is larger than five insertions and deletions (indels) in the exome regions were identified through the sequencing reads as previously done.\n\n    Various lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect of the gene and its product such as (evolutionary, splicing impact, conservation) etc. Classification of identified variants were done by using the American College of Pathologists (ACMG/AMP) criteria. HGVS nomenclature (https://varnomen.hgvs.org/) was used to report the variants. Deleterious effects and abnormalities were also identified using in silico analysis for structure and function of the identified variant leading to the disease. In silico studies were also done for missense variants to predict the effect of amino acid substitutions on protein structure. Mutation Tester (http://www.mutationtaster.org/) also predicted the variant as disease causing variant. Implementation of WES technique improves the screening and identification of novel and causative genetic variants, which aid in the diagnosis of genetic disorders.\n\n    After the WES the identified variant, it was further validated by using the gold standard Sanger sequencing technique to verify a novel homozygous missense variant in PMPCA gene. We designed the targeted primers using online free software primer 3 for PCR and for Sanger sequencing technique for all affected and normal members of the family. For PCR and sequencing, the sets of the targeted primers were designed by using the online primer 3 program. Forward primer sequence was PMPCAF:5'-ACCTGTGTCTGTGGCTCTTC-3' and the reverse primer sequence was PMPCAR:5'-GCAGTCAACACCTATCACCC-3'. After sequencing the files were obtained from the AB1 sequencing unit. The obtained files were aligned with the reference sequence using the BioEdit software.\n\n    The PMPCA sequence retrieved from the Uniprot database. SWISS-MODEL2 was used to produce the homology model. Models were manually inspected, and mutations evaluated, using the Pymol program (pymol.org).",
        "Results": "    Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) results identified a novel homozygous variant, NM_015160.2: c.802C>T p. (Arg268Trp) in PMPCA (MIM:613036) gene. The patient was homozygous for the PMPCA variant c.802C>T where p.(Arg268Trp) amino acid was changed in the protein. The parents were heterozygous carriers who were first-degree cousins, as depicted in the pedigree Fig.1. Sanger sequencing chromatogram in Fig.2 showed that both the parents III-1 and III-2 are heterozygous carriers having C/T on both alleles. The affected child is a 12 years old boy IV-1 was homozygous having T/T and two of his siblings IV-2 (a boy) and IV-3 (a girl) were heterozygous carrier both having C/T alleles while the wild type control has C/C base pair on both allele. Further validation was performed by using 100 normal control samples from Saudi Arabia to confirm that the identified variant is not present in the normal population. To our knowledge, this variant has not been previously reported in the literature, and this is the first reported SCAR2 case in Saudi Arabia.\n\n    Moreover, the variant is not reported in gnomAD exomes and 1000 genomes. There is a physiochemical difference between arginine and tryptophan. The clinical and molecular assessments consistently diagnosed the PMPCA (MIM:613036). PP1 co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease. Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact) etc.\n\n    Furthermore, the results of in-silico tools, commercially and publicly available, are used to aid in interpreting sequence variants identified the variant as disease-causing. Moreover, protein alignment of the identified variants leading to the protein change was studied. It showed that sequence of Arginine is absolutely conserved in the region between different species throughout evolution including mammals, reptiles and nematode as shown in (Fig.3). PMPCA gene encode substrate recognition and binding subunit sites of the essential mitochondrial processing protease (MPP), which is required for maturation of the majority of mitochondrial precursor proteins. This substitution of arginine to tryptophan would result in disruption of enzyme activity and further this substitution may increase in net negative charge of the protein through the inability of the uncharged tryptophan side-chain to polarize the substrate carbonyl bond. Structure of wild type and mutated proteins are shown in Fig.4.",
        "Conclusion": "    This study reported the first case of SCAR2 from a Saudi family where a novel homozygous variant, c.802C>T p.(Arg268Trp) in PMPCA was identified. This case is reporting a rare disease and a rare genetic variant related to the PMPCA gene in Saudi Arabia will further expanding the knowledge about the mutation spectrum of PMPCA, helping to address SCAR2 in the future.

        "Discussion": "    This study reported the first case of SCAR2 from a Saudi family where a novel homozygous variant, c.802C>T p.(Arg268Trp) in PMPCA was identified. Our case presented the typical SCAR2 phenotype with additional motor skill issues, uncommon in SCAR2. PMPCA encodes for alpha-MPP, which is essential for precursor cleavage from mitochondrial proteins to attain their function. Disruption of alpha-MPP is attributable to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondrial precursor proteins, which disturb mitochondrial function and stop cell viability. Any mutation in PMPCA variants changeMMP expression and decrease frataxin (a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein) which play an important role in MMP cleavage pathways, for the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur cluster in cells. Friedreich ataxia is caused by GAA triplet repeat expansions in the first intron of the frataxin gene. Iron accumulation in cerebellum and basal ganglia was noted clinically in Friedreich ataxia patients. This neurogenetic pathophysiology may explain why PMPCA gene variants are important to cause the phenotype of extrapyramidal symptoms as well as cerebellar ataxia and suspected iron accumulation in brain imaging.\n\n    In recent years, PMPCA has been found to cause SCAR2, with typical phenotype of gait ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria, nystagmus and intellectual disability in most cases. Joshi et al, reported a large family with two members presenting with PMPCA mutation; both patients presented at the age of six months with severe developmental delay and failure to thrive with ocular manifestations including bilateral ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia; one died due to severe hypertrophic left ventricular cardiomyopathy and liver failure.\n\n    Our case presented with the typical phenotype in addition to fine motor skills difficulties, intentional tremors, learning difficulty and slurred speech; however, the patient had neither intellectual disability nor nystagmus. This might be justified by the normal cerebellum examined by MRI in this current study, whereas other studies have shown mainly atrophied cerebellum. Furthermore, Takahashi et al, also reported the involvement of bilateral globus pallidum and substantia nigra along with cerebellar cortex and vermis in which the patient presented with cerebellar symptoms in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms with cogwheel rigidity and dystonic features. Full characterisation of the SCAR2 due to PMPCA mutation based on the literature are summaries by Takahashi et al.\n\n    PMPCA variants have been shown to follow a mild and non-progressive course of cerebellar ataxia and developmental delay. However, Choquet et al. presented a case of two brothers with considerably different severity; one showed a slowly progressive spinocerebellar with learning difficulties during adolescence, while his sibling had a severe form of the disease with hemidystonia and neurosensorial hearing loss at the age of five years. Severe and progressive presentation of the disease was also reported from a Japanese 15-year-old girl during infancy. Brain MRI reported extremely severe clinical features with diffuse parenchymal volume loss in the patients having PMPCA variants.\n\n    In another study the patient also exhibited poor body movements during sleep, characteristic findings seen in Segawa disease, which suggests low dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway. Similarly, the patient from the current study presented at the age of 12 with regression of health started in early childhood with tremors, progressive gait abnormality and fine motor skills difficulties with preserved intellectual function.\n\n    In the current study, validated WES results by Sanger sequencing identified a homozygous variant, NM_015160.2: c.802C>T p.(Arg268Trp) in PMPCA gene in a 12 year-old-male patient, proband IV-1. The parents, who were first-degree cousins, were heterozygous carriers and his brother IV-2 and sister IV-3 are heterozygous carrier for the disease. PMPCA gene variants from previous studies are summarised in Table-I.\n\n    Furthermore, SCAR2, due to PMPCA mutations, is an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Therefore, consanguinity is a major player in the disease inheritance. Having said that, the reported cases were both nonconsanguineous and consanguineous parents,, the patient from the current study, however, was a product of three generations of consanguine marriages. Consanguinity is an inherited practice in Saudi Arabia which increases the prevalence of genetic diseases. WES technique is dedicated to identifying genetic defects in patients with suspected genetic disorders. The diagnostic capability of WES ranges between 25 to 35%, with trio analysis yielding a maximum of 40%. Identifying pathological genetic variants will help in genetic counselling and aid in developing therapeutic strategies against the disease through prenatal testing.\n\n    Further functional studies and collection of the patients with PMPCA gene variants would be important steps to understand the pathophysiology of the disease.",

        "Title": "    Mitochondrial Processing Peptidases:Structure, Function and the Role in Human Diseases",
        "Abstract": "    Mitochondrial proteins are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. While some of the essential subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes responsible for cellular ATP production are synthesized directly in the mitochondria, most mitochondrial proteins are first translated in the cytosol and then imported into the organelle using a sophisticated transport system. These proteins are directed mainly by targeting presequences at their N-termini. These presequences need to be cleaved to allow the proper folding and assembly of the pre-proteins into functional protein complexes. In the mitochondria, the presequences are removed by several processing peptidases, including the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), the inner membrane processing peptidase (IMP), the inter-membrane processing peptidase (MIP), and the mitochondrial rhomboid protease (Pcp1/PARL). Their proper functioning is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis as the disruption of any of them is lethal in yeast and severely impacts the lifespan and survival in humans. In this review, we focus on characterizing the structure, function, and substrate specificities of mitochondrial processing peptidases, as well as the connection of their malfunctions to severe human diseases.",
        "Introduction": "    Mitochondria are vital components of all eukaryotes. They supply their cells with energy, maintain calcium homeostasis and biosynthesize heme and steroid molecules. They are also the main junction point of several metabolic and signaling pathways. Rather unsurprisingly, therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction is connected with an enormous range of diseases including myopathies (e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)), processes involved in ageing, and various types of cancers.\n\n    Generally, proper mitochondrial function depends on two sets of proteins. The smaller set is synthesized directly inside the mitochondria, while the larger set is synthesized on the cytosolic ribosomes. Cytosolically synthesized proteins have a presequence on their N-terminus that causes them to be imported into mitochondria using a complex transportation system. After translation, cytosolic heat shock proteins chaperone the unfolded polypeptides to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Here, they are recognized by the receptors of the TOM (translocase of the outer membrane) complex and cross the outer membrane. In the intermembrane space, mitochondrial pre-proteins are immediately directed to the TIM23 (translocase of the inner membrane) complex for further translocation into the mitochondrial matrix (Figure 1).\n\n    Outer mitochondrial membrane proteins and inner mitochondrial membrane carrier proteins possess an N-terminal, C-terminal and/or internal signal sequences instead of a cleavable presequence. Upon mitochondrial localization, the N-terminal presequence must be removed to avoid problems with further sorting and protein folding and assembly. For this task, specialized metalloproteinases, mitochondrial processing peptidases, have evolved.\n\n    The mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) plays an essential role in this process: MPP deletion was shown to be lethal. MPP is responsible for processing the protein precursors that are fully translocated in the mitochondrial matrix as well as the precursors in transit to the inner membrane or inter-membrane space (Figure 1). Several inter-membrane proteins possess a so called bipartite presequence consisting of both a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) cleaved by MPP and also of an intermembrane space-sorting signal that is subsequently eliminated by the inner membrane peptidase (IMP) residing in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Figure 1).\n\n    In addition, some proteins possess a typical octapeptide (Phe/Leu/Ile-XX-Ser/Thr/Gly-XXXX) in their targeting presequence and after cleavage by MPP, are further processed by the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP) located in the mitochondrial matrix. Moreover, a rhomboid-type serine protease, Pcp1 in yeast and PARL in humans, was also shown to act in the processing of several mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. The peptidases involved in presequence cleavage are quite conserved in eukaryotes, including yeast and humans, which reflects their vital role in mitochondrial biogenesis. In humans, mutations in these peptidases were reported to have an impact on the development of several serious diseases including neuropsychiatric disorders, Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCAR2), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (see Table 1 below).\n\n    Here, we provide an overview of the mitochondrial processing peptidases, their functions, substrates, and the diseases associated with their mutations.\n\n    The principal responsibility of the mitochondrial processing peptidase is to remove the N-terminal targeting presequences of proteins imported into the mitochondria (Figure 1). MPP is a hetero-dimeric protein consisting of two subunits, alpha and beta, which are referred to as PMPCA and PMPCB in humans (Figure 2A and Figure 3A,B). Yeast MPP is the only mitochondrial processing peptidase with a known crystal structure, although structures of several others have recently been predicted by AlphaFold. These subunits together create a large substrate-binding cavity with a Zn2+-binding site on the MPPbeta subunit (Figure 2B). Peptide bind cleavage is thought to occur through a reaction similar to that of thermolysin: a water molecule complexed to the Zn2+ ion is polarized by nearby glutamate, thereby allowing it to carry out a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of the peptide bond. The Zn2+-binding site itself is created by a conserved HxxEHx76E motif in the MPPbeta subunit (Figure 3B); the mutation of any of these residues eliminates Zn2+ binding and blocks the peptidase activity. Although the beta subunit contains the entirety of the catalytic site, the cooperation of action of both MPP subunits is required for proper processing of pre-proteins.\n\n    The most conserved part of all known MPPalpha subunits is a glycine-rich loop (Figure 2A,C and Figure 3A) (GRL; residues G284GGGSFSAGGPGKGMYS300 in yeast MPPalpha), which is essential for substrate binding and which moves the precursor protein towards the active site through a multistep process. A crystal structure of an inactive yeast mutant MPP complexed to a peptide substrate showed that the peptide bound in an extended conformation in the active site (Figure 2D), forming a short series of beta-sheet-like interactions with the beta-sheets of MPPbeta before proteolysis occurred. An electrostatic analysis of the complex showed that the binding cavity was strongly negatively-charged while the substrate peptide is positively charged (Figure 2E,F).\n\n    MPP processes the N-terminal signal presequences of the majority of pre-proteins imported into the mitochondria. Although the presequences can vary in length and amino-acid composition, they have several common properties. They are all predicted to form an amphiphilic alpha-helix, have an overall positive charge, and have an arginine residue at position -2 or -3 from the cleavage site.\n\n    Besides, MPP has been shown responsible for the processing of precursor proteins that are post-translationally cleaved into polypeptides functioning as separate enzymes. For example, Arg5,6 from S. cerevisiae synthesized in the cytosol is after the import into mitochondria first cleaved by MPP to be disposed of its MTS and then internally processed to form two distinct enzymes, Arg5 (N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase) and Arg6 (acetylglutamate kinase).\n\n    Moreover, PMPCA has been reported to be SUMOylated at multiple sites. Its SUMOylation was shown important for the processing of thioredoxin 2 (TRX2) in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Such post-translationally modified MPP binds the SUMO interaction motif present in TRX2, which mediates its presequence processing. When the SUMO motif of MPP was mutated, TRX2 existed only as the precursor form, which was unable to protect cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress-induced senescence.\n\n    Deletion of both MPP encoding genes (MPPA and MPPB) is incompatible with the viability of S. cerevisiae under any and all growth conditions, including even anaerobic growth. In humans, mutations in either PMPCA or PMPCB cause mitochondrial diseases that are characterized by neurological disorders with early childhood onset and a severe neurodegenerative course (Figure 3A,B).\n\n    Jobling et al. were the first to associate defects in PMPCA with human mitochondrial disease (Table 1). They identified mutations in PMPCA in 17 patients from four families affected with autosomal recessive non-progressive cerebellar ataxia: a homozygous missense mutation c.1129G>A (p.Ala377Thr), located in close proximity to the conserved glycine-rich loop, and the heterozygous mutations c.287C>T (p.Ser96Leu) and c.1543G>A (p.Gly515Arg), located in two other conserved regions (Figure 3A). They found that patients with these mutations had reduced levels of PMPCA and altered frataxin (FXN) processing. Frataxin is involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in the mitochondria and its cleavage results in an intermediate form (amino acids 42-210) that is further processed into its mature isoform (amino acids 81-210). Patients' cells showed an abnormal accumulation of the FXN42-210 isoform and decreased levels of the mature FXN81-210 isoform resulting in an increased mitochondrial oxidation/reduction ratio, which may occur due to the reduced electron flux in the respiratory chain. The accumulation of unprocessed frataxin leads to the manifestation of non-progressive autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, a neurological disorder characterized by the onset of impaired motor development and ataxic gait in early childhood. Brain imaging of affected individuals revealed cerebellar atrophy and the loss of fine motor skills, dysarthria, nystagmus, cerebellar signs, and delayed cognitive development with intellectual disability. Overall, the disorder is non- or slowly progressive, with patients typically surviving into adulthood.\n\n    Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, Koutnikova et al. found that frataxin is also a direct partner of human PMPCB. A deficiency in mitochondrial levels of FXN causes Friedreich's ataxia, an autosomal-recessive degenerative disease, which is associated with abnormal intramitochondrial iron handling. Experiments suggested that two C-terminal missense mutations of FXN found in patients with FRDA (Gly127Val and Ile151Phe) modulate its interaction with PMPCB resulting in lower FXN processing efficiency which may contribute to its pathogenicity.\n\n    Recently, a novel heterozygous PMPCA variant c.677C>T (p.Arg223Cys) with a deletion of c.853del (p.Asp285Ilefs*16) was reported in a 15-year-old Japanese girl with severe and progressive developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal symptoms that seem to represent a new type of SCAR2 (Table 1). Here, again, the deficiency of functional FXN results in an excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation, reduced iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster formation vital for the mitochondrial ATP production and increased oxidative damage. The magnetic resonance imaging of her brain showed extensive cerebellar atrophy and excessive iron accumulation in deep grey matter nuclei.\n\n    Also, the brain imaging of a 7-year-old boy with global psychomotor delay, spastic-ataxic gait and upper limb dystonia showed cerebellar atrophy and an advancing hyperintensity in the striatum. A homozygous mutation in PMPCA, c.553C>T (p.Arg185Trp) was identified as manifesting with multiple defects of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and signs of mitochondrial proliferation (Table 1).\n\n    Another PMPCA homozygous missense mutation, c.766G>A (p.Val256Met), was identified in two siblings with cerebellar ataxia (Table 1). Here, an immunoblot analysis did not reveal decreased levels of PMPCA, but, like the Ala377Thr mutation mentioned above, a consistent increase in the levels of the FXN42-210 isoform and a decrease in the levels of the FXN81-210 isoform was present. In contrast to the majority of patients described by Jobling et al., these patients seem to have a milder course of disease without any intellectual disability.\n\n    In addition, a c.1066G>A (p.Gly356Ser) mutation in the glycine-rich loop (residues 345-358) of PMPCA together with the c.1129G>A (p.Ala377Thr) mutation, located 20 residues downstream of the loop, leads to a severe mitochondrial disease manifested by muscle weakness, extensive brain atrophy, visual impairment, and respiratory defects (Table 1). Once again, the disease is associated with a reduction in PMPCA levels, abnormal frataxin processing and swollen mitochondria. Since MPP is responsible for the cleavage of imported subunits, its mutated form could lead to an incomplete processing of PMPCA itself and, consequently, further problems in assembling a functional MPP complex. Interestingly, the unassembled yeast MPPalpha was shown to be degraded by the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease Lon.\n\n    Because it holds the catalytic site, the PMPCB subunit has a relatively mutation-intolerant gene, which is why PMPCB variants occur rather rarely. In 2018, however, Vogtle et al. found that mutations to PMPCB were the primary cause of a mitochondrial disease resulting in Leigh-like neurodegeneration with very early and surprisingly strong impairment of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. The decreased activity or dysfunction of Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes lead to massive defects in crucial cellular functions. In patients, this manifests as a complex neurodegenerative condition with prominent cerebellar atrophy in early childhood. They reported several biallelic PMPCB variants (c.523C>T (p.Arg175Cys) with c.601G>C (p.Ala201Pro), c.524G>A (p.Arg175His) with c.530T>G (p.Val177Gly); and c.1265T>C (p.Ile422Thr)) (Table 1), all of which affect amino-acid residues that are highly conserved in yeast and humans (Figure 3B). To better understand the effect of these mutations on human MPP activity, they employed the crystal structure of yeast MPP. Although these mutations did not directly influence its catalytic activity, they may result in changes in PMPCB stability, protein folding, accessibility of the active site, or dimer formation.\n\n    Disruptions in mitochondrial metabolism are also typical for cancer cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors constantly evolve resistance to cytotoxic and targeted agents, resulting in failed treatment and tumor recurrence. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening identified a transcript that conferred higher susceptibility to sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor used to treat advanced HCC; additional screening suggested that MPP could be a candidate and that silencing the PMPCB enhanced PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1)-Parkin signaling and downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 (induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1), thus sensitizing the HCC tumor cells to sorafenib therapy, potentially opening its use for the treatment of liver cancer.\n\n    The mitochondrial inner membrane peptidase is responsible for the maturation of proteins transported into the mitochondrial inter-membrane space (Figure 1). These include mature proteins synthesized both within the mitochondria (e.g., yeast mitochondrially encoded subunit 2 of cytochrome c oxidase, Cox2), or nuclear-encoded proteins synthesized in the cytosol and then transported into the mitochondria (e.g., yeast cytochrome b2, Cyb2, cytochrome c1, Cyt1, and NADH cytochrome b5 reductase, Mcr1).\n\n    Structurally, IMP consists of two subunits; in humans, these are IMMP1L (inner membrane mitochondrial peptidase 1-like) and IMMP2L (inner membrane mitochondrial peptidase 2-like), and in S. cerevisiae there are three subunits, Imp1, Imp2, and Som1. Although the sequence identities between the individual yeast and human IMP homologues are relatively low (between 25-37%; Figure 4A), their tertiary structures, as predicted by AlphaFold, share a number of common features (Figure 4B-E). It should be noted here that the AlphaFold structures, both of IMP and those below, are only predicted structures and are to illustrate features that were originally derived from biochemical experiments or sequence analysis. All four IMP homologues are predicted to have a membrane-anchored alpha-helical N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain. The yeast Imp1 and Imp2 subunits (Figure 4B,C) share 31% amino-acid sequence identity and both possess catalytic activity and are bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The catalytic domain possesses a catalytic Ser/Lys dyad, which is present in all four proteins (Figure 4) and is structurally located in the C-terminal region. The third yeast subunit, Som1, most likely serves to recognize substrates and was shown to physically interact with Imp1. Surprisingly, Som1 seems to be important for the Imp1-mediated proteolytic processing of Cox2 and Mcr1, but not for the maturation of the Cyb2 and Cyt1 cytochromes processed by the Imp2 subunit.\n\n    Two conserved glycine residues in the middle of the catalytic domain of both Imp1 and Imp2 subunits (Figure 4A) are necessary for either mutual subunit stabilization or overall proteolytic activity. Of these two residues, the glycine closest to the catalytic lysine appeared to be important for mutual subunit stability, while the one closer to the C-terminus is vital for proteolytic activity. Interestingly, while the C-terminally located glycines are conserved in both human subunits (IMMP1L and IMMP2L), the glycine closest to the catalytic lysine appears only in IMMP1L but not IMMP2L (Figure 4A).\n\n    The currently known natural Imp1 substrates all possess a characteristic [I/V][H/D/F/M][N][D/E] amino-acid motif surrounding the cleavage site (indicated by  ). Although the substrate specificities for Imp1 and Imp2 do not overlap, there are recognizable similarities between the protein precursors that they cleave. These include a hydrophobic residue at position -3 from the cleavage site and, for the nucleus-encoded substrates, the distances between the transmembrane segment and the cleavage site are also preserved. The accessibility of the cleavage site to the peptidase is also a prerequisite for cleavage by IMP.\n\n    In humans, the IMP homolog, IMMP2L (Figure 4E) has a 41% similarity to the yeast Imp2 subunit and a 90% similarity to the mouse IMMP2L. It is composed of 175 amino acids with a gene of 860 kb located on chromosome 7q (AUTS1 locus), whose integrity has been shown to be critical for the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). IMMP2L is expressed at a basal level in all human tissues except for the lungs and liver of adults.\n\n    Mutations associated with the gene encoding IMMP2L have been observed in several neurodegenerative diseases (Table 1). In 2001, Petek et al. were the first to link IMMP2L mutation to a childhood-onset neurobehavioral disorder called Gills de la Tourette syndrome or Tourette's syndrome (GTS/TS). A boy with a de novo inverted duplication of a DNA segment on the long arm of chromosome 7 did not develop typical autistic symptoms but was observed to suffer from involuntary motor and vocal tics (typical GTS features), delayed speech development, depression, and several other conditions. Likewise, intragenic microdeletions in IMMP2L were connected to a neurological disorder in patients aged 14 months to 9 years, and are thought to be a risk factor for the development of neurological diseases, including not only TS, but also attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ASD, and schizophrenia. Gimelli et al. found IMMP2L microdeletions in four patients diagnosed with a neurological disorder. These patients showed dysmorphisms, hypotension, psychomotor and language delay, microcephaly and occasionally epilepsy. One patient showed some autistic symptoms, while two others showed mild skeletal defects. Autism has also been observed in patients having two single-nucleotide base-pair changes in IMMPL2. Furthermore, a copy number variation of the IMMP2L gene has also been observed in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\n    The IMMP2L gene contains a neuronal leucine-rich repeat gene (LRRN3) located on its large third intron, which is highly expressed during fetal brain development. Studies in both Drosophila and mice demonstrated that the LRR family members could play an important role in various stages of neuronal development thus, making LRRN3 another interesting candidate for autism. Moreover, dysregulation of genes involved in central nervous system development has been observed in the knockdown of IMMP2L in human primary astrocytes. However, Zhang et al. did not confirm the association between IMMP2L deletions and the development of ASD, although they did find that the prevalence of IMMP2L deletions in patients was higher (3%) than in the negative controls (1.52%). Therefore, they believe that IMMP2L could play a role in autism spectrum disorders as an imprinting gene.\n\n    Similar to its yeast homolog, the IMMP2L subunit is responsible for cleaving the targeting sequence of cytochrome c1 and mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2) recognized by Imp1 in yeast. In mice, mutations in both IMMP2L alleles cause an impairment in Cyt1 and GPD2 maturation. Mouse mitochondria without IMMP2L were shown to produce an increasing amount of superoxide but showed normal GPD2 and mitochondrial respiratory complex III activities, as well as the normal level of mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity. However, IMMP2L knockdown mice were observed to suffer from erectile dysfunction and oogenesis, bladder dysfunction, reduced food intake, early onset of ataxia and kyphosis, and age-dependent spermatogenic damage. Liu et al. suggested that the given symptoms are caused by the high production of superoxide in their mitochondria and its negation of nitric oxide (NO) acting as a signaling molecule and consequently, the increased production of other forms of ROS. As a result, ageing IMMP2L knockdown mice showed degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons, which could be treated with the antioxidant SkQ1 targeted to the mitochondria, which reduced the effects of oxidative stress in mice tissues. A heterozygous mutation in mouse IMMP2L was associated with increased cases of infarction, increased ischemic brain damage and cerebellar granule neurons apoptosis.\n\n    IMMP2L can also act in cell fate determination, particularly in \"switching\" between senescence and cell death, as the cell death regulator, and one of its substrates is AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor 1), a component of mitochondrial respiratory complex I. In healthy cells, IMMP2L cleaves GPD2, which further participates in the normal signaling cascade; however, upon oxidative stress, IMMP2L processes AIF, which becomes active and triggers a signaling cascade that leads the damaged cell into apoptosis. Conversely, in cells that are \"programmed\" for the senescence process, the IMMP2L-GPD2 pathway is \"turned off\", resulting in non-functional phospholipid biosynthesis, reduced cell growth and further ageing. Senescence is associated with high levels of ROS. Thus, IMMP2L and GPD2 act as pro-survival proteins, while IMMP2L and AIF function proapoptically in cells damaged by oxidative stress. A shutdown of IMMP2L signaling is associated with the natural ageing process and protects against the premature apoptosis of senescent cells arising from the increased level of ROS in mitochondria that naturally occurs. According to these findings, IMMP2L could be a new biomarker for senescence and could contribute to healthy longevity.\n\n    The mitochondrial intermediate peptidase is important for the maturation of a subgroup of precursor proteins imported into the mitochondrial matrix or embedded into the mitochondrial inner membrane. These pre-proteins are first processed by MPP and only afterwards by MIP, which cleaves an additional octapeptide following MPP cleavage. The cleavage site targeted by MIP is characterized by an RX(F/L/I)XX(T/S/G)XXXX motif and is located at the C-terminus of a leader peptide . Active MIP is a soluble monomer of 75 kDa in yeast and 81 kDa in humans (Figure 5). Its proteolytic activity is stimulated by manganese, magnesium and calcium ions while 1 mM Co2+, Fe2+ or Zn2+ completely inhibits it. Unlike MPP, MIP is also sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and other sulfhydryl reagents.\n\n    Positioning at the substrate N-terminus and a large hydrophobic residue (phenylalanine, leucine and isoleucine) at position -8 from the cleavage site are both essential features for cleavage by MIP; this type of substrate specificity is not shared by any other known peptidase.\n\n    In S. cerevisiae, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is severely affected when mip1 is missing. Branda et al. showed that at least three vital components of the yeast mitochondrial gene expression machinery:mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit protein MrpS28, single-stranded DNA-binding protein Rim1, and elongation factor Tuf1:are processed by MIP. These proteins are essential for maintaining mitochondrial protein synthesis and mitochondrial DNA replication, which explains why the loss of mip1 impairs the mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS subunits. MIP1 disruption also results in the failure of at least two yeast nuclear-encoded respiratory chain components, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (Cox4) and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of cytochrome bc1 catalytic subunit, to be cleaved.\n\n    In humans, MIP is encoded by the MIPEP gene, which contains 19 exons and is located on chromosome 13q12.12. MIPEP is expressed at high levels in energy-dependent tissues, such as the heart, brain, skeletal muscles, and pancreas. Previously, some patients were reported with mutations in MIPEP which may have been linked to their diagnoses, but the first study showing that MIPEP is truly involved in a human disease was published in 2016 by Eldomery et al. (Table 1). They identified several single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the MIPEP gene that caused a loss of MIP function in four unrelated patients suffering from an oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. All four children presented left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), delayed development, seizures, hypotonia, cataracts, and infantile or early childhood death caused by cardiomyopathy. A similar study described a patient with a heterozygous MIPEP mutation, who also had a developmental delay, severe intellectual disability and hypotonia, however, unlike the previous ones, did not suffer from cardiomyopathy at the age of 20 (Table 1). Further studies in human fibroblasts showed that MIP has an important role in OXPHOS function since its loss impaired the processing of several OXPHOS subunits, including the OXPHOS complexes I, IV and V. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein, OXA1L, which is involved in the proper assembly of OXPHOS complexes I, IV and V, was also found to be a MIP substrate. In patients with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type II and cancer morbidity and mortality, MIPEP was also found to be one of the most hypomethylated genes in white adipose tissue; this led to an increased expression of MIP. In non-metastatic prostate cancer, 11 genes associated with mitochondrial integrity and function were downregulated, including both MIPEP and IMMP2L. Decreased IMMP2L expression was also correlated with cancer-related fatigue in prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, which suggests that impairment of mitochondrial function may be involved in the development of radiation-induced fatigue. Finally, Pawlowski et al. described five genes with the most significant expression changes in malignant canine mammary tumors from the lowest to the highest grade of tumor malignancy. One of them was MIPEP, which had increased expression in grade III tumors and the lowest expression in grade I tumors; it could thus serve as a potential marker of mammary malignancy in dogs.\n\n    The mitochondrial rhomboid protease:Pcp1 (processing of cytochrome c peroxidase protein 1) in yeast and PARL (presenilin-associated rhomboid-like) in humans:plays an essential role in mitochondrial quality control and steady-state maintenance. Pcp1/PARL is a member of the rhomboid family of intramembrane serine proteases, which have a core consisting of transmembrane helices (Figure 6). Preliminary cellular localization studies demonstrated that the N-terminal part of PARL is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, while its C-terminus extends into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Conserved serine and histidine catalytic residues (Ser256/His313 in Pcp1, and Ser277/His335 in PARL; Figure 6A) are responsible for its intramembrane proteolytic activity.\n\n    While there is no significant conservation in the N-terminal regions of yeast Pcp1 and human PARL (Figure 6A), this region is strongly conserved among vertebrates, especially in mammals. The N-terminal domain of PARL is processed by two cleavages (Figure 6A,C). The first is mediated by MPP, which removes the mitochondrial targeting sequence, while the second is developmentally regulated and depends on PARL's own intramembrane-cleaving protease activity. The PARLDelta53 truncated form (without its MTS) is considered to be its mature form and is predominantly present in lung, brain, heart and muscle tissues. The second cleavage occurs at Ser77 and releases the so-called Pbeta peptide, whose sequence is conserved only in mammals. This Pbeta peptide is exported into the nucleus and contributes to mammalian-specific, developmentally regulated signaling between the mitochondria and nucleus. Phosphorylation of PARL has also been proposed to play a key role in regulating its activity. Ser65, Thr69, and Ser70 have all been identified as possible PARL phosphorylation sites: phosphomimetic mutations at these sites dramatically reduced Pbeta-cleavage and the PARLDelta77 production. As a result of that, phosphorylation increases PARLDelta53 levels, which enhances its activity towards substrates.\n\n    The C-terminal parts of Pcp1 and PARL have higher sequence identity, where several transmembrane alpha-helices are located (Figure 6A-C). Six of them are present in both Pcp1 and PARL, while PARL has an additional transmembrane alpha-helix (H4 in Figure 6A). Both proteins possess endopeptidase activity and their catalytic dyads, Ser256 and His313 in Pcp1 and Ser277 and His335 in PARL, are highly conserved and both occur in the transmembrane helices in their respective proteases (Figure 6A).\n\n    Yeast Pcp1 is known to process two mitochondrial substrates, cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1), and mitochondrial genome maintenance protein 1 (Mgm1), a mitochondrial outer membrane dynamin-like GTPase. Both substrates are processed in two steps. For Ccp1, its MTS initially directs the import of the Ccp1 pre-protein until its transmembrane segment is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Subsequently, a heme is bound to apo-Ccp1, causing it to fold and become resistant to proteases acting in the intermembrane space. The transmembrane segment of Ccp1 is then further translocated and removed by m-AAA, and subsequently processed by the intramembrane proteolytic activity of Pcp1. The second yeast Pcp1 substrate, Mgm1, was shown to exist in two different lengths, both of which are required for its proper functioning. The large Mgm1 isoform, which contains an N-terminal transmembrane segment, is processed by MPP after import into the mitochondria. This functional isoform is an integral inner membrane protein facing the intermembrane space. Part of it is later processed by Pcp1 and loses its anchoring transmembrane domain. Yeasts lacking Pcp1 were shown to be defective in Mgm1 processing, leading to increased levels of the full-length protein and reduced levels of its shorter isoform. A Pcp1-deficient yeast strain was unable to grow in a glycerol medium and displayed striking mitochondrial morphological abnormalities, such as mitochondrial fragmentation, aggregation, and loss of mitochondrial DNA.\n\n    Mammalian PARL is responsible for the processing of several mitochondrial substrates, e.g., the serine protease HTRA2 (high-temperature requirement factor A2), the serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1, the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PGAM5 (phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5), and OPA1 (optic atrophy protein 1), the human homolog of yeast Mgm1. Full-length HTRA2 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, whereas PARL-processed/activated HTRA2 is released into the intermembrane space. Processed HTRA2 regulates apoptosis in human lymphocytes by preventing the accumulation of the pro-apoptotic regulator Bax in an active form. PARL is thus implicated in regulating the survival of lymphocytes and neurons. An in vivo study investigating the role of PARL and HTRA2 in mouse striatal neuronal injury occurring after transient global brain ischemia found a parallel decrease in neuronal PARL expression and processed HTRA2 levels, consistent with the possibility that HTRA2 could be a pathophysiologically relevant PARL substrate in these stress conditions. Moreover, PARL downregulation through siRNA silencing significantly worsened the outcome of transient ischemia.\n\n    In functional mitochondria with an intact electrochemical potential, full-length 63 kDa PINK1 is imported into the mitochondria through the outer and inner membrane translocases, the TOM and TIM complexes. In the matrix, the mitochondrial targeting sequence is removed by MPP, and the remaining 60 kDa protein is inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Membrane-docked PINK1 is then rapidly cleaved between position Ala-103 and Phe-104 in its transmembrane domain by PARL to generate a 53 kDa form, which relocates to the cytosol; cytosolic PINK1 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome following the N-end rule pathway. A large mitochondrial accumulation of PINK1 is observed upon the downregulation or genetic activation of PARL.\n\n    Unlike PINK1, the processing of the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PGAM5 is increased when the mitochondrial potential has collapsed, which shows that it has a role in stress response and is regulated in an opposite way by PARL. The overexpression and downregulation of PARL also substantially influences the levels of PGAM5.\n\n    By analogy with yeast Mgm1, OPA1 should be a substrate for PARL, but several other proteases also operate in producing mature OPA1 forms and it is thought that PARL cleaves OPA1 only under specific physiological or pathophysiological conditions. It has also been suggested that OPA1 and PARL interact in a non-enzymatic manner.\n\n    Recent proteomic analyses identified several additional PARL substrates including a subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, TTC19 (tetratricopeptide repeat domain 19), the pro-apoptotic protein Smac (second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases), the mitochondrial lipid transferase STARD7 (StAR-related lipid transfer protein 7), and CLPB (caseinolytic peptidase B), a putative mitochondrial chaperone. The identification of these substrates further supports the role of PARL in mitochondrial homeostasis.\n\n    The membrane localization of PARL assumes its interactions with lipids located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). In humans, PARL interacts with cardiolipin, a lipid exclusive to the IMM of eukaryotic cells. Cardiolipin represents approximately 10 % of total cellular lipids and is essential for the activity of numerous IMM proteins. Also, it significantly increases the in vitro activity of PARL, which could either enhance the protease stability or contribute to the conformational changes supporting the substrate binding or substrate entrance to the PARL active site.\n\n    The phenotype of Parl-/- or PARL-deficient mice is characterized by progressive multisystemic atrophy from their fourth postnatal week, eventually resulting in cachectic death. A more detailed study found that in Parl-/- fibroblasts and myoblasts, and in purified Parl-/- liver mitochondria, enhanced mitochondrial network remodeling and the mobilization of cristae stores of cytochrome c occurred, suggesting that PARL and OPA1 could be part of the same molecular pathway of death.\n\n    Reduced PARL levels have also been connected with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and ageing (Table 1). Civitarese et al. showed that lowering PARL levels in human muscle cells resulted in lower mitochondrial oxidative capacity, reduced mitochondrial mass, increased protein oxidation and ROS production and impaired insulin signaling, all of which are known metabolic defects in T2D and ageing. Moreover, screening performed on 1031 North Americans found that the presence of a Leu262Val polymorphism in PARL was associated with increased plasma insulin concentration, making it a risk factor for diabetes. Interestingly, two other groups were unable to confirm this observation when screening the populations of the UK and Ireland, though one of them, Hatunic et al. did find that the Leu262Val PARL genetic variation is associated with an earlier onset of diabetes and may be a marker of increased susceptibility to nephropathy and cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes.\n\n    An additional PARL missense mutation, Ser77Asn, was detected in two patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which also implicates PARL dysregulation in PD pathogenesis (Table 1). This mutation is located in the highly conserved N-terminus of the protein, in a position that is crucial for the second maturation of PARL and the release of the Pbeta peptide (see above and Figure 6). Unfortunately, further independent studies failed to detect this mutation or any other pathogenic mutation in the PARL gene during the screening of patients with both sporadic and familial PD. This suggests that if PARL mutations are a genetic cause of Parkinson's disease, then they are likely to be extremely rare.",

        "Conclusion": "    Mitochondria are semiautonomous organelles that use a sophisticated system for importing pre-proteins synthetized in the cytosol and directing them to their final destination within mitochondria. This system is necessary for maintaining proper mitochondrial function and homeostasis. Mitochondrial processing peptidases are important components of the mitochondrial import machinery; their responsibility lies in removing the signal presequences of peptides and pre-proteins transported into the mitochondria. Most of these pre-proteins are processed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, MPP, while other processing peptidases, including the mitochondrial inner membrane peptidase, IMP, the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase, MIP, and the mitochondrial rhomboid proteases, Pcp1/PARL, are responsible for the further processing of specific protein substrates. Disruption of any of these proteases is lethal, and their malfunctions are connected with a number of severe human diseases. These diseases are characterized by an early onset and patients often exhibit neurodegeneration. The short peptides produced by these proteases might also accumulate inside the organelle, causing further problems; consequently, functional coupling between the processing of precursor proteins and presequence degradation is crucial for maintaining a functional organellar proteome. The mitochondria eliminate these peptides in two ways. Either the free presequences can be exported into the cytosol, like the Pbeta peptide of PARL, which is further translocated into the nucleus where it associates with chromatin and contributes to developmentally regulated mitochondria-to-nuclei signaling, or, like the majority, they can be degraded by a peptidase to generate amino acids that can be used for the synthesis of new proteins within the mitochondria. In humans, the mutation of these peptidases may also lead to severe diseases.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

        "Title": "    Testing Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency in Black Populations",
        "Abstract": "    Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is extensively studied in populations of European ancestry but other ethnic populations also carry SERPINA1 mutations that may be harmful to these populations.\n\n    The majority of studies undertaken in non-European populations screen for SERPINA1 mutations in small subject numbers and not from the general population.\n\n    What are the main findings?\n\n    Insufficient alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency testing is performed in Black populations that already experience poor health outcomes.\n\n    Diagnosis of severe SERPINA1 mutations and counseling assists patients in their health education and a diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a stronger motivator to quit smoking, improves the frequency of regular health checks, and lung and liver scans in patients.\n\n    What is the implication of the main finding?\n\n    Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is an under-recognized hereditary disorder and a significant cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease that contributes to global mortality. AAT is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, and severe mutation variants of this gene increase the risk of developing COPD. AATD is more frequently screened for in non-Hispanic White populations. However, AATD is also observed in other ethnic groups and very few studies have documented the mutation frequency in these other ethnic populations. Here, we review the current literature on AATD and allele frequency primarily in Black populations and discuss the possible clinical outcomes of low screening rates in a population that experiences poor health outcomes and whether the low frequency of AATD is related to a lack of screening in this population or a truly low frequency of mutations causing AATD. This review also outlines the harmful SERPINA1 variants, the current epidemiology knowledge of AATD, health inequity in Black populations, AATD prevalence in Black populations, the clinical implications of low screening of AATD in this population, and the possible dangers of not diagnosing or treating AATD.",
        "Introduction": "    Black populations experience significant health inequities that lead to poor outcomes, such as higher rates of chronic diseases, maternal and infant mortality, infectious diseases, mental health issues, and lower life expectancy. Some of these outcomes can be addressed by improving access to healthcare, addressing social determinants of health, and tackling discrimination and bias in healthcare and within our society. However, this excess burden is well documented and is not completely explained by socioeconomic status or access to care. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, one study reported that 27% of associated deaths within the USA were Black patients, while Black patients account for only 12.5% of the population in the USA. In 2020, chronic liver disease was the ninth leading cause of death for African Americans, ages 45-64 years old, and in a single-center study, African American patients with antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis were diagnosed at a younger age than Caucasian patients. Studies looking at ethnic differences in COPD diagnosis also demonstrate the underdiagnosis of the disease in Black populations. In 2003, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommended that all individuals with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), refractory asthma, unexplained chronic liver disease, or panniculitis, irrespective of age or ethnicity, should be tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). Since AAT is an acute phase protein, it is recommended to perform iso-electric focusing testing for the common alleles of AATD in these individuals. While AATD continues to be underdiagnosed in all populations, the frequency and nature of harmful serine protein inhibitor-A1 (SERPINA1 gene) mutations that occur in Black populations are unclear. Since Black populations experience significant health inequities, one could expect similar disparities in AATD diagnosis and treatment. In this mini-review, we want to outline the current literature on AATD and SERPINA1 mutation frequency in Black populations and discuss the consequences of low screening rates in a population that already experiences disproportionately poor health outcomes compared to other ethnic groups. Equally, we discuss whether the reported low prevalence of AATD is related to a lack of screening in this population or simply a low frequency of SERPINA1 mutations causing AATD.",
        "Methods": "",
        "Results": "    A new ERS statement on AATD outlines an extended algorithm for family screening of individuals diagnosed with severe AATD, including their close relatives and spouses. Even with guidelines in place, there are still significant delays between the appearance of symptoms and the correct diagnosis of AATD. The recommended approach to testing for AATD is to first measure plasma or serum AAT levels. However, it should be noted that AAT levels have weak intra-individual reproducibility due to the acute phase nature of AAT. This could result in a missed AATD diagnosis. Thus, CRP should be ordered in combination with AAT to rule out falsely elevated AAT levels due to illness or inflammation. If AAT is abnormally low, further testing should be performed by either AAT phenotyping with isoelectric focusing or AAT mutation-specific genotyping. The gold standard to detect AATD is DNA sequencing, especially for rarer variants extended molecular techniques are required, such as whole exome sequencing. A recent study in Greece observed several new rare variants by sequencing and these variants appear to be pathogenic as they were detected in patients with early emphysema and lower than normal AAT levels. Non-coding DNA may be an important area to be assessed. For example, the integrative deep sequencing of SERPINA1 identified a 5' untranslated region insertion (rs568223361) in African Americans that is associated with lower AAT levels and an increased risk of small airway disease. Commercially available direct-to-consumer genetic tests have also allowed people to explore the possibilities of genetic screening. However, one needs to be cautious with over-the-counter genetic testing as this results in the customer paying for the service, and these tests are not federally regulated in regard to quality control and provide no counseling service upon the identification of possible genetic diseases. A recent study using data from the U.S. Bronchiectasis Research Registry found that non-Hispanic Black patients were tested less frequently for AATD compared to other groups. This was not the case for screening for cystic fibrosis, immunoglobulin deficiency, and mycobacteria.\n\n    Early recognition of AATD is critical as it permits interventions, including education (e.g., smoking cessation and avoidance), genetic counseling, testing family members, and specific treatment options. The cessation of smoking is strongly recommended following diagnosis of AATD. Equally, the initiation of early additional clinical interventions is paramount, such as bronchodilator and inhaler therapies, pulmonary rehabilitation, and lung volume reduction or lung transplantation in severe cases. Delayed diagnosis is also associated with a negative psychosocial impact, which could be mitigated. For each additional year of diagnostic delay in AATD, FEV1% predicted decreases by 0.3%, the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire total score increases by 1.6 points, and the COPD Assessment Test score increases by 0.7 points. Equally, determining the precise AATD genotype is a major indicator of disease risk, with the ZZ and rare ZZ-equivalent genotypes associated with a higher risk of COPD and liver disease.\n\n    Without neonatal screening, or at the very least systematic targeted screening for those with obstructive lung disease and unexplained liver disease, the true prevalence of AATD will remain undetermined, and the disease will continue to be underdiagnosed. Currently, the ATS/ERS does not recommend screening neonates or adolescents, but this would facilitate early education and intervention.\n\n    A correct diagnosis of AATD provides patients and physicians with a variety of management and treatment options. These include consultation with a genetic counselor to discuss the diagnosis, treatment options, lifestyle changes, and the screening of other family members. Diagnosis is particularly important as it permits the screening of relatives, as they need to consider AATD in their clinical history and maintain surveillance and risk-reduction for liver and lung diseases (such as alcohol consumption and smoke cessation). A recent study demonstrated that the greater the severity of the AATD genotype, the lower the smoking rates among ever-smokers, with a diagnosis of AATD shown to be a stronger motivator to quit smoking than a diagnosis of COPD. Diagnosed AATD individuals also should consider vaccination strategies, undergo regular health checks, and lung and liver scans.\n\n    In those with emphysema caused by severe AATD, weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of plasma-purified AAT, known as augmentation therapy, are an effective treatment option. A recent trial demonstrated that patients with emphysema caused by severe AATD treated with AAT augmentation therapy showed a slower radiologic progression of the disease as compared to placebo. In addition, the discontinuation of AAT augmentation therapy in an Irish ZZ population prompted a deterioration of lung disease, including increased exacerbations following the abrupt cessation of treatment.\n\n    It is important to note that the costs of AAT augmentation therapy are high within the USA and throughout the world. One study published in 2018 found the total medical cost of patients on augmentation therapy to be USD 127,000, while the cost of patients not on therapy was USD 15,874 annually for insurance companies. Disparities already exist in the diagnosis of AATD, and the high cost of treatment may have an impact on populations unable to access this expensive therapy.",
        "Conclusion": "    AATD is substantially underdiagnosed, with an estimated 10% of predicted severe cases of AATD diagnosed. Most of the available data regarding the mutation frequency of SERPINA1 variants in Black populations are estimates. A small number of studies provide actual data on AATD in Black populations, but these cohorts are very small. The increasing frequency of transnational or multiracial relationships may also affect the presence of AAT alleles in these populations. Comparing the prior clinical epidemiological studies from earlier studies to large existing datasets (such as the gnomAD database) would likely increase our knowledge of the true frequencies of SERPINA1 variants and AATD in Black populations. The recent improvement in diagnosis and treatment further emphasizes the importance of identifying AATD in Black populations, thereby providing this neglected population with appropriate and more effective medical care and treatment options. See Figure 1 for possible AATD testing, management, and treatment strategies for subjects with a suspicion of AATD independent of their age or ethnicity.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    AAT was first characterized as a protease inhibitor, with loss in this activity associated with lung disease by Swedish researchers in 1963. AAT is a 52 kDa glycoprotein produced mainly by hepatocytes and secreted into the blood. AAT primarily inhibits neutrophil elastase, and in the absence of AAT, unregulated active proteases cleave the structural proteins of the lungs. AAT also has a plethora of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties. AAT deficiency is the most common genetic cause of COPD. Without sufficient concentrations of biologically active AAT, tissue destruction and airspace enlargement can occur, leading to progressive emphysema. This process is accelerated by exposure to cigarette smoke or other environmental factors. COPD development is common in AATD, especially in combination with cigarette smoke exposure. AATD patients with a smoking history typically present with emphysema on a chest computed tomography and with obstruction determined by spirometry. Chronic bronchitis or asthma is also observed but less frequently. However, AATD subjects who do not smoke tend to get radiographic emphysema after 60 years old. Asthma may be more prevalent in AATD individuals, as wheezing and dyspnea are some of the first pulmonary symptoms in AATD. Bronchiectasis is also increased in AATD, and this is associated with atypical mycobacterial infection. Therefore, AAT testing is recommended for subjects with emphysema, COPD, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, and asthma where spirometry fails to return to normal upon the treatment of asthma. Approximately 2-3% of patients diagnosed with COPD will be AATD. AATD is also a significant cause of liver disease through the polymerization and accumulation of misfolded Z AAT protein within hepatocytes and is a common cause of liver transplantation. Since lung disease in AATD is almost indistinguishable from nonhereditary lung disease, AATD is an under-recognized hereditary disorder and screening typically occurs after disease establishment. AATD is often suspected only following the diagnosis of early-onset obstructive lung disease in individuals with minimal or no cigarette consumption or panacinar emphysema affecting mainly the lower lobes.\n\n    AAT is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene. The most common mutation known to cause severe AAT deficiency is Z (p.Glu342Lys, rs28929474). Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the Z mutation are at increased risk of developing COPD, although heterozygotes require a second insult such as smoking before developing COPD. Classically, severe AATD is more frequently screened for in non-Hispanic White populations. Therefore, AATD is primarily documented in Northern, Western, and Central Europe. However, AATD is also observed in other ethnic groups. This is important as COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States of America, with over 16 million (6.6%) people reporting a diagnosis of COPD. In 2019, COPD was the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths. Self-reported COPD is estimated to be 6.1% in Black populations. Though COPD is typically diagnosed in patients who are current and or former smokers, one in four people who are nonsmokers develop COPD. In addition to environmental factors, individuals who have a genetic predisposition, such as AATD, can develop COPD. A recent study demonstrated that the primary factors for favoring AAT testing were whether the patient was of the White race and had concomitant COPD and liver disease. This same study also observed that increasing age, being non-White, current tobacco use, and being a male with COPD reduced the odds of AAT testing being performed. Therefore, there is bias in performing AAT testing and screening in certain populations.\n\n    SERPINA1 is a pleiomorphic gene with alleles inherited in an autosomal co-dominant fashion. The most frequent clinically significant alleles are Z and S, with M being the normal/non-mutated allele. It is important to note that the S allele (p.Glu264Val, rs17580) is less polymerogenic and causes mild serum deficiency. Thus, the SZ genotype results in a phenotype similar to the MZ phenotype and is deemed less severe than ZZ. There are a few published unbiased studies that address the allele frequencies in the general population. Most studies perform AAT testing on cohorts with a high number of COPD subjects or other subjects with already diagnosed pulmonary diseases, which do not reflect the true numbers in the general population. In a recent study from the Canary Islands (Spain), the estimated frequency of S and Z alleles in the general population was 8.2% and 2.1%, respectively. An Irish study found an estimated prevalence of 1/25 (4%) for the Z allele and 1/10 (10%) for the S allele in DNA collected from 1100 individuals randomly sampled from the general population. In a large genetic testing study, the allele frequency for the Z and S variants among 195,014 study participants was 6.5% and 15.1%, respectively. Notably, this cohort included 1443 African Americans. Unfortunately, allele frequencies in the African American group were not reported. Finally, the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), which is a shared aggregate exome and genome sequencing database from a variety of large-scale sequencing projects, is a useful tool for looking at SERPINA1 variants in multiple ethnic populations, including African and African American populations. These datasets may represent a better overall frequency for SERPINA1 variants in multiple populations.\n\n    Recent advances in sequencing have identified large numbers of harmful new SERPINA1 variants, with over 200 identified to date. There are many rare SERPINA1 variants that could be population specific but require further investigation. Table 1 outlines some of these harmful SERPINA1 variants. All these variants are predicted to be observed in Black populations and require further study. A recent study that compiled a comprehensive database of SERPINA1 coding mutations reported that 2.59% of an African cohort carry harmful SERPINA1 mutations.\n\n    Severe AATD affects about 1 in 1500 to 3500 individuals with European ancestry. While several studies do show lower frequencies in other ethnic groups, the Z and S alleles are documented to be detected in countries in the Caribbean, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. Historically, detection has focused on ZZ AATD, but it is now accepted that Z heterozygotes are also at risk of COPD. A study in Ireland found that MZ smokers were at a higher risk of developing COPD when compared to MM siblings who smoked. The finding of increased risk and severity of COPD in Z heterozygotes has been replicated in larger, multi-ethnic cohorts. One of these studies showed that African American MZ subjects had lower lung function, observed with low FEV1 percent predicted and FEV1/FVC compared to African American MM subjects. It is clear that MZ smokers are at risk for lung function changes in both White and Black populations.\n\n    The regulation of the SERPINA1 gene is quite complex. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in 2012 was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adults who were smokers and suggested a positive correlation between hypomethylation at two CpGs in the SERPINA1 gene promoter and COPD risk. However, another study performed on samples from smoke-exposed children and adults observed no correlation between SERPINA1 gene methylation and lung function. A recent study demonstrated that the SERPINA1 gene promoter is differentially methylated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects. However, further studies are needed to assess the direct link between AAT circulating levels and SERPINA1 promoter methylation in blood cells. There are 11 known SERPINA mRNA isoforms, which are generated through alternative splicing involving the 5'-UTR of the pre-mRNA. Mutations in SERPINA1 5'-UTR non-coding regions can lead to altered translation, as observed in a large-scale clinical study looking at AAT serum levels in patients. One of these 5'-UTR (NM_000295.4) can reduce AAT translation. This may be another means of observing altered AATD levels in different populations.\n\n    The Black population in the United States of America has worse health outcomes in comparison to other ethnic groups. A significant number of physicians are unaware of the current guidelines for screening for AATD in patients and may not be aware of possible treatment available for this form of COPD. Therefore, this may further lead to a reduced urgency of making a diagnosis of AATD. A recent whole genome sequence (WGS) study examined gene variants and lung function and COPD and identified two common variant signals unique to lung function in African Americans. There is likely heterogeneity in genetic effects when investigating race/ethnicity and lung function. Therefore, we cannot presume genetic variants associated with lung function identified by GWAS may be applicable to all populations. Unique variant signaling associated with certain ethnic populations requires further investigation.\n\n    Several studies estimate the global frequency of AATD and SERPINA1 variants in different populations worldwide. Studies looking at 94 countries encompassing 75% of the global population estimated that 173,430 individuals possess the ZZ genotype and 1,011,069 the SZ genotype. Importantly, a recent study predicted that more than 35 million people in 74 countries possess the MZ genotype.\n\n    A study conducted comparing Black and White populations with emphysema demonstrated that Black subjects had a similar degree of lung impairment compared with Whites but developed emphysema younger despite smoking less. As seen in Table 2, consisting of studies reporting Black population screening, only a small number of studies report actual numbers detected during screening, and AAT mutations are detected in this population. Some studies do state that non-White subjects were tested but do not provide screening data based on race. Estimated frequencies exist in Z and S alleles in Caribbean and African countries; the most significant, in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Nigeria, Somalia, Angola, and Namibia, are reported. It is important to note that many estimates are based on studies from the 1970s and 1980s in small cohorts and not necessarily the general population. This could warrant further AAT screening in larger Black cohorts with newer diagnostic techniques.\n\n    Finally, one must also consider that spirometry reference values differ by race/ethnicity, which could result in the underestimation of COPD in Black populations. Applying spirometry reference equations used for Caucasian populations may produce normal lung function values (% predicted) in Black populations. Equally, the smoking habits between populations differ, with cigarette products containing menthol and other flavorings frequently being targeted at Black smokers and vaping device users. Equally, there is some evidence to suggest that racial/ethnic minority populations and younger smokers find it harder to quit menthol versus nonmenthol cigarettes.",

        "Title": "    Known Mutations at the Cause of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency an Updated Overview of SERPINA1 Variation Spectrum",
        "Abstract": "    Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), caused by SERPINA1 mutations, is one of the most prevalent Mendelian disorders among individuals of European descend. However, this condition, which is characterized by reduced serum levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and associated with increased risks of pulmonary emphysema and liver disease in both children and adults, remains frequently underdiagnosed. AATD clinical manifestations are often correlated with two pathogenic variants, the Z allele (p.Glu342Lys) and the S allele (p.Glu264Val), which can be combined in severe ZZ or moderate SZ risk genotypes. Yet, screenings of AATD cases and large sequencing efforts carried out in both control and disease populations are disclosing outstanding numbers of rare SERPINA1 variants (>500), including many pathogenic and other likely deleterious mutations. Generally speaking, pathogenic variants can be subdivided into either loss- or gain-of-function according to their pathophysiological effects. In AATD, the loss-of-function is correlated with an uncontrolled activity of elastase by its natural inhibitor, the AAT. This phenomenon can result from the absence of circulating AAT (null alleles), poor AAT secretion from hepatocytes (deficiency alleles) or even from a modified inhibitory activity (dysfunctional alleles). On the other hand, the gain-of-function is connected with the formation of AAT polymers and their switching on of cellular stress and inflammatory responses (deficiency alleles). Less frequently, the gain-of-function is related to a modified protease affinity (dysfunctional alleles). Here, we revisit SERPINA1 mutation spectrum, its origins and population history with a greater emphasis on variants fitting the aforementioned processes of AATD pathogenesis. Those were selected based on their clinical significance and wider geographic distribution. Moreover, we also provide some directions for future studies of AATD clinically heterogeneity and comprehensive diagnosis.",
        "Introduction": "    Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal codominant disorder caused by multiple mutations affecting SERPINA1 gene. Although in most cases these are translated into a functional protein present in the bloodstream at lower concentrations, some mutations can also lead to dysfunctional molecules or null variants. The major clinical implications of AATD are an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema in adults, and hepatic illness during childhood or later in adult life. Nonetheless, AATD has been associated with disorders affecting not only the respiratory system but also other organs, such as bronchiectasis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) - associated vasculitis, and panniculitis. AATD has been typically correlated with European populations, where its prevalence can reach up to 1:2000 subjects. However, this genetic condition can be virtually detected anywhere due to a worldwide dispersal of two more prevalent deficiency alleles, the S and Z alleles, and a large spectrum of rare pathogenic mutations, which are typically more geographically confined.\n\n    Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) is the major protease inhibitor in the serum and the archetypical member of the SERerine Protease INhibitors (SERPIN) superfamily. Therefore, it is often referred to as SERPINA1 - SERPIN clade A member. AAT is a monomeric glycoprotein that once in the bloodstream weighs approximately 52 KDa and is composed of 394 amino acid residues. However, prior to its secretion, the AAT molecule is post-translationally modified by the removal of its signal peptide, composed of 24 amino acids, and by the linkage of three carbohydrate side chains to asparagine residues located at positions 46, 83 and 247.\n\n    AAT is primarily synthetized at high levels by hepatocytes, but also to a lower extent by many other tissues, such as whole blood innate immunity cells (neutrophils and monocytes), epithelial lung cells, the kidney and the skin (Figure 1A). At the structural level, AAT is a globular protein packed into three beta-sheets (A-C) and nine alpha-helices (A-I), showing a solvent-exposed reactive center loop (RCL; Figure 1B) that determines its inhibitory affinity towards distinct proteases. Precisely, it is the Met358-Ser359 bond (P1-P1'; Figure 1B) located within the RCL that by mimicking a protease substrate, works like a specific bite in a kind of molecular mouse-trap. This remarkable feature of AAT can only be accomplished by the ability of SERPINs to undergo major conformational rearrangements upon RCL cleavage, in which proteases are moved into the opposite pole of the SERPIN molecule. Thereafter, the structure of the protease is disturbed and permanently inactivated in a stable complex with its inhibitor (Figure 1C). Although AAT is mainly recognized as a potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, which is released in the lung during infectious and inflammatory states, it is also capable of regulating other proteases, including proteinase 3, kallikrein 7, matriptase, and caspase-3. Importantly, AAT is also an acute phase molecule with multiple immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory functions, such as in the control and release of cytokines, the recruitment of innate immunity cells and in responses to diverse pathogens.\n\n    Broadly speaking, the clinical manifestations of the AATD condition are partially attributed to the low levels of AAT and an unbalanced activity of proteases, which can lead to tissue degradation through the cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins as described for pulmonary emphysema. In general, a serum concentration of 11 uM (57 mg/dl) is considered as the minimum protective threshold against the lung proteolytic attack. Nevertheless, some authors already questioned its universal application given that some AATD patients with values above the proposed limit may still exhibit respiratory symptoms and benefit from specific clinical interventions. On the other hand, AATD complications can be also correlated with the AAT conformational flexibility and its propensity to polymerize when misfolded. The toxic effects of AAT polymers inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have long been recognized as a primary cause of the hepatic disease associated with AATD. More recently, the role of AAT polymers in the pathophysiology of pulmonary emphysema was also acknowledged after their detection in the lungs. The underlying mechanisms of panniculitis and ANCA vasculitis linked to AATD are not yet fully elucidated, but those are probably correlated with both processes of unbalanced proteolysis and polymer accumulation.\n\n    AAT is encoded by SERPINA1 (SERPIN family A member 1) gene, which is located at chromosomal region 14q32.13, and spans for about 13.9 kb (GRCh38.p13/hg38 genomic coordinates chr14:94,376,747-94,390,654). SERPINA1 is organized into seven exons of which the first three are untranslated regions (UTR), often labeled as IA, IB and IC, and the remaining four comprise the coding region and the terminal UTR (exons II-V). The 5' UTR contains distinct transcription initiation sites being IA and IB exons reported as alternatively used by monocytes, and IC specifically employed in the gene expression by hepatocytes.\n\n    So far, more than 120 SERPINA1 mutations have been reported in the literature, of which near 40% are described to cause some type of AATD. Despite the vast majority of pathogenic mutations is localized within the coding region (II-V exon) and engages either single nucleotide substitutions or small insertion and deletions (1 to 3 nucleotides), there are also a few reports of AATD causing variants affecting splice sites, as well as large deletions eliminating partially or entirely the sequence of SERPINA1 gene (Table 1).\n\n    To date, sequencing efforts are targeting the exome/genome screening of thousands of individuals from ethnically diverse healthy (controls; eg, gnomAD - The Genome Aggregation Database) and diseased populations (eg, TOPMed - The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine). These are uncovering an unprecedented number of very low-frequency variants (<0.01%), many of them with predicted negative effects in AAT function, if considering distinct bioinformatics pathogenicity scores (Supplementary Table 1). This indicates that we are only aware of the tip of the iceberg regarding AATD causing mutations. In this respect and as discussed in the following sections, whereas polymorphic variants (>1%) and several low-frequency variants tend to be dispersed worldwide, or at least found across wider geographical regions, other rarer mutations are more likely to be restricted to specific populations. While low-frequency variants will probably be detected in control populations of genomic databases, population-specific pathogenic variants are likely to be absent from those datasets and identified mainly through AATD clinical cases, or among related disease groups such as COPD subjects included in TOPMED. From a clinical standpoint, this highlights the importance of not neglecting SERPINA1 rare variants while performing AATD genetic testing, especially when subjects show symptoms and reduced AAT serum levels.\n\n    AATD was firstly discovered by Laurell and Eriksson more than 50 years ago, in 1963, when they noticed the absence of a protein band corresponding to AAT in the electrophoresis strips of plasma samples from several pulmonary emphysema cases. Other separating systems with improved band resolution were later developed, and used in multiple studies to assess the genetic polymorphism of blood proteins, including AAT. In general, the alleles of those proteins were labeled as F (fast) and S (slow) according to their electrophoretic mobility in starch, agarose or polyacrylamide gels. For AAT in particular, this classic nomenclature of protein variants is still maintained nowadays. Precisely, it relies on the band patterns achieved upon an electrophoretic separation in an isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel with a narrow pH gradient (pH 4-5). There, alleles are classified from \"A - Z\", being \"A\" the faster ones (closer to the anode - the positive end of the IEF gel), \"M\" those found at the middle region, and \"Z\" the slowest migrating alleles (Figure 2).\n\n    Another typical feature of this terminology is correlated with the \"Q0\" usage to denote null alleles: variants in which no band can be detected in IEF gels. Furthermore, this nomenclature can also admit a linked city name to discriminate alleles with similar electrophoretic mobility, but characterized by distinct mutations (eg, MMalton, ZAugsburg or Q0Ourem). This is more often employed in a rare variant classification where the city name corresponds to the birth-place of the oldest carrier with the identified mutation. Currently, the most updated genomic databases follow the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) guidelines, in which the first amino acid is always the initiation methionine. Still, in the AATD field, it is a common rule to employ the residue numbering according to the mature protein (ie, without the first 24 residues of the signal peptide). Thus, for consistency with the former literature, we will use this same labeling of AAT residues, and whenever available we will provide their genomic reference codes.\n\n    Like other genetic variations, AAT alleles can be divided not only according to their association with the AATD condition but also depending on their frequencies across distinct human populations. If using 1% as the threshold for common variants (former assumption of polymorphism), the spectrum of AAT mutations is quite limited, comprising only five variable positions in which just two are linked to AATD. Precisely, these comprise p.Arg101His (rs709932), p.Ala213Val (rs6647), p.Glu264Val (rs17580), p.Glu342Lys (rs28929474) and p.Glu376Asp (rs1303) amino acid replacements that altogether define seven prevalent protein alleles: M1 (Ala or Val), M2, M3, M4, S and Z (Table 2). Whereas M1 to M4 are all considered normal alleles placed in the central area of IEF gels; S and Z, are both deficiency alleles associated with fainter bands, located closer to the cathode (Figure 2). Here, the Z allele defined by the p.Glu342Lys (rs28929474) mutation, which replaces a negatively charged residue with a positive one, displays the largest separation from the M zone in IEF gels and also the fainter protein bands (Figure 2). On the other hand, the S allele characterized by a p.Glu264Val (rs17580) mutation changes a negatively charged residue by a neutral one, which results in a protein band with intermediate intensity focusing between M and Z zones (Figure 2).\n\n    Along with these major protein alleles, there are a large plethora of other variants segregating in human populations. In general, those are found at much lower frequencies (<1%) and thus often referred to as rare AAT alleles, which comprise variants associated with regular AAT activity and serum concentrations, as well as many pathogenic alleles (Table 1).\n\n    Deficiency alleles: This category includes all alleles causing a significant reduction in AAT serum levels. Some authors suggested a 20 uM threshold to consider an allele as causing AATD. Null alleles (Q0), showing only residual AAT concentrations and no detectable protein band in IEF gels, can also be included in this category. In other words, this group comprises all alleles or mutations that can be connected with a loss-of-function classification.\n\n    Dysfunctional alleles: In a strict sense, this category includes only those alleles described to affect the inhibitory activity of AAT, in a qualitative or quantitative manner. Nonetheless, in a broader interpretation of dysfunction and fitting the currently used gain-of-function definition, variants increasing AAT susceptibility to polymerization may also fall within this group.\n\n    In overview, common and rare pathogenic variants (or mutations) can be subdivided into two non-mutually exclusively categories according to their negative effects in AAT function and/or activity:\n\n    In the following sections, we will revisit some of the collected data about the most relevant pathogenic mutations, by considering not only their clinical importance and functional effects in AAT but also the prevalence among studied AATD cohorts and control populations from the gnomAD database.\n\n    The Z allele is characterized by a p.Glu342Lys (rs28929474) mutation in an M1Ala background allele (Table 2). This replacement of a glutamic acid by a lysine residue at a key region of the SERPINs structure - the breach (upper extremity of the shutter domain; Figure 1B and C; Figure 3) - has been experimentally demonstrated to change the conformational properties of AAT. Briefly, the p.Glu342Lys mutation generates the synthesis of unstable monomers, in which the breach and the shutter are opened. This structural modification predisposes the Z allele to dimerize in a process that can be explained by three alternative mechanisms: 1) the loop-sheet rearrangement, where the RCL alone occupies the shutter of another AAT molecule; 2) the beta-hairpin configuration, where the RCL together with a contiguous beta-strand forms a beta-hairpin structure that is inserted into the core of an acceptor AAT molecule; and 3) the C-terminal swap, where the donor AAT undergoes an RCL self-insertion coupled with an abnormal folding of the C-terminal region, which in turn is incorporated in the following AAT molecule. Indeed, it is the steady state of this dimerization process that when carried in a sequential manner leads to the production of the elongated AAT polymers. According to a recent study by Faull et al (2020), it is the latter model of the C-terminal swap that best suits the structural information and high-resolution images of ex vivo polymers obtained from several ZZ liver explants. In addition, when compared with the other mechanisms, the C-terminal swap also predicates for an increased stability and irreversibility of Z allele conformational changes.\n\n    Notably, although Z polymers are described to aggregate primarily in the ER of hepatocytes, they are suggested to also accumulate in other cell types, such as pneumocytes. Furthermore, Z polymers were found extracellular as well, in the lung interstitium where these are supposed to have a pro-inflammatory activity with repercussions in the progression of emphysema.\n\n    This increased susceptibility of the Z allele to polymerize underlies the dual feature of p.Glu342Lys as a loss- and gain-of-function mutation. If, on one hand, it reduces the secretion of AAT into the bloodstream by 85% thus, enhancing the risk of pulmonary disease due to the unbalanced activity of proteases (loss-of-function); on the other hand, the formation of AAT granules that escape the intracellular pathways of protein degradation induces a stress response that may culminate in cell death and fibrosis (gain-of-function). Notably, this represents a critical step not only in liver disease among ZZ individuals but also in alveolar cell loss in emphysema, where extracellular polymers found in the interstitium were correlated with another gain-of-function effect that amplifies the damage to lung parenchyma. It is through a chemotactic action that the extracellular polymers stimulate the recruitment and degranulation of neutrophils in the alveolar membranes, maximizing proteolytic activity and spreading the focus of inflammation in the lower lung. On top of this major mechanism of AATD pathophysiology, the p.Glu342Lys mutation per se is also known to reduce the inhibitory capacity of the AAT molecule further enhancing its loss-of-function effects.\n\n    From an epidemiological perspective, the Z allele is more prevalent in Scandinavia and Baltic countries, where its frequency is estimated to vary between 2% and 4%. Accordingly, the proportion of severe AATD cases caused by the ZZ genotype is also relatively high considering their population sizes - about 2000 to 4500 individuals. The elevated prevalence of the Z allele in Northern Europe, together with its wide distribution across other regions, namely in Southern Europe and Mediterranean areas, is on the genesis of a Viking migration (800-1100 A.D) theory for its dispersal. Additionally, hypotheses for a selective advantage of the Z allele were also advanced. For instance, taking into account that Z polymers magnify the inflammatory response of an individual, it could thus have been beneficial in fighting pathogens during a pre-antibiotic era. Another scenario was a possible increase in the reproductive success of ZZ subjects. Although an AAT function in the regulation of acrosin proteolytic activity and sperm-egg fertilization might appear as a valid argument for an improved fitness of the Z allele, this selective hypothesis was later rejected by family-based transmission studies.\n\n    More recently, the Z allele was proposed to have been positively selected by height and/or weight adaptive traits to colder climates or conversely, to represent an example of a balanced polymorphism correlated with better lung function values (FEV1: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s and FVC: Forced Vital Capacity) in heterozygotes. Yet, the evidence of extended Z haplotypes collected by North et al 2016, as well as the former arguments for a selective advantage of the p.Glu342Lys, may be questioned by similar findings obtained for other genetics variants. For example, the 32 bp deletion in C-C chemokine receptor 5 gene (CCR5-del32) that confers an effective resistance to HIV infection and is present in North-Europeans at a 16% frequency was proposed to have been selected during the Middle ages, due to a protective effect against the bubonic plague and/or smallpox. Nevertheless, CCR5-del32 long-range haplotypes did not differ from other variants found in the same frequency bins, suggesting a likely neutral evolution for this variant.\n\n    Interestingly, the age estimates of CCR5-del32 mutation fall within a 3000-5000 yrs. old range, which closely overlaps with the origins of Z allele calculated to be around 2000 to 6000 yrs. ago. For the Z allele, this age variability has been correlated with a large haplotype diversity described in Southern European regions compared to Northern ones. Indeed, this south-north cline of genetic diversity is not restricted to SERPINA1 or CCR5 mutations, but rather a global European trend as recently shown by genome-wide data. To date, it is well accepted that the genetic variability within Europe mirrors the local geography, and the observed gradients are likely to result from several population movements towards the north, like the ones associated with the expansion of agriculturalists during Neolithic times. Furthermore, the larger sustained population sizes in Southern European regions, because of their improved long-term survival conditions, are likely to have contributed as well to their larger genetic diversity. In summary, the updated knowledge of human genetic variation discards, not only a Scandinavian origin of the Z allele but also any linked benefit to its carries. Taking into account the limited mortality of ZZ subjects in their early life, and that major clinical complications occur after post-reproductive ages (>40 yrs. old), often connected with cigarette smoking, AATD is likely to represent a modern challenge to human health.\n\n    The S allele is defined by a p.Glu264Val (rs17580) mutation in an M1Val background allele (Table 2). The pathogenic consequences of this allele result from the loss of a hydrogen bond linking the glutamic acid to a tyrosine residue located in the opposed 38 position (Figure 3). This alteration was found to disturb the shutter domain in its periphery affecting the stability of the AAT molecule. An increased turnover of the S protein was initially advanced as the source for its reduced secretion at 50-60% of the normal level. However, the p.Glu264Val mutation has been shown to turn AAT susceptible to polymerization, and to cause its retention in the ER, although at a lesser extent than the Z allele. This finding provides an explanation for the S allele being less frequently associated with detectable granules in hepatocytes, a condition that may be shifted in SZ subjects, given that the two variants are capable of forming heteropolymers. According to recent co-expression assays of Z and S alleles, the first molecules slow down and reduce the intracellular degradation of the misfolded S ones without compromising their secretion. Indeed, this phenomenon of heteropolymerization affords a better understanding of the incidence of hepatic disease among SZ subjects, particularly when there is a second hit caused by other risk factors, such as infection, fat liver or alcoholism.\n\n    Oddly, the risk of lung disease among SZ individuals is not yet fully elucidated. This results from some contradictory studies concerning the association of the SZ genotype with pulmonary emphysema and COPD, but also from the small numbers of individuals analyzed so far. Notwithstanding, in smokers, this same genotype seems to increase the risk of COPD, although the disease itself does not differ from what is observed in non-AATD cases. On the other hand, the proportion of SZ patients showing serum levels below the protective threshold (11 uM) is limited to about 16% and to our knowledge, there are no data concerning the heteropolymerization in the lung, either intra- or extracellularly. At this point, it may be difficult to accurately address the loss- and gain-of-function effects of p.Glu264Val mutation in COPD and emphysema development, and if a second \"hit\" is required in SZ subjects similar to what happens in hepatic disease. Importantly, this genotype is several times more prevalent worldwide than the severe risk ZZ genotype, especially within Europe where numbers are estimated to vary within the following ranges: 600,000-700,000 for SZ and 80,000-125,000 for ZZ individuals. Considering that AATD persists as an underdiagnosed condition, SZ subjects could still represent a vulnerable group to respiratory illnesses.\n\n    The S allele is more common in Iberia, where frequencies as high as 15% were described in both North and West Iberian regions. Previous works also report an increased prevalence of the S allele in Madeira island (Portugal) with an 18% frequency, and in a few African countries, like Angola and Namibia with a prevalence of 18.8% and 14.6%, respectively. Still, those reports are likely to be correlated with the past demography of the studied groups and their recognized Iberian heritage. In this respect, the most updated and unbiased surveys of human genetic variation carried out in African and African-American populations show only minor frequencies of the S allele (<1%; Table 1).\n\n    Similar to the Z allele, the p.Glu264Val mutation was proposed to have arisen in the region where the S allele is more common to date - in the Iberian Peninsula. In this case, the 8000-14,000 yrs. age estimates place the origin of the S allele in the Late Paleolithic after the last glacial maximum, in a period when modern humans are thought to have left their refugees in Southern Mediterranean regions. Later, Neolithic migrations might have facilitated a first dispersal of the S allele throughout Eurasia and North Africa. More recently, the Iberian diaspora initiated in the XV century with the maritime expansion could have contributed to the spread of the S allele in sub-Saharan Africa and in Central and South America.\n\n    The five variants MMalton, MPalermo, MNichinan, Q0LaPalma and SIiyama are connected by their alterations of the contiguous 51-53 residues, where the Phe-Phe-Ser sequence is fundamental to maintain a stable conformation of the shutter domain (Figure 3; Table 1). The deletion of a phenylalanine p.Phe52del (rs775982338) found in MMalton, MPalermo or MNichinan and the replacement of serine by a phenylalanine p.Ser53Phe (rs55819880) as observed in SIiyama, cause in a similar way to the Z allele the opening of the breach/shutter, enhancing the susceptibility of these variants to polymerize. However, whereas the SIiyama allele is an extremely rare variant identified in a few families from Japan, the other alleles characterized by the p.Phe52del are widely distributed across different human groups as indicated by the genomics studies of large control populations, where this mutation was found at low or very frequencies (<0.01-0.04%) (Table 1). The discrimination of MMalton, MPalermo or MNichinan alleles is only achieved by the analysis of their molecular background. The MMalton has a p.Phe52del mutation linked to an M2 allele and the MPalermo to an M1Val instead. The MNichinan allele, on the other hand, has a p.Phe52del in an M1Val background together with another rare mutation that does not lead to AATD, the p.Gly148Arg (V allele - rs112030253). Finally, in Q0LaPalma allele, the p.Phe52del is in phase with the p.Glu264Val mutation, which typically defines the S variant. Interestingly, this combination of pathogenic mutations appears to not only impair AAT secretion, as well as its polymerization. No evidence of hepatic dysfunction was detected in Q0LaPalma carriers.\n\n    Whereas MMalton and MPalermo alleles have been identified in several AATD cases across different European and North African countries, the MNichinan was only reported in AATD subjects from Japan. So far, only a few studies performed a clinical evaluation of MMalton carriers, homozygous and heterozygous, confirming the association of p.Phe52del with both pulmonary and hepatic diseases. Interestingly, one of those studies reports a case of end-stage liver disease in the presence of a non-deficiency allele, in an M3MMalton genotype, suggesting a high pathogenicity and heteropolymerization potential of p.Phe52del variant. According to a recent work, MMalton granules found in the liver of AATD patients contain calcium and are mineralized. These modifications were hypothesized to upregulate ER chaperones fostering cell necrosis in a distinct molecular process from one of the Z and SIiyama alleles.\n\n    The haplotype analysis of MMalton and MPalermo alleles disclosed their independent origin, indicating that the p.Phe52del mutation occurred at least twice. In addition, such data were used to estimate their time to the most common recent ancestor, which in both instances is close to 5000 years old. This date is consistent with a European and Mediterranean distribution, as well as, a spread associated with Neolithic migrations. Although the molecular base linked to p.Phe52del is rarely acknowledged, thus not allowing the discrimination of MMalton and MPalermo alleles, their association with an M2 or M1Val is not expected to further modify protein structure or disease risk.\n\n    There are at least 10 other variants with polymerogenic potential, if taking into account their association with hepatic disease and/or evidence from experimental studies. Among those only King's (p.His334Asp), ETaurisano (p.Lys368Glu) and YOrzinuovi (p.Pro391His) are rare variants absent from public databases (Table 1). Conversely, the I (p.Arg39Cys; rs28931570) and MWurzburg (p.Pro369Ser; rs61761869) alleles are the most prevalent of those low-frequency variants within Europe (0.2% - 0.05%, respectively); the p.Val333Met (rs373630097) is another mutation observed mainly in South Asians at 0.3% (Table 1). Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, only the I and MWurzburg alleles have their polymerogenic properties carefully and experimentally validated. Whereas the I variant is a functional equivalent of the S allele (the residue 39 faces the 264 one, Figure 3) interfering as well in the periphery of the shutter domain, the MWurzburg is closely located to the C-terminal region of the AAT molecule, and described to affect the stability of another key SERPIN domain - the gate. Moreover, the amino acid replacements of I and MWurzburg may also contribute to their ER accumulation by increasing AAT hydrophilicity, although at a lesser extent than Z or MMalton, given that their association with hepatic disease is dependent on a stronger polymerogenic allele. Although the low prevalence of these alleles may prevent an accurate evaluation of their impact in AATD manifestations, their detection among symptomatic cases supports the hypothesis of some associated risk of liver and lung diseases.\n\n    The best example of a dysfunctional allele is illustrated by the Pittsburgh, which is characterized by a p.Met358Arg substitution (rs121912713), altering the P1 residue of the reactive bond located within the RCL (Figure 1B and Figure 3). This change causes the AAT molecule to shift its protease affinity towards thrombin instead of its regular anti-elastase inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the clinical outcomes associated with the Pittsburgh variant are not connected with the loss of AAT function, but rather with an abnormal control of coagulation cascades. Indeed, this mutation was first described in a young boy who died of a fatal bleeding disorder, in which the AAT properties as an acute-phase reactant after trauma were proposed to increase its new anti-coagulation potential, consequently causing the patient severe hemorrhages. This variant is extremely rare and it has been reported in few isolated cases and in a single family, where it always arose as a de novo mutation. Unsurprisingly, this variant is also absent from control populations currently available through large genomic databases (Table 1).\n\n    The F allele is another well-known example of a dysfunctional variant. In this case, if compared with a normal M allele, the F variant displays a considerably reduced inhibitory activity towards neutrophil elastase but also proteinase 3. This functional impaired variant results from a p.Arg223Cys (rs28929470) substitution that in spite of being located outside of the RCL is believed to alter the architecture of P1-P1' region. This allele has been proposed to increase the risk of emphysema; however, this may only apply to FZ heterozygous, given that no evidence of elastase-induced damage was detected in an FF homozygous patient. Importantly, the F allele is a relatively uncommon variant that is found mainly in Europeans, reaching its highest frequency in Sweden (0.9% in gnomAD). Considering that there is also some heterogeneity in the clinical manifestations of AATD cases, the study of additional patients would be fundamental to clarify whether FF subjects are susceptible to lung disease, or not. Still, in no circumstance, the respiratory manifestations would be a consequence of the lower AAT concentrations given that the secretion of F allele is within normal ranges. There are recent reports of additional dysfunctional variants but their rarity has prevented so far, a detailed evaluation of their association with AATD disease.\n\n    In most instances, null alleles (Q0) are caused by the premature termination of protein sequence, due to either a nonsense mutation, or the introduction of small insertions and deletions altering the open reading frame. Nonetheless, in a few instances, AAT null alleles can result from standard amino acid substitutions where a misfolded protein is synthetized and rapidly degraded by the ER-associated machinery. The MHeerlen (p.Pro369Leu; rs199422209) and Q0Lisbon (p.Thr68Ile; rs1490133295) alleles are two such examples, in which a full protein is produced but not detected intracellularly as granules and only poorly secreted from cells, thus being nearly absent from the serum. In addition, these are likely to be the most prevalent of the null alleles, in populations of European descent and native American admixed (approximately 0.01% and 0.02%, respectively; Table 1), as suggested also by studies of AATD patients. In South Asians, a similar situation occurs with the p.Gly115Ser (rs11558261) replacement, which defines the Q0Devon and Q0Newport alleles (0.07%, Table 1).\n\n    Splice site changes are another source of null alleles. Interestingly, some of the few cases reported in the literature engage exon IC donor site (Table 1) and an impairment of SERPINA1 expression restricted to hepatocytes. Given that other cell types use upstream transcription initiation sites located in exons IA and IB, some AAT will be synthetized, but those molecules are far from reestablishing the normal serum levels secreted by the liver. The Q0Porto (rs775786225), Q0Faro and Q0Madrid alleles belong to this category of splice site mutations and were proposed to produce abnormal transcripts targeted by mechanisms of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The same NMD phenomenon is likely to also be involved in the processing of most truncated variants preventing the accumulation of unusually long or short transcripts within the cells.\n\n    Independently of the underlying molecular mechanisms of null alleles, those are by default clinically connected with the loss-of-function effects, and subsequently, with AATD pulmonary manifestations. Here, it is important to strengthen that they will be strictly correlated with the unopposed activity of neutrophil elastase and other proteases. Once there is no formation of AAT polymers, the progression of pulmonary emphysema cannot be exacerbated by a polymer amplified pro-inflammatory response.\n\n    The Q0Ourem, which is characterized by an insertion of a thymine at 353 codon (p.Leu353Phefs*24; rs763023697) in an M3 background allele, is perhaps one of the most prevalent truncated variants of SERPINA1 (Table 1). Although it has been identified in only three individuals from control populations (2 Europeans and 1 Latino American), in the Iberian Peninsula it has been associated with several unrelated cases of severe AATD, including several homozygous patients. The haplotype analysis of Q0Ourem alleles identified in Portuguese patients confirmed not only a single origin of p.Leu353Phefs*24 mutation but also allowed to estimate its age in 650 yrs. Remarkably, this timeframe concurs with the major settlements of Ourem village, in central Portugal, which took place during the XIV-XV centuries. Considering that most cases cluster in Ourem and other neighboring areas, a founder effect offers a plausible explanation for its spread in Portugal.\n\n    Notably, the p.Leu353Phefs*24 mutation was originally identified in an M1Val background and named as Q0Mattawa according to the birthplace of the index case, in Ontario, Canada. This suggested that the p.Leu353Phefs*24 mutation could have occurred at least twice. However, there is recent evidence for the segregation of Q0Ourem allele in two unrelated subjects from Quebec city population (Quebec, Canada). Although an independent origin of the two alleles may now be questionable considering the proximity of Mattawa and Quebec cities (700 km) in Canada, the hypothesis may only be ruled out by an updated characterization of Q0Mattawa haplotypes.",
        "Methods": "    The mutational spectrum of SERPINA1 was proposed to be composed of a limited repertoire of genetic variants, in which specific sites were more prone to accumulate events of homoplasy. Although this conjecture may still hold true for some pathogenic variants (eg, p.Phe52del, p.Glu264Val and p.Glu342Lys; Table 1), the improvements achieved over the last years in AATD testing, as well as the efforts made in the exome/genome sequencing of thousands of individuals, uncovered unprecedented numbers of SERPINA1 variants present in different populations at low and very low frequencies (<1% and <0.01%). In the absence of clinical or experimental data addressing the functional impact of those variants, there are currently multiple predictive scores of variant pathogenicity that offer an alternative bioinformatics approach to evaluate disease-causing mutations. In the context of AATD, a recent study has already analyzed the accuracy of those predictive scores to infer the pathogenicity of known and novel AAT mutations. The authors confirmed not only the scores feasibility in the classification of recognized AATD causing variants, as well as, in the detection of new ones later validated by functional assays. Currently, the compiling of variants identified mainly through the screening of AATD patients (Table 1) with those reported in the gnomAD database linked to their pathogenicity scores for a series of predictive algorithms (Supplementary Table 1), shows that SERPINA1 has a vast number of mutations spreading throughout its coding region and splice sites, many of them with expected negative consequences. In overview, SERPINA1 variants exceed the 500, in which more than a third likely have implications for AATD according to clinical data and/or computational predictive tools.\n\n    Still and as mentioned above, there are some variants fitting the concept of homoplasy, for which the existence of haplotype data is fundamental to address their underlying molecular mechanism. The MMalton and MPalermo (p.Phe52del in M2 and M1Val, respectively) alleles occurring in a short repeat sequence (Table 1), are one of the few examples with sustained evidence of mutational recurrence. The T allele is another known case of homoplasy (p.Glu264Val in an M4 or M3 background instead of the common M1Val) possibly resulting from either crossover or mutation recurrence events. The ZAugsburg (p.Glu342Lys in M2 instead of M1Ala), the MHeerlen (p.Pro369Leu in M1Ala or M1Val), the MNichinan (p.Phe52del in a V allele) among other alleles (Table 1) represent additional examples, in which the molecular events behind their origin were not yet elucidated.\n\n    Although the AATD condition is excepted to be mainly caused by pathogenic mutations, we cannot rule out the influence of their extended genomic background in symptoms variability and clinical outcomes. In this respect, it was demonstrated that the p.Ala213Val variant modifies AAT interactions with neutrophil elastase and lipoproteins, and on the other hand, several cis-quantitative trait loci (QTL) were shown to affect SERPINA1 expression (eQTL) and splicing (sQTL; Figure 4).",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "    The repertoire of AATD causing mutations has expanded over the last years, and to date, it is acknowledged that along with the major disease risk genotypes, ZZ and SZ, there are many others resulting from different combinations with rare alleles. Indeed, previous studies have shown that rare mutations can be detected in up to 17% of clinically cases and like for Z and S alleles, several low-frequency pathogenic variants have been segregating in human populations for hundreds or thousands of years. Therefore, their geographical dispersal could have been facilitated by past human migrations, as well as, by the occurrence of some founders' effects. Besides these, there are other even rarer variants, which probably arisen recently in time, and thus, are familial or regional confined. Altogether, this data highlights the importance of AATD genetic diagnosis to contemplate more inclusive screenings of SERPINA1 variants, and not only p.Glu264Val and p.Glu342Lys mutations. This goal may be achieved by the traditional AATD laboratorial algorithms combining serum concentration, phenotyping, genotyping and SERPINA1 sequencing, or conversely by the implementation of novel state-of-the-art genotyping/sequencing approaches.\n\n    Moreover, it is fundamental to continue unravelling the mechanisms of AATD pathophysiology, for both common and rare pathogenic variants and to define their effects as loss- and/or gain-of-function mutations. Namely, it is imperative to discriminate processes and variants purely associated with an unopposed proteolytic activity, from those stimulating pathways of ER stress and inflammation related to homo- and hetero-polymerization of misfolded alleles. Finally, in a personalized medicine era, it is urgent to solve controversies regarding the disease risk associated with different genotypes (or groups of genotypes for rare variants), and to address the impact in the AATD clinical outcomes of different genetic/genomic modifiers and other factors to which an individual might be exposed (eg smoking, alcoholism, infection, air pollution, obesity).",

        "Title": "    Genetic characterization of pancreatic cancer patients and prediction of carrier status of germline pathogenic variants in cancer-predisposing genes",
        "Abstract": "    National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recently recommended germline genetic testing for all pancreatic cancer patients. However, the genes targeted by genetic testing and the feasibility of selecting patients likely to carry pathogenic variants have not been sufficiently verified. The purpose of this study was to genetically characterize Japanese patients and examine whether the current guideline is applicable in this population.\n\n    Using targeted sequencing, we analyzed the coding regions of 27 cancer-predisposing genes in 1,005 pancreatic cancer patients and 23,705 controls in Japan. We compared the pathogenic variant frequency between cases and controls and documented the demographic and clinical characteristics of carrier patients. We then examined if it was possible to use machine learning to predict carrier status based on those characteristics.\n\n    We identified 205 pathogenic variants across the 27 genes. Pathogenic variants in BRCA2, ATM, and BRCA1 were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer. Characteristics associated with carrier status were inconsistent with previous investigations. Machine learning classifiers had a low performance in determining the carrier status of pancreatic cancer patients, while the same classifiers, when applied to breast cancer data as a positive control, had a higher performance that was comparable to that of the NCCN guideline.\n\n    Our findings support the clinical significance of multigene panel testing for pancreatic cancer and indicate that at least 3.4% of Japanese patients may respond to poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitor treatments. The difficulty in predicting carrier status suggests that offering germline genetic testing for all pancreatic cancer patients is reasonable.\n\n    AMED under Grant Number JP19kk0305010 and Australian National Health and Medical Research funding (ID177524)",
        "Introduction": "    The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends that all patients with pancreatic cancer should undergo germline genetic testing for 11 cancer-predisposing genes including BRCA1/2 and Lynch syndrome genes. Despite the importance of reviewing a sufficient number of investigations to improve the precision and detail of such guidelines, there have been a few large-scale case-control association studies using a multigene panel in pancreatic cancer. Additionally, most investigations that examined several hundred patients almost only targeted non-Hispanic European subjects, despite interethnic differences in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. Thus, it is unclear whether the current NCCN guideline recommendation based on findings from the European population is reproducible and applicable to other populations.\n\n    Using amplicon target sequencing, germline pathogenic variants in the coding region of 27 cancer-predisposing genes were found in 6.7% of 1005 Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer. By comparing with 23,705 Japanese controls, BRCA2 (P = 2.723 x 10-18 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 14.7, 95% CI = 8.5-24.9), ATM (P = 3.168 x 10-11 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 10.7, 95% CI = 5.7-19.5), and BRCA1 (P = 3.333 x 10-7 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 13.4, 95% CI = 5.2-32.2) were identified as statistically significant causative genes. When analyzing the association between pathogenic variants in the three genes and demographic and clinical characteristics, carriers were more likely to have a family history of gastric (P = 0.028 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.7) and ovarian (P = 0.045 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 7.7, 95% CI = 0.7-48.6) cancers and severe lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.018 [Cochran-Armitage test]). Machine learning using six classifiers did not exhibit practical predictive performances for identifying patients with pathogenic variants in pancreatic cancer (AUC: 0.514-0.561).\n\n    BRCA1/2 and ATM are important genes for pancreatic cancer not only in the European population but also in the Japanese population. The proportion of patients with pathogenic variants in the Japanese population (5.1%) was almost the same as that in the European population (4.8%). However, predicting a carrier of a pathogenic variant based on clinical and demographic characteristics was found to be difficult, even when using machine learning classifiers. Thus, offering germline genetic testing for all pancreatic cancer patients would be a reasonable strategy.\n\n    Alt-text: Unlabelled box\n\n    Pancreatic cancer is devastating because of its high mortality rate, which has increased along with the incidence of the cancer in almost all countries and territories. According to Japanese cancer statistics, the five-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is the lowest among those of 19 cancers in the monitoring data of cancer incidence in Japan (cancers of the skin, larynx, bladder, uterine corpus, prostate, breast, liver, renal/urinary tract, stomach, uterine cervix, colon, rectal, thyroid, oral/pharynx, ovary, lung, esophagus, gallbladder/bile duct, and pancreas). The five-year survival rate for the localized stage of pancreatic cancer (6.1% of patients are diagnosed at this stage) is 38.6%, that of the regional stage (32.3%) is 10.2%, and that of the distant stage (42.8%) is 1.3%. The prevalence of pancreatic cancer per 100,000 individuals in Japan is 6.4, and the proportion of familial pancreatic cancer in Japan is 7.5% of all pancreatic cancer patients, both of which are comparable to those in Western counties. Germline pathogenic variants in cancer-predisposing genes (e.g. BRCA1/2, ATM, CDKN2A, MSH6, PALB2, TP53, APC, BARD1, BRIP, CHEK2, NBN, PMS2, RAD51, and RAD51C) have been identified in nearly 10% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Identifying a germline variant in a susceptibility gene not only would assist with early detection of at-risk individuals in the general population who would benefit from longitudinal surveillance programs, but also would be beneficial for selecting poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor treatments for BRCA1/2 genes and for developing cancer prevention strategies for relatives of cancer patients. However, several studies pointed out the difficulty of selecting patients with a pathogenic variant because an effective predictor for identifying those patients has not been identified.\n\n    The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline (Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic, version 1.2020) recommends that all patients with pancreatic cancer undergo germline genetic testing for BRCA1/2, ATM, CDKN2A, Lynch syndrome genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, EPCAM), PALB2, STK11, TP53 . Despite the importance of reviewing a sufficient number of investigations to improve the precision and detail of such guidelines, there has been only two large-scale case-control association studies, conducted by the same research group, using a multigene panel that examined over 1000 patients with pancreatic cancer. Additionally, most investigations that examined several hundred patients almost only targeted non-Hispanic European subjects, despite interethnic differences in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. We have previously identified differences in genetic characteristics of Japanese breast and prostate cancer patients compared to European patients. Thus, it is unclear whether the current NCCN guideline recommendation based on findings from the European population is reproducible and applicable to other populations.\n\n    To examine the applicability of the current guideline to pancreatic cancer germline genetic testing in Japan, we first performed a genetic characterization of Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer based on a large case-control sequencing association study, and then documented the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with pathogenic variants. We also examined whether pathogenic variant carrier status is predictable based on demographic and clinical characteristics using machine learning techniques.",
        "Methods": "    We obtained all samples from BioBank Japan, which is a multi-institutional, hospital-based registry that collected DNA and clinical information from patients with various common diseases, including pancreatic cancer, throughout Japan between 2003 and 2018. Clinical characteristics of cancer patients and control individuals were collected with interviews or medical record survey using a standard questionnaire at the point of entry to BioBank Japan. In this study, we analyzed the DNA of all 1009 pancreatic cancer patients available when requested (March 2018). We used data from 23,780 controls, as in our previous study investigating germline pathogenic variants in colorectal cancer patients. All participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the ethical committees of the Institute of Medical Sciences, the University of Tokyo, and the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences (Approval number: 17-17-16(8)).\n\n    We analyzed 27 genes (APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM, HOXB13, NBN, NF1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11, and TP53), which are known cancer susceptibility genes and include the 11 genes recommended for germline testing for pancreatic cancer by the NCCN guideline but also other cancer susceptibility genes included in Myriad myRisk Hereditary Cancer Test. We analyzed the complete coding regions and 2-bp flanking intronic sequences of all 27 genes (84,822 bp), except exons 10 - 15 of PMS2 due to the presence of PMS2 pseudogene, using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based targeted sequence method. We identified genetic variants, as described in our previous studies.\n\n    We determined the clinical significance (pathogenic, benign, or uncertain) of all variants as in our previous study, using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines (Supplementary Table 1). We considered variants to be pathogenic if they were classified as such by the ACMG/AMP guidelines and/or by ClinVar interpretation irrespective of review status. Variants not registered in ClinVar at May 20, 2019 were considered novel.\n\n    To take advantage of 65 demographic and clinical characteristics collected from patients of BioBank Japan, we attempted to predict the pathogenic variant carrier status of patients using machine learning techniques. Machine learning performance was assessed using six types of supervised machine learning classifiers: random forest, gradient boosting machine, conditional random forest, naive bayes, neural network, and support vector machine. We also used a multiple logistic regression classifier as the baseline. All classifiers were implemented using the R package \"caret\" (ver. 6.0.84). Down-sampling was used to correct for imbalances between the number of cases and the number of control samples in training data. Classifiers were trained using repeated 10-fold cross-validation of the training dataset, and their predictive performances were evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC) using \"pROC\" (ver. 1.15.3). Hyperparameters tuned by grid-search (the number of levels for each tuning parameter, 3) are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Variables missing in over 50% of samples were excluded from analysis; 52 variables used in machine learning analysis are shown in Supplementary Table 3. Finally, 721 pancreatic cancer cases with complete data across 52 variables were applied to each of the six classifiers to predict the carrier status of pathogenic variants in genes associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\n    To confirm the predictive performance of the classifiers, we applied the same procedure to breast cancer data as a positive control, because breast cancer has practical criteria for predicting the carrier status of pathogenic variants. For breast cancer patients, we analyzed germline pathogenic variant data and patient information across 65 characteristics. Sample collection, sequencing, and variant annotation of the data were conducted according to the same procedures as the present study. The same machine learning classifiers and criteria for variable selection as those used to analyze the pancreatic cancer data were applied. Finally, 2496 breast cancer cases without missing data across 48 variables were used to predict the carrier status of pathogenic variants in four genes significantly associated with breast cancer (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PALB2) (Supplementary Table 3). To evaluate the effect of sample size on machine learning performance, we assessed the AUC of the random forest prediction using the same number of breast cancer samples as the number of pancreatic cancer samples. We randomly selected 721 breast cancer cases from the training and test cohorts. To reduce any potential bias due to random selection, we generated 100 sets of data for evaluation.\n\n    Case-control association analysis was performed using a two-sided Fisher's exact test with a recessive model for MUTYH and with dominant models for the other genes. Bonferroni correction was applied for the association analysis between each of 24 genes with pathogenic variants and pancreatic cancer (P < 0.003 = 0.05/24). Median survival time for carriers and non-carriers of pathogenic variants of a subset of genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with a log-rank test for significance of the survival distribution using R package \"survival\" (ver. 2.44.1.1). A multivariable Cox regression model that adjusted for age at diagnosis and cancer stage was also used, along with a Wald test for the statistical significance of the relationship between carrier status and survival hazard. The patient population used for survival analysis was restricted to a subset of 351 pancreatic cancer cases that were enrolled in BioBank Japan within 3 months (<= 92 days) of diagnosis. In addition, to investigate the association between other demographic and clinical characteristics and pathogenic variants in any genes significantly associated with pancreatic cancer, we used t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests or Cochran-Armitage tests for discrete variables. When a characteristic showed a significant association, we separately analyzed the association between the characteristic and pathogenic variants in each individual gene. These statistical tests were two-sided, and values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using the R statistical package (ver. 3.5.1).\n\n    The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the Article.

        "Results": "    We fully analyzed 1009 pancreatic cancer cases and 23,780 controls. The mean age at diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was 67.2 years (standard deviation = 9.9) (Table 1). The incidence of pancreatic cancer was higher in males (62.0% of cases) than in females (38.0% of cases, P = 4.236 x 10-9 [t-test]). There were significantly higher rates of positive smoking and alcohol history among cancer cases (59.8% and 55.0% of cases, respectively) than among controls (46.9% and 45.9% of cases, respectively; P = 2.762 x 10-16 and 5.045 x 10-9 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], respectively). Personal history of any other cancer was reported by 15.1% of patients. First- and second-degree relatives were included in the analysis for familial history. Family history of any cancer was reported by 57.0% of patients. Family history of pancreatic cancer was observed in 8.1% of cases. Other clinical characteristics of cases are shown in Supplementary Table 4.\n\n    Sequencing analysis covered >= 20 sequence reads in 99.95% of the target region in 27 genes and identified 3610 genetic variants in 1005 patients and 23,705 controls. Among them, 65 variants had a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5%, 202 variants MAF <= 5% and > 0.1%, and 3343 variants MAF <= 0.1% in controls. According to the ACMG/AMP guidelines, we categorized the variants as follows: 14 pathogenic, 147 likely pathogenic, 133 benign, 227 likely benign, and 3089 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with insufficient evidence. Three variants designated as pathogenic using our application of the ACMG/AMP criteria had a MAF > 0.05% in controls, P > 0.05 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], and OR < 2, and were thus considered to represent at best low-risk variants and were removed from subsequent analyses (Supplementary Table 5): p.Arg223Cys in CHEK2 (present in 0.20% of cases and in 0.21% of controls, P = 1.000, OR = 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-3.7), p.Arg562* in CHEK2 (present in 0% of cases and in 0.05% of controls, P = 1.000, OR = 0.0, 95% CI = 0.0-8.5), and p.Lys111fs in RAD51D (present in 0.10% of cases and in 0.14% of controls, P = 1.000, OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.0-4.4). Incorporating the ClinVar interpretation, we finally considered 205, 3, 787, and 2615 variants as (likely) pathogenic, low-risk, (likely) benign, and VUS, respectively. Single-variant association results are shown in Supplementary Table 5 for the 205 pathogenic and the 3 low-risk variants and in Supplementary Table 6 for 787 benign variants and the 2615 VUS.\n\n    We focused on the 205 pathogenic variants. We compared the frequency of pathogenic variant carriers in cancer cases with those in controls (Table 2). In total, 67 patients (6.7%) and 225 control participants (1.0%) carried a pathogenic variant in one of 27 genes (P = 1.525 x 10-31 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 7.5, 95% CI = 5.5-9.9). Six genes (BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, APC, PALB2, and CDKN2A) had values of P < 0.05 [two-sided Fisher's exact test]. BRCA2 (P = 2.723 x 10-18 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 14.7, 95% CI = 8.5-24.9), ATM (P = 3.168 x 10-11 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 10.7, 95% CI = 5.7-19.5), and BRCA1 (P = 3.333 x 10-7 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 13.4, 95% CI = 5.2-32.2) were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer after Bonferroni correction. Although the direction of OR in APC (OR = 23.6, No. of carrier cases = 2), PALB2 (OR = 7.9, No. of carrier case = 2), and CDKN2A (OR =  , No. of carrier case = 1) also indicated association, the number of patients with pathogenic variants in these genes was very limited. We checked the locations and frequencies of the pathogenic variants in the three most significantly associated genes (Fig. 1). Among pathogenic variants in BRCA2, ATM, and BRCA1 in cases, 78.9% of them were singleton, and the most frequent pathogenic variant was c.4776+2T>A in ATM (n = 4, P = 3.821 x 10-5 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 47.3, 95% CI = 6.8-520.7), which were not found in 141,456 individuals in gnomAD 2.1.1 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/about).\n\n    The median overall survival time for patients with pathogenic variants in the three genes associated with pancreatic cancer (BRCA2, ATM, and BRCA1) was 0.97 years (95% CI, 0.48-1.60 years), whereas that for patients without pathogenic variants was 0.92 years (95% CI, 0.81-1.04 years). The association between the carrier status of pathogenic variants in those genes and median survival time was not statistically significant (P = 0.609 [log-rank test]) (Fig. 2). There was no difference by carrier status in survival hazard (adjusted by age at diagnosis and cancer stage) (hazard ratio: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33; P = 0.814 [Wald test]).\n\n    To investigate the association between pathogenic variants in the three genes of interest and demographic and clinical characteristics, we compared the characteristics between 51 carrier patients and 954 non-carrier patients. First, we analyzed the association of carrier status with diagnosis age because there were clear negative correlations between diagnosis age groups and the proportion of patients with pathogenic variants in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. The mean age of carriers and non-carriers was 67.0 and 67.2 years old, respectively, and no significant association between carrier status and diagnosis age was observed (p = 0.932 [t-test]). There was no unidirectional trend of the carrier frequency in age groups (Supplementary Fig. 1). Next, we analyzed the association of carrier status with the other characteristics. The carriers more often had a family history of gastric or ovarian cancers (37.3% vs 23.2% in non-carriers, P = 0.028 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], and 3.9% vs 0.5% in non-carriers, P = 0.045 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], respectively) (Supplementary Table 7). Nine of 17 ATM pathogenic variant carrier patients (52.9%) had a family history of gastric cancer (P = 0.008 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.3-11.2). Two of 9 BRCA1 pathogenic variant carrier patients (22.2%) had a family history of ovarian cancer (P = 0.002 [two-sided Fisher's exact test], OR = 52.4, 95% CI = 4.3-396.7). Regarding the family history of cancer other than gastric and ovarian cancers and the personal history of cancers other than pancreatic cancer, there were no significant associations observed in this study. For example, the proportions of carriers and non-carriers with a family history of breast cancer were 11.8% and 6.1%, respectively (P = 0.131 [two-sided Fisher's exact test]). A family history of pancreatic cancer was identified in 9.8% of carriers and 8.1% of non-carriers (P = 0.600 [two-sided Fisher's exact test]). The proportions of carriers and non-carriers having at least one first degree relative with pancreatic cancer were 9.8% and 7.9%, respectively (P = 0.593 [two-sided Fisher's exact test]). Pathogenic variants in the three genes were identified in 5 of 80 patients with at least one first degree relative (6.3%). Carriers also exhibited severe lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.018 [Cochran-Armitage test]), and ATM and BRCA2 were individually associated with severe lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.009 and P = 0.048 [Cochran-Armitage test], respectively) (Supplementary Table 8).\n\n    First, we assessed the predictive performance of machine learning classifiers using breast cancer data with 48 variables as a positive control. The AUCs of six classifiers using data from 2496 breast cancer cases ranged from 0.629 to 0.687; random forest, 0.687 (95% CI = 0.604-0.769); conditional random forest, 0.686 (95% CI = 0.607-0.765); gradient boosting machine, 0.666 (95% CI = 0.574-0.758); naive bayes, 0.673 (95% CI = 0.593-0.754); neural network, 0.629 (95% CI = 0.547-0.711); support vector machine, 0.667 (95% CI = 0.580-0.753) (Fig. 3a). The AUC of a multiple logistic regression classifier was 0.627 (95% CI = 0.536-0.718). Next, we assessed if breast cancer patients met the current NCCN guideline for genetic breast cancer testing (Supplementary Table 9), and then calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria (Supplementary Table 10). The results calculated based on the criteria of \"Testing is clinically indicated\" indicated 65.9% sensitivity and 61.3% specificity (Supplementary Table 10). The sensitivity and specificity calculated based on the criteria of \"Testing may be considered\" in addition to those of \"Testing is clinically indicated\" were 68.3% and 58.5%, respectively. Thus, the predictive performance of machine learning classifiers was equivalent to that of the NCCN guideline criteria for breast cancer testing (Fig. 3a).\n\n    We then applied the same classifiers to the pancreatic cancer data. Machine learning exhibited poorer predictive performance across all methods (AUC: random forest, 0.544 [95% CI = 0.439-0.650]; conditional random forest, 0.555 [95% CI = 0.414-0.697]; gradient boosting machine, 0.561 [95% CI = 0.460-0.663]; naive bayes, 0.544 [95% CI = 0.415-0.673]; neural network, 0.550 [95% CI = 0.418-0.682]; support vector machine, 0.514 [95% CI = 0.324- 0.704]) (Fig. 3b). The AUC of a multiple logistic regression classifier was 0.562 (95% CI = 0.425-0.698).\n\n    One hundred sets of reduced breast cancer data were examined to evaluate the effect of sample size on machine learning performance. The average performance of the random forest prediction that was applied to the reduced breast cancer datasets was higher than that of the prediction applied to pancreatic cancer dataset, although lower than that of the prediction applied to a complete breast cancer dataset with 2496 cases (AUC: mean +- sd, 0.629 +- 0.090) (Fig. 3c). Eighteen of the 100 reduced breast cancer datasets exhibited a lower AUC than did the pancreatic cancer dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2).",
        "Conclusion": "    The genetic characterization of patients with pancreatic cancer revealed that pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer and that at least 3.4% of Japanese patients would show a favorable response to PARP inhibitor treatment, indicating the significance of germline genetic testing. Predicting whether a pancreatic cancer patient was a carrier of a pathogenic variant in a cancer-predisposing gene based on clinical and demographic characteristics was found to be difficult, even when using machine learning classifiers. We thus concluded that offering germline genetic testing for all pancreatic cancer patients would be a reasonable strategy.\n\n    YuM conceived and designed the study. MH, KoM, and KS recruited patients. KeM, YI, ME, and YuM performed the sequencing and data analyses. KeM, YK, TY, YoM, HN, and YuM performed the statistical analyses and data interpretation. KeM and EK performed the machine learning analyses. KeM, AS, and YuM wrote the manuscript and all authors reviewed the final version.",
        "Discussion": "    We identified 205 pathogenic variants in 27 genes of 1005 Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer and 23,705 control individuals from the same racial and regional background. Pathogenic variants were found in 6.7% of unselected Japanese pancreatic cancer patients; BRCA2, ATM, and BRCA1 were identified as statistically significant causative genes. Only a few demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with pathogenic variants in patients with pancreatic cancer. Machine learning classifiers exhibited practical predictive performances for identifying patients with pathogenic variants in breast cancer but not for identifying patients with pathogenic variants in pancreatic cancer.\n\n    A significant association between pancreatic cancer diagnosis and pathogenic variant carrier status was observed in BRCA2, ATM, and BRCA1. As a sensitivity analysis, we conducted a case-control association analysis using a subgroup of cases matched to controls (i.e. > 60 years old and no personal and/or family history of cancer). Although the number of cases decreased from 1005 to 296, BRCA2, ATM, and BRCA1 showed P < 0.05 [two-sided Fisher's exact test] and the OR was relatively comparable to the original result (Supplementary Table 11). These genes have also been shown to contribute to pancreatic cancer in the European population, and are included in the NCCN guideline for germline genetic testing criteria for pancreatic cancer. In this study, 5.1% of patients with pancreatic cancer were carriers of pathogenic variants in these three genes, comparable to the frequency (4.8%) in the largest investigation in the European population. Because 3.4% of patients harbored pathogenic variants in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, PARP inhibitors are expected to help many Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer. Patients with pathogenic variants in ATM may be expected to respond to PARP inhibitor treatment because ATM is one of homologous recombination DNA damage repair genes. To our knowledge, there is only a case study reporting PARP inhibitor treatment for a patient with a germline pathogenic variant in ATM in pancreatic cancer, and it would thus be important to evaluate the effect of PARP inhibitors on a large number of pancreatic cancer patients with pathogenic variants in ATM. The three other genes (CDKN2A, TP53, and MLH1) that were shown to be cancer-associated in a previous investigation were not observed to be significantly cancer-associated in this study. Because only one or two carriers of a pathogenic variant in CDKN2A, TP53, and MLH1 were identified in Japanese pancreatic cancer patients and their proportions in this study were comparable to those in the previous study, the association of these genes need to be carefully evaluated based on larger investigation in this population. Therefore, BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM were identified as the key genes commonly contributing to the risk of pancreatic cancer in Japanese and European populations.\n\n    In this study, we identified three characteristics significantly associated with carrier status of pathogenic variants among pancreatic cancer patients: family history of ovarian cancers, family history of gastric cancers, and lymphovascular invasion. These associations have not been previously reported. Supplementary Table 12 shows demographic and clinical characteristics associated with pathogenic variants in cancer-predisposing genes in five investigations. The association between carrier status and family history of gastric cancer was not described anywhere. Pathogenic variants in ATM mainly explained the association in family history of gastric cancer, indirectly reflecting the association between ATM and gastric cancer. The association between carrier status and family history of ovarian cancer was examined in a previous investigation of pancreatic cancer. In the investigation, although the proportion of patients having family history of ovarian cancer was larger in carrier patients than in non-carrier patients, the association was not significant. A significant association between carrier status and lymphovascular invasion was not observed in pancreatic cancer patients in a previous investigation. Other significant cancer-associated characteristics have been reported in previous investigations (age of onset, stage of cancer, personal history of cancers other than pancreatic cancer, family history of breast cancer and other cancers, and location of cancer), although the association was not always consistent among those investigations. There was no obvious tendency for carrier frequencies to change depending on age groups, making age-based prediction of carrier patients impractical (Supplementary Fig. 1). The lower incidence rate of breast cancer in Japan than in Western countries might have resulted in the lack of a significant association between the carrier status and family history of breast cancer in this study. Given the lack of common associations identified across investigations to date (including the present study), it would appear that individual demographic and clinical characteristics will not be useful to identify pancreatic cancer patients who should undergo germline genetic testing.\n\n    We also examined the potential for predicting pathogenic variant carrier status using machine learning, a suitable technique for interactive high-dimensional data. In this study, we verified the applicability of machine learning for this purpose by using machine learning to analyze breast cancer data and comparing the results to the predictivity of the criteria used in the NCCN germline genetic testing guideline. It should be noted that machine learning was conducted using unselected variables without any adjustment based on existing knowledge, whereas NCCN guideline criteria have been polished several times according to the findings of various investigations. On the other hand, the predictive performance of all classifiers was found to be poor for pancreatic cancer, although the variables used for pancreatic cancer analyses were collected by a biobank project like the one used for breast cancer analyses. The most reasonable explanation is that the association between each characteristic and carrier status is not so strong in pancreatic cancer, and any combinations of those characteristics is still inadequate for predicting carrier status.\n\n    This study had some limitations. First, because DNA samples in this study were extracted from peripheral blood, somatic variants caused by clonal hematopoiesis may be reported as germline mutations especially in TP53 . Compared with germline variants, mosaic variants usually have a lower variant allele fraction (VAF). The mean VAF of pathogenic variants in TP53 (N = 12) in this study was 0.354 (min: 0.254, max: 0.482). The median VAF from clonal hematopoiesis was 0.03. Therefore, the variants reported in this study are most likely to be a germline variant. Second, we allowed for the presence of comorbidities in the cases and controls recruited in this study, which might have affected the analysis of the association between pathogenic variants and pancreatic cancer. We analyzed the association between pathogenic variants and the personal history of chronic pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus, which are known to be risk factors of pancreatic cancer. As no significant association was observed (P = 0.619 in chronic pancreatitis, P = 0.297 in diabetes mellitus [two-sided Fisher's exact test]), at least these diseases were unlikely to interfere with the analysis of pancreatic cancer and pathogenic variants. Third, although this study examined the largest number of non-European pancreatic cancer patients to our knowledge, we could not systematically analyze demographic and clinical characteristics associated with carrier status of each individual gene separately because the number of carriers for each gene was 9-25. A larger number of samples is required to investigate if there are novel clinically useful associations between characteristics and carrier status of each gene. Finally, the number of samples used for machine learning modeling might be limited. The predictive performance may be improved by increasing the number of samples in the training cohorts. However, the predictive performance for over 80% of reduced breast cancer datasets was higher than that for the pancreatic cancer data, suggesting a limited possibility of notably improving predictive performance for pancreatic cancer cases by increasing the number of samples in the training cohort.",

        "Title": "    Diagnostic yield of a multigene sequencing approach in children classified as idiopathic short stature",
        "Abstract": "    Most children with short stature remain without an etiologic diagnosis after extensive clinical and laboratory evaluation and are classified as idiopathic short stature (ISS). This study aimed to determine the diagnostic yield of a multigene analysis in children classified as ISS.\n\n    We selected 102 children with ISS and performed the genetic analysis as part of the initial investigation. We developed customized targeted panel sequencing, including all genes already implicated in the isolated short-stature phenotype. Rare and deleterious single nucleotide or copy number variants were assessed by bioinformatic tools.\n\n    We identified 20 heterozygous pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) genetic variants in 17 of 102 patients (diagnostic yield = 16.7%). Three patients had more than one P/LP genetic alteration. Most of the findings were in genes associated with the growth plate differentiation: IHH (n  = 4), SHOX (n  = 3), FGFR3 (n  = 2), NPR2 (n  = 2), ACAN (n  = 2), and COL2A1 (n  = 1) or involved in the RAS/MAPK pathway: NF1 (n  = 2), PTPN11 (n  = 1), CBL (n  = 1), and BRAF (n  = 1). None of these patients had clinical findings to guide a candidate gene approach. The diagnostic yield was higher among children with severe short stature (35% vs 12.2% for height SDS <= or > -3; P = 0.034). The genetic diagnosis had an impact on clinical management for four children.\n\n    A multigene sequencing approach can determine the genetic etiology of short stature in up to one in six children with ISS, removing the term idiopathic from their clinical classification.",
        "Introduction": "    Short stature affects 2.3% of children and is a frequent complaint in pediatric endocrinology visits. However, more than 60% of these children have clinical and laboratory evaluations with no relevant findings justifying their growth impairment and are classified as having idiopathic short stature (ISS). This term is widely used but this strict definition excludes children with evidence of systemic, endocrine, nutritional or chromosomal abnormalities, and those born small for gestational age (SGA). On the other hand, it includes familial short stature, which may suggest a major genetic basis.\n\n    It is known that human height has a high degree of heritability (>80%). Thousands of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (minor allele frequency (MAF) >= 5%) have a low individual impact on height variability (less than 1-2 mm), while some rare variants (MAF < 1%) have been associated with a higher individual impact on stature (about 20 mm). This demonstrates that short stature has a complex inheritance and that adult height is primarily determined by the sum of the effects of common and rare variants.\n\n    In the last 20 years, many monogenic defects have been established as causes of isolated short stature in patients initially classified as ISS. The genetic defects associated with ISS are mainly located in genes that regulate the endochondral ossification process in the growth plate and in genes related to the GH-IGF-1 axis. Also, defects in genes associated with the RAS-MAPK pathway (PTPN11 and NF1) were reported in children with short stature without other characteristics, with clear relevance for the patient s follow-up.\n\n    The individuals carrying these monogenic conditions exhibit variable degrees of short stature with nonspecific additional findings, limiting the use of a candidate gene approach. Therefore, genetic evaluation through multigene sequence analysis has gained importance, and several studies have already been published using this methodology in children with short stature of unknown cause. However, the previous studies assessed pre-selected samples and/or included children born small for gestational age (SGA) or children with syndromic short stature. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate a large number of homogeneous children classified as ISS, using a targeted gene panel as part of the initial investigation. We evaluated the diagnostic yield of this comprehensive genetic approach in 102 children with ISS.",
        "Methods": "    We enrolled 102 children initially classified as ISS for genetic investigation. The ethics committee for the analysis of research projects of the Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo approved the present study (approval no. 3.555.875). All procedures followed the ethical standards of our ethics committee and the Declaration of Helsinki. The patients and/or their tutors provided written informed consent after receiving a full explanation of the purpose and nature of all procedures.\n\n    All children underwent clinical and laboratory assessment defined by the ISS consensus. The inclusion criteria were short stature (height standard deviation score (SDS) <= - 2) and clinical assessment compatible with a healthy child. We excluded children born preterm (<37 weeks) and/or with low birth weight, as well as patients with significant dysmorphic features, major malformations, microcephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disabilities, skeletal dysplasia, chronic systemic, nutritional, and endocrine diseases, including growth hormone deficiency.\n\n    In total, 364 children classified as ISS and who met the inclusion criteria were evaluated between August 1994 and February 2020. Of these, 262 were not included because they lost clinical follow-up (n  = 198) and/or had already been genetically evaluated in previous studies using a candidate gene approach (n  = 64). A total of 102 children were enrolled for this study. Fifty-nine children without previous genetic studies were selected for the genetic study during the follow-up in our outpatient clinic (retrospective cohort). Forty-three children were sequentially enrolled from March 2018 to February 2020 (prospective cohort). For these 43 children, the present genetic analysis was performed just after the first clinical and laboratory evaluation (Fig. 1).\n\n    The clinical assessment included measurements of weight (measured using an electronic scale) and standing and sitting height (mean of three measurements using a calibrated wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm). The results were converted to SDS using age- and sex-specific norms for height, BMI, and sitting height:total height ratio (SH:H). The heights of the parents were obtained during the patients' visit or were obtained from the medical records reported by the family. The target height of the child was calculated as ((father's height + mother's height +- 13 cm)/2) and expressed as SDS. Patients were characterized as having familial short stature when at least one of the parents had height SDS <= -2. Bone age was assessed by the method of Greulich and Pyle, using left hand and wrist x-rays. All children underwent laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, creatinine, electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, screening for celiac disease, TSH, free T4, and IGF-1 levels determination. A karyotype was performed in all girls to exclude Turner syndrome. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was excluded in all children based on normal IGF-1 SDS level (IGF-1 SDS >= -1), normal growth velocity for age (n  = 100), and/or a GH peak at stimulation test > 5 microg/L (n  = 59).\n\n    Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes from all patients and relatives using standard procedures. Targeted panel sequencing was performed only for the index patients. We developed a customized targeted panel (Agilent SureSelect XT assay; Agilent Technologies). The complete list of included genes is available in Supplementary Table 1 (see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article). It contains genes expressed in the growth plate, involved in fundamental cellular processes and/or in the GHRH-GH-IGF1 pathway. In addition, we included SHOX genomic and enhancer regions to improve the analysis of this locus by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our customized targeted panel had similar accuracy to the standard evaluation of SHOX defects. In-house bioinformatic analysis was performed as previously reported. The sequences were aligned to the human reference genome sequence (GRCh37/hg19). Copy number variation (CNVs) analysis was also performed for all patients using the program Copy Number Targeted Resequencing Analysis (CONTRA) to identify the presence of deletions or duplications.\n\n    For data analysis, we searched for rare variants located in exonic regions and consensus splice site sequences, with MAF < 0.1% in public international (gnomAD) and national databases (ABraOM; SELAdb). We prioritized variants according to their potential to be pathogenic, including loss-of-function variants, variants predicted to be pathogenic by multiple in silico tools (Supplementary Table 2), or previously reported in Clinvar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). The sequencing reads carrying candidate variants were visually inspected using the Integrative Genomics Viewer to reduce false-positive findings. The assessment of gene function was performed using the OMIM (https://www.omim.org/) and PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate the candidate variants identified and for segregation analysis. The CNVs related to the SHOX gene identified by the CONTRA analysis were confirmed and segregated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). MLPA analysis was carried out using the SALSA MLPA P018 SHOX (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The other CNVs of interest were confirmed and segregated in the family using the CGH-array technique. All variants were classified following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology variant pathogenicity guidelines.\n\n    Qualitative (nominal) variables were reported as absolute values and percentages. Continuous variables were expressed as mean +- s.d. or median and interquartile range (IQR) (p25-p75). To compare children who had a genetic diagnosis with those without a genetic diagnosis and with those children who harbor a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), we used the ANOVA followed by Tukey test or Kruskal-Wallis, one-way ANOVA on ranks for numerical variables, as appropriate. Nominal variables were compared by chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. A P-value <0.05 was used for statistical significance. All analyses were done with SigmaStat software (RRID:SCR_010285, version 3.5; Systat Software, San Jose, CA).",
        "Results": "    We analyzed data from 102 unrelated children initially classified as ISS. The clinical characteristics of these children are summarized in Table 1. Children who were included in the genetic study during their follow-up (retrospective cohort) or at the initial evaluation (prospective cohort) had similar characteristics (Supplementary Table 3). Our cohort was characterized by the predominance of boys (66%) and patients with familial short stature (59%). The mean age at the first evaluation was 8.9 +- 3.7 years, and 78% of the selected children were prepubertal. The average height was -2.6 +- 0.8 SDS, with 70% of the children having a height SDS < -2.5 and 20% a height SDS <= -3.0. Most of the children were eutrophic (80%; BMI SDS >= -2 and <=1), 11% had low BMI (BMI SDS < -2), and 9% were overweight (BMI SDS > 1 and <=2). The mean difference between bone and chronological age was -1.9 +- 1.4 years.\n\n    Eight pathogenic (P) and 12 likely pathogenic (LP) heterozygous variants, including 4 CNVs (16 single nucleotide variants and 4 CNVs; total = 20), were identified in 17 of 102 patients. Three patients (patients 1, 4, and 7) had more than one P/LP variant (Fig. 2). The genetic results are described in Fig. 1 and Table 2. Ten single nucleotide variants were located in genes related to the growth plate (four in IHH, two in NPR2, two in FGFR3, one in ACAN, and one in COL2A1), one variant was in a gene associated with the GH-IGF1 axis (GHSR), and five variants were in genes related to the RAS-MAPK pathway (two in NF1, one in CBL gene, one in PTPN11, one in BRAF). In addition, we observed an allelic imbalance suggesting mosaicism in one NF1de novo mutation (Tables 2 and 3). Three CNVs were heterozygous deletions related to the SHOX gene, and one is a complex rearrangement involving the ACAN gene (Supplementary Table 4). Considering the 20 variants identified in this study, 13 were found in patients from the prospective cohort and 7 in patients from the retrospective cohort.\n\n    Additionally to P/LP variants, 13 variants were classified as VUS in 12 patients (Table 4). One patient had more than one VUS (patient 26), and another carried one P and one LP variant besides the VUS (patient 4). Eight VUSs were in genes related to the growth plate (three in NPR2, three in IHH, one in FGFR3, and one in COL2A1), four were in genes associated with the GH-IGF1 axis (three in IGF1R and one in GHR), and one in NF1 gene. Among these 13 variants, 6 were found in patients from the prospective cohort and 7 were found in the retrospective cohort.\n\n    The clinical characteristics of the children who had P/LP variants (n  = 17) are summarized in Tables 1 and 3. Twelve children (71%) inherited the variant from a parent with short stature (height SDS from -4.2 to -2.0). Seven patients had mild disproportionate short stature (SH:H SDS > 2) and a normal skeletal survey; all of them had defects in genes related to the growth plate (FGFR3, IHH, SHOX, and ACAN). Eight had nonspecific skeletal abnormalities, and seven of them with a variant associated with the growth plate. Two of four patients carrying a variant in IHH gene (patients 2 and 11) had a shortening of the middle phalanx of the fifth finger with cone-shaped epiphyses identified in the x-ray for bone age. None of the patients who had CNVs (n  = 3) related to the SHOX gene had Madelung deformity, and only one girl had disproportionate short stature. Most of the children had a bone age (BA) compatible with chronological age (58%) or slightly delayed BA (37%). Considering the two girls that harbored pathogenic variants in ACAN, only one had advanced bone age (CA 5.4 years; BA: 7.6 years), the other one had a bone age compatible with her chronological age (CA 9.3 years; BA: 8.6 years). The boys with pathogenic variants in CBL, PTPN11, and BRAF had no clinical criteria that could suggest Noonan syndrome or other RASopathies. Similarly, the two patients who had the NF1 variants did not have any clinical findings that suggested neurofibromatosis type 1 at the age of 2.7 and 9.6 years. One of them had mosaicism for the NF1 variant, which could explain the absence of additional signs.\n\n    Although children harboring LP/P variants had clinical characteristics that overlapped with children with negative results, as a group, these patients had a higher BMI and GH peak. There were no differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with VUS compared to patients with negative result (Table 1). Eight inherited the VUS from a parent with short stature (height SDS from -4.2 to -2.0), and only one had mild body disproportion.\n\n    We identified 20 P/LP variants and/or CNVs in 17 of the 102 children with idiopathic short stature, corresponding to a diagnostic yield of 16.7% (95% CI: 9-24%). The diagnostic yield was higher among children with severe short stature (height SDS <= -3; 35%) in comparison with children with less severe short stature (12.2%; P = 0.034). There was no significant difference in the rate of a positive genetic diagnosis in the group of patients with familial short stature (with 22.4%, without 9.1%; P = 0.129) or with mild body disproportion (present 30.4%, absent 14.1%, P = 0.116). The positivity in the prospectively evaluated group was higher: in this group, 10/43 patients (20.9%) had the cause of short stature elucidated vs 7/59 patients (11.9%) in the retrospective group. Despite this, there was no statistical significance when comparing the results of the two groups (P  = 0.333).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The assessment of children with ISS is puzzling. Despite the wide amount of reported new causes of growth disorders in children, those labeled as ISS remain without a specific diagnosis. The genetic investigation has emerged as a potential tool to establish the etiology of short stature. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive genetic study as part of the initial investigation of a large cohort of 102 children with ISS. We identified 20 P/LP variants and/or CNVs in 17 children with ISS, which corresponds to a diagnostic yield of 16.7%, including 3 patients with more than 1 P/LP finding (Figs 1, 2 and Table 2). Additionally, 13 variants were classified as of uncertain significance (VUS) in 12 patients. However, the definitive classification of VUS is a challenge, demanding the genotyping of several family members, functional assays and/or population studies. Thus, in our study, we preferred to be cautious and to consider patients with VUS belonging to the group of patients with negative results when we calculated the diagnostic yield. Consequently, this diagnostic yield may increase in the future if, some VUS are reclassified with additional data.\n\n    The diagnostic yield observed in our study was above the median reported in previous studies that used a multigene sequencing approach to assess children with short stature of unknown cause (average diagnostic rate of 12.5%, ranging from 8.7 to 19.5%; reviewed by Sentchordi-Montane et al.). Nevertheless, several of these studies were not restricted to patients with ISS and included patients who were born SGA, with syndromic conditions, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or skeletal dysplasia.\n\n    In one remarkable study, Hauer et al. evaluated 200 children with short stature by whole-exome sequencing (WES). A positive genetic diagnosis was obtained in 19 (14.2%) of 134 children initially classified as isolated short stature but which encompassed children born SGA or with syndromic features. In a recent study, Fan et al. analyzed 561 patients with short stature by WES. In a subgroup of 257 patients classified as having isolated short stature due to the absence of associated organ malformation(s) or other clinical evidence for multisystem involvement, a genetic diagnosis was obtained in 11.3%. However, among the positive results, mutations in genes associated with hypopituitarism, skeletal dysplasia, and chronic and metabolic disorders were reported, making it unlikely that all investigated patients met the ISS criteria. In another recent study, Sentchordi-Montane et al. evaluated 108 children with short stature and minor skeletal anomalies with a customized skeletal dysplasia NGS panel. Although most of these children met the criteria for ISS, about a third were born SGA. Additionally, defects in the SHOX were ruled out before patients had been included in the study. The diagnostic yield was 11.1%, considering only P/LP variants.\n\n    We can attribute the higher diagnostic yield of our study in part to the systematic analysis of CNVs. This analysis included the evaluation of the SHOX gene and its regulatory regions, whose haploinsufficiency is a well-known cause of short stature in patients with ISS. Three patients had P/LP SHOX-related CNVs, corresponding to 2.9% of our cohort. Additionally, our cohort had an enrichment of familial cases, which can be associated with an increased possibility to identify an autosomal-dominant genetic cause for short stature. Since our protocol was not pre-selected based on the patients' parent s height, we hypothesized that there was a referral bias of familial cases to our outpatient clinic in a tertiary center. Nevertheless, the severity of short stature was the only variable significantly associated with a higher diagnostic rate in our cohort.\n\n    Most of the genetic defects found in our cohort of ISS (70%) were identified in genes related to the growth plate (ACAN, IHH, SHOX, NPR2, COL2A1, FGFR3), similarly to previous studies. This finding emphasizes the role of defects in the endochondral ossification process leading to ISS phenotype. Children with defects in these genes usually inherited the genetic defect from a parent with short stature (9 of 13 cases); had mild body disproportion (7 of 13) and/or nonspecific skeletal abnormalities (7 of 13). However, these findings did not allow a differentiation between patients with alterations in the IHH, NPR2, ACAN, or SHOX genes. Additionally, three children with a causative defect in a growth plate gene had normal body proportion and no skeletal findings; and two children with de novo germline mutations had parents with normal height. Thus, clinical and radiological data may be insufficient to guide a candidate gene approach due to their nonspecificity (Table 3).\n\n    It is noteworthy that five children had genetic variants related to the RAS-MAPK pathway. Three of them had a de novo mutation, including one detected in a mosaic state and two inherited the variant from a parent with ISS (Table 2). These children may have a mild presentation in a spectrum of phenotypes caused by defects in these genes. Other studies using the genomic approach in patients with short stature also identified NF1 and PTPN11 mutations in patients without the typical clinical features. This data highlight the importance of the genetic diagnosis as it has an impact on the clinical follow-up and in the decision to start growth hormone therapy for these children.\n\n    Three patients have more than one P/LP genetic alteration that explains the short stature phenotype (Fig. 2). Multiple genetic diagnoses can occur in 1.4-7.2% of patients with Mendelian disorders. Additionally, two non-overlapping genetic diagnoses of growth disorders were previously reported in patients with syndromic short stature. The exact role of each variant in our patients' phenotype was not well established.\n\n    In summary, a multigene sequencing approach is able to determine a genetic etiology of short stature in up to one in six children with ISS, removing the term idiopathic from their clinical classification. Knowing the genetic basis of these patients short stature can allow precise genetic counseling and clinical follow-up. It is particularly relevant to children harboring variants that can support the indication or be a contraindication of rhGH therapy. Based on the significant and progressive reduction of the costs of the genetic studies and their increasing diagnostic yield, we expect to reach the time when this diagnostic tool will be routinely offered in the assessment of children with ISS.",

        "Title": "    Genetic variation in apolipoprotein A-V in hypertriglyceridemia",
        "Abstract": "    While biallelic rare APOA5 pathogenic loss-of-function (LOF) variants cause familial chylomicronemia syndrome, heterozygosity for such variants is associated with highly variable triglyceride phenotypes ranging from normal to severe hypertriglyceridemia, often in the same individual at different time points. Here we provide an updated overview of rare APOA5 variants in hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n    Currently, most variants in APOA5 that are considered to be pathogenic according to guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics are those resulting in premature termination codons. There are minimal high quality functional data on the impact of most rare APOA5 missense variants; many are considered as variants of unknown or uncertain significance. Furthermore, particular common polymorphisms of APOA5, such as p.Ser19Trp and p.Gly185Cys in Caucasian and Asian populations, respectively, are statistically overrepresented in hypertriglyceridemia cohorts and are sometimes misattributed as being causal for chylomicronemia, when they are merely risk alleles for hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n    Both biallelic and monoallelic LOF variants in APOA5 are associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia, although the biochemical phenotype in the monoallelic state is highly variable and is often exacerbated by secondary factors. Currently, with few exceptions, the principal definitive mechanism for APOA5 pathogenicity is through premature truncation. The pathogenic mechanisms of most missense variants in APOA5 remain unclear and require additional functional experiments or family studies.",
        "Introduction": "    Apolipoprotein (apo) A-V is a key regulator of plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. Biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) variants in the APOA5 gene are a well-documented cause of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which is characterized by severely compromised plasma lipolysis resulting in pathogenic elevation predominantly of intestinally-derived chylomicrons, refractory hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), characteristic physical findings, abdominal pain with failure to thrive, and high lifetime risk of pancreatitis. The consequences of heterozygosity - that is, a monoallelic pathogenic variant of APOA5 - is less well appreciated. We recently found that the phenotype associated with monoallelic variants in APOA5 is highly variable both within and between patients over time, associated with normal TG, mild-to-moderate and severe HTG phenotypes, with secondary factors playing an important modulatory role. This was perhaps counterintuitive to preconceived assumptions that heterozygosity for LOF variants in APOA5 would be associated with an intermediate HTG phenotype, following an incorrect analogy with familial hypercholesterolemia. Here, we synthesize this new understanding with previous information to provide an up-to-date characterization of APOA5 variants in HTG.\n\n    Apo A-V is one of the first human proteins identified using a primordial artificial intelligence approach leveraging comparative DNA sequence analysis. It was initially determined to be expressed almost exclusively in the liver and secreted with TG-rich lipoproteins, primarily very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Subsequently, expression of apo A-V in the small intestine was detected. Intestine-derived apo A-V is presumed to circulate in plasma with lipoproteins of intestinal origin, i.e., chylomicrons. Interestingly, apo A-V of hepatic origin is also found in the bile, technically making it an exocrine secretion that may reach the intestinal lumen to possible exert effects there. Despite its very low absolute plasma concentration relative to other apolipoproteins (i.e. <1 mug/ml), apo A-V is a potent regulator of plasma TG concentrations.\n\n    Apo A-V reduces plasma TG concentrations via multiple mechanisms. First, apo A-V plays an intracellular role whereby it interferes with hepatic synthesis of VLDL particles, averting their secretion into the circulation, by associating with cellular membrane components and various lipid species within hepatocytes. Second, apo A-V is bound to TG-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs) in plasma and directly enhances the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to clear TG from circulation, although this also depends on the concurrent presence of apo C-II and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1). Specifically, this function of apo A-V is most likely due to its ability to bind to and/or interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and GPIHBP1 on endothelial cell surfaces, which enhance the association of apo A-V-containing lipoproteins with endothelial cell surface features associated with LPL. GPIHBP1 is a major capillary lumen binding site and anchor for LPL and is also the platform upon which LPL-mediated lipolysis occurs. Third, there is some evidence that apo A-V mediates hepatic uptake of TRL remnants through interaction with members of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family.\n\n    Recently, a novel role for apo A-V was described by which it indirectly enhances LPL activity by competing with LPL for binding to a unique inhibitory epitope present in the ANGPTL3/8 complex, thereby suppressing the LPL-inhibitory effects of the complex . Additionally, this function of apo A-V plays a role in regulating selective tissue uptake of circulating TG in the fed versus fasted state . Specifically, in the fed state, increased insulin signaling induces the expression of ANGPTL8 in liver and adipose tissue while downregulating hepatic apo A-V production and adipose ANGPTL4 expression. The net effect is an increase in circulating ANGPTL3/8 complex uninhibited by apo A-V, which suppresses LPL activity in oxidative tissues such as skeletal muscle. TG hydrolysis in adipose tissue in turn increases because ANGPTL8 expressed in adipose tissue complexes with ANGPTL4, and the ANGPTL4/8 complex has reduced LPL-inhibitory activity compared to ANGPTL4 alone. Additionally, binding of the ANGPTL4/8 complex to adipose tissue LPL blocks interaction with circulating ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL4, which results in most circulating TG in the fed state being hydrolyzed in adipose tissue, where adipocytes take up the released fatty acids and store them for energy. The opposite occurs in the fasted state. Finally, recent tantalizing experimental data suggest that the modulating influence of ANGPTL4/8 includes effects that link the coagulation system with lipolysis, an interaction that requires further exploration. These functions are summarized in Table 1.\n\n    Thus, integrating the above multiple effects suggests that apo A-V promotes lipolysis and thus its plasma levels should be inversely related to TG levels. However, it has long been appreciated that there is a somewhat counterintuitive positive correlation between plasma levels of apo A-V and TG. This is the same direction of correlation seen between TG and apo C-III, an inhibitor of LPL activity that counteracts the effect of apo A-V. One possible explanation for this direct correlation is that apo A-V circulates on TGRL and thus within the macro-biochemical context, is positively correlated with TG levels. However, at the micro-biochemical regional level in close proximity to LPL, such as the endothelial cell or adipocyte, apo A-V enhances lipolysis, eventually resulting in TG reduction, but not at an immediate or sufficiently large scale as to be reflected in total plasma TG concentration, whose decline would be delayed and reactive, adhering to a slower time course.\n\n    After cleavage of the 23 amino acid signal peptide, the mature apo A-V protein consists of an ~39 kDa protein composed of 343 amino acids. It is secreted as a component of high density lipoprotein (HDL), VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo A-V has two coiled-coil domains and a large alpha-helical content with most recent predictions of structure, indicating an alpha-helical content ~35% in the lipid-free state and increasing to ~45% upon association with lipid, corresponding to elongation and stabilization of alpha-helix segments.\n\n    Apo A-V has several main functional domains. First, the N-terminal region spanning residues 1 to 146 of the mature protein is the likely hydrophilic domain of the protein with the alpha-helices in this region adopting a water-soluble helix bundle configuration. Second, the C-terminal region spanning residues 295-343 of mature apo A-V is highly hydrophobic and has lipid binding properties. Finally, the central intervening region between the terminal regions spanning residues 147-294 contains a string of residues associated with enhancement of LPL activity by interacting with GPIHBP1. Specifically, a positively charged region spanning residues 186-227 is involved in binding to HSPG, LDL receptor family members and GPIHBP1. There is strong evidence that this positively charged region on apo A-V and the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 are both required for interaction, which likely facilitates the LPL-enhancing function. Thus, enhancement of efficient LPL-mediated lipolysis of TGRLs requires coordination between GPIHBP1, apo A-V and LPL. Another region of note within the central intervening region of apo A-V is the hydrophobic region spanning residues 161 to 181 preceding the positively charged region; this region has been implicated in enabling apo A-V to bind to the surface of intracellular lipid droplets. This may explain the function of apo A-V to reduce hepatic VLDL secretion, although this may also result in concurrent hepatic lipid accumulation.\n\n    Currently, the exact region of apo A-V associated with its ability to bind the ANGPTL3/8 complex is unknown , although some inferences might be drawn based on properties of the apo A-V-interacting epitope of the ANGPTL3/8 complex. Specifically, it seems that the apo A-V-interacting epitope is a hydrophilic leucine zipper-like motif . Thus, apo A-V might interact with this motif either through its N-terminal domain, which is hydrophilic, or via residues in the intervening region between its terminal domains, since the C-terminal region of apo A-V is highly hydrophobic and might thus be unlikely to be involved directly in this interaction.\n\n    The gene encoding apo A-V in humans, namely APOA5, is located on chromosome 11q23.3 within the apolipoprotein gene cluster that also includes APOA1, APOC3, and APOA4. The APOA5 gene is composed of four exons and three introns spanning roughly 3.05 kb on the reverse strand. As mentioned above, the gene is expressed primarily in the liver and secondarily in the small intestine.\n\n    APOA5 is one of the five canonical genes in which presence of biallelic LOF variants underlies an extremely rare - prevalence of ~1-10 in a million - condition known as familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). FCS is characterized by sustained, refractory severe HTG due to essentially complete loss of LPL-mediated lipolysis of TGRLs, leading to excessive accumulation of chylomicrons in circulation. Clinically, this manifests as severe HTG that is resistant to treatment, potentially resulting in several other systemic manifestations such as lipemia retinalis, eruptive xanthomatosis, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal and acute pancreatitis, which can be fatal.\n\n    Loss of LPL-mediated lipolytic activity is caused primarily by biallelic LOF variants (i.e. homozygous or compound heterozygous) in one of the following genes; LPL in 70-80% of all cases, with the remaining 20-30% of cases caused by variants in APOA5, APOC2, GPIHBP1 or LMF1 genes. These genes comprise those encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL gene), and its four essential co-factors, apo A-V (APOA5 gene), apo C-II (APOC2 gene), glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1 gene), and lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1 gene), respectively. Occasional FCS cases are digenic, with affected individuals having single heterozygous variants in two of these genes. In depth discussion of the diagnosis and management of FCS is beyond the scope of this review, and is covered elsewhere.\n\n    The phenotype associated with biallelic LOF variants in the FCS genes is well understood. However, despite being much more common, the phenotype associated with monoallelic or heterozygous LOF variants in these genes is less well appreciated. We previously showed that ~3-4% of the general population with a normal lipid profile are heterozygous for rare pathogenic variants in one of the five FCS genes. Furthermore, heterozygosity for rare variants in these genes is statistically over-represented in mild-to-moderate and severe HTG cohorts, at three- and fivefold enrichment respectively. However, the heterozygous state is not 100% causal for HTG - it merely predisposes to increased risk of HTG. In addition, we recently showed that heterozygosity for rare LOF variants in both LPL and APOA5 is associated with highly variable TG levels both within and between patients over time, associated at times with normal TG, mild-to-moderate and severe HTG phenotypes.\n\n    With respect to definite or likely disease-causing variants of APOA5, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently at least 118 unique rare variants reported in the literature and/or databases as being associated or with suggestive evidence of possible associations with phenotypes such as FCS and HTG, but also with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We have summarized the coding sequence variants resulting in amino acid changes alongside the relative positions of the major functional domains of apo A-V in Fig. 1. We have also summarized outlined the nucleic acid changes for noncoding region variants in Fig. 2. Finally, we have curated and annotated some details of these variants in Table 2. Full details and notes related to molecular defect (where applicable) and exact citations are in Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content.\n\n    We obtained this list of variants by first compiling APOA5 variants listed in three databases as disease-causing or associated variants, namely the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), ClinVar, and Leiden Open Variation Database 3.0 (LOVD3) and then double-checking their reporting in the literature when possible. We independently assessed the pathogenicity of these variants using our laboratory pipeline as we have previously reported using the Franklin by Genoox tool (https://franklin.genoox.com) paired with manual curation, to determine the pathogenicity classifications of these variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. We also included variants found in our own clinical testing at the Lipid Genetics Clinic, London, Ontario, Canada, if they were considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic under the ACMG guidelines. We note that eight variants reported in ClinVar, namely p.Arg40Trpfs*16, p.Glu52Ter, p.Glu156Ter, p.Val166Argfs*102, p.Arg259Ter, p.Thr266Leufs*31, p.Gln283Ter, and p.Trp348Ter, nine reported in LOVD3, namely p.Gly26Glufs*37, p.Gln46Hisfs*11, p.Glu102del, p.Arg126Gln, p.Gln161Arg, p.Gln161Leu, p.Thr184Asnfs*84, p.Ala219Profs*79, and p.Gln229Ter, and the two novel variants found in our clinic, p.Ala20Profs*37 and p.Asp37Thrfs*20, have been included without any prior literature citations associated with them. At the time of writing, these variants have only been reported as clinical testing results. However, we feel that including these variants is warranted given that most predict premature stop codons (Table 2) in a gene for which LOF due to premature protein truncation is an accepted mechanism of disease.\n\n    Interestingly, our curation indicates that only 46 of the 118 variants in our compiled list are considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to the ACMG guidelines. This is because of a lack of functional research demonstrating the pathogenicity of most of these variants. To the best of our knowledge, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is not a prevalent mechanism by which LOF occurs with regards to APOA5 variants. It has been previously shown that even severely prematurely truncated APOA5 variants are synthesized and secreted. Premature truncation leads to disruption and/or elimination of key functional domains and misfolding of the truncated peptide. These deficits in the homozygous and compound heterozygous states lead to severe loss of apo A-V mass and activity in plasma, resulting in FCS, as discussed above. Indeed, as mentioned above, premature protein truncation is the primary mechanism by which LOF occurs in APOA5.\n\n    Currently, 47 of 50 variants classified as pathogenic predict premature protein truncations of varying severities (Figs. 1 and 2). Even small truncations eliminating small portions of the protein are deleterious as the lipid binding properties of apo A-V are enabled by the C-terminal lipid binding domain. The remaining three pathogenic LOF variants in APOA5 are also inferred to have marked functional compromise. These are namely: (i) APOA5 p.Ala6_Ala13del, which codes for a gross deletion of eight amino acids from the signal sequence resulting in missorting and impaired secretion; (ii) APOA5 p.Ser232_Leu235del, which codes for a deletion of 4 amino acids from the GPIHBP1-interacting domain; and (iii) APOA5 p.Leu253Pro, a missense variant that results in decreased liposome binding and loss of binding to sortilin, which is thought to affect both VLDL secretion and LPL activity.\n\n    However, the picture is less clear regarding the monoallelic LOF condition. As discussed earlier, previous descriptions of heterozygous carriers of LOF variants in APOA5 found considerable variability in baseline TG levels, ranging from normal TG to mild-to-moderate HTG to severe HTG. This is consistent with our recent findings of extensive baseline and longitudinal TG level variability. Taken together, alongside findings of young, healthy heterozygous carriers of APOA5 LOF variants, this suggests that secondary factors, such as increased age and body mass index (BMI), are likely needed to force expression of clinical HTG in APOA5 LOF variant carrying heterozygotes. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which the heterozygous state for a pathogenic variant predisposes to HTG is unclear. In the monoallelic state, the wild-type allele should theoretically provide sufficient compensation capacity to offset the LOF due to the variant allele. This is consistent with the findings of normolipidemic heterozygous carriers of APOA5 LOF variants and suggests that haploinsufficiency, where two healthy alleles are required to express a completely normal phenotype, is not a likely mechanism for HTG related to monoallelic APOA5 LOF variants. Rather, indirect evidence suggests that APOA5 variants exert a dominant-negative effect, where the variant protein interferes with the normal functionality of the wild-type protein. Specifically, preliminary evidence suggests that certain truncated apo A-V proteins are expressed and can interfere with the ability of wild-type apo A-V protein to associate with lipoprotein particles during their formation in cells. Given that normolipidemic carriers of APOA5 LOF variants are prevalent in the population, this dominant-negative effect of truncated apo A-V variants and the nonfunctional variant protein alone are insufficient to induce phenotypic HTG. But perhaps the heterozygous state compromises the homeostatic capacity of the lipolytic cascade such that it is more easily saturated in the presence of secondary TG-elevating risk factors, such as elevated age, increased BMI, polygenic risk accumulation, excessive calorie intake, etc.. A more easily saturated lipolytic capacity would more readily precipitate HTG, and even severe HTG if the secondary stresses were large enough. However, this explanation is just speculative at this time and the actual mechanistic picture underlying this dominant-negative interaction requires additional study.\n\n    The majority of reported APOA5 variants are missense variants that have been previously associated with HTG or related comorbidities, although according to the ACMG guidelines, many variants lack sufficient functional evidence to be considered pathogenic. Compared to the obvious molecular lesions caused by premature stop codons, the consequences of most missense variants in APOA5 are less obvious. Dedicated functional, structural, and/or family studies of the protein produced by missense variants are needed to determine the pathogenicity of these variants and the specific molecular defects they may induce.\n\n    Currently, perhaps the only missense variant that can be definitively labeled as a pathogenic LOF variant is APOA5 p.Leu253Pro. This variant was observed in the homozygous state in a pediatric female patient at age five years, with severe HTG with no other TG-elevating variants. Functional analysis revealed three consequences of this variant: (i) the secreted abnormal apo A-V had impaired liposome binding ability; (ii) the abnormal apo A-V had complete loss of sortilin and SorLA/LR11 binding ability, which are thought to mediate the ability of apo A-V to reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis and secretion; and finally, (iii) the secreted apo A-V variant potently inhibited LPL activity rather than enhancing it. In silico modeling suggested that the deleterious impact of this variant is because the leucine at residue 253 in wild-type apo A-V interfaces between two alpha-helices via hydrogen bonding interactions. Therefore, given the high alpha-helical content of mature apo A-V and the functional importance of these structures, it is likely that a missense variant that disrupts the formation and/or interaction of these alpha-helices would be pathogenic. However, specific functional studies are needed to confirm variant pathogenicity. In summary, while most missense variants in APOA5 are considered variants of uncertain significance (VUS), it is likely that at least some are in fact pathogenic variants and one of the potential mechanisms may be via disruption of key alpha-helical structures.\n\n    Many studies on APOA5 genetics have highlighted the TG-elevating effects of several common polymorphisms, as previously summarized. With respect to HTG, the APOA5 promoter polymorphism c.-1131T>C, c.-3A>G, c.56C>G, also known as p.Ser19Trp, c.553G>T, also known as p.Gly185Cys, c.725C>G, also known as p.Leu242Val, IVS3 + 476G>A (also known as c.162-43G>A) and c.*158T>C polymorphisms have been associated with elevated TG in numerous small case-control association studies, and more recently as small effect signals for slight deviations in TG levels in genome-wide association studies.\n\n    These common APOA5 polymorphisms, especially p.Ser19Trp and p.Gly185Cys, are often interpreted as being major contributors to the large variability in HTG severity observed in heterozygotes for true rare APOA5 LOF variants, such as truncating variants. They are even sometimes erroneously reported as being causal for FCS on clinical genetic reports of next-generation sequencing analysis. In reality, these are merely risk alleles that raise the probability or odds of developing HTG if the metabolic context allows. But they are not directly causal or pathogenic, as evidenced by their high frequency of 5 to 15% in normolipidemic populations. Furthermore, they are actually components of polygenic risk scores for HTG, and contribute to the burden of TG-raising polymorphisms in patients with both mild-to-moderate and severe HTG. We suggest that these polymorphisms should be excluded from any experimental analysis of true LOF pathogenic rare variants of APOA5.",

        "Conclusion": "    Apo A-V is an important regulator of TG metabolism despite its relatively low plasma concentration and near exclusive expression in hepatic tissue. Here, we have summarized current understanding of the physiological roles of apo A-V related to TG metabolism and have provided a very comprehensive overview of APOA5 genetic variants. Apo A-V has a wide range of functions related to lowering HTG. Thus, LOF variants in APOA5 represent an important genetic contributor and sometimes direct cause of HTG. Our recent study clarified the TG phenotype associated with heterozygosity for APOA5 LOF variants and highlighted the highly variable TG phenotypes both between and within patients over time. Our analysis indicates that the primary mode of APOA5 LOF pathogenicity is through premature stop codons. Furthermore, we have also highlighted a need for improved understanding of the role of missense variants in APOA5-associated disease. Currently, minimal in vitro or in vivo functional studies have been conducted to evaluate dysfunction of APOA5 missense variants. Therefore, future studies using high throughout functional analytic platforms should aim to uncover the molecular and biochemical defects associated with APOA5. Greater understanding of the biochemistry underlying these variants may lead to new and better diagnosis and treatment for HTG.",

        "Title": "    Prevalence of Variants of Uncertain Significance in Patients Undergoing Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer and Lynch Syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    The increasing advancements in genetic testing have led to a rise in the number of patients undergoing cancer genetic testing who receive a VUS (variant of uncertain significance) result. This outcome leaves both patients and their healthcare providers perplexed, as they are unsure about the actual cancer risk and the necessary preventive measures. To address this issue, our retrospective study aimed to assess the occurrence of VUSs in patients tested for two prevalent cancer genetic syndromes. Additionally, we sought to explore the demographic and clinical characteristics of the population who received a VUS result. Our findings revealed that nearly one third of patients tested for common cancer genetic syndromes obtained a VUS test result. Furthermore, we discovered that age, personal history of breast cancer, and family history of breast or ovarian cancer were associated with VUS results. Further research is imperative to identify individuals at risk of receiving a VUS report and, more importantly, to develop tests that can accurately determine the associated cancer risk.\n\n    Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) and Lynch Syndrome (LS) are the most common inherited cancer syndromes identified with genetic testing. Testing, though, commonly reveals variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). This is a retrospective observational study designed to determine the prevalence of pathogenic mutations and VUSs in patients tested for HBOC and/or LS and to explore the characteristics of the VUS population. Patients 18-80 years old that met NCCN criteria for HBOC and/or LS genetic screening were tested between 2006 and 2020 at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A total of 663 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 50 years old and 90% being females. Pathogenic mutations were identified in 12.5% and VUSs in 28.3%. VUS prevalence was associated with race (p-value = 0.019), being particularly higher in Asian populations. Patients with a personal history of breast cancer or family history of breast or ovarian cancer were more likely to have a VUS (personal breast: OR: 1.55; CI: 1.08-2.25; family breast: OR: 1.68; CI: 1.08-2.60, family ovarian OR: 2.29; CI: 1.04-5.45). In conclusion, VUSs appear to be detected in almost one third patients tested for cancer genetic syndromes, and thus future work is warranted to determine their significance in cancer development.",
        "Introduction": "    Germline genetic testing is slowly becoming a regular part of clinical practice. With the surge of next-generation sequencing technologies, many novel genetic variants have been identified, most of which are variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). The latter are DNA changes in a genetic sequence with an unknown effect on the gene function and risk for cancer development. Thus, genetic tests for inherited mutations are reported as positive (pathogenic mutations likely to cause malignancy), negative (no mutation), or VUS (variation in a genetic sequence for which the association with disease risk is unclear). The two most common hereditary cancer syndromes are Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome. HBOC is responsible for 10-15% of all breast cancers and 24% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are most commonly involved in HBOC. Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by germline mutations, leading to impaired function in one of the multiple mismatch repair genes. As a result of impaired DNA processing correction, patients with Lynch syndrome are at 80% risk for colorectal cancer, 60% for endometrial cancer, and at increased risk for several other malignancies. The mismatch repair genes commonly involved are MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.\n\n    As our understanding of hereditary cancer syndromes advances, a noteworthy convergence has emerged among these syndromes. This intersection is particularly evident in the increased risks associated with certain cancers. Both pancreatic and ovarian cancers, for instance, exhibit heightened risks for hereditary cancer syndromes. Lynch syndrome (LS) alone accounts for 13-15% of ovarian cancer cases. The literature also underscores the association between specific mutations and an elevated risk of certain cancers. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, for instance, are linked to increased risks of endometrial and colorectal cancers, while Lynch syndrome is associated with a higher breast cancer risk. Notably, Lynch syndrome patients with specific mutations, such as PMS2 and those exhibiting MMR deficiency, face an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. The accumulating evidence designates breast cancer as an extra colonic manifestation of Lynch syndrome. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of pathogenic variants in both Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome is on the rise, underscoring the complex interplay between these genetic predispositions.\n\n    Genetic testing of high-risk individuals for HBOC and Lynch syndrome allows patients and their children to undergo close surveillance with more frequent screening, including breast imaging or colonoscopies, endometrial sampling, and pelvic ultrasounds with CA-125 levels, leading to early detection and improved morbidity and mortality. Depending on the results, some may be placed on risk-reducing medications or decide to undergo risk-reducing surgery, like mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. Unfortunately, as NGS (Neo-Genomic Sequencing) use is becoming more widely available, an increasing proportion of patients tested for HBOC or Lynch receive a diagnosis of VUS, leaving them and their physicians unsure of how to proceed with screening intensity. The reports of VUS rates vary, ranging from 10-40% in patients undergoing genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes. Specific patient demographics or risk factors associated with a VUS result continue to remain unclear. The aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of pathogenic mutations and VUS in patients tested for HBOC and/or Lynch syndrome and to further explore the demographic and clinical characteristics of the population receiving a VUS result.",
        "Methods": "    This is retrospective observational study designed to determine the incidence of genetic mutations and VUS in patients who underwent genetic risk assessment for HBOC and/or Lynch syndrome at Mount Auburn Hospital (MAH), an academic community hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, between 2006 and 31 July 2020. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and follow-up were gathered through electronic medical records. For data storage, a master code spreadsheet was generated linking a study number to direct identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, dates of therapy, dates of access to medical records, and medical record numbers) Then, a de-identified data spreadsheet was created with each patient's study number, race, ethnicity, medical history, treatment history, family history, disease characteristics, and outcomes. Given this was a medical record review study without interventions, no informed consent was required. With regards to confidentiality, all spreadsheets were maintained as password-protection-accessible only to members of the study protocol, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our network.\n\n    Included in the study were patients between 18 and 80 years who met the criteria for HBOC or Lynch syndrome genetic testing between 1 January 2006 and 31 July 2020. For HBOC, we used the NCCN recognized criteria for genetic testing as summarized in Table 1(a). For Lynch syndrome, genetic testing was pursued in individuals that met Amsterdam II or Bethesda criteria, as described in Table 1(b).\n\n    Genetic mutation information was extracted from patients' genetic testing laboratory reports. All our patients underwent testing via the commercial Invitae or Myriad genetic panels. These panels encompass a comprehensive 20+ gene hereditary cancer panel, inclusive of both HBOC and Lynch genes, along with several others. The 20+ common genes for which patients are typically, at minimum, tested for are as follows: BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, APC, MUTYH   CDK4, CDKN2A (p16INK4a, p14ARF), TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, BMPR1A, SMAD4, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, NBN, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, POLD1, POLE, and GREM1. Patient records were collected for the period spanning from 2006 to 2020. Notably, genetic panels underwent modifications over time, resulting in variations among tests. These changes were influenced by the addition of new genes or, in some instances, patients opting for more limited panels based on their preferences or insurance coverage. Our analysis considered all Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUSs) detected through genetic testing, extending beyond the confines of NCCN-designated HBOC and Lynch syndrome genes. For result interpretations, reports without identified mutations were categorized as \"negative\". Conversely, if a mutation was identified, it was classified as \"positive\" (indicating a pathogenic mutation), \"VUS\", or grouped with the negative results if deemed benign.\n\n    To classify mutations, we utilized ClinVar 19, designating results as \"positive\" if they had at least one pathogenic report in ClinVar. Variants were considered VUS if they lacked pathogenic reports in ClinVar but had at least one report of unclear significance. Variants were designated as negative if they lacked pathogenic or unclear significance reports in ClinVar. The determination of results as positive, negative, or VUS was based on ClinVar reports published as of 9 July 2023. Mutations not previously reported in ClinVar were considered VUS and were included in our analysis.\n\n    Our primary goal was to determine the prevalence of pathogenic mutations and VUS in patients that underwent genetic risk assessment for HBOC and/or Lynch syndrome. We also assessed the demographic and clinical characteristics of the population that underwent genetic testing and tried to explore potential risk factors that could be associated with the detection of VUSs.\n\n    The descriptive data for demographic and clinic characteristics are presented as median +- standard deviation (SD) or percentages (%). The Chi-square test was used to evaluate VUS proportion within different subgroups. A p-value <= 0.05 was considered significant. The Chi-square test was performed with GraphPad Prism, version 9.5.1. Effect size was measured with Odds Ratio (OR) for retrospective data, and the Confidence Interval (CI) was set at 95%.",
        "Results": "    There were 663 individuals included in our study. All patients met the criteria for genetic testing for HBOC or Lynch syndrome (or both) and were tested during the period 2006-2020 at MAH. The mean age was 50 years (SD:15), with 90% being females and with a high proportion of patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (14.3%). Regarding personal history of cancer, 162 (24.4%) had a previous breast cancer and 25 (3.7%) had a precancerous breast lesion. Colon cancer rates were much lower, at 3.01%. The majority of patients had a family history of cancer, with 351 (52.9%) in first- and 396 (59.7%) in second-degree relatives. In our cohort, 20 (3.01%) patients reported active smoking and 47 (7.08%) reported previous smoking history. Almost no patients reported heavy alcohol drinking (i.e., >7 drinks/week for females and >14 drinks/week for males). Baseline characteristics are available in Table 2.\n\n    The most common indication for genetic testing was HBOC (558, 84.2%). A total of 90 pathogenic mutations were identified in 83 (12.5%) patients, with the most common being BRCA mutations (24, 28.9%), followed by MUTYH (11,13.2%) and CHEK2 mutations (10, 12.0%). All pathogenic mutations were reported classified as pathogenic in ClinVar, and among them, 12 out of 90 (13.3%) had conflicting reports indicating uncertain significance.\n\n    Among the whole group, 188 (28.3%) patients had a VUS, with 253 total VUSs identified (Table 3). Eleven of those mutations had not been previously reported in ClinVar (Table 4). Fifty-two patients (26.6%) had two or more VUSs within the same or different genes. Most VUSs were in APC, followed by ATM and MSH3 (Figure 1). Other common genes in which VUSs were detected were CHEK2, NBN, BRIP1, MSH2, and MSH6 (Figure 1). ATM and MSH6 were the most common genes in the Asian population. In the African-American population, the most common genes were NBN and APC. All variants found were previously described in ClinVar. VUSs and pathogenic mutations were present simultaneously in nine patients (0.90%).\n\n    During the period from June 2021 to June 2023, we observed significant changes in the distribution of pathogenic, VUS, and negative findings within our cohort, driven by the updates to ClinVar. Notably, our preliminary analysis of 663 patients in June 2021 revealed 76 deleterious mutations, whereas the June 2023 analysis identified 89 such mutations. Additionally, the number of VUSs also saw an upward trend, rising from 200 in June 2021 to 253 by June 2023. We also identified VUSs that had conflicting data on ClinVar (Table 5).\n\n    Rates of VUS were not different with relation to age (<=40 vs. >40) or ethnicity (Hispanic vs Non-Hispanic) (Table 6). Interestingly, VUS incidence rates were significantly associated with race (Table 6). Post hoc analysis showed that VUSs were much more commonly detected in our Asian population compared to White patients (OR: 2.44; CI: 1.18-5.15). There was no difference between White and African-American, or African-American vs Asian. Furthermore, patients with a personal history of breast cancer were almost two times more likely to have a VUS compared to patients without a previous history (OR: 1.55; CI: 1.08-2.25) (Table 6). Patients with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative were also more likely to have a VUS (OR: 1.68; CI: 1.08-2.60 for breast and OR: 2.29; CI: 1.04-5.45 for ovarian) (Table 6). Family history of prostate or colon cancer in a close relative did not affect VUS rates (Table 6). Finally, the most common recommendation following a VUS report was annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (70/188, 37.2%) as per review of clinical notes on electronic medical records. The next most common recommendations were following up with the primary care doctor (PCP) (20/188, 10.6%) or oncologist (30/188, 15.9%) in high-risk clinics.",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, VUSs appear to be detected in almost one out of three patients tested for cancer genetic syndromes, like HBOC and Lynch, thus having a huge impact on patients' psychology and health management. Further studies are required to identify patients at risk for VUSs and, most importantly, to develop tests to determine the associated cancer risk.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the prevalence of VUS in patients meeting genetic test criteria for HBOC or Lynch syndrome in a USA-based population between 2006 and 2020. Our results show that 12.5% of the 663 patients that met the criteria for HBOC and/or Lynch genetic testing were found to have a pathogenic mutation, while almost one third of patients (28.3%) were found to have a VUS. VUS detection appeared to be associated with race, personal history of breast cancer, and family history of breast or ovarian cancer.\n\n    In our patient population meeting genetic test criteria for HBOC or Lynch syndrome, 12.5% of patients were found to have a pathogenic mutation, with the most common being in BRCA1/2 followed by MUTYH and CHEK2. BRCA1/2 are the most common genes involved in HBOC, and mutations in either of the BRCA genes increase a woman's risk of breast cancer to 45-65% by 70 years old. CHEK2 DNA repair gene pathogenic mutations also account for a significant amount of breast and colon cancer. In contrast, MUTYH is primarily associated with MUTYH-associated polyposis, exhibiting some phenotypic similarities to Lynch syndrome. In a Europe-based study, MUTYH accounted for only 3.6% of Lynch syndrome-like cases. In our study, however, we identified MUTYH pathogenic mutations in 13.2% of cases. This disparity may be attributed to incidental factors, population-specific genetic variability, or other contributing factors.\n\n    The main finding of our manuscript is the high prevalence of VUSs in patients tested for HBOC and/or Lynch. Almost one-third (28.3%) of the patients received a report for a VUS. There have only been a few studies evaluating VUS prevalence across the world, generating inconsistent results. For example, VUS prevalence was 46.1% in a Brazilian population tested for HBOC, while it was 9.2% in a Jordanian-Arab population. This variability can be attributed to the availability of genetic testing, the number of genes tested in each panel, and possibly demographics and specific population characteristics. It is also important to consider that the relevance of genetic variants to disease is undergoing constant evaluation and change as NGS continues to advance. This is evident from the significant difference in prevalence numbers observed between our June 2021 and June 2023 analyses. The shifting prevalence of numbers highlights the continuous discovery of new variants and the evolving landscape of genetic research. Staying updated on the latest advancements is essential to ensure accurate and up-to-date genetic analysis and interpretation.\n\n    In addition, VUS prevalence showed no significant difference between the Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations in our study. However, when examining different racial groups, we observed significantly higher VUS rates in all non-White groups. A subgroup analysis further revealed that a significant difference in VUS rates was specifically observed between the Asian and White populations. However, the small sample size in the non-White groups and uneven distribution due to the observational study design may pose limitations to our findings. The literature data regarding the prevalence of VUSs based on race or ethnicity are currently scarce. Some studies find no correlation, while others, consistent with our results, find a higher prevalence of VUSs in non-White populations. In a recent large study, Ndugga-Kabuye et al. evaluated VUS prevalence in 50,000 patients and confirmed the higher prevalence of VUS in non-European populations (i.e., Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders). The absence of ancestral variety in genomic investigations is most likely to blame for the racial/ethnic discrepancies. For example, European ancestral populations account for the majority of observations (55.8%) in ClinVar, used to determine if a mutation is pathogenic or of undetermined significance.\n\n    Furthermore, we show that individuals with a personal history of breast cancer or family history of breast/ovarian cancer are more likely to have a VUS compared to their counterparts without history. This association may be an unintended consequence of VUS predominance in our population that will be later reclassified as pathogenic. If not incidental, it raises the question of whether VUS is the outcome of the increased mutational tendency seen in patients with pathogenic mutations and/or a history of cancer. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have compared the prevalence of VUS in patients with and without a personal or family history of cancer. Ndugga-Kabuye et al. performed separate analyses for VUS prevalence for patients with a positive and negative history of cancer. Although they did not statistically compare the prevalence, based on descriptive data, a VUS in HBOC or LS genes was found in 6.8% of patients with a personal history of cancer and in 6.4% of patients without, which is more suggestive of a similar distribution. Another study that looked at VUS prevalence in breast cancer found no link between VUS rates and triple-negative malignancy. Larger, prospective, and randomized studies are thus needed to investigate the possible correlations of VUS with ancestry and cancer history.\n\n    The unclear diagnosis resulting from a VUS result can have a negative impact on a patient's health. The lack of structured medical guidance leads to inconsistent management based on the approach of the PCP or oncologists. Some patients may not be offered predictive testing, while others may enter a cycle of intense screening and/or risk-reducing interventions of unclear benefit. Furthermore, studies show that an inconclusive diagnosis may affect patients' psychology, increasing stress and anxiety. Similarly, the accuracy of pathogenic reports may also need to be questioned. In our study, all pathogenic mutations were listed as pathogenic on ClinVar, but 12/90 (13.3%) also had conflicting reports for uncertain significance or benign classification. This can lead to overestimation of the pathogenicity of the assessed variants and underestimation of VUSs. Thus, there is an unmet need to understand and better classify VUSs.\n\n    Towards this end, the ongoing development of functional assays holds promise in accurately determining the cancer risk associated with VUSs in a timely way. These assays are designed to assess the impact of a particular variant on the structure and functionality of the corresponding protein, providing an estimated VUS pathogenicity. Large investigator consortia, like ENIGMA or INSIGHT, have started to form, with the aim of collecting a large amount of data on VUSs and subsequently using machine learning prediction models or functional assays in determining the significance of variants.\n\n    To further address the complexity of sequence interpretation, the American Society of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) has released a set of guidelines for the classification of new sequences. According to the ACMG, sequences should be categorized as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, of uncertain significance, likely benign, or benign. The criteria for classifying a sequence as pathogenic or likely pathogenic take various factors into consideration, such as the type of mutation (e.g., frameshift, nonsense), whether the mutation is causing an amino acid change of known pathogenicity, and the patient's demographics. On the other hand, the criteria for benign or likely benign involve considerations like patient demographics, the frequency of the sequence, and existing functional studies. It is important to highlight that both sets of criteria take into great consideration the sequence distribution in healthy vs. affected individuals. Sequences identified in patients with a personal history provide robust evidence of pathogenicity, while those observed in healthy adults are more likely to be benign. Of note, these guidelines are designed for the interpretation of sequences related to inherited (Mendelian diseases) and not somatic genetic variations.\n\n    For sequence interpretation, the ACMG recommends that healthcare providers work in collaboration with clinical laboratories, as the patient's clinical information plays a crucial role in enabling the laboratory to accurately classify genetic variants. Given the growing complexity of analysis and interpretation, the ACMG strongly advocates for these tests to be conducted in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved laboratories, and the results should be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or pathologist. While acknowledging the current imperfections in variant classification, the ACMG recommends that mutations deemed pathogenic or likely pathogenic have substantial evidence to be used in clinical decision making, always within the appropriate clinical context. On the other hand, variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) are discouraged from influencing clinical decisions. Some experts recommend that laboratories do not release VUS reports and alert the clinician only if the VUS is reclassified as pathogenic. However, this approach might threaten patients' autonomy. As per the ACMG, as efforts to reclassify VUS are ongoing, vigilant monitoring of patients with VUS results is advisable. This approach ensures a cautious and informed approach to utilizing genetic information in clinical practice.",

        "Introduction": "    Irish Thoracic Society Annual Scientific Meeting\n\n    19 November 2021\n\n    Outline Programme\n\n    IRISH THORACIC SOCIETY POSTER REVIEW AND DISCUSSION\n\n    1. ILD\n\n    1.1 An Evaluation of 116 patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) commenced on anti-fibrotic treatment therapies (Pirfenidone and Nintedanib) from Jan 2019 to June 2021\n\n    Bowen BR and Henry MT\n\n    Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Cork University Hospital, Cork\n\n    There are two approved anti- fibrotic treatments for IPF, pirfenidone (P) and nintedanib (N) but some patients need to stop or switch medications due to side effects. In large studies, both treatments slow the progression of IPF by 50 per cent based on lung function measurement.\n\n    The aim of this study was to evaluate the medication treatments and side effects on our cohort of patients with IPF over a two and a half year period. Consecutive patients with mild/moderate IPF (FEV1 > 50% predicted, DLCO > 35% predicted) prescribed pirfenidone or nintedanib at the ILD clinic in Cork University Hospital were analysed.116 patients commenced on either treatment from January 2019 to June 2021 were assessed.\n\n    With education, awareness and a patient centred approach, potential dose adjustment, monitoring and symptom management is crucial to maintain adherence to the therapies.\n\n    1.2 RB-ILD: More common than we thought?\n\n    Conor Cruickshank1, Michaela Donaghy2, Eoin Murtagh3, Paul Minnis3\n\n    Interstitial Lung Disease Service, Antrim Area Hospital, Bush Road\n\n    Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) is a rare, inflammatory pulmonary disorder that occurs almost exclusively in current or former heavy smokers. A previous epidemiological study has reported the incidence of 0.04 per 100,000.1 The natural history is unknown, specifically whether interventions result in radiological or clinical improvement and what the long-term sequelae may be of this condition.\n\n    We reviewed all patients attending ILD clinic (712) over the last 18 months and identified 23 (3.2%) with RB-ILD satisfying clinic-radiological descriptors in addition to pathology where available. The crude incidence was estimated at 4.86 per 100,000. The average age at presentation was 56.1 years (35-77) having accrued 40.2 pack years and demonstrated a slight female predominance (12/23). All but one patient reported gradual onset of exertional dyspnoea, symptomatic wheeze and or persistent cough. In all cases high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) described centrilobular micronodules, ground-glass opacities, and peribronchiolar thickening. Additional emphysema was seen in 6/23. 11 patients underwent bronchoscopy for confirmatory pathology.\n\n    21 patients had serial data and were followed up for a median of 38.7 months (IQR 14.2-58.3). During this time 7 stop smoking, 6 reduced consumption and the rest continued actively smoking. Radiological improvement was seen in 2 patients both of which had stopped smoking. Adjusted DLCO percentage change was calculated for a 24-month period with patients characterised into \"active\", \"reduced\" and \"stopped\" tobacco use cohorts (Fig. 1). There was a small signal in terms of the relationship of ESR with DLCO when adjusted for co-existent emphysema.\n\n    A higher incidence than expected within the Northern Trust was identified. Active tobacco use was associated, not surprisingly to a greater percentage decline in DLCO over 24 months. Ongoing follow up of this cohort will be useful in identifying possible long-term sequelae particularly in terms of relationship to other interstitial pneumonias.\n\n    Reference\n\n    Karakatsani A, Papakosta D, Rapti A, Antoniou KM, Dimadi M, Markopoulou A, Latsi P, Polychronopoulos V, Birba G, Ch L, Bouros D (2009) Epidemiology of interstitial lung diseases in Greece.

The exact cause of IPF is unknown, however, a prevailing theory is that recurrent microinjuries to alveolar type II (AEC2) cells results in an altered dysfunctional phenotype, which drives the pathogenesis of the disease. In conjunction with this, iron has also been suggested to play a role in the development of IPF, with recent studies showing alterations of iron levels in the lungs of individuals with IPF. This study aimed to investigate whether iron is altered in in vivo and in vitro experimental models of IPF. Here, we show that iron levels decline in AEC2 cells isolated from experimental IPF models. These reduced intracellular iron levels were associated with AEC2 cell dysfunction and altered expression levels of cell senescence markers. Furthermore, restoration of iron in AEC2 cells was also shown to prevent bleomycin-induced mortality and injury in vivo. These findings highlight the potential role iron dyshomeostasis plays in driving disease pathogenesis and presents the manipulation of iron levels through iron supplementation as an interesting potential therapeutic target.\n\n    1.4 Mode of Presentation, Diagnosis and Prevalence of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis in an Irish population\n\n    Evelyn Lynn1, Marissa O'Callaghan1, Lindsay Browne1, Michael P. Keane1,2, Cormac McCarthyy1,2\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\n    2 School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\n    1.5 Computed Tomography morphometric analysis of patients with Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy related Interstitial Lung Disease correlates with Forced Vital Capacity\n\n    O'Mahony A1, Henry P3, Coughlan P2, Crowley C1, Ryan D1, Moore N1, O'Connor OJ1, Maher M1, Henry MT2\n\n    1 Academic Department of Radiology, Cork University Hospital / University College Cork\n\n    2 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital / University College Cork\n\n    3 School of Medicine, University College Cork\n\n    Sarcopenia is a prognostic indicator in COPD and IPF. Identification of sarcopenic patients may enable intervention to improve prognosis. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common non-musculoskeletal manifestation of patients with Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIMs). This study investigated muscle mass in IIM, and its relationship to ILD disease severity.\n\n    IIM patients with ILD attending Cork University Hospital were identified. Morphomic analysis of muscle mass on CT thorax was performed using CoreSlicer, a web-based tool which enables semi-automated segmentation of muscle and fat. Bilateral Erector Spinae Muscle (ESM) and Pectoralis Muscle (PM) cross-sectional areas (CSA) were calculated. All morphomic data were correlated with lung function including forced vital capacity (FVC).\n\n    Data from 31 patients (16 male, mean age 69.8 years) were analysed. No relationship was established between change in morphomics between diagnostic (first) and second CT scans and change in PFTs over the same interval.\n\n    There were significant correlations between baseline and follow-up PM CSA, ESM CSA and FVC (p = 0.002 r = 0.384, p = 0.013, r = 0.318 respectively) when treated as separate data points. A negative relationship between the patients' albumin levels and their visceral fat at T12 was also found (p = 0.022, r = 0.0215).\n\n    ESM CSA and PM CSA may be an important parameter in patients with IIM related ILD due to their significant correlations with FVC.\n\n    1.6  Hypercalcaemia in patients with sarcoidosis in the South of Ireland\n\n    JL O'Sullivan, HI Ibrahim, LJ Walsh, TM O'Connor\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland\n\n    Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder whose prevalence is high in the South of Ireland. Hypercalcaemia has been reported in 10-20% of patients with sarcoidosis at presentation. Increased intestinal calcium absorption induced by high serum calcitriol concentrations is the primary cause and heavy exposure to sunlight is a common precipitant. We sought to determine the prevalence of hypercalcemia in our patients with sarcoidosis.\n\n    We reviewed the data of 317 patients with a tissue-proven diagnosis of sarcoidosis who attended Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland from 2005-2021.\n\n    Median age was 53y (20-94y), serum calcium was 2.41 mmol/L (1.92-3.1 mmol/L) and serum ACE was 56 IU/L (5-249 IU/L). Hypercalcaemia was present in 6.8% of patients (18/263) at the time of diagnosis, moderate hypercalcaemia (> 3 mmol/L) was present in 0.8% of patients (2/263). Higher serum calcium was associated with younger age (p = 0.0229), but no correlations with stage of sarcoidosis, serum ACE, lymphocyte count or vitamin D were seen. There were no differences in serum calcium according to month of diagnosis using non-parametric analysis of variance (p = 0.2836).\n\n    Despite a high background prevalence of sarcoidosis in the South of Ireland, the prevalence of hypercalcaemia at the time of diagnosis was lower than internationally reported. Moderate or clinically significant hypercalcaemia was rare and seasonal variation had no influence on the level of serum calcium. The temperate climate in our region may explain the lack of seasonal variation in serum calcium in patients with sarcoidosis.\n\n    1.7 A single center audit of access to healthcare and disease monitoring in patients diagnosed with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n\n    Liam Carey1,2, Siadbh Comerford1, Helen Mulryan1,2, Sinead Walsh1,2, Anthony O Regan1,2,3\n\n    1 University Hospital Galway\n\n    2 National University of Ireland Galway\n\n    3 Royal College of Physicians Ireland\n\n    Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating condition that carries a prognosis worse than that of many cancers1. The aim of this audit was to quantify reduced access to healthcare in IPF during the COIVD pandemic. This was a single center review of the care patients with IPF received in the year 2020 in comparison to the year prior 2019.\n\n    There was no significant difference in the average planned interval follow up between 2019 and 2020 (P = 0.316). The actual interval follow up was on average 4 months longer in 2020 than in the year preceding (P = 0.007). Patients were on average seen once less per year (P = 0.003). When seen in 2020, they were more likely to be seen virtually (P < 0.001). In 2020, patients were less likely to receive pulmonary function tests (P = 0.001) and 6 min walks tests (P = 0.042) than in 2019. On average, patients received less serum aminotransferase monitoring in 2020 with 2.8 (CI 1.693, 3.886) being performed in comparison to 4.4 (CI 2.5, 6.3) (P = 0.48).\n\n    In conclusion, structured timely follow up is essential for IPF. We have demonstrated the effect of COVID 19 on these pathways. The effect on disease outcome will require monitoring going forward.\n\n    References\n\n    1.

In particular, IPF patients are fearful of undertaking exercise independently. To prevent deconditioning of this cohort, virtually run exercise classes were organised as part of a collaboration between UHL and ILFA.\n\n    The physiotherapist-led weekly exercise classes commenced in May 2020. Participants were invited to complete an online survey in May 2021 to assess the impact of the virtual classes and attitudes towards physical activity.\n\n    53 participants responded to the survey, 83% were aged 61 + . All respondents were diagnosed with IPF, 6% being post-transplant recipients and 36% using oxygen all the time or most of the time. Only 11% of the respondents were on a public waiting list for either face-to-face or virtual pulmonary rehabilitation. A rating of 'excellent' was awarded by 73% of respondents for help in overcoming any anxiety about exercising online. Of the respondents, 64% reported being more active and 68% reported being less fearful about doing exercise since starting the online classes.

The survey highlights the lack of pulmonary rehab availability to IPF patients.\n\n    1.9  The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association's Multi-Stakeholder World Cafe on Pulmonary Fibrosis Services in Ireland During Covid-19 and Beyond\n\n    1Nicola Cassidy, 2Eoin Judge, 1Gemma O'Dowd, 3Tony Shone, 4Anne-Marie Russell\n\n    1 Irish Lung Fibrosis Association\n\n    2 Connolly Hospital, Dublin\n\n    3 Invisio Ltd. Wicklow\n\n    4 University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom\n\n    The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association (ILFA) hosted a virtual World Cafe forum to identify key stakeholders' experiences of healthcare services for pulmonary fibrosis during COVID-19 and priorities for future care. Eight groups of mixed patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals and industry partners discussed (1) Diagnostics, (2) Healthcare Supports, (3) Psychological Support, (4) Integrated Care. Rotating group discussions were facilitated and recorded by the eight leaders. The forum was anonymously evaluated.\n\n    Seventy-two people participated. Discussions revealed most patients experience significant delays in diagnosis; paucity of access to dietetic advice, palliative care, social support, and psychological services for patients and caregivers, and lack of integrated care across hospital and community-based services. The lack of education and emotional support at diagnosis causes distress for patients and families. Post COVID-19, a blend of face-to-face and virtual care, considering patient preference, could improve future healthcare access. Fifty-three participants (74%) completed the post-event survey. 96% agreed/strongly agreed that the World Cafe was helpful and 92% agreed/strongly agreed that they were able to get their views across during the event.\n\n    The findings of the World Cafe indicate that a National Clinical Programme for pulmonary fibrosis is required to improve diagnosis and ensure equity of access for healthcare supports.\n\n    1.10 Lung fibrosis patients identify deficiencies in vital healthcare support services\n\n    Cassidy N1, Fox L1,2, Brown L1,3, Galvin L1, Gemma O'Dowd1, Danny Sheahan4, O'Reilly KMA1,2,5\n\n    1 The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    2 Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    3 St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    4 Invisio Ltd. Wicklow, Ireland\n\n    5 School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland\n\n    The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association (ILFA) conducted an online survey from 19 July-02 August 2021 to determine the healthcare support needs and experiences of lung fibrosis patients.\n\n    Ninety-nine lung fibrosis and 13 post-transplant patients responded (53% male). 58% had a clinical nurse specialist (92% transplant recipients). 38% had been referred to a physiotherapist-led pulmonary rehabilitation programme, 25% to a dietitian and other services included social worker (9%), occupational therapist (8%), palliative care (6%), clinical psychologist (6%) and speech therapist (3%). Forty-five percent of patients had not been referred to any service. Post-transplant patients were more likely to be referred to a dietitian (69%), social worker (31%) and clinical psychologist (38%). For all services, most referrals happened more than 12-months after diagnosis. Patients' felt they would have benefitted from referral to the following specialties at the time of diagnosis- physiotherapist-led pulmonary rehabilitation programme (65%), dietitian (51%), clinical psychologist (45%). Specialties of benefit to patients currently are physiotherapy (53%), clinical psychology (48%) and dietetics (47%). The following are seen as future needs -physiotherapy (85%), clinical psychology (67%), dietetics (67%), palliative care (65%) and occupational therapy (56%). This suggests that essential support services are lacking for lung fibrosis patients.\n\n    1.11 SCLERODERMA-RELATED ILD REVIEW\n\n    Dr Dominic Doyle, Dr Michael Henry\n\n    Cork University Hospital\n\n    CUH (Cork University Hospital) is a tertiary referral centre with a joint Respiratory/Rheumatology outpatient service. We have a large cohort of ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease) patients, and wanted to examine treatment outcomes in our scleroderma subset. Scleroderma is a prime cause of CTD-ILD (Connective Tissue Disease-associated ILD). Furthermore, ILD is the main cause of death in scleroderma.\n\n    We used our electronic health record to collect data on 10 randomly selected patients with scleroderma-related ILD. Data collected were: Age, Sex, Pre-treatment PFTs, Medication, Post-treatment PFTs (generally at 1 year), CT changes and Co-morbidities.\n\n    The mean age was 56. 6 out of 10 patients were female. 5 patients had documented Raynaud's phenomenon, 2 had pulmonary hypertension and 2 had gastro-oesophageal reflux. The mean pre-treatment FVC was 88% and DLCO was 69%. 5 patients were on treatment with CellCept, 2 with Rituximab, 2 with Nintedanib and 1 with Myfortic. 9 patients had stable post-treatment PFTs apart from 1 patient treated with Nintedanib who had a 30% drop in DLCO over 12 months. The mean post-treatment FVC was 90% and DLCO was 62%. 6 patients had stable CT appearances and 1 had minimal progression.\n\n    There are no conflicts of interest.\n\n    1.12 A Decade of Sarcoidosis in the Midwest\n\n    N. Logan, P. O'Regan, E. McMonagle, L. Casserly, A. O'Brien\n\n    University Hospital Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\n\n    The aim of this study was to assess the demographics, initial presentation, clinical course (including extra-pulmonary organ involvement) and outcomes of sarcoid patients in the Midwest over a 10 year period. Retrospective data analysis was performed on patients with either a clinical or histopathological diagnosis of sarcoid from a hospital database in University Hospital Limerick. Data collected on 213 patients revealed; 56% were male with a mean age 52 (range 24-91). On current available data, 165 were born in Ireland, 8 in the United Kingdom, 7 in Poland, 2 in Pakistan and 2 in Africa. Of note, a significant cohort of patients had their initial presentation with a service other than respiratory medicine, with only 30% initially presenting to the Department of Respiratory Medicine and 5% initially presenting to the surgical service with cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and subsequent biopsy confirming sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a disease with significant geographical and racial heterogeneity. We hope that our data from the Midwest will add to the available literature characterising this complex multi-organ disease.\n\n    1.13  Compliance with ATS/ERS guidelines for lung fibrosis reporting in CT thorax in University Hospital Kerry, and demographic distribution of pulmonary fibrosis in Kerry Group\n\n    A.Nabri, M.I.Khan, U.Khan, H.Arshad\n\n    Respiratory Department, University Hospital Kerry\n\n    Introduction: Audit is aimed to assess reporting practices of CT thorax in lung fibrosis based on ATS/ERS guidelines in University-Hospital-Kerry.\n\n    Method: Retrospective data collected from 01/11/2020 to 28/04/2021.Total 281 CT Thorax reports were surveyed. Total number of CT Thorax which reported fibrosis was 60.CT thorax reporting of lung fibrosis should be done according to one of one the following four categories.\n\n    UIP\n\n    Probable UIP\n\n    Indeterminate for UIP\n\n    Alternative diagnosis.\n\n    Results: Most of time fibrosis was reported as 'fibrotic changes' & 'fibrotic scarring' and none were reported as per ATS/ERS guidelines.\n\n    Demographic distribution as below:\n\n    Discussion/ Conclusion: Lung fibrosis on CT thorax should be reported as per ATS/ERS guidelines as UIP pattern, probable UIP pattern, indeterminate for UIP pattern, and alternative diagnosis. This would consequently help with further management options.\n\n    85% patients with pulmonary fibrosis were above 60 years of age.\n\n    Recommendations: Guidelines recommendation sent to local radiology group.

We compared explanted histopathology of 14 patients with ILD with their pre-referral diagnosis to determine diagnostic accuracy of our referral pathway.\n\n    A list of all patients with an ILD diagnosis referred for lung transplant from SVUH between 2010-2020 was obtained from a clinical database. Pre-transplant referral diagnosis was determined by clinical assessment, radiological imaging, lung biopsy and/or MDT discussion. Histopathological assessment of explanted tissue was performed with pathologist blinded to the pre-referral diagnosis.\n\n    In 71% (n = 10) of cases pre-transplant diagnosis fully correlated with explant histology. 14% (n = 2) of cases partially correlated and 14% (n = 2) did not correlate with any pre-referral findings, with only one of these four discussed at MDT. 86% correlation was seen in cases discussed at MDT, with biopsy facilitating pre-transplant diagnosis in difficult cases.\n\n    The relatively high number of cases (almost 30%) that did not fully correlate with explant histopathology and improved figures seen with MDT discussion supports this pathway to enhance pre-transplant diagnostic accuracy. The possibility of progression of ILD phenotype over time encourages continued MDT discussion of cases awaiting transplant.\n\n    1.15 The impact of virtual pulmonary rehabilitation programme on physical activity on people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a feasibility study\n\n    Orlagh O'Shea1, Grainne Murphy2, Luke Forde3, Grainne Casey2, Lynn Fox4, Katherine M.A. O'Reilly4\n\n    School of Physiotherapy, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin\n\n    Department of Physiotherapy, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin\n\n    Wexford General Hospital, Wexford, Dublin\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin\n\n    Lower levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with increased mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Nishiyama et al. 2018).

We looked at their baseline demographics, pre admission therapy, as well as the cause of exacerbation and the mortality rate.\n\n    10 patients were identified who were admitted during this period. Seven (70%) were male with a mean age of 72.

Cork University Hospital Cork\n\n    2. St Vincent's University Hospital Elm Park Dublin 4\n\n    Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology that may results from several sources of alveolar injury in genetically predisposed individuals. In the majority of cases, IPF is diagnosed by high resolution computed tomography, where the classic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and those with probable UIP. Indeterminate cases of UIP may progress to a form sur lung biopsy. The median survival is 3 to 5 years from diagnosis. The hallmark histopathological feature is the fibroblastic foci (FF), which represents active fibroproliferation.\n\n    Micro-CT allows non-destructive imaging of tissue 3D microarchitecture, down to spatial resolutions, in the order of 1 to 10 mum. We performed micro-CT analysis of acquired cryoprobe assisted transbronchial biopsies of patients with IPF pre and post treatment with pirfenidone. The interval time between biopsies was 6 months. Initial work correlated micro-CT of whole paraffin-embedded samples of UIP tissue with the histological sections. We aim to quantify the level of fibrosis and morphology of the FF present in the biopsies, pre and post treatment.\n\n    1.19 A review of antifibrotic drug therapy in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) in St James's Hospital\n\n    R. Kennedy1, L Dolan1, C Gray1, K Devenney1, P Nadarajan1\n\n    1 Respiratory Assessment Unit, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8\n\n    Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing lung disease with high mortality1. Two antifibrotic (AF) drugs Pirfenidone and Nintedanib have been licenced in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) for use in Ireland since 2015, with the aim of slowing disease progression. However, they are associated with side-effects which can affect quality of life and result in discontinuation.\n\n    We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with IPF commenced on antifibrotics our centre between 2017 and 2019, to determine reasons for treatment discontinuation and most common side effects.\n\n    Twenty-eight patients (mean age 73 years 39.2% female) were included with 43% (n = 12) commenced on Nintedanib and 57% (n = 16) commenced on Pirfenidone. During this 2-year period, 25% (n = 7) had treatment stopped (2 diarrhoea, 2 nausea & vomiting, 1 skin reaction 1 died), 21.4% (n = 6) had their treatment switched and 53.6% (n = 15) did not require a change to treatment. 66% (n = 4) of those patients that required a switch of their treatment reported nausea and vomiting.\n\n    Side effects are common with antifibrotic treatment, further research will ascertain whether nursing interventions may reduce this rate.\n\n    1Raghu G, Rochwerg B, Zhang Y, Garcia CA, Azuma A, Behr J, et al.; American Thoracic Society; European Respiratory society; Japanese Respiratory Society; Latin American Thoracic Association.

The most common manifestation is Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). (1) There are no international guidelines guiding PCP prophylaxis in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) requiring immunosuppressive therapy. However, prophylaxis is widely recommended in clinical practice.\n\n    The audit was a single-centre study looking at patients attending the specialist ILD clinic who were prescribed immunosuppressive therapy. Anonymous data was collected via the electronic healthcare record. Our data collection tool was pre-defined in conjunction with the rheumatology service.\n\n    19 patients were included. 8 patients had connective tissue disease-associated ILD (42%). 11 patients were prescribed dual immunosuppressive agents and five patients were prescribed triple therapy. 84% of patients were prescribed prednisolone (n = 16). 3 of the 19 patients were prescribed PCP prophylaxis (15.7%) and in all cases, co-trimoxazole was the drug of choice. The dose given varied across all three patients.\n\n    PCP prophylaxis prescribing was exceptionally low. In the absence of international guidance, we created a simple prescribing flowsheet for PCP prophylaxis. This will help guide physicians which patients should be considered for PCP prophylaxis and the appropriate doses. We will follow up with a re-audit of our practice.\n\n    2. Miscellaneous\n\n    2.1 Accessory Muscles Support Respiratory System Performance in Young Dystrophin-Deficient mdx Mice\n\n    Aoife D. Slyne1, Ken D. O'Halloran1 & David P. Burns1\n\n    1 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork\n\n    Respiratory impairment is a feature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic neuromuscular disorder. Peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity is preserved in young dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, despite diaphragm muscle weakness and reduced electromyogram (EMG) activitya. We hypothesise that accessory muscle compensation limits ventilatory deficit in early dystrophic disease.\n\n    Four-month-old male wild-type (n = 30) and mdx (n = 29) mice were studied. In urethane (1.7 g/kg i.p.) anaesthetised mice, diaphragm and scalene EMG activities were recorded during baseline and sustained tracheal occlusion producing maximal respiratory muscle activation. Diaphragm and scalene muscle function were examined ex vivo. Data (mean +- SD) were statistically compared using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test.\n\n    Peak diaphragm EMG activity in mdx mice was reduced compared with wild-type (25.8 +- 13.8 vs. 15.7 +- 7.4 mV.s; P = 0.0009). Moreover, mdx diaphragm force was considerably lower (significant force loss at 25-150 Hz). In comparison, peak scalene EMG activity was equivalent in wild-type and mdx mice (1.74 +- 1.45 vs. 1.48 +- 0.58 mV.s; P = 0.5767). Scalene muscle force-generating capacity was preserved in mdx mice.\n\n    The early decline in diaphragm performance (decreased activation and intrinsic weakness), suggests that compensation provided by accessory muscles is critical to the support of respiratory performance in mdx mice, which may have relevance to DMD.\n\n    References\n\n    aBurns DP, Murphy KH, Lucking EF, O'Halloran KD.

The average length of stay of COPD patients was reduced by 2.16 days and discharges were accelerated. A permanent Specialist Physiotherapist was appointed in 2021 to progress the role.\n\n    The physiotherapist screened patients on admission and accelerated discharges. Data was collected for patients reviewed from 2019 to August 2021. Condition, length of stay, and discharge destination were recorded. Data was anonymised, stored on a password protected excel document, and analysed. Referral pathways to Peamount Healthcare Respiratory Unit (PHRU) and outpatient services were improved.\n\n    1287 patients were reviewed in 2019 and 2020 (n = 554, n = 733), compared with 398 in 2021. 852 discharges were accelerated in 2019 and 2020 (n = 356, n = 496), with 217 in 2021. Transfers to PHRU increased from 102 in 2019, to 135 in 2020, and 108 up to August 2021. Patients spent 1779 bed days in PHRU in 2020, equating to a cost saving of $907,290 for TUH. In 2021, PHRU transfers have saved 1837 acute bed days; a cost saving of $936,870.\n\n    The Specialist Physiotherapist in Respiratory Pathways is extremely cost effective, with over $2,502,060 saved in acute bed days for TUH since 2019.\n\n    2.3 The Quantitative Measurement of Active Neutrophil Elastase in Sputum using a Point of Care Test and Reader Device\n\n    Darragh McCafferty1, Sarah Johnston1, Shasidran Raj2, Gennady Lubarsky2 and James McLaughlin2\n\n    1 ProAxsis Ltd, Catalyst, Belfast, Northern Ireland\n\n    2 Northern Ireland Connected Health Innovation Centre (CHIC), NIBEC building, Ulster University, Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland\n\n    Sputum neutrophil elastase (NE) is a biomarker of disease severity in respiratory disorders; with point of care measurement being of interest to assist in patient triaging. NEATstik  is a lateral flow test for the qualitative detection of sputum NE; however, the need for a quantitative device has been highlighted. This study aims to improve the quantitative potential of NEATstik  using a CMOS reader.\n\n    NE calibrants and sputum samples (n = 19) were prepared in NEATstik dilution buffer. Sputum samples were initially diluted x 10, then serially diluted. NE calibrants and samples were transferred (70 microl) to a NEATstik device; with a CMOS reader used to measure signal intensity. Sputum sol was analysed on ProAxsis' NE Activity based Immunoassay.\n\n    CMOS readings revealed a matrix effect, with statistical analysis (Kruskal-Wallis; Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test) indicating that a further x 8 dilution is necessary for the quantitative measurement of active NE, in sputum, with NEATstik. Moreover, a significant correlation (spearman r value = 0.86) was observed between NE levels when measured on both platforms.\n\n    Improved accuracy in the quantitative determination of sputum NE may assist in the identification of key disease thresholds, enabling pre-emptive medical intervention, thereby improving the standard of care received by patients with respiratory disease.\n\n    Conflict of Interest: the presenting author is an employee of ProAxsis Ltd.\n\n    2.4 Characteristics of Sarcoid Associated Pulmonary Hypertension in Ireland\n\n    Margaret Higgins1, Sarah Cullivan1, Brian McCullagh1, Sean Gaine1\n\n    1 National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease of uncertain aetiology, that can affect the pulmonary circulation and right heart. Sarcoid associated pulmonary hypertension (SAPH) is an important and under-recognised complication of sarcoidosis, which carries significant morbidity and mortality. This is the first study describing the characteristics of SAPH in the National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit (NPHU) in Ireland.\n\n    This retrospective single centre study identified cases of SAPH, confirmed by right heart catheterisation, diagnosed between 2010 and 2020. Nineteen cases of SAPH were identified in this period and baseline characteristics are highlighted in Table 1.\n\n    The nature of SAPH was multifactorial and included a sarcoid related pulmonary arterial vasculopathy, left heart disease, hypoxic lung disease due to interstitial lung disease and extrinsic pulmonary artery (PA) compression due to progressive massive fibrosis. At SAPH diagnosis, 13 (68%) patients were prescribed sarcoid directed therapy. Pulmonary hypertension specific therapy was prescribed in 14 cases (74%) and comprised of monotherapy in 10 (53%) and double combination therapy in 2 (21%) cases. One patient required PA stent insertion for extrinsic compression and 1 patient underwent double lung transplantation.\n\n    This study described the phenotypes of SAPH in the NPHU and characterises the clinical and treatment characteristics of this cohort.\n\n    Table 1\n\n    2.5 Initial experience of Virtual Pulmonary Rehabilitation in a District General Hospital\n\n    R Mc Garrigle1, B Leonard1, D Clifford1, T Mc Kelvey2, S Mc Namee2, A Henderson3, R Griffith3, J O'Callaghan1, T Mc Guigan1, RA Sharkey1\n\n    1. Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Trust, N Ireland\n\n    2. IT Department, Western Trust, N Ireland\n\n    3. Physiotherapy Department, Western Trust, N Ireland\n\n    The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the delivery of the face to face pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme in the Western Trust. As a result, a virtual PR programme was introduced in order to meet the needs of the service users\n\n    With the support of the Trust IT department, educational videos featuring the current PR team were recorded and made available to participants on the Trust You-tube site. During the interactive section of the 6 week programme, the participants undertake exercise at home and were monitored virtually by the PR team.\n\n    Between January and July 2021, 24 participants completed the virtual PR programme (14 Female and 10 Male) with age range from 44-80 years. Of the total number of patients (39) pre-assessed, 32 patients opted for the virtual programme with 24 (75%) of these patients completing the programme. Feedback was collected via questionnaires - of the 24 questionnaires sent out, 22 (92%) questionnaires were completed. 16 patients (73%) who completed feedback found the virtual PR programme to be beneficial or very beneficial.\n\n    There is no doubt that the virtual programme has a role to play for a certain cohort of patients who undergo pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n    2.6 Transitioning between oral and parenteral prostacyclin therapy in two patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension\n\n    Devlin S1, Cullivan S1, McCullagh B1, Gaine SP1\n\n    1 National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    Current therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) target the nitric oxide, endothelin and prostacyclin pathways to promote pulmonary vasodilation and reduced right ventricular afterload and failure. Agents that utilise the latter pathway include the prostacyclin analogue epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost and selexipag, a selective prostacyclin (IP) receptor agonist. As more medications become available, transitioning between agents is increasingly performed. While clear guidelines exist for initiation of individual drugs, equivalent guidelines for transition between medications are often lacking.\n\n    We describe two cases of transition from oral selexipag to subcutaneous treprostinil in patients with idiopathic PAH. Following an average of 34.5 months on selexipag, the decision was made to transition to parenteral prostacyclin due to NYHA functional class III symptoms and intermediate risk features. The patients were admitted for in-hospital transitions, whereby treprostinil uptitrations could be guided by clinical response and prostacyclin-related side effects. Overall, these transitions were well tolerated, taking place over an average of 11 days. Regarding long-term outcomes, Patient 1 experienced a progressive decline in symptoms and was listed for double lung transplantation, but died 2 years following this transition. Patient 2 remains stable with NYHA FC III symptoms, 4 years later.\n\n    Our patient-centred approach, guided by prostacyclin side-effects, was both safe and well-tolerated, providing an example of a safe method of transitioning from oral selexipag to subcutaneous treprostinil.\n\n    2.7 Smoking cessation in Irish written guidelines Audit\n\n    Mohammad Abdulsalam1, Eddie Moloney2, Stephen Lane3, Minesh Kooblall4\n\n    1,2,3,4 Department of Respiratory medicine, Tallaght University Hospital\n\n    Smoking is an important modifiable risk factor for communicable, non communicable disease and cancer. It is still prevalent despite the huge investments in smoking cessation including global campaigns. The prevalence of smoking in Ireland in 2019 is 19.4% for male gender and 14.8% for female gender, with overall prevalence of 17.1% (1). there was a reduction of around 6% in overall prevalence compared to 2012 (1). However, around 2 out of 10 adults are still smoking in Ireland. Smoking cessation has a significant effect in reducing many diseases prevalence as well as improving their prognosis. Therefore, emphasising this effect and mentioning smoking cessation in the guidelines of disease related to smoking is crucial. a recent Audit published on global guidelines in mentioning smoking cessation showed that 49% of the guidelines mentioned smoking cessation (2). This audit looked at the percentage of Irish guidelines, which are written for conditions linked with smoking, mention smoking cessation. 67% of the screened guidelines mentioned smoking cessation. The target is reaching 100% is still not met which we think is crucial and necessary in preventing and managing these smoking related diseases.\n\n    References\n\n    Hse IE (2021) [Internet] [cited 14 June 2021].

We analyse the total thoracic activity related to lung cancer resection in level one trauma centre.\n\n    The purpose of study intended to look at over all thoracic activity & resources requirement related to lung cancer resections, chest trauma & benign lung diseases.\n\n    Our results clearly demonstrate that lung cancer resection only consists of approximately 46% of total thoracic activity. Hence it does not represent a true thoracic activity & resources requirement in comparison to centres focusing only on lung cancer resection.\n\n    264 thoracic cases have been admitted under cardiothoracic care in cuh\n\n    It includes chest trauma (37 cases), Lung Cancer-Primary & Secondary (123), Benign lung disease (decortication, pleurectomy, Talc pleuredesis, pleural biopsies, Lung volume reduction surgery)-65, Diaphragmatic plication (2), Mediastinal mass/cyst excision -13, Pneumothoraxes & empyema not requiring surgery-24.\n\n    2.9 An Audit on the Extra-Pulmonary Screening in Biopsy-Proven Sarcoidosis Patients in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital\n\n    A. Asis1, D. Halim1, N. Boyle1, A. Kirk1, T. McEnery1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mater Misericoardiae University Hospital, Dublin\n\n    The clinical presentation of sarcoidosis can vary from an asymptomatic state to multi-system involvement. Early detection and timely treatment for asymptomatic extra-pulmonary disease can reduce unnecessary consequences. For this reason, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) have guidelines for the screening of extra-pulmonary involvement at the time of diagnosis.\n\n    This audit aimed to assess local practice in the Mater Hospital of screening for extra-pulmonary involvement in the biopsy-proven pulmonary sarcoidosis patients against the ATS guideline1. A total of 69 patients were diagnosed over the course of the audit timeline from January 2015 to January 2020. 38 patients were excluded as they were referred externally for biopsy but followed up outside Mater Hospital. Table 1 summarises the findings from the audit.\n\n    Table 1\n\n    This audit suggested that our adherence to the ATS screening guideline was variable with none of investigations achieved 100% standard. The implementation of ocular and cardiac investigations was poor with either under or over-ordered. ACE levels were still being ordered despite not being in the recommendation.\n\n    In conclusion, an increased awareness of the recommended screening tests is warranted in order to detect occult extra-pulmonary involvement and to ensure hospital resources are utilised efficiently.\n\n    Conflict of Interest: None.\n\n    2.10 Current Physiotherapy knowledge of temporary Tracheostomies in St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny\n\n    Kathleen Dowling, Fiona Blackie\n\n    HSE, St. Luke's General Hospital Kilkenny\n\n    To evaluate current on-call Physiotherapists knowledge of patients with temporary tracheostomies and the role as a profession we play in the management of patients with tracheostomies within the MDT in St. Luke's hospital Kilkenny from ICU to ward level.\n\n    This will include a validated questionnaire for all on-call physiotherapy staff of pre-existing knowledge.\n\n    Educational presentations with audio will be completed by senior respiratory physiotherapist at SLHK for intra-internet access for all staff to complete within a 1 month timeframe and will be re-audited with an additional validated and reliable questionnaire. Once all results have been submitted, an appropriate SPSS format will be used.\n\n    These results will be presented to the working Tracheostomy Group of SLHK which includes antitheses, surgeons, clinical facilitators, nurses and AHPs for review and adaptation for current hospital policy and practice.\n\n    Current physiotherapist knowledge and practice with patients who have tracheostomies in place may vary across professional levels and areas of experience. As a result, standards of care may differ greatly within physiotherapists. This gives reason for development in this area in order to provide best practice, maintain standards of practice and ultimately provide patients with evidence based care (Bonvento et al. 2017).\n\n    Using Physiotherapy as the example, the hope would be to generate change to practice across the MDT for overall improved care and reduced length of stay in an acute setting (Garrubba et al. 2009).\n\n    References\n\n    Bonvento B, Wallace S, Lynch J, Coe B, McGrath BA (2017) Role of the multidisciplinary team in the care of the tracheostomy patient.

Belfast Health and Social care Trust\n\n    Previous data has suggested around 7.2% of patients admitted to hospital with community acquired pneumonia develop a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema. 1\n\n    A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with parapneumonic effusion or empyema between 1st February 2020 and 31st January 2021 was performed assessing patient demographics, co-morbidities, microbiology, time-to-drain and outcomes.\n\n    Sixteen patients were identified (n = 11 males, mean age 57, mean length of stay 25.6 days); 12 were diagnosed as empyema, three as parapneumonic effusion (2 managed conservatively), one chylothorax. Median time to drain was 3 days (range 1-17); 7 patients required more than one drain. Of the 32 total drains, 15 were inserted by Interventional Radiology, 10 by Respiratory and 7 by Thoracics. Nine patients had positive microbiology and antibiotics rationalised accordingly. Nine patients had a pre-existing respiratory co-morbidity. The majority of patients had clinical and radiological resolution; 1 patient was subsequently diagnosed with a mesothelioma.\n\n    There is a variance in time to drain in patients with suspected empyema which may influence identification of pathogen and subsequent ability to rationalise antimicrobials. Reliance on the multidisciplinary team is highlighted as is the complexity and prolonged length of stay of these cases with the need for multiple interventions for some patients.\n\n    References\n\n    Chalmers J, Singanayagam A, Murray M, Scally C, Fawzi A, Hill A (2009) Risk factors for complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema on presentation to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia.

The paucity of clinical information required on the card precludes triaging of requests. We audited a random selection of PFT orders in 2020 to identify areas for quality improvement.\n\n    2751 PFT studies were performed during the audit period in 2020, compared to 4658 studies in 2019; a 41% reduction in activity. 281 (10.2%) were reviewed. 55 (19.6%) referrals did not request a specific test or detail a specific indication, leading to suboptimal testing.\n\n    These incomplete requests were more likely to come from non-respiratory referrers than from within the respiratory department (40% vs 11%). We also found that there was significant repetition of PFTs. Of those patients who previously had PFTs, 83.2% were returning within 2 years of their prior study. A significant proportion (49.8%) of tests were normal, comprising 33% of respiratory requests vs 55.4% of non-respiratory requests.\n\n    The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to reduced capacity for PFTs, increased demand for testing, and significant growth in waiting times. The implementation of an electronic ordering system will permit triaging of requests, facilitate online access to results, and improve the efficiency of the PFT service.\n\n    2.13 A Clinical Audit on the Use of Respiratory Physiotherapy Outcome Measures on Inpatients in St. Luke's General Hospital\n\n    Eve Geraghty\n\n    St. Luke's General Hospital Carlow/Kilkenny\n\n    The aim of this study was to audit on the use of respiratory physiotherapy outcome measures in St. Luke's Hospital against the European Region World Confederation for Physiotherapy (ERWCPT) Standards1.\n\n    Charts of inpatients referred for respiratory physiotherapy were identified and audited. The initial audit was carried out in September 2019 (n = 18) and the repeat audit in October 2020 (n = 12).\n\n    Following the initial audit, an action plan was implemented that included a literature review, an education session for physiotherapists and a redesign of our Respiratory Physiotherapy Assessment Form.\n\n    In the initial audit, 5.5% of charts had respiratory physiotherapy outcome measures, however this improved to 83.3% in the repeat audit. The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale and the Breathlessness Cough and Sputum Scale were the two most common outcome measures used in the repeat audit (both in 75% of charts).\n\n    Outcome measures which have psychometric properties, rather than physiological measures like oxygen saturation, are more favourable in determining the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment as their validity and reliability have been well-researched, they have minimal clinically important differences and can be patient-centred if using a patient-reported outcome measure. This project ensured that ERWCPT Standards were met with an emphasis on patient-centred care.\n\n    References\n\n    1. https://www.erwcpt.eu/file/233\n\n    2.14 Improving the assessment, prescription and follow up of inpatients newly commenced on home oxygen therapy in an acute hospital\n\n    C. Gleeson1, C. Gray1, P. Nadarajan1\n\n    1 Respiratory Assessment Unit, St. James's Hospital\n\n    A local clinical audit demonstrated that the processes surrounding the provision of home oxygen to patients on discharge from hospitalisation was uncoordinated. This prompted a quality improvement (QI) project with the aim being to increase the adherence of staff to oxygen prescribing guidelines for all inpatients prescribed home oxygen from 0 to 100% over a 12-month period.\n\n    The project team used QI methodology which included stakeholder engagement, process mapping and development of a driver diagram to illustrate our 'theory of change' and to plan improvement activities. We used a number of Plan Do Study Act cycles to test and implement changes surrounding the assessment, prescription, education and follow up of inpatients commencing home oxygen therapy on discharge.\n\n    All home oxygen referrals were directed through a Respiratory Assessment Unit and a home oxygen care bundle (7 standards) was developed collaboratively with staff. The median number of oxygen standards met for each patient was 7 (range 6-7) by project completion and has been sustained in the months following the project (Fig. 1)\n\n    Use of quality improvement methodology led to standardisation of care for patients prescribed home oxygen on discharge from hospitalisation. The principles used will be used to inform similar QI initiatives for patients commencing home non-invasive ventilation.\n\n    Fig. 1 - Run Chart demonstrating the number of standards relating to home oxygen ordering process being met in consecutive patients over 12 months\n\n    2.15 Impact On Hospital Length of Stay of A Respiratory Assessment Unit\n\n    C. Hayes, S. Toland, L. Madden-Doyle, R. Morgan, E. O'Brien\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9\n\n    A dedicated Respiratory Assessment Unit (RAU) was opened in Beaumont Hospital in January 2021. The initial role of the RAU, which is composed of 9 single rooms, was management of COVID-19 inpatients. Its utilisation has evolved with the changing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n    The RAU provides an opportunity to potentially decrease patient length of stay and facilitate ambulatory care of common respiratory conditions as well as facilitating access to more rapid diagnostic testing. We reviewed the records of 79 patients assessed in the RAU from July to August 2021.\n\n    49/79 patients (62%) were under the care of the respiratory team with the remaining 30 patients under another medical or surgical team. 16/79 (20%) patients were admitted directly to RAU from respiratory clinic electively or urgently. Total hospital length of stay was significantly less in this cohort compared to those admitted via ED or transferred from another inpatient ward and there were 2 (12.5%) same day discharges.\n\n    42/79 (53.2%) patients were admitted with a non-respiratory diagnosis and 19/79 (24.1%) underwent specialist respiratory intervention. 11/79 patients (13.9%) required use of non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula.\n\n    2.16 Improving Awareness of Monitoring and Education of Patients Prescribed Methotrexate in Respiratory Care\n\n    Dr Seadna Burke, Dr Arsalan Shahid, Dr Riana Minogue, Dr Kieran Cooper, Dr Katherine Finan\n\n    Sligo University Hospital, SAOLTA University Healthcare Group\n\n    Methotrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor used to treat a variety of autoimmune conditions. It has significant potential for adverse events. In respiratory medicine, BTS guidelines recommend its use to treat steroid dependent sarcoidosis. As use in a general respiratory clinic is rare, there can be a lack of formal monitoring systems in place.\n\n    We reviewed patients receiving methotrexate treatment for sarcoidosis in SUH respiratory clinic between 2018 and 2021 and assessed their adherence to blood monitoring. We subsequently created a questionnaire and assessed their knowledge of important adverse events and precautions. Of the six patients we identified, five did not meet the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) recommended blood monitoring requirements of three-monthly complete blood count and liver function tests. Only four were aware of the requirement for blood monitoring. Four were not aware of issues surrounding fertility or restrictions on vaccinations. Only three patients were aware of the risk of liver damage, and only one was aware of potential myelosuppression. None were aware of significant interactions with other medications.\n\n    Adapting pre-existing patient information leaflets and blood monitoring booklets developed by the local rheumatology service, we will now introduce these for use in our patients, aiming to improve patient education and monitoring.\n\n    2.17 Is O2 too much of a Go To? An Audit of our Clinical Practice\n\n    Aoife Sheehan, Caoimhe Murray\n\n    Physiotherapy Department, St. Lukes General Hospital Kilkenny.\n\n    Oxygen is considered to be a drug, and as such should be prescribed. Across the UK only 57% of patients had a valid oxygen prescription.1 The objective of this study was to audit current practices and evidence based knowledge among NCHDs, nursing staff and physiotherapists in St. Luke's General Hospital. The overall aim of this project was to prevent incorrect oxygenation and maintain oxygen prescription practice within best practice guidelines.\n\n    This is a mixed method study. 1) A chart audit took place (n = 98) Inclusion criteria: Medical patient receiving oxygen therapy and admitted > 24 h. 2) A survey was undertaken among medical professionals (n = 51)\n\n    It showed 52% of patients were receiving oxygen therapy without any form of written order, parameter or prescription. This percentage is higher than the UK.1 Sixty-five percent of staff stated that all patients should have oxygen parameters charted. 85% of staff understood the necessary documentation that should be prescribed.\n\n    Oxygen prescription remains complex for a drug that is administered so frequently. It is associated with greater error than that seen with antibiotics. Education should stress more prudent prescription and use of oxygen as is can be detrimental to many of the patients who receive it.\n\n    2.18 Establishment of a Tertiary Care Respiratory Assessment Unit\n\n    Sile Toland, Lucy Power, Conor Hayes, RK Morgan, ME O'Brien\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9\n\n    A purpose built Respiratory Assessment Unit (RAU) opened in Beaumont Hospital in January 2021 comprising of 9 single rooms.\n\n    The RAU provides early specialist input for a range of respiratory conditions via a multi-disciplinary team of respiratory doctors, nurses, ANPs, and physiotherapists. The RAU supports both scheduled and unscheduled inpatient and ambulatory care, including COVID-19 assessment and delivery of advanced respiratory supports.\n\n    Over 6 months, 280 patients' RAU admissions were evaluated, including 114 (40.7%) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Initially the RAU treated patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute respiratory failure and provided advanced respiratory supports, such as non-invasive ventilation. Early specialist respiratory input for patients presenting to ED supported inpatient and ambulatory pathways for COVID-19 care.\n\n    Of the total 280 patients, there were 232 (82.85%) patients transferred from ED, 25 (8.9%) elective admissions, 8 (2.85%) OPD admission, and 15 (5.35%) direct ED admissions.\n\n    2.19 An Integrated Respiratory Service:from paper to patient and beyond\n\n    Agnes Barry, Rosaleen Reilly, Stanley DW Miller\n\n    Meath Integrated Respiratory Service (MIRS), Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, Co Meath\n\n    Slaintecare funding for the Meath Integrated Respiratory Service (MIRS) commenced in March 2021. MIRS aims to provide both local chronic respiratory care and a reduction in acute hospital admissions for patients in County Meath. We describe development of the service.\n\n    Initial weeks were spent identifying service requirements and creating an implementation timeline. Administrative and clinical accommodation, governance structures and equipment were agreed. Primary and secondary care stakeholders collaboratively identified service needs and challenges. Priority areas and benchmarking were identified through audit.\n\n    Documents describing model of care, policies, pathways, patient assessments, evaluation framework and reporting structure were developed. A single referral pathway was established. We promoted our service and delivered education to all healthcare professionals.\n\n    Service implementation occurred simultaneously in acute, home and outpatient settings. Our expertise allows for supportive discharge and admission avoidance. Pulmonary rehabilitation is delivered in virtual and face to face format. Regular multidisciplinary meetings allow for clinical supervision, shared expertise and learning. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are captured on our activity database.\n\n    MIRS now successfully provides Integrated Respiratory Care for Co. Meath. We have learned the benefit of careful planning, patience and persistence. We provide further advice for others initiating similar services highlighting barriers with suggested solutions.\n\n    2.20 A Survey On The Use Of Adult High Flow Nasal Oxygen in Cork University Hospital\n\n    Siobhan Healy1, Annemarie Fitzgerald1, Avril Hallahan1, Maeve O'Grady1, Desmond Murphy1, Michael T Henry1\n\n    1 Cork University Hospital\n\n    Usage of high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) continues to expand. However there is limited information on usage in acute hospitals. This survey reviewed HFNO usage in Cork University Hospital (CUH).\n\n    CUH Airvos (HFNO device) were tracked by physiotherapists from March 2020 to March 2021. Information on machine usage, locations and settings was captured. A detailed patient (non-covid) database was completed for fourteen weeks from July to Oct 2020.\n\n    Airvos were tracked as being in use 3397 times. Table one shows the settings used. The average daily number of Airvos used was 13 (maximum 43). There were 124 patients on Airvo during the fourteen weeks. The respiratory ward had the highest number of patients; 46% of patients moved ward/room while on Airvo; median Airvo duration was 4 days and median length of hospital stay was 25 days. Physiotherapy was the discipline that most commonly set it up, initiated weaning and discontinued Airvo. Airvo outcome: 74% successfully weaned, < 1% RIP, 14% palliation/comfort care. Hospital outcome: 75% discharged from CUH, 25% RIP in hospital (see Table 2).\n\n    Our data provides a snapshot of current acute HFNO use and outcomes and identifies some areas for improvement, e.g. implementing a guideline for intra-hospital transfer of patients on HFNO.\n\n    2.21 Attitudes and Dimensions Influencing Physical Activity in Pulmonary Hypertension Patients\n\n    Ciara McCormacka*, Sarah Cullivanb, Brona Kehoec, Noel McCaffreyd, Sean Gaineb, Brian McCullaghb, Niall M.

LUNG CANCER BRONCHOSCOPY\n\n    3.1 Real world Experience of Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopy over Six Months in a Tertiary Centre\n\n    Anne-Marie Sweeney1*, Grace Kavanagh1*, Patrick Coghlan1, Hammad Danish1, Fernando Gomez1, Barry Plant1, Michael Henry1, Marcus Peter Kennedy1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital\n\n    * = joint first authors\n\n    The development of single use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) has accelerated in recent years, with the reduced risk of infectious transmission and reduced need for endoscopy staffing particularly advantageous in the COVID-19 pandemic era. We trialled the routine use of The Surgical Company Bronchoflex  SUFB in a tertiary bronchoscopy service.\n\n    139 procedures were performed by five consultants from January to July 2021. The majority were carried out for infection (45%) and malignancy (32%). Most were performed in the endoscopy suite, however 8 procedures took place in ICU, 6 at ward level and 3 in theatre as an adjunct to a rigid bronchoscope. The SUFBs were used across a range of procedures including bronchoalveolar lavage, brushings, endobronchial biopsy, transbronchial needle aspiration, argon plasma coagulation, cryobiopsy and stent placement.\n\n    85% of procedures were reported to have no complications related to the use of a SUFB with a user satisfaction score of above 4/5 in 89% of cases. Issues with image quality (6%) or suction (5%) meant the reversion to reusable bronchoscope in some cases.\n\n    Overall, the use of SUFBs has significant benefits in patient care with the ability to use the SUFB across a range of indications and procedures with high user satisfaction.\n\n    3.2 Lung Cancer Detection During COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n    D Halim1, S Foley1, A Asis1, CR Cayabyab1, C Higgins1, F Colhon1, D Burnei1, RK Morgan1, ME O'Brien1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin\n\n    Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and delayed diagnosis is associated with poor outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a considerable amount of strain on all healthcare services internationally. Our aim is to establish the effects of COVID-19 pandemic to the lung cancer detection in Beaumont Hospital across the 3 waves.\n\n    We compared the number of lung cancer referrals and lung cancer diagnoses made via both the in-patient and out-patient pathways throughout COVID-19 pandemic compared to similar periods in two years preceding; 2019 and 2018. Each wave lasted approximately 3 months each.\n\n    The number of referral to Rapid Access Lung Cancer Clinic (RALCC) saw a significant reduction during the first wave, with significant increase during the second wave and non-significant change in the third wave when compared to previous years. The difference in the number of referral between 3 waves were all significant. Despite the variability in each wave, all referrals were seen in RALCC within the targeted 10 working days. Diagnosis of lung cancer from RALCC trended similarly to the number of the referrals. Total diagnoses remained comparable to previous years but with increased proportion of late stage diagnoses. Interestingly, inpatient diagnoses of lung cancer in 2020 almost doubled compared to previous years (n = 71 vs 44 & 40), of which 90% were in advanced stage.\n\n    These results demonstrated that lung cancer detection was delayed during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic with compensatory increase in referral and late stage diagnosis in the second wave.\n\n    Graph shows the trend of lung cancer referrals during COVID-19 pandemic\n\n    3.3 Accuracy of Multidisciplinary Team Consensus for Lung Cancer Resection in the absence of pre-operative histology: A five-year experience\n\n    Jack Whooley, Rebecca Weedle, Alexandra White, Alan Soo\n\n    Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Hospital Galway\n\n    Lung resection remains the cornerstone of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines recommends pursuing pre-operative diagnosis and staging as much as possible. In the absence of pre-operative histological diagnosis, surgical treatment can be offered in conjunction with multidisciplinary team (MDT) and patient consensus. We aimed to assess the accuracy of our thoracic MDT in recommending treatment for those with suspected NSCLC in patients who do not have a confirmed pre-operative histological diagnosis.\n\n    A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing lung resection at the recommendation of the thoracic MDT for suspected NSCLC in our unit between May 2016 and August 2021. Patients with confirmed histological diagnosis were excluded from analysis.\n\n    227 patients underwent lung resection without pre-operative histology in the five-year period. 54.6% were female, mean age was 67.4 years. Overall, the positive predictive value of the MDT team consensus for lung malignancy in the absence of pre-operative histology was 89.4% (true positive n = 203/227.)\n\n    Performing lung resection in the absence of pre-operative histology is reasonable if done in conjunction with MDT consensus and appropriate patient counselling, in keeping with the British Thoracic Society Guidelines.\n\n    3.4 Vats Vs Thoracotomy for primary lung cancer, single surgeon audit\n\n    Daniyal Arshad, Muhammad Nadeem Anjum, Tanya Chandwani, Mr Kishore Doddakula\n\n    Cork University Hospital\n\n    During the covid period, we evaluated all cancer resections undergone in a tertiary referral centre.\n\n    The purpose of study was to evaluate the rate preoperative histological diagnosis and its impact on postoperative recovery and resources requirement.\n\n    All patients following discussion in lung cancer Multi-disciplinary meeting subjected to pulmonary resection were included. Approximately 21% patients did not have preoperative histological diagnosis and required frozen section (Histopathology) prior to definite procedure e.g. completion lobectomies. The usual reasons for not having preoperative histological diagnosis are;\n\n    Emphysematous lungs (high risk of pneumothorax during CT guided biopsy).\n\n    Proximity of lesion to major vascular structures.\n\n    Technically difficult areas to biopsy(behind the scapulae, ribs)\n\n    Small nodules/Ground glass lesion.\n\n    Approximately 80% of the patients requiring thoracotomy were patients who needed completion lobectomy following VATs wedge resection as a follow up procedure. There is one day less hospital stay for VATs group. Systematic lymphadenectomy was performed in all resections.\n\n    Our study reveals lack of histology prior to surgery does impact on length of surgery and hospital stay. Furthermore it does carry a risk of patients requiring second procedure.\n\n    3.5 Dedicated Lung Nodule Services Reduces Need for Follow up Imaging\n\n    Walsh S, Cogan G, Counihan I, Quinn A, Hassan T\n\n    Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda\n\n    The management of solitary lung nodules using the BTS guidelines 2015 can increase the detection rate of early-stage lung cancers and reducing unnecessary CT surveillance. To date, there is a lack of dedicated nodule services in Ireland. We audit the impact of a dedicated service in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.\n\n    CT surveillance for solitary lung nodules performed 15 months before and after the introduction of a dedicated nodule service were compared. Retrospective NIMIS review were used to capture nodules detected incidentally. The MDM nodule service was attended 6 weekly by a respiratory physician and radiologist with outcomes sent to the primary physicians including the rapid access clinic if deemed appropriate.\n\n    79% of CT surveillance were deemed inappropriate (either unnecessary or outside the interval window as per BTS Guidelines) before the service was introduced (Fig. 1). This reversed to over 80% of appropriate surveillance thereafter. The number of CT surveillance performed after was also reduced by 74% following the service (Fig. 1).\n\n    A dedicated nodule service is effective in reducing CT surveillance which might alleviate both unnecessary waste for the hospitals and anxiety to patients.\n\n    3.6 An Audit of Endobronchial Ultrasound Services for Detection of Lung Cancer in University Hospital Galway 2020\n\n    Neil Hyland1, Dominic Doyle1, David Breen1\n\n    University Hospital Galway\n\n    Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) is an important method of detecting of lung malignancies. Efficient access to high quality EBUS services is important to reach targets set by the National Health Service (NHS) Lung Cancer Expert Group. This study was carried out as no such audit had previously been undertaken in University Hospital Galway.\n\n    A three-month period was examined from June to August 2020 with fifty patients included. Data was extracted from EBUS records and compared with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set by the NHS Lung Cancer Clinical Expert Group.\n\n    Results recorded were KPIs being met or not. The majority were met (13/17) including: Pathological results received within five days (> 85), total pathology pathway time under ten days (> 85%), pathological confirmation rate in advanced disease (> 90%) and adequate tissue for genetic marker testing (> 90%).\n\n    KPIs not met included: Procedure within seven days of referral (> 85%), complication rate (< 5%) and procedures with node stations inadequate (< 10%).\n\n    Conclusions: The major shortcoming was the timing of procedure from referral indicating limitations in access. The complication rates were slightly above the KPI standards, but just two out of fifty total and no major complications were seen. Repeat audit is crucial to examine changes in the intervening time.\n\n    3.7 Proteomic Analysis Of The Nanoparticle Biomolecular Corona Formed In The Plasma Of Lung Cancer Patients And Healthy Controls\n\n    Iulia Marinescu1, Marco Monopoli2, Cormac McCarthy1,3, Ngoc Duong Trinh 2, Michael P. Keane1,3\n\n    1 UCD School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\n    2 Department of Chemistry, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, 123 St Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, Ireland\n\n    3 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\n    A challenge posed by lung cancer biomarker screening is that target proteins have low molecular weights and are too difficult to isolate by standard mass spectrometry (MS). Using nanoparticles (NPs) and the protein corona formed on their surface to isolate molecules of interest may be a more efficient way to detect low-abundance proteins related to malignancy. In this study, we characterize the corona of silica NPs incubated with human plasma from lung cancer patients and healthy volunteers.\n\n    Samples were analysed using dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MS. The raw data was imported into MaxQuant for label-free quantification and then analysed using the softwares Perseus and Cytoscape.\n\n    Gel densitometry analysis revealed two significantly different protein bands between lung cancer and controls. MS analysis identified five significantly downregulated proteins in the lung cancer group. The most abundant proteins identified were apolipoprotein A-I, fibrinogen, albumin and proteins of the complement family.\n\n    The results of our analysis provide information on how the surface constitution of NPs may influence their interaction with the internal environment. The downregulation of several proteins in the cancer samples suggests an altered molecular make-up in malignancy and may contribute to the discovery of specific biomarkers for lung cancer screening.\n\n    3.8 Bronchoscopy Training using ALFIE  (Airway Low-Fidelity including Endobronchial Ultrasound Bio-simulator) and Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopy\n\n    Deasy KF1, Sweeney AM1, O'Reilly BA1,2,3, Kennedy MP1,2,3\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital\n\n    2 ASSERT Centre, University College Cork\n\n    3 College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork\n\n    The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in us having to reconsider our traditional teaching modalities and develop newer, dynamic methods of furthering medics' education.\n\n    Both high and low fidelity simulators in bronchoscopy including endobronchial guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are costly. We considered whether a combination of a low-cost bio-simulator made of recyclable (ALFIE ) and single use flexible bronchoscopy (SUFB) have the capability of differentiating novices from experts, and the ability to train novices in bronchoscopy?\n\n    Senior house officers (SHO) and Registrars were invited to training on ALFIE  using a commercially available SUFB. Trainees were evaluated individually before and after training using a modified validated Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (B-STAT) including the scope handling, endobronchial biopsy and brushing.\n\n    18 trainees were included (14 SHOs and 4 Registrars). Pre-training assessment of scope handling differentiated novices from experienced bronchoscopists ((p = 0.0025 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 3.12-12.17). Training of novices was associated with an improvement in scope handling and sampling (p = 0.0001 (95% CI 4.73-10.27)).\n\n    ALFIE  and SUFB have the potential to create a low-cost platform for remote training in bronchoscopy. Even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic with a combination of virtual teaching software, this potentially provides a convenient training platform to train junior doctors remotely.\n\n    3.9 Is high dependancy unit mandatory for all lung resection\n\n    Daniyal Arshad, Muhammad Nadeem Anjum, Tanya Chandwani, Mr Kishore Doddakula\n\n    Cork University Hospital Cork\n\n    We evaluated all pulmonary cancer resection performed by single surgeon in cuh with no HDU (high dependency unit).\n\n    The purpose of study was to evaluate postoperative pain management & safety of patients undergoing lung resections in cardiothoracic ward in absence of high dependency unit & non availability of Intensive care beds\n\n    Postoperative pain in VATs group (approximately 81%) was managed with epidural/paravertebral catheter in the ward.\n\n    Patients undergoing thoracotomy (approximately 19%) were managed postoperatively in ICU (Intensive Care Unit)\n\n    There is one day less hospital stay for VATs group.\n\n    No significant difference in the lymph node station dissection between the two groups.\n\n    None of the patients in VATs (Video assisted thoracoscopy) group required ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission.\n\n    Our study clearly demonstrates that with adequate postoperative pain management strategy in patients undergoing lung resection can be easily managed in the cardiothoracic ward.\n\n    Conflict of Interest: None.\n\n    3.10 Surgery vs. radiotherapy for the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of propensity matched studies\n\n    Sean Barrett1,2, Darragh Rice1, Patrick P Higgins1, Christina Fleming1,2, Donna Eaton1\n\n    1 Mater Misercordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    2 Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. With the increasing popularity of lung cancer screening, the incidence of early-stage non-small cell lung cancers is on the rise. The current gold standard for management of early disease is surgery. Advances in radiotherapy techniques has led to an increase in the effectiveness of this treatment modality.\n\n    Our objectives were to extract 5- and 3- year survival and recurrence rates from propensity matched studies and synthesise data as a meta-analysis.\n\n    A search of Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus, was performed up to April 2021. We included retrospective propensity score matched studies for quantitative analysis. The study adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using Revman software.\n\n    22 studies were included. There were statistically significant superior outcomes in the surgical group for 5- year [RR 1.47 (95% CI 1.28-1.68) p < 0.001] and 3-year overall survival [RR 1.24 (95% CI 1.10-1.40) p < 0.001]. Findings persisted on subgroup analysis of lobectomy and sublobar resection versus radiotherapy.\n\n    Best current evidence in the form of a meta-analysis of retrospective propensity matched studies demonstrates that surgery remains the gold standard of treatment for early-stage NSCLC.\n\n    Table 1. Summary of Outcomes\n\n    3.11 Early stage lung cancer presents incidentally. Is it time for a national lung cancer screening program?\n\n    Ruaidhri J. Keane1, Grainne Cogan1, Ian Counihan1\n\n    1 Respiratory Department, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Co. Louth, Ireland\n\n    Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The overall survival rate remains poor as most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage1. Lung cancer screening (LCS) has been implemented in the USA and China following the National Lung Screening Trial which showed significant reduction in lung cancer mortality with CT screening2. A large European trial, NELSON trial, published similar results3.\n\n    The aim of this retrospective, single centre study was to evaluate the percentage of people with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent radical treatment that were incidentally diagnosed to explore the benefits of a possible screening program.\n\n    43 patients diagnosed with stage I/II NSCLC who underwent radical treatment were identified in a Level-4 hospital in Ireland from 2018 to the end of 2020. 56% (n = 24) of these patients had an incidental diagnosis with a mean age of 67.75 years, 95% CI [64.4-71.1]. 92% (n = 22) had a history of smoking and 54% were male. During the same period, 68% (n = 121) of patients diagnosed with stage III/IV NSCLC (n = 178), mean age 68.9 years, received anti-cancer treatment.\n\n    This study supports the urgent exploration of the feasibility of LCS in an Irish population.\n\n    References\n\n    Siegel R, Miller K, Jemal A (2020) Cancer statistics, 2020.

O'Connor\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland\n\n    We analyzed data over a 10-year period (2010-2020) of patients with lung cancer diagnosed in the Mercy University Hospital (MUH) to determine whether there is improvement in early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\n    NSCLC remains the most common type of lung cancer presentation in MUH, accounting for 602 (59%) of 1027 cases. The sex ratio was 1.5 male to female, but mean age at diagnosis was comparable at 66 years. The majority of NSCLC were diagnosed at later stages:272 (45%) at Stage 4 and 144 (24%) at Stage 3. The remaining 55 (9%), 95 (16%) and 36 (6%) were Stage 2, Stage 1 and unknown respectively.\n\n    Looking in more depth at those diagnosed in Stage 4, the percentage of patients diagnosed at late stage remained constant throughout the 10-year interval, varying from 40%:60%.\n\n    Data collected from our institution were consistent with national data from 2012-2014, which showed most lung cancer was diagnosed at Stage 4 (40%) and Stage 3 (25%). These results reflect that the last five years did not show significant improvements in detecting NSCLC at an earlier stage. These data support the case for lung cancer screening in Ireland.\n\n    3.14 A review of complications post CT guided lung biopsies in the Mid-Western Lung Cancer Centre\n\n    Kashif Rana1, Gillian Bennett1, Blessing Okpaje1, Shahram Shahsavari1, Adam Farrell1, Paul Hession2, A O'Brien1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Limerick, Limerick\n\n    2 Department of Radiology, University Hospital Limerick, Limerick\n\n    Percutaneous CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy is used to classify pulmonary lesions difficult to reach by bronchoscopy. The most common complications are pneumothorax (0-61%), chest drain insertion (3.3-15%), intrapulmonary haemorrhage (5-16.9%) and haemoptysis (1.25-5%). Other adverse events, including systemic air embolism, needle tract seeding, and death have a much lower incidence (< 1% of cases). An erect chest x-ray(cxr) is sufficient to detect the majority of post biopsy pneumothoraces.\n\n    We retrospectively reviewed the incidence of complications post CT guided lung biopsies performed from 2019 until 2020 in the Mid-Western lung cancer centre, University Hospital Limerick(UHL). We investigated patients age, gender, post biopsy incidence of pneumothoraces, pneumothoraces requiring chest drain/admission, haemoptysis and haemorrhage.\n\n    34.6%(28/81) of patients had pneumothoraces on cxrs performed two hours post biopsies. Out of those 28.6%(8/28) patients required chest drain insertion and 71.4%(20/28) of patients were managed conservatively. 11.1%(9/81) had a haemorrhage and 4.9%(4/81) reported haemoptysis post procedure. Only 14 patients were admitted due to complications of pneumothoraces and haemorrhage. There were no cases of systemic air embolism, needle tract seeding or death.\n\n    The complication rate post CT guided lung biopsies in UHL is similar to those reported in international published literature.\n\n    References\n\n    1.

As a consequence, and to maintain thoracic surgical oncology, the thoracic surgical service at our institution relocated to the Blackrock Clinic from March 25th to June 30th 2020.\n\n    A retrospective satisfaction audit was conducted on ninety three patients who had thoracic surgery during that period. Of the eighty nine patients who received a telephone call, 59 patients agreed to participate in the audit.\n\n    88% of participants agreed (A) or strongly agreed (SA) that the communication from the hospital prior to admission was good. 99% of participants (A or SA) that the facilities were excellent. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the communication received from the multidisciplinary team (96% A or SA). 98% (A or SA) that all precautions were taken to prevent them from getting Covid-19 infection during their hospital stay and 97% (A or SA) with the statement \"I felt safe while in hospital\".\n\n    The theme of \"Acceptance\" emerged from responses to the no visitor policy.\n\n    Our findings reassuringly demonstrate that patients felt safe during an unprecedented time for the Irish health service and that their experience reflected our own.\n\n    3.16 Meeting Quality Standards in Endobronchial Ultrasound\n\n    Dr Naoise Smyth, Dr Martin Kelly, Dr Ciaran King\n\n    Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry, County Derry\n\n    Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) plays a key role in the diagnosis and staging of suspected lung cancer. We reviewed EBUS data from April-October 2020, comparing results with the British Thoracic Society's \"Quality Standards for Flexible Bronchoscopy in Adults\".1\n\n    Using the Northern Ireland Electronic Care Record (NIECR) we reviewed the following areas for all procedures carried out during this study: the sedation given during EBUS; the use of staging computed tomography (CT) prior to EBUS; sensitivity of EBUS; and the occurrence of complications.\n\n    In terms of sedation we used on average less than the usual maximum dose of midazolam (3.28 mg versus 3.5-7 mg) but more than the usual maximum dose of fentanyl (64.15mcg versus 50mcg).\n\n    All patients (n = 53) had appropriate CT imaging prior to EBUS (target 100%).\n\n    85% of samples were diagnostic (target > 88%).\n\n    Complications occurred in 3.7% of cases (target < 1%) and included sedation reversal.\n\n    Our results suggest that exceeding the advised maximum dose of sedatives can lead directly to complications such as the need for reversal agents, meaning that missing one target leads to missing others. While we are meeting some of our targets there is still progress to be made in other areas.\n\n    1 https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/document-library/quality-standards/flexible-bronchoscopy/bts-quality-standards-for-flexible-bronchoscopy-2014/\n\n    3.17 Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopy: An ex-vivo comparison of all commercially available scopes\n\n    Deasy KF1, Sweeney AM1, O'Reilly EM1, Kennedy MP1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital\n\n    The development of single use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFB) has proceeded with pace over the last 2 years. Concerns regarding infection related to standard bronchoscopes with subsequent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated global uptake with multiple companies releasing SUFB. There has been no ex-vivo comparison of SUFBs to date.\n\n    We obtained samples of all commercially available SUFBs (TSC Broncoflex , Boston Scientific , Ambu , Vathin  and Pentax  prototype). We compared technical metrics using a custom-built bench toolkit engineered to allow standardised. Angulation was analysed by a force meter to ascertain the effort needed to fully flex the scopes while empty and while accessed by both a forceps and cytology brush.\n\n    The Boston Scientific Exalt  SUFB had the tightest consistent turning envelope at 64-69 mm, this resulted in the highest maximal thumb force required (13-37 N). The Ambu  SUFB had the best performance in terms of force (11.8-13.7 N) to angulation (150:190 ). The SUFB from Vathin  and Broncoflex  provided a compromise, with increased angulation (180-209 , 148-215 ) but at the cost of higher thumb force compared to Ambu  (15.7 N-29.4 N, 10.24 N-24.23 N).\n\n    This research helps to inform the practical usability of each bronchoscope when deciding which SUFB is best for the physicians intended end use. Further research should look at perceived qualitative assessment of SUFB by clinicians.\n\n    3.18 ALFIE: Airway Low Fidelity Including Endobronchial Ultrasound Bio-simulator\n\n    Anne-Marie Sweeney1, Kevin Frederick Deasy1, Barry Aidan O'Reilly2,3, Marcus Peter Kennedy1,2,3\n\n    1. Dept of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland\n\n    2. ASSERT Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n    3. College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n    The COVID-19 pandemic has prioritised the role of simulation-based training. Both high and low fidelity simulators in bronchoscopy including endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are costly. The purpose of this research was to develop a low fidelity bio-simulator from predominately recyclable household materials and to demonstrate its utility in EBUS-TBNA skills training.\n\n    The ALFIE (Airway Low Fidelity Including EBUS) bio-simulator was developed from household and plumbing materials with organic materials (fruit) used as pseudo-peri-bronchial lymph nodes. Residents (novices) and fellows (advanced trainees) were tested using a modified validated EBUS-TBNA scoring tool before and after training on the bio-simulator. EBUS scope handling score, EBUS-TBNA score and a combined EBUS score were calculated.\n\n    19 trainees (11 residents, 8 fellows) were included. Pre-training assessment of EBUS scope handling differentiated novices from experienced bronchoscopists (p = 0.0005 (95% confidence intervals 1.3-2.95)). Novice EBUS scope handling scores improved after training (p = 0.0011 (95% confidence intervals 0.41-1.22)). Significant improvements in EBUS-TBNA score (p = 0.0011 (n = 7, 95% confidence intervals 0.35-5.09)) and total EBUS score (p = 0.0472 (95% confidence intervals 0.03-1.4.65)) were identified in fellows after training.\n\n    Assessment of scope handling on ALFIE differentiated novices from more experienced bronchoscopists. Trainees' bronchoscopy skills improved with training on ALFIE bio-simulator.\n\n    3.19 Pre-Clinical Testing of Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopes: Clinician Preference based on Physical Characteristics and Level of Experience\n\n    Anne-Marie Sweeney1, Kevin Frederick Deasy1, Emily O'Reilly1, Hisham Ibrahim2, Hammad Danish1, Tara O'Sullivan1, David Landers1, Marcus Peter Kennedy1\n\n    1 Dept. of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland\n\n    2 Dept. of Respiratory Medicine, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland\n\n    3 ASSERT Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n    4 College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n    Single use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) have come to the forefront in the COVID-19 pandemic due to the need to minimise risk of infectious transmission as well as carry out bedside procedures for critically unwell patients. Multiple companies have released SUFBs with varying technical metrics.\n\n    39 participants including physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists with a range of expertise from first time endoscopists to consultants took part in a trial of all available SUFBs (The Surgical Company (TSC) Broncoflex , Boston Scientific , Ambu , Vathin , Pentax  prototype scope). Likert scales were used for evaluation of scope parameters including ergonomics, comfort and ease of technical procedures. Participant parameters were collected including height, gender and hand size.\n\n    TSC Broncoflex  was the preferred bronchoscope with an average score of 45.4/55 including 82.1% for ergonomics and 83% for usage. Female participants (n = 12) preferred Pentax (48.5/55) while male participants preferred TSC (44.3/55). Participants with small (n = 10) or medium (n = 23) glove size preferred Pentax (48.5/55; 45.3/55); those with large glove size (n = 5) ranked Vathin and TSC highest (44.4/55, 44/55). Doctors with > 10 years experience preferred Pentax (p = 0.04); less experienced groups preferred TSC.\n\n    In conclusion, gender, hand size and previous experience influenced scope preference. These factors should be considered in future scope development.\n\n    Conflict of Interest: None.\n\n    3.20 Assessment of user satisfaction and experience of three commercially available Single Use Bronchoscopes in a clinical setting\n\n    Emily O'Reilly1, Anne-Marie Sweeney1, Kevin Deasy1, Marcus Peter Kennedy1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork\n\n    Single use Flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) are an alternative to reusable flexible bronchoscopes with the reduced endoscopy capacity and increased infection control considerations during the covid-19 pandemic. SUFBs minimize infectious transmission and can be used during bedside procedures. Multiple SUFB brands are available.\n\n    With institutional ethical approval, we prospectively gathered data on one new (Boston Scientific ) and two established (AMBU  and Vathin ) SUFBs to assess clinician satisfaction between June-August 2021. Patient gender, procedure performed, indication, location, SUFB used, complications, and overall user satisfaction were assessed.\n\n    Twenty-two procedures were examined (12 Boston Scientific , 5 AMBU , 5 Vathin ). Eleven patients were male. Twenty-one procedures were performed in endoscopy, and 1 on the ward. All included airway assessment, 68% BAL, and 5% endotracheal biopsy. There were no complications with the Boston Scientific  scope. There was poor image quality in all (n = 5) AMBU  procedures (only scope without High-Definition Camera). There was dissatisfaction with suction in all (n = 5) Vathin  procedures (persistent suction without activation by scope). Using a satisfaction scale (1-5), mean score for Boston Scientific , AMBU , and Vathin  were 5, 2.8, and 2.8 respectively.\n\n    Real-world data on SUFBs use in a clinical setting should be considered when selecting brands available within a hospital group.\n\n    4. CF & INFECTIONS\n\n    4.1 Impact of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor on airway inflammation and clinical outcomes in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis\n\n    Michelle Casey1,2, Claudie Gabillard-Lefort1, Orla Kerr2, Elaine Marron2, Anne-Marie Lyons2, Lydia Cullen2, Alexandra Murphy2, Cedric Gunaratnam1,2, Emer P.

The clinical benefits have been well demonstrated, with little known regarding their impact on other aspects of CF pathophysiology in particular airway inflammation. We aimed to assess the impact of Elex/Tez/Iva on airway inflammatory markers in sputum samples of patients with CF (PWCF) collected pre- Elex/Tez/Iva and 3 months post.\n\n    We evaluated 14 paired samples from PWCF, Sputum samples were processed via the TETRIS method. We measured differential cell count by light microscopy, ATP via bioluminescence, cytokines via ELISA and active neutrophil elastase(NE) via FRET assay.\n\n    We observed a mean increase in FEV1 of 13.57% (p < 0.001) and in body weight of 4.14 kg (p < 0.001) and a reduction in CF ABLE score (p = 0.0058). This clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in sputum ATP level(p < 0.0001),neutrophil count(p = 0.0043), IL-8(p = 0.039), IL-1beta(p = 0.0023), TNF-R1(p = 0.044) and NE (p = 0.0023).\n\n    Our study demonstrates a significant impact on CF airway inflammatory markers at 3 months post treatment with an improvement in clinical parameters in keeping with published literature. We aim to further explore whether this impact of Elex/Tez/Iva is maintained at 6 months follow-up.\n\n    We would like to acknowledge the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation grant # REEVES21G0 as our funding source.\n\n    4.2 Pre-Activated Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Enhance the Restoration of Local and Systemic Immune Homeostasis During Transitionary Phase Pulmonary Sepsis\n\n    Declan Byrnes1,2, Claire H.

Patients who survive the early phase enter the transitionary phase where they either return to immune homeostasis or enter late sepsis, characterised by immunosuppression. This is where 70% of sepsis related deaths occur. We wish to target the transitionary phase and promote immune homeostasis.\n\n    Previously our lab group have shown mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to be effective in treating bacterial pneumonia in early phase sepsis[1] and we aimed to develop an in vivo prolonged sepsis model to investigate if Naive and Pre-activated MSCs restore immune cell homeostasis.

O'Connor, MD, FRCPI, FCCP4\n\n    University College Cork; Mercy University Hospital, Cork\n\n    Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is implemented in certain tuberculosis (TB) patients to ensure treatment compliance. This study aims to identify the factors contributing towards the decision to implement DOT in the management of TB patients in Cork.\n\n    A retrospective dataset analysis of TB patients treated in the Mercy University Hospital TB Outpatient clinic between January 2016 and August 2020 was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad InStat.\n\n    Of 165 patients with active TB, 58 (35%) were managed with DOT. Patients who underwent DOT were more likely to be male (R = 0.2410, P = 0.0018), acid fast bacilli positive on a respiratory specimen (R = 0.2497, P = 0.0034), to have cavitary disease (R = 0.2468, P = 0.0014), longer treatment duration (R = 0.2009, P = 0.0131), to have been admitted to hospital prior to DOT (R = 0.2364, P = 0.0022), to have had a prolonged hospital stay (R = 0.2560, P = 0.0009), to have had psychological problems prior to diagnosis (R = 0.1666, P = 0.0324) and to be a current or ex-smoker (R = 0.1767, P = 0.0241).\n\n    In conclusion, biological, psychological, and social factors can influence the probability of patient compliance and inform the need for DOT. These factors should be taken into consideration when evaluating a patient for poor adherence to therapy.\n\n    4.6 Dexamethasone Reduces Metabolic Function and Subsequent Activation of Human Macrophages to  Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n    Dr Lorraine Thong1,2, Dr Donal Cox1, Prof. Joseph Keane1,2\n\n    1 Tuberculosis Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, St James Hospital\n\n    2 Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, St James Hospital\n\n    Corticosteroids are ubiquitous in the field of respiratory medicine due to their potent anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. More recently in the COVID-19 pandemic, corticosteroids are one of the only effective treatments for patients with COVID-19, particularly in individuals requiring respiratory support. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent for tuberculosis (TB). Furthermore, the emergence of extreme multidrug resistant Mtb drives the need for improved host-directed therapies. Host-directed therapies aim to improve immune responses of patients rather than classical therapies like antibiotics. The most efficient strategies to achieve new host-directed therapies is by repurposing drugs. At present, corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, are the only approved adjunctive treatment for Mtb with neurological or cardiological involvement. Despite the clinically proven effect of corticosteroids on TB patient survival, the exact mechanism of action underlying this benefit is poorly understood.\n\n    Human AM were purified from bronchoalveolar lavage. MDM were obtained from blood of healthy individuals. Dexamethasone treated human macrophages were infected with Mtb. Macrophages were then assessed for cytokine secretion, metabolic gene expression and metabolic flux at multiple timepoints. Dexamethasone significantly reduced secretion of IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha following infection. Moreover, dexamethasone reduced the expression of metabolic genes and glycolysis in macrophages.\n\n    4.7 Real -World Safety and tolerability of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis: A single centre experience\n\n    Michelle Casey1,2, Claudie Gabillard-Lefort1, Orla Kerr2, Elaine Marron2, Anne-Marie Lyons2, Ciara Reddy2, Cedric Gunaratnam1,2, Emer P.

The most common AEs reported are listed in Table 3, with no patient discontinuing treatment and treatment interruption required for 3(10%) patients.\n\n    In our experience most AEs have been mild and of short duration. Interestingly, we describe adverse events not reported in the original studies, such as the neurocognitive side effects and gender specific side effects of testicular swelling/discomfort in men and increased vaginal discharge in women. As the number of PWCF commencing CFTR modulator therapy increases, it is essential CF teams are aware of all potential AEs and that systematic approaches for prevention and/or management of AEs are developed.\n\n    4.8 Physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adults with Cystic Fibrosis:association with aerobic capacity, lung function, sleep, well-being, and quality of life: An observational study\n\n    Curran, M.1,2,3, Tierney, AC.1,3,4,5, Button, B.6,7, Collins, L.2, Kennedy, L.2, McDonnell, C.2, Sheikhi, A.3, Jurascheck, A.1, Casserly, B.2, Cahalan, R.1,3\n\n    1 School of Allied Health, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\n\n    2 University Hospital Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\n\n    3 Health Research Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\n\n    4 Health Implementation Science and Technology Research Group, Health Research Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\n\n    5 Department of Dietetics, Nutrition and Sport, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia\n\n    6 Departments of Respiratory Medicine and Physiotherapy, The Alfred, Melbourne, Australia\n\n    7 Department of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia\n\n    4.9 Extrapulmonary disease burden and impact of cystic fibrosis (CF) on productivity in people with CF (pwCF) aged >= 12 years not treated with CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulators (CFTRm): interim analysis (IA) of the HUBBLE study\n\n    J Stuart Elborn1, Jochen G.

We report results from a cross-sectional IA evaluating extrapulmonary disease burden and CF impact on work/school productivity in pwCF not treated with CFTRm.\n\n    This IA included pwCF in Ireland, the UK, and Germany aged >= 12 years not receiving CFTRm with F508del/F508del, F508del/minimal function (MF), or F508del/uncharacterized (second allele not F508del, gating, MF, or residual function) CFTR genotypes. PRO measures administered included questions on sinonasal symptoms, CF abdominal symptoms (CFAbd-Score), and the Work Productivity/Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment. Data were collected through participants' internet-enabled devices (10/2020-04/2021).\n\n    Fifty pwCF (32.0% male; mean [SD] age at registration, 29.2 [9.8] years; mean [SD] percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 74.9 [25.4]) were included. Sinonasal symptoms (Table) were experienced by 70% (n = 35) of pwCF; 62% of pwCF experienced moderately or very bothersome symptoms. Total mean (SD) CFAbd-Score was 30.7 (16.2) (Table 4). Average productivity loss was 46.1% (n = 15) and 33.0% (n = 11) in pwCF who were working and attending school, respectively.\n\n    Overall, evidence suggests substantial extrapulmonary disease burden and negative productivity impact in pwCF not treated with CFTRm.\n\n    1.

The VTE cumulative incidence was 2% in total (Subgroup analysis: 1% pre-transplant and 9% post-transplant). 61 radiological investigations were performed to assess for VTE. Positive cases: CTPA 1 of 49 and US Doppler 4 of 12. The clinical characteristics of positive case are summarized in Table 5.\n\n    Discussion: The overall cumulative incidence of VTE and use of VTE is prophylaxis is low in our population however higher in our post transplantation group suggesting definite need of use of VTE prophylaxis in this subgroup. The diagnostic positivity rate of PE with CTPA was low (2%). Interestingly the positive case was on a CFTR modulator. Large registry prospective analysis is needed in this area to determine a standardized approach.\n\n    Murray TS, Metzger NL, Chesson MM, Walker SD.

Portable medical devices for objective data capture, and access to a teleconference platform was provided to patients. To evaluate the telehealth service, a retrospective chart review was performed on consenting patients. Usability and Acceptance data was also collected from both patients and staff via the: System Usability Scale (SUS), TeleHealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ), IT Familiarity, and our own quality-survey.\n\n    Preliminary data was collected from 52 patients (p) and 11 staff (s). The SUS received a median score of 90 (p) and 87.5 (s) out of 100. The TUQ received a total score of 6.52 (p) and 6.1 (s) out of 7, with Ease of Use as the highest rated category (median 7, range 3.6-7) and Reliability as the lowest (median 5.33, range 2-7). The IT Familiarity questionnaire demonstrates that both cohorts have the skills necessary to conduct telehealth clinics. Qualitative data collected shows that while patients and staff experiences are positive, a good WiFi connection is imperative. Likewise traditional face-to-face care remains important and cannot be replaced.\n\n    4.13 Who's talking about CF?

Google Alerts was enlisted to generate and record alerts for the term \"Cystic Fibrosis\" and related terms for six months in 2015 and 2019. One month data was also recorded for Asthma, COPD and Lung Fibrosis for comparison.\n\n    In 2015 there were 3518 CF related terms, this increased to 5214 in 2019. There was an increase in blocked articles (144 to 540) due to GDPR regulations. For both years, the USA generated the highest number of alerts (56%). In 2015, News (58%) was the most common category, however this changed to Financial/Marketing (35%) in 2019. In 2015 Asthma received the highest mean number of alerts per day (31.7), followed by CF (16.1), then COPD (14.6), and Lung Fibrosis (5.1). However, in 2019 CF was the highest with 19.5, followed by Asthma (11.5), COPD (10.3), and Lung Fibrosis (7.4).\n\n    CF related internet postings are changing. CF is now more commonly reported on than other lung conditions with an emphasis on investment opportunities, while content from the general public has decreased (or is private).\n\n    4.14 Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) Pre and Post 'Kaftrio ' at Beaumont Hospital Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centre\n\n    Lydia Cullen1, Alexandra Murphy1, Michelle Casey1,2, Cedric Gunaratnam1,2, N.G.

Limited data exists for the effects of Kaftrio  in this group.\n\n    The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 'Kaftrio ' in a small group of NIV dependent adults with severe CF.\n\n    Patient demographics and NIV data, including respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (MV) and minutes of usage, for 4 patients were examined in the 3 months before and after initiation of 'Kaftrio '.\n\n    Statistically significant changes in FEV1% (p = 0.0437), FVC% (p = 0.0119), RR (p = 0.0137) and MV (p = 0.0420) were found. One patient discontinued use of NIV and oxygen (02), and 2 patients reduced their 02 requirements from 3L02 to 2L02 at night. Improvements in VT, minutes of usage, CF-ABLE score, BMI and weight were also found, however, they were not statistically significant.\n\n    This small study has demonstrated improvements in work of breathing and quality of life for PWCF with severe lung disease within months of starting Kaftrio . We plan to monitor NIV data more closely and complete more frequent investigations in order for therapy to be adjusted and/or discontinued in an objective and timely manner.\n\n    4.15 Submaximal Exercise Testing in People with Cystic Fibrosis (PWCF) Pre and Post 'Kaftrio ' at Beaumont Hospital Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centre\n\n    Alexandra Murphy1, Lydia Cullen1, Michelle Casey1, 2, Cedric Gunaratnam1, 2, N.G.

Pre and post 'Kaftrio ' MSWT results were compared and analysed.\n\n    Within six months of starting 'Kaftrio ' statistically significant improvements were noted in FEV1% (p = 0.0084), weight (p < 0.0001), resting oxygen saturation levels (p = 0.0176) and MSWT distance (p = 0.0112), with a mean increase of 100 m. There was no significant difference in resting heart rate and BORG scores remain unchanged.\n\n    4 additional patients (mean FEV1 = 74.75%) completed the MSWT prior to starting 'Kaftrio '. This ceiling effect could be highlighted further as patients with milder disease transition to 'Kaftrio ', thus potentially limiting the value of MSWT in the modulator era.\n\n    These results highlight the benefit of exercise testing in assessing clinical response to modulator therapies. Furthermore these results emphasise the need for maximal exercise testing when assessing clinical response in PWCF with milder disease.\n\n    UK CF Trust Standards of Care and Good Clinical Practice for the Physiotherapy Management of Cystic Fibrosis, 4th Edition, 2020.\n\n    Hebestreit H et al.

Antimicrobial resistance worldwide contributes to this problem, and patients receiving multiple courses of antibiotics are particularly at risk. The aim of this study is to identify multi-drug resistance rates in the cohort of patients with difficult to clear secretions who were referred to the respiratory physiotherapy department for chest clearance techniques over a 3 year period.\n\n    Seventy four patients (43 female, average age 67) with confirmed bronchiectasis were identified. Eighteen patients (24%) had at least 1 growth of Pseudomonas in the last three years. Of these, 6 patients (33%) had resistant pseudomonas, requiring combination antibiotic therapy for outpatient treatment. These patients were older, with a higher number of previous exacerbations, and lower FEV1. These patients also required more frequent visits for chest physiotherapy.\n\n    Pseudomonas rates in this cohort are similar to pseudomonas rates seen in the overall bronchiectasis population. The resistance rates of 33% are concerning, but are in line with resistance levels seen elsewhere. Appropriate antimicrobial stewardship, exacerbation prevention strategies, and appropriate vaccinations are required to reduce the risks of development of pseudomonas resistance in these patients.\n\n    4.17 Novel iPS-derived MSCs have antibacterial properties against pneumonia relevant pathogens\n\n    Juan Fandino1, Matt Angel2, Christopher Rohde2, Arya Padmakumar1,3, Rosella Giannoccari1,3, John Laffey1, Daniel O'Toole1\n\n    1 CURAM, SFI Research Centre for Medical Devices, Galway, Ireland\n\n    2 Factor Bioscience Ltd., Cambridge, MA, USA\n\n    3 Centre for Cell Manufacturing Ireland (CCMI), Galway, Ireland\n\n    Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated benefit in pathogenic ARDS models and are in clinical trials, but allogeneic MSCs have several manufacturing and consistency disadvantages. Recently, an iPS-derived MSCs (iMSCs) has been developed by a novel mRNA method generating mutation-free, clinically viable cells, with similar characteristics to naturally occurring MSCs. We wished to study this cell's cytokine production in response to injury microenvironment related stimuli and the antibiotic properties of its conditioned media (CM) against bacterial pneumonia pathogens.\n\n    For cytokine production, bone marrow (BM-MSCs) and iMSCs were stimulated for 24 h with cytokines or lipopolysaccharide, and secreted soluble factors quantified by ELISA. For antibiotic properties, known colony forming units of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates were added to CM and bacterial proliferation assessed spectrophotometrically.\n\n    iMSCs showed similar cytokine production patterns in response to different stimulus as BM-MSCS. iMSC-derived CM exhibited the same inhibitory effect as BM-MSC CM on the growth of the different bacterial clinical isolates. These results demonstrate that iMSCs retain the immunomodulatory and antibacterial properties of MSCs and are a promising therapeutic candidate to advance to preclinical and clinical trials for ARDS and other lung diseases.\n\n    4.18 Risk Factors and Markers of Severity in Hospital Acquired Pneumonia\n\n    Claire Bright1, Donna Leahy2, Seamus Linnane2\n\n    1. School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4\n\n    2. Beacon Hospital, Bracken Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18\n\n    Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a nosocomial infection occurring in hospital patients > 72 h post admission. Studies on hospital pneumonia tend to focus on ventilator associated infections meaning that HAP is a neglected area of research. HAP is an avoidable cause of morbidity and mortality with a concomitant impact on health economics.\n\n    A clinical audit took place in the Beacon Hospital in order to identify potential risk factors and markers of severity.\n\n    The Hospital database was searched for key terms consistent with a diagnosis of HAP. 915 patients were identified. These records were individually reviewed for clinical criteria consistent with HAP. 70 patients aged (Mean (SD)) 69.9 (13.4) years fit the criteria.\n\n    Risk factors for HAP included proton-pump inhibitor use on admission (56%), cardiothoracic surgery (31%), low haemoglobin levels on admission (59%) and presence of active cancer (33%). Adverse outcomes were more common in those with elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein levels, as well as low albumin (p = 0.04) or haemoglobin levels (p = 0.04 ANOVA).\n\n    This audit indicates that HAP is a significant clinical problem. Several risk factors and routine blood tests may allow earlier identification of at-risk patients improving both morbidity and mortality.\n\n    4.19 An Audit on the Outpatient Management of Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) in Mater Misericordiae University Hospital\n\n    D.

McCullagh1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin\n\n    2 Department of Clinical Microbiology, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin\n\n    TB is a treatable condition requiring prolonged course of antimicrobials. A comprehensive outpatient management is paramount to ensure completion and prevent the emergence of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB. This audit is aimed to establish our institution's current practice against the standard outlined by the European Union Standard TB Care (ESTC, 2017).\n\n    We collated data of patients diagnosed with active Pulmonary TB who had completed follow up in our institution from 2017 to 2020. A total of 40 patients were included in the audit. The main standards of comparison include Drug Sensitivity Testing (DST) and choice of antimicrobial treatment, HIV testing, and the documentation of treatment tolerance i.e. liver profiles and medications side effects.\n\n    This audit shows that our institution achieved 100% for DST and antimicrobial treatment option. However, HIV testing and documentation of treatment tolerance were completed in only 50% and 95% of the patients respectively.\n\n    In conclusion, this audit shows that our institution has yet to achieve the standard care of the active Pulmonary TB outpatient management. A proforma is being developed to improve our service provision to comply with the standards.\n\n    4.20 Use Of Video Observed Therapy As An Alternative To Directly Observed Therapy In Drug Resistant TB\n\n    Lorraine Dolan1, Joe Keane2, Annemarie Mc Laughlin2\n\n    1  TB CNS, St James's Hospital\n\n    2 Respiratory Consultant, St James's Hospital\n\n    Video observed therapy (VOT) is a novel alternative to Directly observed therapy (DOT) to assist compliance with Tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Mobile phone technology can be used in which patient's video themselves taking their medicines. It is time stamped and sent to their healthcare provider.\n\n    Herein, we describe a patient with a Rifampicin resistant TB who was initially started on conventional DOT. He had 76/133 (57%) doses observed by DOT. Since the rate of failure to observe with DOT was unacceptable he was transferred to VOT. Using VOT 138/180 (76%) doses were observed. This case highlights an increase in the observed doses using VOT by comparison to DOT. We are currently examining compliance, cost and patient satisfaction in a larger study.\n\n    5.

It can be carried out via bronchoscopic lobar reduction with endobronchial valves (EBV) or keyhole surgery (VATS or robotic assisted thoracic surgery;RATS) with resection of hypo-perfused tissue.\n\n    As part of a clinical trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of LVR for a multi-centre cohort of patients with end-stage emphysema; we present the initial results of 20 patients. Workup includes smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, PFTs, VQ scan, high resolution CT-thorax non-contrast to generate a STRATX report evaluating interlobar fissures, 6-min-walk test, pre-operative assessment and quality of life(QOL) questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L and SGRQ).\n\n    The mean age of this patient cohort is 66.7 (49-80), their mean FEV1 28.05 (16-43) and mean residual volume 206.8(147-290). 3 patients underwent VATS LVRS, 1 RATS and 16 had EBV.\n\n    Preliminary results from patients who have completed 3 months follow-up show a mean increase in FEV1 to 32.75(28 - 47) and mean decrease in RV to 170.5(145 - 201). Patient reported QOL scores increased from 43(20-70) to 60(35-95) (EQ-5D-5L).\n\n    LVR is an effective treatment for dyspnoea with improvement in clinical and patient reported parameters.\n\n    5.2 A study to assess the impact of airway virus on asthma control in non-exacerbating patients\n\n    Laura J Walsh1, Ashley Sullivan2,3, John A MacSharry2,3, Desmond M Murphy1,4\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland\n\n    2 The APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n    3 The Schools of Medicine and Microbiology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n    4 Health Research Board, Clinical Research Facility, University College Cork, Cork\n\n    Changes to the composition of the pulmonary microbiome e.g., through viral infection have the potential to impact asthma severity. However, little is known about the lung virome and the role viruses play in non-exacerbating asthmatics.\n\n    We aim to assess if viral colonisation in non-exacerbating asthmatics influenced their asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score and if viral colonisation differed by severity of disease as per GINA classification.\n\n    Patients were recruited from the asthma clinic in Cork University Hospital. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out and viral analysis was conducted. We also measured a cell differential and cytokine levels in the samples.\n\n    46 samples were obtained of which 10.8% were virus positive. Most patients in this study were classed as severe asthmatics. There was a higher mean ACQ-7 and lower FEV1 in the virus positive group. Oral steroid use was significantly higher in those with severe asthma who were virus positive.\n\n    Our results suggests that in non-exacerbating asthmatics, viral colonisation results in poorer asthma control, a significantly higher dose of oral steroids and lower FEV1. Elevated airway levels of several cytokines were also observed in the airways of patients who were virus positive.\n\n    5.3 The accuracy of HIPE coded data in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD: a quality improvement project\n\n    Eleanor Cronin1, Breda Cushen1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin\n\n    The number of cases of patients admitted to Irish hospitals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as their principal diagnosis has increased over the last 10 years from 10,996 in 2010 to 16,184 in 2019 (1).\n\n    A retrospective chart review was carried out on 22 patients who died in 2019 with a HIPE coded admission diagnosis of an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Data were collected and a comparison was made between the admitting diagnosis as documented by the NCHD, and the admitting diagnosis as documented by the consultant.\n\n    In 50% of cases (11/22) the consultant diagnosis was not of an AECOPD. In 6/11 of these cases, while the admitting NCHD had initially documented the diagnosis as an AECOPD, on consultant review an alternative diagnosis was documented (e.g., pneumonia). In the other 5/11 cases, COPD was not mentioned as the reason for admission, yet was HIPE coded as such. Interestingly, in 4 of these 5 cases the patient had a diagnosis of type two respiratory failure.\n\n    We conclude that reliance on the admitting NCHD documentation for HIPE coding may lead to incorrect data capture. The lack of an objective marker of a COPD exacerbation means patients are erroneously labelled and treated as an exacerbation when alternate coexistent pathology is responsible.\n\n    References\n\n    http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/noca-uploads/general/National_Audit_of_Hospital_Mortality_Report_2019_Final.pdf\n\n    5.4 Cigarette smoke alters macrophage mitochondrial iron handling in COPD\n\n    Lynne Faherty1,2, Kihwan Kim3, William Z. Zhang3, Suzanne M. Cloonan1,2,3\n\n    1 School of Medicine, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    2 Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    3 Joan and Sandford I. Weill Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, USA\n\n    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease characterised by emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Cigarette smoke (CS) inhalation constitutes the primary risk factor for COPD progression and dysregulates numerous pathways essential to lung-resident alveolar macrophage (AM) and circulating bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) function. Aberrant iron metabolism is one such hallmark: AMs are the primary lung resident iron-positive cells, with numerous iron-related proteins elevated in patient bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Interestingly, CS also causes mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages, which are the primary iron storage sites in the cell. CS-induced mitochondrial dysregulation blunts phagocytic and inflammatory function in AMs and BMDMs, but its effect on mitochondrial iron in COPD macrophages is unknown. Using an in vitro model of smoke exposure, we show that CS alters expression of the mitochondrial iron transporters mitoferrin 1 and 2 and mitochondrial iron content in immortalised BMDMs, with further dysregulation upon lipopolysaccharide treatment. Single-cell RNAseq of AMs isolated from CS-exposed mice revealed similarly altered expression patterns in vivo. These findings illustrate the role of macrophage mitochondrial iron dysregulation in COPD pathogenesis and present the manipulation of mitochondrial iron in the lung as an intriguing therapeutic target.\n\n    5.5 Robot-Assisted Lung Volume Reduction Surgery in Management of Severe Emphysematous Disease: A Case Series\n\n    Hallinan N1, Aladaileh M2, Eaton D3\n\n    1,2,3 Department of Thoracic Surgery, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Eccles St, D 7\n\n    Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive inflammatory disease of the airways, alveoli and pulmonary microvasculature1. In selected patients, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) has been shown to improve lung function and quality of life2. Minimally invasive techniques have become standard of care, offering distinct benefits over thoracotomy. We present a case series, describing our experience of robot-assisted LVRS.\n\n    A retrospective review of patients who underwent robot-assisted LVRS in a Dublin hospital was carried out to assess morbidity and mortality. Main outcome measures were post-operative length of stay and chest drain duration.\n\n    Robot-assisted LVRS was performed in 5 patients between April 2019 and September 2020. The mean age of patients was 56.6 years (median age 58 years, range 48-63 years). Patients had a mean pre-operative FEV1 of 46%, total lung capacity of 110% and residual volume of 220% of predicted. The median post-operative length of hospital stay was 6 days (range 2-13). The median post-operative chest drain duration was 6 days (range 3-19). There were no operative, in hospital or 90 day mortalities.\n\n    Based on our experience, robot-assisted LVRS appears safe and feasible. Future projects aim to compare post-operative outcomes in robot-assisted versus video-assisted thoroscopic surgery (VATS) LVRS.\n\n    References\n\n    1.

The End to End COPD Model of Care (2019) provides guidelines for best practice. COPD Quality Improvement Initiative (COPD QI) was rolled out to support the implementation of the guidelines in 2018 and 2019. The first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated restructuring of hospital services and redeployment of staff. We aimed to audit COPD care in our institution based on this guideline in the aftermath of the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n    This retrospective study reviewed 20 patient charts with admissions for an exacerbation of COPD between September and November 2020. Data was collected with a predetermined pro forma based on standards in the End to End COPD Model of Care and previous COPD QI. The results are highlighted in Table 6.\n\n    COPD pathways are very likely to have been impacted by the changes forced on hospitals during the COVID surges. Institutional memory is short lived. We recommend that a dedicated staff member is appointed in each institution to champion and drive the changes and standards endorsed by the End to End COPD Model of Care and COPD QI.\n\n    5.7 A 2-year longitudinal follow-up study examining physical activity and frailty in supplemental oxygen users attending a respiratory outpatient service\n\n    L Oliveira1, R Keegan1, K Devenney2, C Gleeson2, J Broderick1\n\n    1. Discipline of Physiotherapy, Trinity College Dublin\n\n    2. Respiratory Assessment Unit, St. James's Hospital\n\n    The aim of this study was to assess and longitudinally follow up physical parameters of people with COPD who were supplemental oxygen users over a 2-year period.\n\n    Eighteen participants [11 males, mean (SD) age 71.67 (9.93)] took part in a telephone-based assessment at baseline (T1) and 2-year follow-up (T2). The following variables were assessed; spirometry, dyspnoea severity (eMRCD), health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EQ5D5L), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), physical activity levels (Physical Activity Vital Sign) and frailty (FiND questionnaire).\n\n    Spirometry remained stable over time (mean %predicted FEV1 47.2 +- 16.9 at T1; 47.7 +- 15.8 at T2) as did dyspnoea scores (median eMRCD 3 at T1; 3 at T2). 27.8% (n = 5) were frail at baseline compared to 66.7% (n = 12) at follow up. Sleep quality scores were lower at follow up (8.17 +- 4.19 at T1; 9.56 +- 5.03 at T2). Mobility and usual activities were the domains of HRQoL most affected at both T1 and T2. Adherence to physical activity recommendations was very low at both timepoints (16.7% (n = 3) at T1; 11% (n = 2) at T2).\n\n    Overall, although disease progression and dyspnoea remained stable over two years, physical activity, HRQoL and sleep quality decreased and frailty levels increased. This study highlights areas which represent exercise intervention targets in supplemental oxygen users.\n\n    5.8 Does the Test of Adherence to Inhalers Questionnaire Correlate with the Inhaled Corticosteroid Medicines Possession Ratio of Patients Attending a UK Hospital Asthma Clinic?\n\n    Adiva Khan, Sadia Rahman, Niall Stewart-Kelcher, Ankita Patel, Linda Green, Mariana Fernandes, Cris Roxas, Louise Thompson,Jaideep Dhariwal, Alexandra Nanzer, David J Jackson, Grainne d'Ancona\n\n    Guy's Severe Asthma Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK\n\n    A common method of determining adherence to inhaled corticosteroid treatment is the medicines possession ratio (MPR) calculated from prescription records as observed pickup/expected. A high MPR (>= 75%) suggests good adherence, 51-74% is intermediate and MPR <= 50% suggests poor adherence. Another strategy is the Test of Adherence to Inhalers1 (TAI), a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire with 10-items which classifies adherence as good, intermediate or poor based on the patient's total response score (50/50, 46-49/50 or <= 45/50 respectively).\n\n    Of 100 patients attending a hospital asthma clinic (60% female, mean age 46 years), 56 had a TAI that matched their MPR classification, 28 TAI suggested better adherence than MPR (10 significantly so) and 16 insinuated less ICS use (4 significantly so). The results are summarised in Table 7.\n\n    While the limitations of interpreting a high MPR are acknowledged (it does not guarantee adherence), a low MPR makes adherence unlikely. In this cohort of patients, using TAI to triage patients with intermediate/low adherence for medicines-taking support from the pharmacist identified 44 patients, of whom 14 were potentially inappropriate (high MPR), but importantly overlooked 17 with intermediate/low MPR. These data suggest TAI alone is unlikely to identify potential non-adherence and reiterates caution when interpreting the MPR.\n\n    Reference\n\n    Plaza V, Fernandez-Rodriguez, C, Melero C et al (2016) Validation of the 'Test of the Adherence to Inhalers' (TAI) for Asthma and COPD Patients.

Close monitoring by RANP included monthly PEFR monitoring, asthma education, assessment of adherence and assessment of airway inflammation using blood eosinophils and serial fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Patient contacts were either face to face or virtual in keeping with COVID-19 guidelines. Using a shared decision approach, PEFR data and airway inflammation data: (1) There was an improvement in adherence to inhaler therapy by switching to once daily asthma regimen which led to a reduction in FENO, blood eosinophils and exacerbations; (2) Switching to anti-IL5 therapy was avoided in the second patient. When the patient decided to stop inhaled corticosteroid therapy, detection of early rise in FeNO, blood eosinophils and drop in peak flow led to the patient agreeing to re-commencement of inhaled corticosteroids.\n\n    RANP frequent contacts with severe asthma patients and a shared decision making resulted in improved medication adherence, reduction in asthma exacerbations.\n\n    5.10 A Survey of the Multidisciplinary Team Understanding of the Impact of Inhalers on Carbon Footprint\n\n    S.

Pressurised metred dose inhalers (MDIs) contain a propellant (hydrofluroalkanes) which has a disproportionate global warming potential to dry powdered inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMIs).\n\n    In this study an anonymous, online, 23 question, survey of the respiratory multidisciplinary team assessed the understanding of the impact of inhalers on carbon footprint.\n\n    Sixty-one members of the respiratory multidisciplinary team completed the survey. Sixty two percent of respondents prescribe inhalers at least weekly. Eighty percent would appreciate further training on inhaler technique. Forty-seven percent were not aware that some inhalers release greenhouse gases and eighty nine percent had never discussed the correct disposal of inhalers with their patients. Half did not feel confident identifying patients who do require an MDI and those could be suitably managed with a DPI. Ninety- four percent felt it was important to consider carbon footprint when choosing an inhaler for a patient.\n\n    When informed, the respiratory multidisciplinary team recognises the importance of considering carbon footprint when prescribing inhalers. Further education is welcomed by the respiratory multidisciplinary team to increase awareness of the impact of inhalers on carbon footprint.\n\n    References\n\n    Healthcare Without Harm: HealthCare's Climate Footprint. https://noharm-global.org/documents/health-care-climate-footprint-report\n\n    5.11 A Novel Respiratory Physiologist Led Diagnostic Spirometry Service in Primary Care: Slaintecare Integration Fund (SIF) 159 Project\n\n    F.

Irish General Practitioners (GP) do not often have direct access to a quality spirometry diagnostic service in Primary Care. Respiratory Physiologists, based in Northeast Wicklow (CHO6) and Longford/Westmeath (CHO8), began providing a novel community based spirometry diagnostic service in April 2021. The data from the first 150 patients has been audited and results are presented in Table 8. Data is presented as percentages or mean +- SD as appropriate\n\n    Both patients and GP's are very satisfied with this service, which is providing a rapid and direct access service in primary care.\n\n    In conclusion this audit demonstrates early success with this novel service.

First approved for HSE reimbursement in 2018, anti-IL-5 therapies allow for targeted asthma care in carefully selected patients with refractory disease.\n\n    We assessed clinical outcomes in severe eosinophilic asthmatics who remained suboptimally controlled despite Omalizumab and were therefore switched to Anti-IL-5 therapy.\n\n    All patients who switched therapy were reviewed (2018-2021). Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), exacerbation rate, eosinophil count, maintenance corticosteroid (OCS) dose, and FEV1 were analysed. Comparisons were made pre Omalizumab vs one year established on Omalizumab and pre switch on Omalizumab vs. one year post anti-IL-5 commencement.\n\n    Ten patients met criteria. All switched therapy September 2018-September 2020. Six patients commenced Benralizumab, and four commenced Mepolizumab.\n\n    There was a significant reduction in exacerbation rate, eosinophil count, and FEV1 in Omalizumab vs. one year post anti-IL-5, (p = 0.029, p = 0.007, p = 0.028) respectively.\n\n    Median annual exacerbation rate decreased from pre Omalizumab to one year post (10 vs. 5) and from pre anti-IL-5 to post (6 vs. 0). Median OCS dose decreased from pre anti IL-5 to post (7.5 vs. 2.5 mg). Median ACQ score decreased (3.0 vs 1.9).\n\n    Asthmatics who are suboptimally controlled despite Omalizumab should be considered for anti-IL5 therapy\n\n    5.13 A Different Approach to the Delivery of a Respiratory Integrated Care Service.\n\n    P.

Mentorship between the integrated clinical nurse specialist (CNS) and advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) within secondary care was created. It was envisioned that the ANP would supervise and sign off the majority of the clinical patient caseload for the CNS, with overall clinical governance by the respiratory consultant. Inclusion and exclusion criteria would be applied to referrals and complex cases would be discussed with the respiratory consultant.\n\n    Monthly statistics were gathered and patient files were reviewed retrospectively. Data was collected from the commencement of the service in April 2021 to end of July.\n\n    In total 55 patients have been assessed. Of these, 12% (n = 7) had no previous diagnosis of pulmonary disease. To clarify a diagnosis, 43% (n = 24) were sent for additional testing (PFTs). 5.5% (n = 3) had change in their diagnosis from Asthma to COPD. Overall, 27% (n = 15) were referred to the consultant for further discussion/assessment.\n\n    This project shows that integrated care services can be supervised safely and effectively by a registered ANP once sufficient medical supports are in place.

A survey to determine patient satisfaction was carried out in July 2021. A questionnaire was distributed to all patients who received more than three infusions within the outpatient setting in the previous 12 months\n\n    A 7 item Likert questionnaire was developed. Questions 1-6 were based on a scoring scale of 1-5 to rate the service, and question 7 was open ended to allow for feedback. These questionnaires were discussed with patients with help from administration staff whom the patients had never met previously to exclude any bias. Patients who responded to a text message agreed to being contacted, to complete the questionnaire.\n\n    All patients felt they would be able to contact the respiratory team in an event of acute deterioration in their asthma symptoms. 96% of patients felt by attending asthma biologic clinics, that they had a greater level of knowledge on disease management. 78% of patients felt by attending the asthma biologic service that they avoided a hospital admission by early interventions of the multi-disciplinary team.\n\n    Our results suggest that the provision of an outpatient asthma biologic service is a modality of treatment delivery supported by our asthma cohort.\n\n    5.16 A Nurse led Respiratory Integrated Care Service for CHO 6:4 months on\n\n    J.O'Hara1, P.O'Toole2, S.O'Beirne3\n\n    1 Respiratory Integrated Care CHO 6 North East Wicklow\n\n    2 Department of Respiratory Medicine St. Michael's Hospital (SMH)\n\n    3 Department of Respiratory Medicine St.Vincent's University Hospital\n\n    Affiliations: This project was affiliated with Slaintecare, Pobal, the National Clinical Programme (NCP) Respiratory, RIC CHO Area 6, St. Michael's Hospital.\n\n    The purpose of this integrated nurse led clinic is to provide diagnosis, treatment and management of Asthma and COPD in a Primary Care setting.

Our aim was to evaluate the Virtual PR (VPR) service, implemented due to Covid-19 restrictions in Tallaght University Hospital (TUH), by monitoring adherence to PA. We measured daily PA levels and sedentary behavior in patients following VPR and assessed the barriers to PA.\n\n    The first 12 patients who completed VPR in TUH were contacted via telephone an average of 19 weeks post completion of the programme. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form, a self-reported survey that assesses PA, was administered. In addition patients were asked to give examples of PA performed and barriers limiting PA.\n\n    Ten patients were included (one patient did not answer the phone and one patient had died). Eight patients performed moderate PA, walking for an average of 24 min per day, no patients partook in vigorous PA. Two patients completed strengthening exercises and housework was the most common PA reported. Reduced motivation when exercising alone, Covid-19 restrictions, dyspnea, fatigue and oxygen dependency were barriers to PA.\n\n    Poor adherence to PA was observed following VPR.

Sixty eight participants (female 43.2%, mean age 68.4 +- 11.2 years, mean MRCD 2.8 +- 1) enrolled over 1-year. The dropout rate was 45.5% (n = 31). Post assessment outcomes (n = 34) demonstrated MID in exercise capacity or health status was achieved in 91.1% of participants (70.5%, n = 24 in exercise capacity; 50%, n = 17 in health status; 29.4%, n = 10 both).

While safety and feasibility were demonstrated, clinical effectiveness has not been fully established.\n\n    5.19 Comparison of Subjective and Objective Outcomes in 8-Week Virtual Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program with Telehealth Alternative\n\n    Brian Fitzgibbon1, Conor Hynes2, Caoimhe Murray3\n\n    1 Senior Physiotherapist Respiratory Integrated Care, Carlow/Kilkenny\n\n    2 School of Allied Health, University of Limerick\n\n    3 School of Allied Health, University of Limerick\n\n    a)Effectiveness of virtual/telehealth Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) versus in-person PR, demonstrated in COPDAssessment Test (CAT) scores. b)Effectiveness of virtual (VPR) versus telehealth PR, demonstrated in COPDAssessment Test (CAT), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), 1-min Sit-to-Stand (1MSTS) test.\n\n    Participants in VPR and telehealthPR programmes completed pre- and post-assessments including the CAT, GAD-7 and 1MSTS outcome measures. Differences between pre- and post- scores were evaluated and compared between virtual and telehealthPR groups. The outcome measure common to both groups, CAT scores from virtual/telehealthPR participants were compared to pre-COVID, in-person PR.\n\n    In-person PR outcome measures were recorded between March 2019-2020, and virtual/telehealthPR between July 2020-May 2021. Similarly significant reduction observed in median CAT score for participants of both in-person PR (-3;n = 53) and virtual/teleheathPR (-3.68;n = 44) Significant reduction (-4.76 points)in median CAT score was observed for VPR participants (n = 29;MCID = -2). A non-significant reduction (-0.96) observed for telehealthPR participants (n = 15). Similar improvements observed in median GAD-7 scores for telehealth (-0.5; n = 14) and virtual (-1; n = 31)PR groups. A significant increase (3reps) in median 1MSTS scores observed for telehealthPR participants (n = 19; MCID =  >= 3reps). A non-significant increase (2 reps) observed for VPR participants (n = 33)\n\n    In-person and virtual/telehealthPR programmes were equally effective for CAT scores. VPR programmes were more effective than telehealth CAT scores.\n\n    5.20 Should frailty assessment be incorporated in COPD Outreach Programmes?\n\n    Daphne Masterson, Martha O Connor, Angela Radley, Yusuf Vapra, Kenneth Bolger\n\n    Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Outreach Team, Respiratory Department, Tipperary University Hospital (TippUH), Clonmel, Co Tipperary\n\n    A Slaintecare funded COPD Outreach Programme was commenced in October 2020. COPD Outreach Programmes have been proven to reduce length of stay (LOS), reduce re-admission rates and improve quality of life.\n\n    National inclusion and exclusion criteria for COPD Outreach ensure safety is maintained but precise measures to predict who will require readmission, are less robust. Baseline measures such as FEV1, mMRC, CAT, EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L, previous admissions, LOS, and co-morbidities are captured. Our programme includes frailty assessment using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS).\n\n    32 candidates, with a CFS ranging from 3-7, have been enrolled and discharged within 72 h. 15/32 (47%) have passed the 90 day since acceptance. 7/15 have been readmitted, of which 57% were associated with a CFS-6 which is a moderately frail classification, with the remainder at CFS-5 (mildly frail). These re-admissions utilised 21.5 bed days, compared with 51.5 bed days in the previous 90 days.\n\n    This study questions whether frailty scores should be incorporated in inclusion /exclusion criteria. On identification of a frail patient, further resources and interventions could then be made available through the COPD Outreach Programme, to further optimise health outcomes and potentially reduce re-admissions.\n\n    5.21 Reviewing Bone Health in a COPD Outreach service in South Tipperary\n\n    Daphne Masterson, Martha O Connor, Angela Radley, Yusuf Vapra, Kenneth Bolger\n\n    Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Outreach Team, Respiratory Department, Tipperary University Hospital (TippUH), Clonmel, Co Tipperary\n\n    A Slaintecare funded COPD Outreach was commenced in 2020. Bone health is a potentially modifiable factor in health outcomes in patients with COPD. Assessment of bone health includes vitamin D measurement and DEXA scanning, to guide prescribing and address lifestyle modifications such as BMI, smoking, diet and exercise.\n\n    Of 32 patients managed to date, 15 have had a DEXA scan. 14/15 (93.3%) have highlighted bone health disorders. Two studies showed osteoporosis in spine, femoral neck and total hip (-2.5 to -4.2). The remainder demonstrated a combination of normal to osteoporosis in the 3 separate dimensions of the scan (-0.3 to -2.5).\n\n    13/32 (40%) of the total patients were prescribed bone protector medications with 3 of these having no documented DEXA scan. 14/32 were deficient in Vitamin D. 7 have successfully ceased smoking; 11 continue to smoke. 5/32 candidates had a BMI of less than 20.\n\n    This study highlights one associated comorbidity of patients treated during an Outreach program. This highlights the need for a systemic approach to patient health rather than solely lung health. Assessing and treating bone health through pharmacological and non-pharmacological means has the potential to improve the COPD associated health burden, and prevent hospital admissions and readmissions.\n\n    5.22 Can Grip Strength be used as a predictor of re-admission in patients enrolled in a COPD Outreach Early Supported Discharge (ESD) Programme?\n\n    Martha O'Connor, Daphne Masterson, Angela Radley, Yusuf Vapra, Kenneth Bolger\n\n    Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Outreach Service, Respiratory Department, Tipperary University Hospital (TippUH), Clonmel, Co. Tipperary\n\n    COPD Outreach ESD commenced in TippUH as a Slaintecare project in November 2020. One aim of ESD is to reduce re-admission rates. An estimated 35% of patients hospitalised with acute exacerbation of COPD are re-admitted within 90 days. The first step towards avoiding re-admission is identification of patients at risk. Studies have explored potential predictors for re-admission, including frailty. Hand grip strength, a component of the Frailty Phenotype is an objective measure which may predict re-admission.\n\n    All patients accepted for ESD (36 to date) performed grip strength measurement, using a Saehan Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer. Grip strength was classified as 'Weak' or 'Not Weak' using cut off scores stratified by gender and BMI, as per 'Strength' component of the Frailty Phenotype assessment.\n\n    15 patients have passed 90 days post acceptance. Of those, 10 (67%) were 'Weak' and 5 (33%) were 'Not Weak'. Of the 'Weak' patients, 7 (70%) were re-admitted within 90 days. Of the 'Not Weak' patients, only 1 (20%) was re-admitted.\n\n    Results indicate a potential clinically significant difference between 'Weak' and 'Not Weak' groups. However as patient numbers are limited, further data collection and analysis are required to determine association between grip strength and re-admissions for COPD patients.\n\n    5.23 Join the living Quit smoking. A smoking cessation physiotherapy led Slainte care initiative\n\n    Angela O'Donovan, Martha O'Connor, Rosaleen Anglim, Daphne Masterson, Yusuf Vapra, Kenneth Bolger\n\n    Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)Outreach Team, Respiratory Department, Tipperary University Hospital (TippUH), Clonmel. Tipperar\n\n    COPD outreach commenced in TippUH in October 2020 as a Slaintecare project. There are 3 pillars to this programme(Pulmonary Rehab, Smoking Cessation & Early Supported Discharge).Smoking is the top modifiable risk for mortality in COPD. 6000 deaths a year in Ireland due to smoking.\n\n    The Smoking Cessation service is committed to promoting positive health and well-being, by reducing the harm caused by tobacco use. We do this through education, client centred treatment, advocacy, audit and evaluation.\n\n    Patients are referred to the smoking cessation service with their consent as in-patients where brief intervention and NRT is commenced. Then patients are reviewed in the Physiotherapy OPD department for face to face behavioural support with regular carbon monoxide(CO) monitoring.\n\n    All patients are registered on the national Quitmanager database.\n\n    To date 368 patients have received smoking cessation advice. 68% were smoke free after the 12 week programme. 79% smoke free at 6 months.\n\n    This ongoing initiative demonstrates the importance of a smoking cessation face to face behavioural support programme with CO monitoring. Brief intervention re smoking cessation should be commenced at ward level and continued in out-patients.\n\n    The author encourages patients to remember that their last puff is their first breath of a new life so join the living Quit the habit.\n\n    Conflict of Interest: The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\n\n    5.24 Slaintecare Integration Fund 159 Project: Development of an End to End Respiratory Model in two Community Healthcare Networks - The Clinician's Perspective\n\n    M. Ward, Change Manager, Slaintecare Integrated Fund 159\n\n    Affiliations: This project was affiliated with Slaintecare, Pobal, the National Clinical Programme (NCP) Respiratory, the office of NCAGL for chronic disease and Primary Care Strategy & Planning.\n\n    Development of an End to End Respiratory Model in two community healthcare networks is aligned to strategic actions three and four in the Slaintecare Implementation Strategy 20181. To date respiratory services have generally been delivered in acute secondary care. This project looked at the development of a community based respiratory team across two sites - Northeast Wicklow and Longford/Westmeath.\n\n    Disciplines included in the team were: Clinical Nurse Specialist Respiratory, Senior Physiotherapists x2WTE, Senior Respiratory Physiologist and a Smoking Cessation Officer. The team was governed clinically by the local acute hospital respiratory consultant and the NCP Respiratory.\n\n    At the end of the project a questionnaire was distributed to each team member to obtain their feedback on the project.\n\n    Highlights of the project were:\n\n    Successful implementation of the community based respiratory team\n\n    Positive patient feedback about attending respiratory services in primary care\n\n    Improved service delivery for respiratory patients with increased accessibility to respiratory services\n\n    Team approach and collaborative working to provide an array of community respiratory resources for respiratory patients\n\n    Challenges to the project as reported by the team included:\n\n    Difficulty sourcing accommodation\n\n    Some services had to be modified to an online platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n    All team meetings initially were virtual which meant that team members were unable to meet face to face\n\n    Overall this project overcame all challenges to successfully implement the End to End Respiratory Model in two community sites embracing the Slaintecare ethos of bringing high quality integrated care closer to the patient's home.\n\n    References\n\n    1.

However, the COVID-19 Global Pandemic highlighted its underutilisation amongst the COPD population. We aimed to explore the reasons for this and determine what improvements could be made to increase utilisation.\n\n    A 10-question e-survey was disseminated through respiratory health care professional (R-HCP) organisations as well as sharing it on twitter.\n\n    Results confirmed a lack of awareness of COPD-Adv amongst R-HCPs; 60% were aware of it, but only 31% referred patients to it. Of non-referrers, 14% reported their service fully met their patients' needs, the remainder either didn't know about COPD-Adv, didn't have details to distribute, or didn't think of it. Amongst respondents, Respiratory Nurses and Physiotherapists had most familiarity with COPD-Adv, indicating promotion amongst medical doctors could be beneficial. Main referrals were for new diagnosis COPD and exacerbation self-management education. Most valued features were delivery by fellow R-HCPs and suggested developments to allow video-call inhaler technique, breathlessness management and tailored home exercise programmes were proposed.\n\n    Overall, the response was positive regarding service content, but awareness was low, suggesting increased promotion across R-HCPs would be beneficial.\n\n    5.26 Implementation of a Virtual Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme for patients with chronic respiratory disease in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n    Clare Baily-Scanlan1, Barry Kehoe1, Professor Eddie Moloney2\n\n    1 Physiotherapy Department, Dublin South West, CHO7,  2 Professorial Respiratory Centre, Tallaght University Hospital\n\n    Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is one of the most effective and efficient treatments for patients with chronic lung conditions(1). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, face to face PR classes across the country were suspended. The community-based PR staff in Dublin South West sustained the delivery of PR through a virtual medium, which has previously been shown to be safe and feasible (2).\n\n    43 patients were referred to the virtual PR (VPR) service. Of these, 14 declined due to technical issues, 19 were assessed and suitable and the remaining 10 were unsuitable. Patients were invited to log onto the HSE approved digital platform Attend Anywhere or attend in person, depending on public health advice, for their initial and post assessments. Classes were delivered via Attend Anywhere and ran twice a week for 8 weeks. 52% (n = 10) of participants showed significant improvement in their health status using the COPD Assessment Tool. 63% (n = 12) showed significant improvement in exercise tolerance, using either the 1 min sit-to-stand or 6 min walk test. Three patients dropped out of the programme.\n\n    VPR has been shown to be effective for a select group of patients who have both the equipment and technological literacy to engage in it. Although it will not replace traditional face to face PR, it will continue be a vital method to enable continued access and prevent service interruption in the future.\n\n    References\n\n    Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Report (2020) Global strategy of the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. www.goldcopd.org 2020 [Google Scholar]\n\n    Knox L, Dunning M, Davies CA et al (2019) Safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of virtual pulmonary rehabilitation in the real world.

Patients' GOLD classification varied; GOLD 1 = 27%, GOLD 2 = 23%, GOLD 3 = 23%, GOLD 4 = 9%, differential diagnosis = 18%.\n\n    Of the 42 questionnaires issued, 23 were returned, representing each classification group. 100% reported receiving enough notice of their appointment and were \"very satisfied\" (77%) or \"satisfied\" (23%) with the service (Fig. 1). 92% of replies reported attending their appointment and Fig. 1 also reports the reasons for not attending their appointment (N = 1).\n\n    This information is positive that patients are subjectively reporting their satisfaction with the service.

Access to pulmonary testing has been limited internationally2,3,4 and locally. We aim to assess what percentage of patients attending our hospital with COPD have had Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) or spirometry.\n\n    The respiratory consultants in St. John's hospital daily inpatient ward census was reviewed for April 2021. Patients were selected if they had COPD in their problem list. Charts were retrieved and checked for documented PFT or spirometry results.\n\n    N = 21 patients were selected with diagnosis of COPD; 9 of them were admitted with infective exacerbation of COPD (IECOPD). Of the 21 patients with COPD in the problem list, 33%(7) had had PFTs/spirometry documented in the past. Of the 9 patients admitted with IECOPD, 44% (4) had PFTs/spirometry documented in the past.\n\n    More than half of the patients admitted with IECOPD and two thirds of patients with a labelled diagnosis of COPD had no record of pulmonary function tests.

Ireland has one of the highest rates of allergic asthma internationally and identifying aeroallergens may help improve symptom control (1,2). IgE sensitization testing when used in combination with a comprehensive allergy history can be used in this identification[3]. To date there is no published data on the prevalence of sensitization to aeroallergens in Ireland.\n\n    We sampled the population of patients that had specific IgE to aeroallergens at St Vincent's University Hospital (SVUH) and compared our results to the Specific IgE data available for the NHANES cohort[4].\n\n    From January to April 2019, 1,830 RAST specific IgE to inhaled allergens tests were performed in SVUH, of which 344 (19%) were positive (> 0.35 IU/L). NHANES reported positivity of 44.6% in their population.\n\n    At SVUH, specific IgE to house dust mite was the most commonly performed (18.6%), followed by cat dander (16.9%), dog dander (16.8%), grass mix (16.1%) and Aspergillus (15.2%). The least commonly tested were weed mix (1.3%), silver birch (1.2%), and moulds (0.9%).\n\n    Comparing the positivity between SVUH and the NHANES, similar positivity was found for cat (14.2% vs 13%) and dog (13.7% vs 12%), while differences were found for house dust mite (36.4% vs 18.5), grass mix (26.9% vs 16.8%,) and aspergillus (9.3% vs 6.5%).\n\n    In conclusion, positivity to aeroallergens was lower at SVUH compared to the NHANES epidemiologic cohort. However, similarities in positivity were found for some indoor allergens between both populations.\n\n    References\n\n    Tormey V, Lee-Brennan C, Conlon N et al (2018) HSE National Laboratory Handbook: Laboratory testing for Total IgE and Specific IgE, Version 1\n\n    http://www.beaumont.ie/media/Guideline11.pdf\n\n    Kabir Z, Manning PJ, Holohan J, Goodman PG, Clancy L (2011) Prevalence of symptoms of severe asthma and allergies in Irish school children: an ISAAC protocol study, 1995-2007.

Guidelines advocate screening all people with airflow obstruction, cryptogenic liver disease, difficult-to-control asthma and first-degree relatives of those affected. The most common deficiency-causing mutation in Ireland is the S mutation (Glu264Val, rs17580), with 1 in 10 Irish individuals affected. This is one of the highest allele frequencies in Europe. The S mutation causes a mild plasma deficiency and S heterozygotes (MS phenotype) are not at risk of disease. However, the clinical characteristics of individuals homozygous for S (SS phenotype) are not well described (1).\n\n    We evaluated the characteristics of a cohort of individuals diagnosed with the SS phenotype attending the national centre of expertise for AATD at Beaumont Hospital.\n\n    43 individuals with the SS genotype were included in our analysis. Baseline demographics, PFT results and co-morbidities were recorded for each person.\n\n    Our study demonstrated that the prevalence of lung and liver disease is high in individuals with the SS phenotype referred to our clinic. Our data suggests that increased vigilance may be required in the management of the SS phenotype.\n\n    Reference\n\n    1.

Clinical features of the rare IZ Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency genotype\n\n    M Herron, D Fraughen, T Carroll, C Gunaratnam, NG McElvaney\n\n    Irish Centre for Genetic Lung Disease, RCSI Education and Research Centre, Beaumont Hospital\n\n    The National Alpha-1 Targeted Detection Programme was introduced in Beaumont Hospital, Ireland in 2004. Since its introduction 7,786 cases of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency have been identified in Ireland. The most common genotypes are MZ, MS, SZ and ZZ. However, serum deficiency and/or clinical suspicion has led to the identification of rarer genotypes, such as the I allele, which is less well understood. The extent of lung and liver disease in the IZ genotype requires clarification.\n\n    Since 2004, 24 IZ patients have been identified. This represents 0.001% of tests. The majority were referred for diseases related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, rather than family screening. The mean alpha-1 level at diagnosis was 0.65 g/dL (range 0.49 - 1.06 g/dL). Half of those tested were female. The average age at diagnosis was 49 (range 12:73). Gender had no influence on the age at diagnosis. Abnormal spirometry was seen in smokers only.\n\n    From our data the IZ phenotype appears to represent moderate risk state akin to MZ and SZ genotypes.\n\n    5.32 Rare Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Variants in Ireland\n\n    T.

McElvaney1\n\n    1 Alpha-1 Foundation Ireland, RCSI Education & Research Centre, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9\n\n    2 Department of Biochemistry, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9\n\n    3 Department of Biochemistry and Clinical Genetics, University of Pavia, Italy\n\n    AAT deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene. It can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease and panniculitis. Over 200 SERPINA1 mutations exist in addition to the well described Z mutation (p.Glu342Lys). AATD continues to be under-diagnosed in Ireland despite its high prevalence.\n\n    21,000 individuals have been screened for AATD following ATS/ERS guidelines as part of a HSE-funded national targeted detection programme. AAT quantification is by turbidimetry and AAT phenotyping is by isoelectric focusing. Rare SERPINA1 mutations are identified by DNA sequencing.\n\n    We identified a large number of rare AAT mutations including I, F, Null (Q0), Etokyo, Mmalton, Mwurzburg, Plowell, Smunich, Xchristchurch, and Zbristol. The I mutation (p.Arg39Cys) is most common with 182 cases, with 85 cases of the F mutation (p.Arg223Cys). The most common severe mutation is Mmalton (p.Phe52del, 15 cases). In addition, 7 novel mutations were identified, including the novel Null mutations Q0dublin and Q0cork. The rare intronic Null mutation, Q0porto was also identified in 3 cases.\n\n    Rare mutations were detected in 1.5% of individuals screened with many causing profound serum AAT deficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach to AATD that includes phenotyping, genotyping and if necessary, DNA sequencing.\n\n    6. SLEEP/NIV\n\n    6.1 Assessing the Burden of Undiagnosed OSA in Patients Hospitalised with COVID-19\n\n    Cara M Gill, Laura M Piggott, Aoife Carolan, Liam Townsend, Peter Coss, Orla Gavin, Alanna Martin, Rebecca McLoughlin, Tracey Matthews, Ciaran Bannan, Parthiban Nadarajan, Barry Kennedy, Brian D Kent\n\n    St James' Hospital, Dublin 8\n\n    There are numerous risk factors common to Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) and morbidity and mortality from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n    The primary aim of this study is to assess the incidence of undiagnosed OSA in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The secondary aim is to assess the influence of OSA on morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.\n\n    This is a prospective, observational study. A consecutive cohort of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were invited to participate. Patients completed sleep health questionnaires and underwent home sleep testing (HST) using the WatchPAT novel diagnostic device.\n\n    Mean age of participants (n = 17) was 64 years, with 64.7% male and mean body mass index (BMI) of 29.55  6.25. 94% of patients had HST suggestive of OSA, with moderately-severe disease identified in 56%. Patients admitted to ICU had higher mean Apnea-Hypopnea Indices (pAHI) (21.95  19.85) than those on wards (15.3  10.3). Patients with at least moderate OSA had lower mean fatigue scores (14.5  3.5) than those without (18.5  3.5). Similarly, patients with pAHI > 15 had lower mean Epworth scores (5.5  1.5) than those with pAHI < 15 (16.5  2.5).\n\n    This highlights the prevalence of undiagnosed OSA in this population. Fatigue may be independent of OSA severity. OSA is a confounding factor in COVID-19 morbidity.\n\n    6.2 An Audit of Non Invasive Ventilation Services in Cork University Hospital and a Comparison to the BTS Adult NIV Audit Report 2019\n\n    Maeve O'Grady1, Annemarie Fitzgerald1, Avril Hallahan1, Siobhan Healy 1, Dr. Des Murphy2, Dr. Mike Henry2\n\n    1 Physiotherapy Dept, Cork University Hospital\n\n    2 Dept of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital\n\n    In 2020 the physiotherapy department in CUH carried out a 2 month audit of all acute NIV services. A data collection tool, based on that used for the BTS Adult NIV Audit 2019, was used.\n\n    NIV in CUH is provided in multiple settings, by multiple teams. The aim was to establish areas to be improved upon and to benchmark against an internationally recognised guideline and a large multicentre audit (BTS 2019). Results were compared to the BTS Audit results and recommendations outlined in the BTS/ICS guideline 2016.\n\n    There were aspects of NIV provision in CUH that compared favourably to the BTS audit results. The number of patients discharged home off NIV was above that reported in the BTS audit and the overall mortality of patients commenced on NIV in CUH was comparable to the BTS results.\n\n    There were however areas where CUH did not consistently meet recommended standards. Documentation of prescribed settings and an escalation plan and the taking of an ABG within 2 h of commencing NIV were suboptimal. Timely initiation of NIV following an indicating ABG was again suboptimal.\n\n    An NIV pathway has been developed in CUH and these audit results will inform focus areas during pathway implementation.\n\n    6.3 To Review the Prevalence and Under Recognition of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea in Octogenarians\n\n    Dr Liam Doherty, Dr Paul Gallagher, Dr Niamh Moloney\n\n    Bons Secours Hospital Cork, Ireland\n\n    Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is characterised by heavy snoring, witness apnoea and excessive daytime somnolence. The reported prevalence of OSA in octogenarians is 13-33% (1-3) yet few patients > 80 are referred for evaluation. This could be attributed to under-recognition, lack of perceived relevance or assuming octogenarians do poorly on CPAP therapy. Aims: 1. Determine referral rate for OSA evaluation in octogenarians. 2. Demonstrate CPAP efficacy in octogenarians. Methods: A retrospective database review of sleepstudy outcomes from patients > 80 years in Bons-Secours Cork Sleep Lab 2006-2021. Study population: adults > 80 years referred for sleepstudy. Results: 3771 patients were referred for OSA investigation, only 63 (1.6%) were > 80 years and only 17 (27%) were community referrals. 22 female (35%). OSA was present in 88% of the elderly cohort with a mean age (+- SD) 82 years. 46% had a successful CPAP trial at 1 month with average post-CPAP AHI was 6.5 compared to 28.1 pre-CPAP. At 1 year, 3 were lost to follow-up, remaining participants showed a 95% success rate of CPAP therapy. Conclusion: Sleepstudy referrals in octogenarians are very rare despite significant subjective improvement in quality-of-life and objective improvement in AHI score pre & post CPAP. The suggestion is an ageist approach to OSA investigation. Further analysis is needed with larger sample size, more complete follow-up and multivariable-adjusted linear regression analysis.\n\n    References\n\n    Glasser M, Bailey N, McMillan A, Goff E, Morrell M (2011) Sleep apnoea in older people.

High Risk included those on FiO2 > 60%, flowrate > 50 l/min, PEEP > 10 and IPAP > 12. The CSP Treatments performed and further care provided to escalate the care of the patient was documented.\n\n    Out of a population of 60 patients, 68% (41/60) were referred for Physiotherapeutic review due to a change in the Early Warning Score (EWS). The most frequently provided CSP Treatment included arterial blood gas sampling (56%); Initial NIV/HFOT set up (63%); FiO2 changes made (66%); ceiling of care discussion with team (51%) and NIV/HFOT settings changes (68%). To further escalate care for these patients, the CSP Physiotherapist requested Anaesthetic Review in 50% of these cases and only 17% of these 60 patients were admitted to Intensive Care.\n\n    Hospital Outcome for these High Risk Patients, 58% were discharged home and 40% had an inpatient mortality outcome. Of those admitted to Intensive Care (n = 10), 60% were discharged home and 40% died.\n\n    Clinical Specialist Respiratory Physiotherapists are valuable team members in preventing deterioration in a High Risk Non Invasive Ventilation / High Flow Oxygen Therapy Respiratory patient.

Sleep studies where among top 5 procedures for elective hospitalisation in 2016. Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, there has been a shift towards home Limited Sleep Studies (LSS) which are widely accepted for OSA diagnosis. They are, however resource intensive and can be challenging for patients. WatchPAT is a wrist-based device which utilised peripheral arterial signal, heart rate, oximetry, actinography, body position, snoring and chest motion to provide AHI, RDI, ODI & Sleep Time for OSA diagnosis. WatchPAT is clinically validated, with an 89% correlation with PSG. To date, it has not been compared to Limited Sleep Studies.\n\n    We preformed 38 simultaneous home Limited Sleep Studies and WatchPAT analysis (13 female, age 50 years  12 years) recruited from our Sleep Clinic. Thirty six WatchPAT studies were diagnostic and 38 LSS. Mean AHI by LSS was 21  23 events per hour, with 6 normal studies, 7 with mild, 12 moderate and 15 with severe OSA. Correlation between LSS and WatchPAT AHI, RDI and ODI is 0.81, 0.80 and 0.74, p < 0.001 respectively.\n\n    We found the WatchPAT device is accurate for home diagnosis of OSA in a Sleep Clinic population.\n\n    6.6 A Retrospective review of the diagnostic value of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Stop-Bang Questionnaire in a regional Sleep Medicine Clinic\n\n    Emily O'Reilly1, Hammad Danish1, Catherine Hanlon1, Filipe Afonso1, John Kiely1\n\n    1 Respiratory Department, Mallow General Hospital, Co. Cork\n\n    This review aimed to assess the role of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the STOP-BANG (SB) questionnaire in triaging referrals to a regional specialist sleep clinic. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is highly prevalent, but remains both underdiagnosed and undertreated. The ESS and SB are common OSA assessment tools however their ability to help stratify patients requiring priority investigation is uncertain.\n\n    This retrospective review analysed records of public patients reviewed in a regional sleep medicine clinic in 2020. Gender, Apnoea-hyponea index (AHI), ESS and SB were analysed. Patients were compared using an AHI >= 15 as the cut-off due to the clinical practice of prescribing CPAP at this score. SB scores were categorised as 0-4 (low-intermediate risk), and 5-8 (high risk). ESS was categorised 0-10 and >= 11.\n\n    One hundred sixty patients were identified. SB was associated with a higher AHI score when examined as both a continuous and categorical (0-4 vs 5-8) variable, both (p < 0.001). SB strongly correlated with AHI (r = 0.638, p =  < 0.001) but ESS did not correlate with AHI (r = 0.051, p = 0.518). SB only correlated weakly with ESS (r = 0.175, p = 0.027).\n\n    SB has significantly superior correlation with AHI and should assist in prioritisation of referred patients for respiratory sleep assessment.\n\n    6.7 Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source- is OSA a contributing factor?\n\n    Toland S1, McEvoy K1, Stewart L1, McGowan A1, Guilfoyle P2, Dolan E2, Cormican L1\n\n    1. Department of Respiratory and Sleep Diagnostics, Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15\n\n    2. Department of Stroke Medicine, Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15\n\n    Embolic stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS) is a type of ischaemic stroke defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources. ESUS accounts for about 1 in 6 ischemic strokes. Obstructive sleep apnoea, a form of sleep-disordered breathing, is associated with multiple major stroke risk factors including hypertension and atrial fibrillation, but it is also an independent risk factor for stroke.\n\n    We conducted a prospective study assessing 11 patients in Connolly Hospital admitted with a diagnosis of ESUS who underwent sleep studies between January and August 2021. All of these patients underwent a full stroke workup prior to their sleep study including CT brain, MRI brain, Echocardiogram, Carotid dopplers, Holter monitor and a full blood panel.\n\n    Of the 11 patients, 7 (63.6%) of the patients were female with a median age of 63. All 11 patients (100%) had an AHI (Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index) on their sleep study consistent with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). The median AHI observed was 16.5, with 4 patients (36%) in the mild category (AHI 5-15/hour), 4 (36%) in the medium category (AHI 15-30/hour) and 3 (27.2%) falling into the severe category (AHI > 30/hour)\n\n    6.8 Retrospective Comparison of Traditional Face to Face Clinical Physiologist Led Consultant Supervised PAP Review Clinic and Clinical Physiologist Led Consultant Supervised Virtual PAP Review Clinic\n\n    A.Bukhari, K.McEvoy, L.Stewarts, A.McGowan,, J. Faul, L.Cormican,\n\n    Respiratory and Sleep Diagnostics Department, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    A retrospective study of 423 patients divided as 248 followed traditional Face to Face Clinic and 175 patients followed by Virtual Clinic between November 2016 and April 2021.\n\n    The COVID 19 pandemic forced changes in the delivery of our PAP service for OSA patients.\n\n    A new Virtual Clinic service is delivered by Clinical Physiologist, Supervised by Consultant, in which the patient is contacted virtually, assessed and advised by the Clinical Physiologist, then subsequently individually reviewed with the supervising Consultant. The traditional clinic was a face to face review by the Clinical Physiologist then subsequently individually reviewed with the supervising Consultant.\n\n    Compliance and Adherence were the primary outcome of this study.\n\n    ESS on treatment, number of patients seen in clinic was the secondary outcome.\n\n    The demographic of the two groups were comparable including BMI, ESS, STOP/BANG Score, Neck Circumference, Waist to Hip Ratio.\n\n    There were minor non significant differences were seen in Mallampati Score, AHI, PLM index, Arousal Index, RDI and severity of OSA.\n\n    We found that patients followed up in the Virtual Clinic had better compliance and adherence.\n\n    The ESS on treatment was also better in the Virtual clinic group ( 6.08 v 3.44 / 24).\n\n    Total number of patients seen per clinic was similar in both groups ( 10) with multiple advantages including optimal utilisation of staff time and expertise.\n\n    Conclusion: Virtual Clinic are at least non inferior to traditional Face to face Clinic in the follow up of patients on PAP for OSA. They may actually be better.\n\n    We recommend that all PAP review clinics should transform into Clinical Physiologist Led Consultant Supervised Virtual Clinics.\n\n    6.9 The Role of a Virtual Sleep Clinic in Reducing Sleep Waiting times in a Tertiary Referral Centre\n\n    Eleanor Cronin1, Christina D Campbell1, Daisy O'Connor1, Thomas Kane1, Richard Costello1, Imran Sulaiman1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin\n\n    In 2020 the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to restructuring of many respiratory services, with a consequent increase in waiting times. In response to this, a virtual sleep clinic was formed at our centre.\n\n    Triaged referrals were sent directly for sleep studies, if diagnostic for moderate/severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a phone call and commencement of treatment followed. After three months of treatment, following virtual consultation, if the individual was adherent and had a treatment response, they were discharged to community follow-up.\n\n    We analysed data from patients referred to the sleep service between 2016 and 2020. We compared waiting list times, results of limited sleep studies (LSS) as well as time to treatment.\n\n    In 2020 the mean time to LSS was 7 months, compared to 11, 17 and 22.5 months in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively. Also in 2020, the time to result was 3 months, compared to 6.7, 11 and 16 months in 2019, 2018 and 2017. While time to treatment from LSS was 7 months in 2020, compared to 11 months in 2018.\n\n    Changes in work practices in our hospital, including utilisation of virtual consultations has improved waiting times for the diagnosis and instigation of treatment for OSA.\n\n    6.10 Domiciliary Sleep Study Testing During COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n    M Walsh, M Talty, D Nash, S Walsh, F Gargoum\n\n    Respiratory Department, Galway University Hospitals\n\n    During the COVID-19 pandemic, our centre began using WatchPAT devices, measuring peripheral arterial tone as a surrogate marker for sleep disordered breathing (SDB), to perform limited sleep studies. A retrospective review of studies undertaken until 01/12/2020 was performed to evaluate results.\n\n    50 patients were reviewed. Mean age was 53 years and 38 were male. Average time since referral was 13 months, mean wait time for home sleep apnoea testing (HSAT) approximately 1 month. 44/47 recorded had a STOP-BANG >= 3. Mean Epworth Sleepiness Score 9. Mean number of co-morbidities 2.5. Mean BMI 34 kg/m2. Four patients had an uninterpretable or failed study. 38 studies were diagnostic for OSA requiring inpatient follow-up, 13 of which were severe, requiring Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP).\n\n    The implications of this are that this domiciliary service has shown to be adequate at diagnosing sleep apnoea in those with a high-pre-test probability, with notably reduced wait times, subject to availability of devices. Given limited inpatient resources and an ongoing pandemic, WatchPAT can provide an important resource in the first steps of managing OSA.\n\n    6.11 Non-invasive ventilation for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, a quality improvement project\n\n    Folliard A, Ridge P, Leitmann M, Bajaar E, Gavin D, Rooney CP, Mokoka MC\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mayo University Hospital, Co. Mayo\n\n    The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the treatment acute respiratory failure has proven to limit the need of intubation, duration of hospital admission and mortality (Ferrer, et al.). We conducted a quality improvement project, and the global aim was to improve quality of care for patients presenting with AHRF associated with AECOPD. The smart aims were to ensure that every patient with AHRF receives evidenced based standardised treatment and to improve access to the respiratory specialist service.\n\n    A quality improvement NIV team was established, and 2-weekly meetings were held. Process mapping was used, and baseline data gathered to understand the complexities of our current system. Subsequently, SMART aims and driver diagrams were developed. A respiratory nurse attended the emergency department and the wards to screen for patients who were commenced on NIV for AHRF.\n\n    Process mapping demonstrated the need to standardise the prescription process for NIV and ensure treatment is in line with evidence-based practice. The NIV prescription sticker was introduced to standardise treatment. This change idea will be tested prospectively using the PDSA cycle.\n\n    Reference\n\n    Ferrer M, Torres A (2020) Non-invasive Ventilation and High-Flow Nasal Therapy Administration in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jul 28].

Griffith; CP. Rooney; MC. Mokoka\n\n    Mayo University Hospital (MUH), Castlebar, Co. Mayo\n\n    Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) use in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a ward based NIV unit is effective and reduces the need for tracheal intubation (Plant etal). To ensure a standardised treatment approach for patients admitted with hypercapnic respiratory failure, NIV guideline was developed in MUH. We sought to assess the awareness of these guidelines amongst non-respiratory NCHDs, those whom in practise, commence the majority of NIV support out of hours.\n\n    An online anonymised questionnaire was administered to 42 medical NCHDs. The response rate was 45%. Of the respondents, 32% of individuals didn't feel confident recognising those who require BiPAP, 53% didn't feel confident prescribing initial settings and 37% didn't feel confident adjusting ventilator pressures. 32% of the respondents were aware of the local NIV protocol, however, only 2 individuals knew how to access the protocol. Participants were asked initial NIV pressures as per MUH guidelines only 26% supplied the correct answer.\n\n    The audit highlights poor awareness of MUH NIV guidelines amongst NCHDs which could impact poorly on management of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Promotion of a greater awareness of the NIV guidelines is required at our institution.\n\n    Reference\n\n    Plant PK, Owen JL, Elliott MW (2000) Early use of non-invasive ventilation for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on general respiratory wards: a multi-centre randomised controlled trial.

Gray1, S. Shelley1, J. Brady1, R. Kennedy1, N. Nyambe1, P Nadarajan1\n\n    1Respiratory Assessment Unit (RAU), St James' Hospital, Dublin 8\n\n    NIV has been shown to improve survival rates in acute respiratory failure however NIV in stable hypercapnia COPD patients is less studied but potentially may improve clinical symptoms, admissions and survival1.\n\n    The implementation of NIV and follow-up in this patient group is disjointed and uncoordinated in St James hospital. We decided to audit the current patients prescribed domiciliary NIV.\n\n    Sixty-two (62) patients were identified as having home NIV. Forty-four (44) of these patients had a diagnosis of COPD. Information was gathered using the electronic patient record (EPR).\n\n    The audit results showed 6 (9.7%) of patients had a diagnosis of asthma, 10 (16.1%) had no recorded Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) on the EPR prior to commencing domiciliary NIV. Of those with a diagnosis of COPD that had an ABG done 4 (9.1%) did not show hypercapnia and 41 (93.2%) had an ABG and respiratory follow-up however the timing of this was haphazard and ranged from months to years.\n\n    A more structured and standardised approach is needed in the care of COPD patients commencing home NIV. This review has prompted a larger scale quality improvement project to standardise domiciliary NIV care in line with international guidelines.\n\n    Macrea, M., Oczkowski S., et al.

Armagh. BT63 5QQ\n\n    Pneumomediastinum is a rare complication of all forms of ventilatory support. The pathogenesis is due to alveolar rupture secondary to Barotrauma usually in lungs with reduced compliance.[1] We describe a case series of 18 patients with severe covid pneumonitis requiring Respiratory CPAP or Intubation & Ventilation in an ICU setting. All had evidence of pneumomediastinum with 7 having pneumothorax requiring intercostal drain insertion.\n\n    Results: 14 were male (age range 36-70; mean 53.3), 4 female (range 61-70; mean 66.3). All but 2 were initially treated with CPAP on the Respiratory unit with PEEP 8-10 cm H20 depending on sex, body habitus & initial response. A maximum PEEP of 12 was used for several patients with high BMI. 11 were escalated to the Intensive Care Unit (9 intubated). Timelines have been reviewed for each case with duration of CPAP, PEEP & Intubation schedules reviewed. 50% of cases resulted in mortality.\n\n    Learning: High PEEP is a risk factor with imaging on admission defining extent of pneumonitis, emphysema & bullae with potential risk stratification. Management is largely supportive with a rapid taper of pressure support.\n\n    Conclusions: Balancing appropriate ventilation whilst minimising risk of air leaks with covid pneumonitis is a challenge and we have demonstrated a higher proportion of injury in male patients and those with severe covid with reduced compliance and elasticity.\n\n    References\n\n    1.

The understanding and management of post COVID-19 sequelae is still evolving. A new physiotherapy service was established to identify and employ appropriate management to reduce the severity and duration of these sequelae.\n\n    Referrals were accepted from the Post COVID-19 clinic respiratory consultants, COVID-19@Home Remote Monitoring service and physiotherapy colleagues. A holistic assessment was completed with baseline individualised patient reported outcome measures.\n\n    826 patients successfully discharged following hospital admission with COVID-19 were offered a Post COVID-19 clinic appointment. 95 (11.5%) were identified with persistent post COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n    Prior to physiotherapy assessment, symptom duration ranged from 18 days to 16 months. 19 (34.5%) of the assessed (n = 55) patients were healthcare workers. 16 (29.1%) patients were unable to return to work with 27 (49.1%) returning to a modified level.\n\n    Fatigue (n = 43, 78.2%) and breathlessness (n = 33, 60%) were subjective primary issues. 34 (61.8%) had a Fatigue Severity Score of >= 30/63. Breathing pattern dysfunction was identified in 19 (34.5%). 23 (41.8%) were offered mental health support referrals. A persistent dry cough was identified in 9 (16.4%). 3 (5.5%) patients presented with a resting tachycardia. Discharged patients required a median of 6.5 physiotherapy interventions.\n\n    Post COVID-19 sequelae were identified in 11.5% of discharged COVID-19 patients from Connolly Hospital with fatigue and breathlessness the primary issues. Identified cardiorespiratory issues included breathing pattern dysfunction, persistent dry cough and resting tachycardia. Fatigue was characterised by a disabling nature with widespread lifestyle and occupational modification.\n\n    7.4 6 month Patient Profile of the Connolly Hospital COVID-19@Home Monitoring Service\n\n    Sinead Delahunty1, Sarah Nolan1, Prof. Liam Cormican1,2, Ciara Feeney1, Helen Johnston1, Aisling McGowan1, Louise Brien1, Megan McGrane1, Catherine Devine1 and Ciaran Browne1\n\n    1Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15; 2RCSI, Dublin 2\n\n    The study aimed to provide a six month insight into the service outcomes and user demographics of the COVID-19 at Home (CO@H) Remote Monitoring Service in Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown. The service was founded to optimise timely discharge, appropriately escalate acute deterioration, minimise patient mortality and enhance acute recovery following COVID-19 infection.\n\n    Collation and analysis of patient data from both inpatient and CO@H monitoring periods. Utilised a bespoke database and patients logging data four times daily via patientMpower technology.\n\n    126 patients were enrolled onto the programme, 123 of which completed the programme with 0% mortality. The patient cohort ranged from 20-88 years with 53.2%:46.8% male:female. 8% of patients (9) developed a PE pre-enrolment on the service. One patient who was re-admitted developed a PE during their re-admission. 8% of patients who completed the CO@H programme required re-admission to hospital. Upon discharge, resting tachycardia (>= 100 bpm) was found in 16.3% of patients who completed the service (20/123) and 21% required referral to post COVID-19 physiotherapy (26/123).\n\n    CO@H is a safe and effective method to monitor patients at home. Patients had their care appropriately escalated in the case of deterioration. Early access to Post COVID-19 physiotherapy services was provided for timely chronic disease management. At monitoring completion, resting tachycardia was evident within this patient group.\n\n    7.5 Tocilizumab - real world data from a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\n    Grace Kavanagh1, Emily O'Reilly1, Oisin O Murchu1, Laura Walsh2, Hisham Ibrahim2, Christina Raykha3, Kevin Deasy3, Terence M O'Connor2, Kenneth Bolger3, Michael Henry1\n\n    1 Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Co.

O' Beirne\n\n    St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin\n\n    Long COVID syndrome is defined as 'signs and symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks that are not explained by an alternate diagnosis'. It is thought that between 10-50% of survivors may develop Long COVID, with many experiencing ongoing symptoms such as, dyspnoea, cough and fatigue.\n\n    A retrospective audit of patients attending the Pulmonary Laboratory at St Vincent's University Hospital was conducted. All pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were carried out according to the ATS/ERS 2005. Data (as percentage, mean +- SD, as appropriate) from the first 100 patients is presented in Table 9.\n\n    Gas exchange (DLCO) and inspiratory muscle strength (MIP) were the most reduced lung function parameters. The results of this retrospective audit of Irish patients is consistent with current published data. Further research is required to identify cause and treatments for this new syndrome.\n\n    7.7 The effects of a 6-week virtual COVID19 recovery programme on exercise capacity, fatigue scores and quality of life in individuals recovering from COVID-19\n\n    K.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a 6-week virtual exercise rehabilitation programme in people recovering from COVID-19.\n\n    Participants referred from a post-COVID-19 multidisciplinary clinic were included if presenting with persistent dyspnoea, reduced exercise capacity and/or reduced physical function. Pre and post programme assessments (6-Minute Walk Distance(6MWD), Chalder Fatigue Score(CFQ-11) and Short-Form 36 Questionnaire(SF-36)) were completed in person.\n\n    Forty participants were assessed between April and August 2021, and 5 participants have completed post programme assessment. Results demonstrate significant increases in 6MWD distance (n = 5) (pre: mean distance 439.2 m +- 66; post: mean distance 530 m +- 67) as well as reduced dyspnoea scores (mean peak Borg pre: 2.8 +- 1.9; Borg post: 1.4 +- 1.6). There were no adverse effects on fatigue levels (mean CFQ-11 17 +- 4.5 pre; mean CFQ-11 14 +- 6.08 post). SF-36 scores improved (mean 402 +- 174 pre; mean 496.5 +- 184 post) with participants showing improvement in physical functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and pain domains.\n\n    These preliminary findings suggest a physiotherapist delivered virtual post-COVID-19 recovery programme can improve exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life without exacerbating fatigue.\n\n    7.8 Tocilizumab Use In 44 Hospitalized Patient With Severe Covid-19 Pneumonia, A Single Centre Observational Study\n\n    Abdul Qadeer, Fearghal Bannon, Ampazis Dimitrios, Eamon Dolan, Liam Cormican\n\n    Department of Respiratory, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Dublin 15\n\n    BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a dysregulated immune response and hyperinflammation, a key mediator of which is cytokine IL-6. Tocilizumab (TCZ) a humanised anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, may be a possible adjunctive therapy in this context.\n\n    METHODS This is a single centre observational study of patients infected with COVID-19 who were treated with tocilizumab. 453 patients were admitted with covid 19 from the start of third surge of which 44 were identified for tocilizumab therapy by the following inclusion criteria: laboratory proven SARS-CoV-2 infection or high clinico-radiological suspicion of COVID-19 infection, CRS category C1, C2 and D, within 24 h of starting nasal high flow (NHF) oxygen with an Fi02 of 0.6 or greater, (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).\n\n    RESULTS: Data was collected from 44 patients who were severely ill with covid 19 infection and received tocilizumab. The study population of 27 men (61.3%) and 17 women (38.6%) and median age of 63 years (range 35-86). The mean BMI was 36 kg/m2 (range 29-48). The average Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 4. 11 (25%) patients progressed to intubation and in 33 (75%) patients oxygen requirement reduced. Thirty-seven (84%) patients were discharged, and seven (15.9%) patients died; thirteen out of thirty-seven patients needed admission to ICU and among them seven got mechanical intubation. The SOFA score for all patients in our study group range in between 2 to 6. On average we noticed oxygen wean off time were thirteen days with range (4 to 26 days). There is significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio at every three-day interval observed post tocilizumab treatment. In addition, out of thirteen ICU admissions eight(61.5%) got discharged with average stay of 17-20 days in ICU and other five patients died. There had been only five (13.5%) patients in our study group who had secondary infection (fungal) post tocilizumab. Interestingly, we found C-reactive proteins (CRP) value for twenty patients (45%) in our study group improved to normal ranges in 3 to 5 days.\n\n    Conclusion: This study supports the use of tocilizumab in critically ill COVID 19 patients (C1, C2 and D category on CRS) as it is safe, decreases progression of respiratory failure and had mortality benefits. CRP is a useful indicator of treatment response.\n\n    7.9 Risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Health-Care Workers\n\n    Ahmed Ahmed , Ali Elgaderi*, Suhail Basunaid**, Katherine Finan***\n\n    Department of Emergency Medicine\n\n    *Department of Internal Medicine\n\n    **Department of Respiratory Medicine, ***Head of Department of Respiratory Medicine\n\n    Sligo University Hospital, Sligo, Ireland\n\n    Aim:To understand transmission rates of COVID-19 among health-care workers in Sligo University Hospital, from March 2020 to December 2020.\n\n    Methods:A survey was sent to all health workers working in different wards in Sligo University Hospital. We obtained data from health-care workers regarding their specialty, Exposure to aerosol generating procedures, symptoms, source of transmission and whether or not SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was positive by them.\n\n    Results:The Survey was distributed in December 2020, and we got 118 responses. The biggest group of responders were health-care providers working in the emergency department (25.64%), followed by internal general medicine (23%), and nurses scattered in different wards (16.24%). There was 14.66% worked in ICU while the rest worked in other departments. About 88% worked with COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients, and 64.96%were involved in aerosol generating procedures. Of the 63 responders who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 13 (20.31%) tested positive for the virus.\n\n    Discussion and conclusion:It appears from the results that aerosol generating procedures are associated with increased risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care.\n\n    We will spread this survey nationally to compare the risk of transmission in different hospitals in Ireland. If findings were found to be significant, necessary recommendations will be relayed to concerned bodies to, review and adjust national guidelines accordingly.\n\n    Keywords: SARS-COV-1; SARS-COV-2; COVID-19 virus; coronavirus; detected; positive; aerosol generating procedures, PCR; healthcare workers; transmissio\n\n    7.10  Effects of non-invasive respiratory support on gas exchange and outcomes in COVID-19 outside the ICU\n\n    Gough, Ciara\n\n    University Hospital Galway\n\n    7.11 Effective Quality Care of patients with Severe COVID-19 on a Respiratory Ward\n\n    Burke E, Yunes A, Shah, M, Byrne T, Farmer G, McLoughlin H\n\n    Portiuncula University Hospital\n\n    Severe COVID -19 defined by the National Office of Clinical Audit as Care in an intensive Care Unit (ICU) or use of mechanical ventilation or discharge to hospice or death (NOCA 2020). Many patients with severe COVID not suitable for the ICU may not be included in statistical analysis therefore.\n\n    Retrospective study of patients admitted to the respiratory ward with Severe COVID 19 March 2020 to April 2021. Severe COVID classified as Covid Respiratory Category C (High flow Nasal Oxygen HFNO or CPAP therapy- ITS).\n\n    90 COVID-19 patients admitted to PUH audited. 25% DNAR status. 35 Severe COVID patients managed on Respiratory Ward using CPAP. 10 failed CPAP and intubated(29%). 25 ward CPAP survived to discharge. 5 ward CPAP deaths (20%). 12 ward patients HFNO up to FiO2 0.7.\n\n    CPAP hoods used to facilitate compliance. Well tolerated and preferred by many.\n\n    Many patients with Severe COVID-19 can be successfully managed on Respiratory Wards. The NOCA definition of Severe COVID should be amended to take this into account. Consideration should be given to additional funding for Respiratory Wards to reduce pressure on ICUs.\n\n    7.12 SingStrong for Long Covid: A singing and breathing pilot intervention for respiratory symptoms and general health in Long Covid: A mixed-methods study\n\n    Roisin Cahalan1,2, Sarah Mockler3,2\n\n    1 School of Allied Health, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.\n\n    2 Physical Activity for Health Research Cluster, Health Research Institute, Limerick, Ireland\n\n    3 Athlone Institute of Technology, WestMeath, Ireland\n\n    The authors have no conflict of interest.\n\n    This pilot study explored the efficacy of a breathing and singing programme (SingStrong for Long Covid (LC)) to address respiratory and other common LC symptoms. The 10-week bi-weekly online programme was comprised of a 45-min class of mindfulness, breathing retraining, vocal exercises and singing. Sessions were recorded for non-attenders and conducted by a trained vocal coach experienced in respiratory cohorts. Hospitalised/non-hospitalised persons with confirmed Covid diagnosis and persisting symptoms were invited to participate. Demographic and Covid-19 data, DePaul Symptom Questionnaire Short Form (DSQ- SF) and Covid 19 Yorkshire Rehab Screen (C19-YRS) questionnaires were collected at baseline. Questionnaires were re-administered post-intervention and focus groups were conducted. Of 27 (F = 23(85%)) participants recruited, data from 21 who completed at least ten (50%) classes were analysed. Participants showed significant pre-post intervention improvements in all breathlessness domains (at rest: p < 0.001; dressing: p = 0.01; stairs: p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.03), usual activities (p = 0.04), pain/disability (p = 0.03), voice quality (p = 0.01), and communication/cognition (p = 0.04). Pre-post number of instances meeting DSQ-SF criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) decreased by a net of nine cases (14.3%). No association between hospitalisation status and diagnosis of ME/CFS was identified. Qualitative feedback from eight participants was overwhelmingly positive with all reported breathing improvements.\n\n    7.13 Pulmonary Findings in Patients Post Mild/Moderate COVID-19\n\n    Helena Dias1, Jessica Oliveira1, Shekinah Navarro1, Mary Nagle1, Azhar Jahangir1, Alan Mulgrew1\n\n    1 Respiratory Department, Bon Secours Hospital Tralee\n\n    On March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. There is little knowledge related to alterations in pulmonary function in Post COVID-19 patients.\n\n    In the Respiratory Department at the Bon Secours Hospital Tralee, we carried out a retrospective study on 38 subjects diagnosed with Mild/Moderate COVID-19 Infection. From January to June 2021, Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) were performed at least 30 days after diagnosis of COVID-19. D-Dimers, Protein C-Reactive, radiological changes and bronchoscopy data were also documented. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of PFT abnormalities in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n    We present our experience of a growing data set of patients Post COVID-19. From the 38 subjects, 24 were female and 14 male with a mean age of 47 years old. The PFTs were performed in all subjects with an average time of 92 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\n    Of 38 patients, 26% (N = 10) of them had PFT abnormalities. 5 of these patients had pre-existing lung disease but there were no significant changes in PFT values Pre and Post COVID-19. The remaining 5 patients (13% of total number) without prior PFTs appeared to have abnormalities in lung function after COVID-19.\n\n    7.14 The impact of Covid-19 on the red flag respiratory pathway: An audit of the 2019 and 2020 patient red flag pathways\n\n    Cathal Donaghy, John Gill, Karen Harper, Martin Kelly, Ciaran King, Margaret McCloskey\n\n    Altnagelvin Hospital, Western Health and Social Care trust, Northern Ireland\n\n    This audit's purpose was to investigate the management of patients with lung cancer in 2019 compared to 2020 and assess what influence the Covid-19 pandemic may have had.\n\n    We audited the process of lung cancer management from initial presenting stage to available treatments. We looked at the distribution of treatments available in 2019 compared to 2020 and the number of days from presentation to treatment.\n\n    When auditing the mode of referrals to red flag respiratory in 2019 30% (65/216) were GP referrals compared to 33% (60/182) in 2020. Endobronchial Ultrasound biopsy remained the most used method for obtaining tissue across both years. The key discrepancy between 2019 and 2020 when obtaining tissue was with CT guided biopsy. 11.2% less patients were referred for this procedure in 2020. Changes between 2019 and 2020 regarding treatment options available were highlighted, such as in 2020 40% of patients underwent referral for palliative treatment compared to 14% in 2019 and 11.6% of patients in 2020 had been referred for radiotherapy treatment compared to 26.5% in 2019.\n\n    In conclusion, we can see variations in the red flag pathway between 2019 and 2020 because of Covid-19. A review of the 2021 data may further support this.\n\n    7.15 Prone-Positioning in Awake, Non-Intubated Patients with COVID-19 Hypoxemic Failure: A Single-Center Prospective Cohort Study\n\n    A Duncan1, D Halim1, A.Asis1, S Toland1, Khalid El Kholy1, I Sulaiman1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital\n\n    A surge in critically-ill patients with respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 has overwhelmed ICU capacity in many healthcare systems across the world1. Given significant resource limitations, less-invasive and inventive approaches such as prone-positioning (PP) of non-intubated patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure was implemented 2,3.\n\n    This is a prospective observational study. The aim is to evaluate the impact of awake PP at ward level on oxygenation levels of patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen.\n\n    The primary outcome is to evaluate the change in SpO2:FiO2 (SF) before and after PP. SF is compared in the participants who tolerated and those that did not tolerate PP. Secondary outcomes are assessment of risk-factors of treatment failure (requirement for ICU or death).\n\n    A total of 63 patients admitted to Beaumont Hospital between January and February of 2021 were recruited. 47 (74%) participants were reported as tolerating and 16 (26%) as non-tolerating. Table 10 shows baseline demographics. The mean change in SF in the tolerating group was 38 vs 16 non-tolerating. This was statistically significant (P < 0.001) with a mean difference of 22. A regression model was utilized to show SF ratio on admission, BMI and age are all significant and strong predictors for length of stay and treatment failure (R2 = 0.52, P < 0.05).\n\n    PP was associated with improvements in oxygenation parameters without any reported adverse events. A well-designed RCT testing the efficacy of PP in non-intubated COVID-19 patients is needed to give more robust evidence prior to widespread adoption of this practice.\n\n    References\n\n    Bellani G, Laffey JG, Pham T, Fan E, Brochard L, Esteban A et al (2016) Epidemiology, Patterns of Care, and Mortality for Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Intensive Care Units in 50 Countries.

Here we performed a retrospective review of Wave 1 (W1, March - May 2020) & Wave 3 (January 2021) of COVID-19 admissions: patient demographics, imaging, d-dimer levels & illness severity was recorded. Data collection is ongoing.\n\n    During W1, 318 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were admitted to Beaumont Hospital, and 222 during W3. Of these patients, 41 (13%) in W1 and 59 (27%) in W3 had a CT-pulmonary- angiogram (CTPA) to diagnose a PE (this compares to 35% internationally). There was a 46% positivity rate in W1 and 27.11% in W3. For those in ICU, 50% W3 & 55% in W1, 29% in W3, 40% in W1 on non-invasive-ventilation and 21% in W3 and 33% in W1 on ward level care had PEs. Of the PEs identified in W3, 68.75% were segmental and 75% bilateral. Radiographic evidence of right heart strain was noted in 43.75%. The overall incidence rate of PE was 5% in W1, compared to 7% in W3.\n\n    In this study, by W3 of the COVID19 pandemic the incidence rate of PE increased while the positivity rate decreased, consistent with increased awareness of PE in SARS-CoV-2 infection & increased level of CT imaging. This incidence rate is comparable to that reported internationally.\n\n    7.17 D-Dimer Levels and PE detection in Covid 19 patients admitted to Tallaght University Hospital\n\n    MR Kelly, R Trueick, P Donovan, MK Rana, M Kooblall, E Moloney, S Lane\n\n    Respiratory Department, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin 24\n\n    Studies have linked COVID 19 with increased risk of venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism. Abnormalities in coagulation profile including elevated d-dimer are a feature of early disease.\n\n    In this study we examined the number of COVID 19 patients with elevated d-dimer and the outcome of CTPA, if done. Data was collected retrospectively using HIPE records for patients admitted to Tallaght University Hospital from of January to June 2021. Inclusion criteria was any patient over age 17 with COVID 19 infection listed as a diagnosis on discharge.\n\n    Our review included total of 510 patients with COVID 19 infection. Of these, 390 (76%) had elevated d-dimer (> 0.42 ug/ml). 75 (15%) never had a d-dimer level checked and 45 (9%) had normal d-dimer levels. In total 258 (50%) patients underwent CTPA during the course of their admission, 36 of these were positive for PE.\n\n    Of the patients who had elevated d-dimers, 9% were diagnosed with PE. Overall, although the majority of patients with COVID 19 will have elevated d-dimers, it remains reasonable to proceed to CTPA if there is clinical suspicion.\n\n    7.18 Surge Two: therapeutic and mortality outcomes for COVID-19 in a District General Hospital\n\n    Helen Kerr1, John Gill2, Margaret McCloskey3, Rose Sharkey4, Martin Kelly5, Ciaran King6, Meave Boyle7, Patrick McShane8\n\n    Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry\n\n    Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, around 170,000 individuals have tested positive for the virus in Northern Ireland with 2,200 associated deaths. October 2020 saw Derry and Strabane have the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the UK. This study aimed to measure therapeutic and mortality outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19 between September 2020 and March 2021 in a district general hospital. All COVID-19 related discharges or deaths from COVID-19 wards and intensive care (ICU) were reviewed with a sample size of 647 patients. The created database comprised of discharge data, length of stay, use of steroids/remdesivir, use of higher respiratory support and inpatient mortality. The average length of stay was 11 days. Therapeutic outcomes demonstrated that 71% of patients received steroids and 39% received remdesivir. With regards to higher respiratory support:20% of patients required AIRVO and 16% required CPAP. ICU care was required for 8% of patients. Overall male mortality was 21% whilst female mortality was 16%. The data demonstrates that the majority of inpatients required oxygen therapy and steroids. Hospital admission was associated with higher mortality but overall mortality was in keeping with national mortality rates.\n\n    7.19 How do you manage a respiratory pandemic in a hospital with an emergency department but no critical care? One DGH's experience\n\n    M. McCall, C Hagan, A Livingstone, S. Moan, E. Hayes, D. McNicholl, A Green\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Daisy Hill Hospital, Newry, Southern Health & Social Care Trust\n\n    The COVID-19 pandemic has generated huge numbers of patients requiring hospital admission for supplemental oxygen therapy. A significant proportion of these patients will go on to require critical care input and advanced oxygen delivery techniques such as continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), non-invasive (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).\n\n    Often these patients deteriorate early and quickly, this poses challenges in regard to ensuring these patients are managed in appropriate care areas, this is a particular challenge when the emergency department and critical care are not located within the same hospital site.\n\n    In this situation we developed a protocol for guiding the management of these patients depending upon the patient's escalation status, their ceiling of treatment and their current level of hypoxemia measured objectively by the PF ratio.\n\n    This protocol is then used to guide patients into one of four groups.\n\n    Best supportive care, remaining in DGH\n\n    Active care up to and including NIV remaining in DGH\n\n    Active care up to and including IMV, P/F > 25, remains in DGH and monitored\n\n    Active care up to and including IMV, P/F < 25, Transferred to local hospital with ICU available.\n\n    We believe this protocol has functioned well and would be of interest to the Irish respiratory community which is comprised of many small DGH hospitals in a similar situation.\n\n    7.20 Predictors of worsening respiratory disease in COVID-19 positive post lung transplant recipients\n\n    E Nolan; S Winward; I Lawrie; S Towell; P Riddell; MA Murray\n\n    National Heart and Lung Transplant Unit, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin 7\n\n    Transplant recipients are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, concerns associated with suboptimal vaccine immunogenicity suggest an impaired protection from serious adverse events. In this study we assessed the incidence of COVID-19 infection amongst recipients in Ireland. We further identify risk factors associated with serious adverse outcomes amongst this population.\n\n    To date, 22 recipients have tested positive for COVID-19. Of these, 18 recipients were positive prior to vaccination rollout and a further 4 recipients were positive despite vaccination. Of patients with COVID-19, 67% required hospital admission. On presentation, the identification of radiographic changes, lymphopaenia, elevated serum LDH and ferritin conferred a worse outcome, specifically, the requirement for supplemental oxygenation and ventilator support.\n\n    Lung Transplant recipients have high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The completion of a standard vaccination course did not substantially reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 or death. Ongoing care during the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose many challenges in this cohort, and advice regarding continued preventative strategies to mitigate risk is required.\n\n    7.21 An insight into the technology literacy, service accessibility and service user satisfaction of the Connolly Hospital COVID-19@Home Monitoring Service\n\n    Sarah Nolan1, Sinead Delahunty1, Prof. Liam Cormican1,2, Ciara Feeney1, Helen Johnston1, Aisling McGowan1, Louise Brien1, Megan McGrane1, Catherine Devine1 and Ciaran Browne1\n\n    1Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15; 2RCSI, Dublin 2\n\n    The study aimed to provide an insight into the COVID-19 at Home (CO@H) Remote Monitoring Service design to promote tech literacy, service accessibility, patient satisfaction and reduce compliance barriers to prioritise a patient centred service.\n\n    Service design focused on technology literacy and equity of service. Data collated from referral and CO@H monitoring period. A ten question dichotomous style anonymous patient satisfaction survey was distributed. Weekly service team meetings ensured adaptation to service user needs.\n\n    Service users ranged from 20-88 years. 6 lived alone and 19 patients provided readings via text message due to lack of internet access or required a Next Of Kin (NOK) to log readings due to tech literacy issues. English was not the primary language of 64 patients. Of the 126 enrolled, 123 completed and 4 did not complete the programme (3 non-compliant and 1 inappropriate referral). Survey results displayed an extremely high patient satisfaction level.\n\n    Patient and carer education during service on-boarding was critical in maintaining patient compliance and meeting service user needs. Equitable service provision was ensured by allowing logging of readings via text message or NOK. An initial study limitation was that all service user materials and technology were provided in English. Equitable access to telehealth initiatives must be prioritised in service design.\n\n    7.22 COVID-19 - An Experience Within An Acute General Hospital\n\n    Helen O'Brien1, Alison Fahey2, Thomas Cahill1, Clarifil Flordeliza3, Emma O'Sullivan1\n\n    Department of Medicine, Wexford General Hospital\n\n    Department of Anaesthesia, Wexford General Hospital\n\n    Department of Nursing, Wexford General Hospital\n\n    Until 2021, patients requiring non-invasive ventilation were managed in an ICU setting in Wexford General Hospital (WGH). During the third wave of COVID-19 infections in Ireland in early 2021, Wexford General Hospital saw an unprecedented volume of admissions with respiratory failure requiring ICU level care.\n\n    Between January and March 2021 there were 222 admissions to hospital secondary to COVID-19. 42 (18.9%) patients required advanced oxygenation and 18 (8.1%) required ICU care. This is in comparison to 93 admissions in the entirety of 2020, with 13 patients requiring ICU care and no NIV managed at ward level.\n\n    In the first quarter of 2021, 42 patients required advanced oxygen therapy in the form of high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Of these 8 patients, who were considered for full escalation in the event of deterioration, were managed solely on the ward with CPAP therapy, thus preventing 8 ICU admissions. An admission and oxygen weaning protocol was designed and implemented to streamline patient care.\n\n    In total during this time 6 patients were transferred to ICUs in other clinical sites as a result of bed capacity.\n\n    7.23 Investigating the activity of an acute hospital's post-COVID19 physiotherapy service from April to August 2021\n\n    K.

Townsend3\n\n    1 Physiotherapy Department, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8\n\n    2 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8\n\n    3 Department of Infectious Diseases, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8\n\n    Little is known about the rehabilitation needs of those who are recovering from COVID-19. The aim of this study is to describe the activity of a post COVID-19 physiotherapy service in a large acute teaching hospital.\n\n    In May 2020, a post COVID-19 multidisciplinary clinic was established to provide follow-up care to both patients and staff members who tested positive for COVID-19. The physiotherapist's role at this weekly clinic is to assess patients' physical functioning during their recovery from COVID-19. The physiotherapy assessment includes collection of information on baseline/current exercise levels and return to work status as well as an evaluation of any persistent symptoms. Following assessment, a plan of care is developed.\n\n    Between April and August 2021, 117 patients were referred to the physiotherapy service. 20% (n = 24) were given advice on their recovery trajectory and education on returning to physical activity and discharged at the time of initial assessment. 21% (n = 25) were referred to community based services including post COVID-19 community rehabilitation. 34% (n = 40) were enrolled onto a 6-week virtual exercise programme. 24.5% (n = 28) were followed-up for 1:1 physiotherapy sessions for more individualised care.\n\n    As post COVID-19 rehabilitation models of care begin to emerge, this study will inform the follow-up rehabilitation needs of this new patient cohort.\n\n    7.24 Outcomes of Patients admitted with COVID pneumonia at 3 month follow up\n\n    Walsh S, O' Connor A, Uno M, Counihan I, Hassan T\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Co. Louth\n\n    7.25 A 3 months survey in the north-west of refusals versus partially Covid-19 vaccinated patients admitted during the 4 th  wave. Behavioural factors in the decision-making processes\n\n    Stanislav Tyulkin, MB BCh BAO*, Internal Medicine Trainee, Suhail Basunaid, MD**, Katherine Finan, MD**\n\n    *Department of General Internal Medicine in Sligo University Hospital\n\n    **Department of the Short Stay Unit Ward in Sligo University Hospital\n\n    ***Department of the Respiratory Ward in Sligo University Hospital, Mentor\n\n    Introduction: 4 major vaccines are being developed to control the Coronavirus 2019 disease beside the current measures and the social distancing. In the winter of 2021 Ireland started vaccinating against the coronavirus. Doubt to have the vaccine is an increasing recognized global phenomenon. This played a role in limiting people's desires for the vaccine and unfortunately this could itself be impacted by the epidemic. The definition given by the WHO for vaccine hesitancy is a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services. This complex context was influenced by factors such as convenience, smug-satisfaction, misinformation on social media, and confidence. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine, and its deployment among adults played an important rule among COVID-19 vaccine refusals.\n\n    Objective: The aim of this survey is to estimate the incidence of positive new cases among fully, partially or refused vaccinated, to know the major consequences of vaccine's rejection, how many of the refusals end up in the ICU, the indecision towards a vaccine against COVID-19, and if there is regret of doing that.\n\n    Materials and Methods: A survey will be submitted to the ITS congress based data collected of all admissions between the beginning of July and the end of September 2021. The collected data will be used to estimate the current refusals among the rest of COVID-19 admitted patients and the severity of the disease. There will be a supplementary part to link the type of vaccine among refusals.\n\n    Results: The results indicate that around 49% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated, with 28% undecided and 77% of individuals potentially were not willing to be vaccinated. The main variables that explained the probability of indecision were associated with the side effects, perceived benefits, decreased fear of contagion. Our analysis of hypothetical vaccine scenarios revealed that individuals preferred less risky vaccines in terms of fewer side effects, rather than effectiveness.\n\n    Conclusions: We discovered that it is necessary to formulate vaccination-promotion strategies among the anti-vaccine groups.\n\n    7.26 Characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients requiring non-invasive ventilation for management of COVID-19 pneumonia\n\n    Fiona O'Hannigan, Dee O'Flaherty, Catherine McGeoghegan, Breda Cushen\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9\n\n    Non-invasive ventilation(NIV) for the management of COVID-19 induced hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure was commonly employed during the pandemic. The characteristics of patients requiring NIV on a specialist respiratory unit and clinical outcomes were retrospectively examined.\n\n    The medical notes of ninety-three patients were reviewed. The mean age was 68 (14) years. The majority (60%) were male and 84% were overweight or obese. Multimorbidity was common (75%). All patients had a ceiling of care established; 57% for full escalation of care including intubation and 43% for ward-level care. Median time to NIV initiation was 2 days. NIV continued for > 72 h in 70% of patients. Overall 58% of patients recovered to discharge. Of those who survived, the median length of hospital stay was 15.5 (2-60) days.\n\n    Over 75% of patients for full escalation survived, 54% required intubation. Intubated patients had more pronounced hypoxaemia at hospital admission and prevalence of co-morbidity was greater.\n\n    NIV can be used effectively to manage respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia in the appropriate patient and setting. Additionally patients can successfully tolerate a prolonged duration of therapy. Identification of those most at-risk and early intensivist involvement is important to ensure timely escalation of treatment if required.\n\n    7.27 Potential for Increased Risk of Infection Following Tocilizumab Treatment in COVID-19\n\n    Dr Naoise Smyth, Mr Euan Smyth\n\n    Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry / University of Glasgow, Glasgow\n\n    Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor, is proven to improve survival and other clinical outcomes in COVID-19. However, increased risk of infection is a known and common side effect.\n\n    This study investigated the occurrence of post-treatment complications (i.e. infection) in patients treated with tocilizumab. We reviewed the electronic care records of all patients (n = 37) who were given tocilizumab in a five month period (January-March 2021), screening for documented infections, positive microbiology results and antibiotic prescriptions in the three months after treatment.\n\n    Results showed that 59.45% (n = 22) of patients given tocilizumab had evidence of infection in this period, with 40.90% of these patients having evidence of multiple infections. The most commonly identified source of infection was the respiratory tract (63.63% of patients with infection). An array of organisms were identified, the most common being coliforms (45.45% of infections).\n\n    These results appear to show that tocilizumab does carry an increased risk of bacterial and fungal infection after treatment. Some patients went on to develop multiple and/or severe superimposed infections which may have contributed to higher morbidity and mortality. While further investigation is required, clinicians should consider these risks when prescribing tocilizumab.\n\n    7.28 CPAP versus HFO therapy for severe COVID-19 ARDS\n\n    Walsh S, Curran E, Counihan I, Hassan T\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Co. Louth\n\n    7.29 A retrospective observational study of admission rate during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and re-admission rate in UL Hospitals Group (ULHG), Mid West, Ireland\n\n    B Okpaje, G Bennett, MK Rana, S Shahsavari, A Farrell, TK Teoh, A O'Brien.\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Limerick, Ireland\n\n    Background The Coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), yielded an outbreak which begun in 2019. The first established case of COVID-19 in Ireland was in February 2020 and in the ensuing months many patients suffering from the virus required admission. Although majority of positive cases were managed in the community, 12.9% of cases required hospitalisation in Ireland.\n\n    Methods In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the electronic records of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, aged at or above 18 years, admitted to University Limerick Hospital Group within March 1st to May 31st, 2020. Positivity was confirmed with polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal/ sputum samples. The rate of hospital admission within this three month span was recorded and from this data, we reviewed the rate of re-admission into hospital.\n\n    Results Of a total of 540 cases reviewed, 46.3% (250/540) required hospital admission within March 1st and May 31st. Of this hospitalised group, 31.6% (79/250) of hospitalised cases required re-admission to hospital in the subsequent months. 36.7% (29/79) of re-admitted cases occurred within the first 3 months post discharge. Approximately 13.2% (33/250) were deceased post COVID-19 infection.\n\n    Conclusion It is evident from the data, that almost 50% of positive cases, required hospital admission in the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in ULHG. It is concerning that, approximately third required re-admission, with the highest peak falling within three months of discharge from hospital. This highlights the need for a formal pathway of post-discharge care for patients infected with COVID-19 in the Mid-West.\n\n    7.30 IS IMMUNOSUPPRESSION TRIGGERING mRNA BNT162b2 VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION? - CASE SERIES\n\n    Nithya Rajendran1, Emma Moore1, Aoibheann Houston1, Brendan Crowley2, Brian Kent1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St James' Hospital, Dublin\n\n    2 Department of Virology, St James' Hospital, Dublin\n\n    SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have played a significant role in reducing mortality and morbidity from Covid-19. However, concern remains that immunosuppressed individuals may develop breakthrough infection despite full vaccination, resulting in severe Covid pneumonia.\n\n    We assessed vaccinated patients admitted with Covid pneumonia between 09 July 2021 - 09 August 2021. We measured Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (anti-S IgG) and nucleocapsid (anti-N IgG) antibodies, clinical severity, imaging, immunosuppressant drugs and oxygen requirements.\n\n    Three fully vaccinated patients developed severe Covid pneumonia. All were male, with an average age 53 years (range 51-59). Two had haematological malignancies, one had systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease, and all were on B-cell depleting immunosuppression therapy. One patient had detectable anti-S IgG, compatible with a humoral response, another had both anti-S and anti-N IgG, compatible with a serological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the third was seronegative. Peak CRP was 146 +- 92. All three required high flow nasal oxygen therapy, prolonged self-proning and high dose corticosteroids, two receiving Tocilizumab.\n\n    Immunosuppressed patients may remain at risk of severe Covid pneumonia despite full vaccination. This may be particularly the case in patients receiving B cell depleting therapies, even in the presence of apparent humoral response to vaccination and/or infection.\n\n    7.31 Organising Pneumonia as a complication of SARS-COV-2 infection\n\n    Nithya Rajendran, Sania Noor, Emma Moore, Aoibheann Houston, Aoife Carolan, Barry Kennedy, Brian Kent\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St James' Hospital, Dublin\n\n    Organizing pneumonia (OP) can occur in a small number of patients following initial resolution of SARS-COV-2 infection. We aimed to analyse the outcome of OP in COVID-19 patients.\n\n    A retrospective single-centre cohort study was used to assess a total of 6 patients who developed OP following resolution of COVID pneumonia admitted to the COVID unit in St James' Hospital between 01/12/2020 and 01/05/2021. Patients were categorised based on their oxygen requirement, CT imaging, steroid therapy, duration of hospital stay, and clinical outcome.\n\n    The mean age was 70.8 years, with mean CRP 110 +- 49.8. 5 (83%) patients were male. The median (range) onset developing OP from positive RT-PCR was 17 (9-22) days. 4 (66%) required high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy; no patients needed invasive ventilation. The median (range) daily prednisolone dosing was 40 (40-60) mg, and hospital stay 46(6-52) days. Of these 6, one died within 3 days of treatment.\n\n    We achieved a favourable outcome in most patients with early introduction of steroid, thereby regressing lung injury. Therefore, it is important to recognize and treat the unpredictable patterns post-COVID infection.\n\n    7.32 \"Janssen adenoviral-vector COVID-19 vaccine associated cerebral venous thrombosis\"\n\n    A Sarfaraz1, S Staunton1, N Brady1, C Buckley1, J Olaniyi1, S Donnelly1,2, PD Mitchell1,2\n\n    1 Medical Professorial Unit, Tallaght University Hospital\n\n    2 Trinity College Dublin School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin\n\n    Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare event with an incidence of 0.22-1.57 per 100,000 and a Female: Male ratio of 3:1 and mortality of up to 24%. Rarely CVST have been associated with adenoviral-vector vaccines against Covid-19. As of April 2021, over 6 cases of CVST have been reported following administration of this specific vaccine after 6.86 million doses (reporting rate 0.87 cases per million doses). We report the case of an otherwise healthy 21-year-old male who presented with a 5 day history of headache and left arm pain who suffered a grand mal seizure 2 weeks following a Covid-19 vaccine (Janssen) whilst driving his car. CT Venogram identified a left superior sagittal and sigmodal venous sinus thrombosis. Platelet count was low at 133 x 109. Vaccine-induced Immune-Thrombotic-Thrombocytopenia screen was positive confirming vaccine-related venous sinus thrombosis. Rarely associated with the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, this case was related to the Janssen vaccine - another adenovirus mediated COVID-19 vaccine. It again highlights the need for vigilance and continued assessment in this select population.\n\n    7.33 Vitamin D Status and Disease Severity in COVID-19\n\n    M.Youssef1,M.Connolly2, A.O'Shea2,R.Barrett2,D.McCartney2,A. Al Lawati1,S. I. Shah1, J.Faul1,3\n\n    1 Respiratory Department,Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15,Ireland\n\n    2 School of Biological and Health Sciences, TU Dublin and School of Medicine,Trinity College Dublin,Ireland\n\n    3 James Connolly Memorial Asthma Research Centre, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown,Dublin 15, Ireland\n\n    Data links a low Vitamin D status with increased COVID-19 severity. This might be attributable to co-founding factors.Alternately, since vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects on lymphocytes and macrophages, the link between a low vitamin D and poor clinical outcomes might be attributable to dysregulated inflammatory pathways.\n\n    To examine the association between Vitamin D status and severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and whether this association could be explained by inflammatory markers.\n\n    We prospectively measured serum 25(OH)D levels in 232 consecutive COVID-19 patients. Clinical severity outcomes (chest radiograph score, supplementary oxygen, length of stay, ICU admission, mortality) and different inflammatory markers were recorded. Univariate and Multivariate analyses were used to determine whether measures of inflammation and clinical outcome were associated with vitamin D status.\n\n    No association found between vitamin D status and X-ray scores, O2 requirement or the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic biomarkers. ICU admission was more likely in VDD group (21.6%) and vitamin D insufficient group (28.3%); however this was abolished on multivariate analysis (p = 0.632). Mortality was higher in VDD group (21.6%) (p = 0.037).This persisted after adjustment for age, gender and diabetes.\n\n    Although a low serum 25(OH) D is strongly and independently associated with increased mortality in Covid-19 hospitalized patients, no specific inflammatory marker was found explains this.\n\n    7.34 Pulmonary function assessment post covid-19 infection in University Hospital Limerick\n\n    John Stephenson, Michelle Balicaco, Tendai Nyaude, Cristina Falcao, Ciara Mathews, Dr. Brian Casserly, Dr. Aidan O'Brien\n\n    Pulmonary Function University Hospital Limerick\n\n    The Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of COVID-19 infection on Pulmonary Function in patients attending the Respiratory Clinic in UHL.\n\n    20 Patients were included in the study. Spirometry, DLCO and Lung Volumes Nitrogen Washout were measured. A questionnaire scoring the severity of symptoms at the time of infection, and the duration and severity of symptoms post infection was completed. Patient history and other relevant data were noted including smoking history, prior lung disease, age and if admitted during infection.\n\n    10% had Obstructive Spirometry. 55% had a mild reduction in DLCO. 5% had moderate reduction in DLCO, 15% had a reduced Total Lung Capacity. During infection, 55% described mild, 35% described moderate and 5% described severe symptoms. 18% of mildly symptomatic patients had abnormal Spirometry, 55% had abnormal DLCO and 27% had Restrictive Lung Volumes. 14% of moderately symptomatic patients had abnormal Spirometry and 57% had abnormal DLCO.\n\n    Abnormal Pulmonary Function was seen in 65% of study patients. The parameter most impaired was DLCO. The symptoms that persisted longest in patients were Dyspnoea, Cough and Fatigue.\n\n    This study suggests an association between COVID-19 infection and abnormal DLCO.\n\n    7.35 Review of the first 6 months of a virtual post-Covid-19 Virtual Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme\n\n    Clare Baily-Scanlan1, Barry Kehoe1, Professor Eddie Moloney2\n\n    1 Physiotherapy Department, Dublin South West, CHO7,  2 Professorial Respiratory Centre, Tallaght University Hospital\n\n    There are a large number of post-Covid-19 patients who are experiencing ongoing physical, functional and psychological impairments. Frequently reported symptoms are cough, breathlessness and fatigue(1). Evidence for post-covid-19 pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) remains limited, however these symptoms can be potentially managed within the traditional PR programme.\n\n    In response to the suspension of face to face PR due to Public Health Guidelines, the community-based PR staff in Dublin South West sustained the delivery of PR through a virtual medium. This has previously been shown to be safe and feasible (2). In the initial 6 months, 25 patients with post-Covid-19 symptoms were referred to virtual PR (VPR). 14 were assessed and 9 completed the programme. The remaining did not attend assessment as they were either back to baseline, medically unwell or had issues with the technology required.\n\n    Patients were invited to log onto the HSE approved digital platform Attend Anywhere or attend in person, depending on public health advice, for their initial and post assessments. Classes were delivered via Attend Anywhere and ran twice a week for 8 weeks.\n\n    88% (n = 8) of participants showed a significant improvement in exercise tolerance using either the 1 min sit-to-stand or 6 min walk test. Other outcome measures used were the Chalder Fatigue Score, short-form IPAQ and HADS.\n\n    The implementation of an integrated multidisciplinary service for patients experiencing post-Covid-19 symptoms is needed to address the rehabilitation needs of this patient cohort.\n\n    References\n\n    1.

Many patients present with infiltrates/consolidation on imaging which requires a follow up chest x-ray(cxr) to investigate for any underlying malignancy. In this audit patients with a positive covid-19 swab received by the University Hospital Limerick microbiology laboratory were examined.\n\n    The microbiology department provided a list of positive cases from the first wave of Covid-19 (March 1st until May 31st 2020). Patients with cxr infiltrates during the acute phase of Covid-19 (until 14 days post positive swab result) were examined to determine if follow up imaging (up to 6 months post positive swab) showed resolution of these infiltrates.\n\n    50.8%(231/455) patients with a covid positive swab were admitted or presented to the Emergency Department. Of these 210 had a chest cxr and 60%(126/210) had infiltrates. The majority of follow up cxrs were reported as clear, however changes persisted in 15.9%(20/126) patients and worryingly 21.4%(27/126) had no follow up cxr.\n\n    A significant number of patients testing positive for Covid-19 present with cxr changes. Our study highlights an important finding, that many patients with infiltrates on imaging are discharged without a follow up cxr arranged.\n\n    7.37  Audit of Airvo and Non-Invasive Ventilation Usage Outside of Critical Care Areas in Cork University Hospital during Wave 3 of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n    Avril Hallahan1, Annemarie Fitzgerald1, Siobhan Healy1, Maeve O'Grady1\n\n    1. Physiotherapy Department, Cork University Hospital\n\n    An audit completed by the Physiotherapy Department looked at the number of patients using Airvo and/or NIV outside the critical care areas during the months of January to March 2021 which encompassed Wave 3 of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n    In total, there were 303 patients using either Airvo or NIV or both during this time. 59% of these patients were COVID-19 positive. The results are outlined in the table below.\n\n    In terms of machine dependency, the majority of patients on Airvo were on 40-60% FiO2 (50%) and a flowrate of 30-50L/min (73%). Most patients on BiPAP were on settings of IPAP <= 12, FiO2 > 40% or IPAP > 12, FiO2 > 40% (29% each). Most patients on CPAP were on 40-60% FiO2 (58%) and a PEEP of 8-10cmH20 (74%).\n\n    Airvo and NIV were used throughout the hospital during this time, but this audit illustrated that the wards with the highest numbers of patients on these machines were the COVID-19 designated areas and the emergency department all of which had extra physiotherapy staffing to account for the clinical need. Physiotherapists played an integral role in managing these deteriorating patients at ward level thereby helping to avoid ICU admissions when these beds were in high demand.\n\n    7.38 Prevalence and correlates of pulmonary embolism among Covid-19 patients undergoing CT pulmonary angiography\n\n    Sania Noor1, Kristi Constantinou1, Hazel O'Neill2, Caoimhe McDonnell2, Ronan McDermott2, Brian Kent1\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St James' Hospital, Dublin\n\n    2 Department of Radiology, St James' Hospital, Dublin\n\n    Many patients hospitalised with Covid-19 undergo CTPA. Early reports had suggested a significant burden of pulmonary embolism (PE) in Covid-19 populations, but as the pandemic has evolved, this relationship has come under greater scrutiny. We assessed the burden of PE in Covid-19 patients undergoing CTPA at our institution.\n\n    All patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent CTPA in January 2021 were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics, calculated Well's scores, D-Dimer levels, and outcomes were compared between patients with and without PE.\n\n    Of 123 Covid-19 patients who underwent CTPA, 15 (12.2%) had PE. No significant differences were seen in demographic factors, gas exchange, respiratory support, or co-morbidities. No difference was seen in calculated risk of PE (median Well's score 4.5(2.5-5.5) vs 4.5(3.0-5.5); p = 0.425), but D-Dimers were significantly higher with PE (6,226 +- 4,252 vs 1,528 +- 1762 ng/ml; p < 0.001). No PE were identified in patients with a D-Dimer level < 1,000 ng/ml. No increase was seen in length of stay (9.0 (IQR 4.5-26) vs 10 (IQR 3-14) days; p = 0.363) or mortality (13.3% vs 12.8%; p = 0.968) in patients with PE.\n\n    Pulmonary embolism is not uncommon in patients with Covid-19 undergoing CTPA, and is associated with elevations in D-Dimer levels. Clinical risk scores may be less reliable in Covid-19 populations.\n\n    7.39 Inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and their COVID vaccination status\n\n    C O'Connor, RA Sharkey, MG Kelly, C King, P Mc Shane, M Mc Closkey\n\n    Department of Respiratory Medicine, Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry/L'Derry\n\n    The uptake of the COVID vaccine in Northern Ireland is the lowest in the UK and means that more adults are more susceptible to the most severe effects of COVID-19 infection.\n\n    We retrospectively reviewed the notes of patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis between April 1st and July 31st 2021. We determined their COVID vaccination status and inpatient clinical course\n\n    During the 4 month period, we determined the vaccination status of 90 patients admitted with COVID pneumonitis - 46 male (51%) and 44 female (49%). Of the 90 patients, 36 were partially or fully vaccinated (40%) - 4 had single vaccine dose (11%) and 32 were fully vaccinated (89%). Of these 36 patients, 25% required higher level oxygen support or ITU admission. 54 patients were unvaccinated (60%) and 57% of these patients required higher level oxygen support or ITU admission. Of the 10 patients who required ITU admission, 9 patients (80%) were unvaccinated and 1 patient was vaccinated. Overall, 6 patients died - 2 patients unvaccinated and 4 fully vaccinated (one patient had significant immunosuppression).\n\n    In this initial review, we found that patients admitted with COVID pneumonitis and who had not received the COVID vaccine were more likely to require higher level oxygen support.\n\n    7.40 Antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 patients - An Irish perspective\n\n    David P. O'Sullivan1, Joshua Olaniyi1, Seamas C. Donnelly1, Deirdre Stewart2, Anna Rose Prior2\n\n    1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Medical Professorial Unit, Tallaght University Hospital & Trinity College, Dublin 24, Ireland\n\n    2 Department of Clinical Microbiology, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland\n\n    Inappropriate antibiotic use is a global health issue. It is reported to be more prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Despite the low rates of bacterial co-infection, antibiotics are still frequently prescribed in this population. The CURB-65 criteria is often used to guide antibiotics in patients with suspected community acquired pneumonia.\n\n    The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital.\n\n    We retrospectively reviewed the notes of all the patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19, throughout the month of January 2021. The prevalence of PIP was determined by the CURB-65 criteria.\n\n    Of the 74 patients reviewed, 66% were male; median age was 59 [IQR; 47-71 years). 69 patients (93%) received an antibiotic, with 78% being prescribed a potentially inappropriate antibiotic.\n\n    Despite low rates of bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 patients, antibiotics continue to be prescribed in these patients. PIP of antibiotics can lead to increased levels of complications such as Clostridium difficile and antibacterial resistance. In this study, the level of antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 patients was higher than the rates previously reported in literature and the CURB-65 criteria identified a high level of PIP of antibiotics in this population.\n\n    7.41 Assessing The Impact of COVID-19 in Severe Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)\n\n    K McGoldrick 1, D Fraughen 3,4, G Kelly2, N G. McElvaney3,4, T P. Carroll2,4\n\n    1 Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, School of Medicine, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    2 Alpha-1 Foundation Ireland, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    3 Department of Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    4 Irish Centre for Genetic Lung Disease, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland\n\n    Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder arising from mutation of the SERPINA1 gene. The ZZ genotype of AATD results in severe deficiency of this key antiprotease and can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), even in never-smokers. As a respiratory pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to pose a heightened risk to those with severe AATD and, as such, they were advised to cocoon. This study aimed to contextualize the impact of COVID-19 in this cohort.\n\n    Through the National AATD Registry, 184 eligible ZZ individuals were invited to participate via phone. Data on exacerbation frequency, COVID infection status and cocooning history were collected via a survey. The overall response rate was 63.5% (N = 117).\n\n    The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our cohort was 12.3% (N = 12/117) with 4.2% of cases requiring hospital admission (N = 5) and no fatalities. Men who cocooned were the only group shown to have fewer exacerbations during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic\n\n    Limitations of our study include the lack of COVID-19 diagnosis dates and the fact outcomes are patient reported. Nevertheless, our data shows that men with severe AATD reported fewer exacerbations in the COVID-19 era.\n\n    7.42 The benefits of a physiotherapy review for post intensive care COVID-19 patients\n\n    Maria Baily-Scanlan1, Elaine Joyce1, Evan Farrell1, Eimear McCormack1, Ciara Scallan1\n\n    1 Physiotherapy Department, Tallaght University Hospital\n\n    Post intensive care (ICU) Covid-19 survivors may experience a range of sequelae related to their critical condition. Emotional, cognitive and physical symptoms can limit patients functioning. A physiotherapy review can identify physical and exercise limitations which can be ameliorated to help patients' recovery. Patients (n = 27) who were in ICU in Tallaght University Hospital with COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were invited to attend a multi-disciplinary clinic of which 22 attended in October 2020.\n\n    Physiotherapy assessments included mobility status; a 6 min walk test (6MWT); grip strength assessment and completion of the short form international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-SF).\n\n    11 patients were referred to a community based pulmonary rehab programme due to their low levels of exercise tolerance. 3 patients were referred to the oxygen clinic due to on-going oxygen desaturation on exertion. 6 patients were referred for out-patient musculoskeletal physiotherapy review. These patients had shoulder dysfunction from proning (n = 3), foot weakness (n = 2) and back/hip pain (n = 1) since their discharge from ICU. Two patients required on-going physiotherapy which included neuro, aquatic and musculoskeletal rehabilitation. As indicated from their IPAQ-SF scores the overall levels of physical activity were low. Exercise advice, education and health promotion was provided to all patients.\n\n    A physiotherapy review is important for this patient cohort to identify/address needs and to ensure onward referral to appropriate health care services.\n\n    7.43 The Experience of people with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis living through the Covid-19 Pandemic\n\n    Noelle Ryan, Aidan O' Brien, Brian Casserly, Pauline Meskell\n\n    HSE, Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Limerick (UHL). University of Limerick\n\n    As a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, restriction measures aimed to slow down virus transmission and protect vulnerable groups of people were introduced worldwide. People with IPF were particularly vulnerable due to increased risk of more serious illness from Covid-19, therefore many self-isolated to protect themselves. A qualitative descriptive design was undertaken using purposive sampling to recruit 13 participants with IPF attending the respiratory department of a large urban teaching hospital in Ireland. Data were collected between January 2021 and February 2021 through semi-structured interviews using an online platform. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis.\n\n    Four key themes were identified from participant's experience of living through the Covid-19 pandemic: (1) fear of contracting Covid-19, (2) living with reduced social interaction, (3) the adjustment in the relationship with healthcare professionals and (4) navigating an altered landscape. Participants were compelled to self-isolate due to fear and anxiety of contracting Covid-19. Participants reported increased social isolation with some experiencing anger and resentment at loss of precious time with family and friends. Conscious of their limited lifespan having IPF, many felt saddened and aggrieved at the time theft. Participants felt an increased responsibility for self-monitoring their condition and concern at differentiating symptoms of Covid-19 from an exacerbation. Participants discussed a variety of strategies that helped them cope through the pandemic and the important role they played.\n\n    8.

The efficacy of VPR compared to TPR was examined.\n\n    Patients completed twice weekly TPR or VPR classes over 8 weeks. Pre- and Post-PR symptom, functional and emotional status was measured using validated questionnaires and assessment techniques, and compared between PR groups.\n\n    Fifty-three patients enrolled (29 TPR; 24 VPR). Overall, 72% completed the programme (76% TPR; 66% VPR, p = 0.53). The majority(74%) of participants had COPD. The mean age was 69.6(8.4) years. Baseline COPD assessment test(CAT) score was high at 19.3(7.8), with mean FEV1 53(20.8)% and 2.18(3.76) exacerbations in the year pre-enrolment. Baseline demographics were comparable between PR groups(p > 0.05). The minimal clinically important difference(MCID) for CAT was achieved by 53%(TPR) and 69%(VPR) of patients, p = 0.33. Both groups achieved significant improvements in functional status with 71% exceeding the MCID in 6mwt and 1 min STS in TPR and VPR respectively. There was no difference in the proportion of patients reporting improvements in emotional status.\n\n    The majority of patients undergoing VPR achieve meaningful improvements in symptoms and functional status. Results are comparable to those achieved by a traditional PR programme. The long-term benefits of VPR need to be explored.\n\n    8.2 Outcome of a new dedicated Consultant delivered Post-COVID -19 Outpatient Clinic Service\n\n    Abdul Qadeer, Ann Marie White, Isalynne Delagua, Aisling McGowan, Sinead Delahunty, Krzysztof Wanic, Dimitris Ampazis, Eoin judge, John Faul, Liam Cormican\n\n    Respiratory & Sleep Diagnostics Department, Connolly Hospital, Dublin 15\n\n    Background: The long term course of COVID-19 infection appears to be variable and unpredictable. Because of the numbers of patients involved, there has evolved an unmet clinical need and there is capacity for pre-existing respiratory ambulatory care services to be overwhelmed. In October 2020 we established a new respiratory consultant delivered post COVID -19 outpatient clinic service so that all COVID-19 patients discharged from Connolly hospital were offered a follow up appointment at 3 + months following discharge. The dedicated clinic served as a 'one stop shop' diagnostic hub for COVID-19 related pathology and a gateway to a multidisciplinary team. Here-in we describe the findings.\n\n    Methods and Results: This was an observational study. There were 972 admissions with COVID-19 infection (inc. 86 ICU patients). 826 patients were successfully discharged from hospital, and all have been offered out-patient appointments at 12 plus weeks from discharge at post COVID clinic. There was smaller proportion (n = 20) of GP referrals to the service. The following investigations were performed in advance of attending; repeat chest x ray, ECG, full pulmonary function test( spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion studies), 6-min walk test, Hospital Anxiety and Depression score (HADS-A, HADS- D), Fatigue Severity Score (FSS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).\n\n    Of the 826 patients discharged from hospital and offered an appointment, 310 patients accepted and attended and the reminder have not availed of the appointment. We present data on the first 204. patients ( male 52%), median age of 57 years (range 17-98) Caucasian 174 (85.2%), Asian 24 (11.7%), Black (2.9%). Of the 204 appointments 62 patients required additional investigations and follow up appointment and the remainder 142(69.6%) patients were discharged from the service after 1 visit. Only 18(8.8%) patients had residual changes on chest Xray and were advised repeat chest Xray in 8-10 weeks' time. All patients in our study population have normal spirometry with FEV1 (median value of 99% predicted), FVC (median-101% predicted), DLCO (median- 79%) and FEV1/FVC (median- 80%). There were minor reductions in DLCO. Also results of 6-min walk test had been normal for all patients with oxygen saturation (range 94%-98%) pre and post-test. A small number had persistent interstital changes requiring further investigation, Fatigue Severity Score was significantly elevated with average 26 (range 7-63), HADS-D average 14 (range 8-20), HADS-A average 15 (range 9-21). Post COVID syndrome was diagnosed in 51 ( 6% of those offered appointment following COVID -19 infection, mandating referral to a dedicated post COVID Physiotherapy service.\n\n    Conclusion: Organisation and delivery of a dedicated post COVID clinic service requires time, staff resource and infrastructure. Post COVID syndrome occurred in at least 6% of discharged patients at a conservative estimate.\n\n    8.3 Omitted\n\n    8.4 Candidate role for Toll-like receptor 3 L412F polymorphism in bacterial infection and acute exacerbation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n\n    Aoife N.

To date, the role of TLR3 L412F in bacterial infection and acute exacerbations (AE) in IPF has not been reported.\n\n    Here, we investigated the effect of TLR3 L412F on the lung microbiome using 16S rRNA qPCR and pyrosequencing. The effect of TLR3 L412F on anti-bacterial TLR-responses of primary IPF lung fibroblasts was quantitated. Hierarchical heatmap analysis was employed to establish bacterial and viral clustering in nasopharyngeal lavage samples from AE-IPF patients.\n\n    We observed a significant increase in AE-related death in 412F-variant IPF patients. We demonstrated that 412F-heterozygous IPF lung fibroblasts have reduced anti-bacterial TLR responses to LPS (TLR4), Pam3CYSK4 (TLR1/2), flagellin (TLR5) and FSL-1 (TLR6/1) and have reduced responses to live Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, 412F-heterozygous IPF patients had a dysregulated lung microbiome with increased frequencies of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp.\n\n    This study reveals that TLR3 L412F dysregulates the IPF lung microbiome and reduces the responses of IPF lung fibroblasts to bacterial TLR-agonists and live bacterial infection. These findings identify a candidate role for TLR3 L412F in viral- and bacterial-mediated AE-death.\n\n    8.5 Characterisation and Epithelialisation of 3D Printed Scaffolds for Tracheal Tissue Engineering\n\n    Luis Soriano1,2,3, Ruairi P Brannigan4, Tehreem Khalid1,2,5, Andreas Heise4, Fergal J.

HRB-CRF, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n    Respiratory rate (RR) is an important predictor of serious adverse events during hospitalisation. Issues in RR recording include the absence of a gold-standard recommendation for RR measurement and a dependence on manual recordings with significant inter-observer variability.\n\n    The purpose of this study was to introduce electronic continuous RR monitors on an acute respiratory ward. In addition, we aimed to assess whether or not electronic RR monitoring correlated with manual RR; if electronic measuring of RR would lead to a different NEWS score; if a change in the pattern or rate of respiration preceded a clinical deterioration; if ABG readings correlated with trends in RR; and if triggering of medical review based on RR monitoring would reduce acute deteriorations.\n\n    90 inpatient episodes were analysed. Discrepancies between electronic and manual RR readings were noted throughout, with both over- and under-estimations of RR common, with subsequent impact on the NEWS score The RR trends for five patients in particular showed increased frequency in RR spikes in the 24 h preceding a deterioration requiring medical input.\n\n    Continuous RR monitoring should be routinely available for inpatients in order to monitor trends and trigger earlier medical intervention for those at risk of acute respiratory compromise.\n\n    [8.6]\n\n    8.7 Is Full Nocturnal Polysomnography on an Acute Medical Ward comparable to that in a Dedicated Sleep laboratory in terms of Sleep Quality?\n\n    Walsh S, Janjua A, McEvoy K, Stewart L, McGowan A, Faul J, and Cormican L\n\n    8.8 Characterisation of exosomes from Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) patients\n\n    Patrick McFadden1, Amina Jouida2, Michael P.

This study aims to characterise exosomes from the serum of patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, low-grade, metastasizing neoplasm that occurs almost exclusively in females.\n\n    Using serum samples from patients with LAM and healthy individuals as controls, exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifuge. The presence of exosomes was confirmed by western blot and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). The activity of metalloproteinases in exosomes was measured by zymography. A549 cells were treated with serum derived exosomes and the effects were analysed by western blot and zymography.\n\n    LAM patients have significantly increased numbers of exosomes in their serum when compared to the controls (8.9 x 109 vs 13.8 x 109 particles/ml; p = 0.024). Interestingly, these LAM-derived exosomes had significantly higher activity of Pro-MMP-9 (threefold increase), but lower activity of MMP-9. Vimentin, a protein expressed in mesenchymal cells and a marker of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), showed higher expression in A549 cells treated with LAM-derived exosomes compared to control.\n\n    Findings indicate an exosome mediated EMT pathway in LAM. This exploration advances our knowledge of LAM and the role of exosomes in metastasising diseases.\n\n    9.

Queens University Belfast\n\n    2. Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children\n\n    Polysomnography is the gold-standard test for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), but availability is limited. Nocturnal pulse oximetry can be a cost-effective screening tool for OSA. Delta 12 s, a measure of oxygen saturation variability, has been validated for screening for OSA in adults and in children with Down's syndrome. However, it is not known if a single night of oximetry is sufficient as the repeatability of Delta 12 s over successive nights is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the repeatability of the Delta 12 s index over three consecutive nights in children with potential OSA.\n\n    A retrospective study of nocturnal home pulse oximetry over 3 consecutive nights was conducted in children with suspected OSA between July 2018 and July 2020. Night-to-night repeatability of the Delta 12 s parameter was assessed by calculating 95% limits of agreement (LoA) and Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC). A CCC > 0.95, 0.9-.95, and < 0.9 suggest good, moderate and poor agreement respectively.\n\n    Of the 481 patients included; 268 patients had 3 nights of technically adequate oximetry data recorded. Table 11 demonstrates poor agreement in the delta 12 s parameter over successive nights.\n\n    Due to night-to-night variability one night of oximetry done in children using the Delta 12 s index may be insufficient to screen for OSA\n\n    Publisher's Note\n\n    Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

        "Title": "    Computational analysis of high-risk SNPs in human CHK2 gene responsible for hereditary breast cancer: A functional and structural impact",
        "Abstract": "    Nowadays CHK2 mutation is studied frequently in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients in addition to BRCA1/BRCA2. CHK2 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, also involved in pathways such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. CHK2 is a well-studied moderate penetrance gene that correlates with third high risk susceptibility gene with an increased risk for breast cancer. Hence before planning large population study, it is better to scrutinize putative functional SNPs of CHK2 using different computational tools. In this study, we have used various computational approaches to identify nsSNPs which are deleterious to the structure and/or function of CHK2 protein that might be causing this disease. Computational analysis was performed by different in silico tools including SIFT, Align GVGD, SNAP-2, PROVEAN, Poly-Phen-2, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, MUpro, iPTREE-STAB, Consurf, InterPro, NCBI Conserved Domain Search tool, ModPred, SPARKS-X, RAMPAGE, Verify-3D, FT Site, COACH and PyMol. Out of 78 nsSNP of human CHK2 gene, seven nsSNPs were predicted functionally most significant SNPs. Among these seven nsSNP, p.Arg160Gly, p.Gly210Arg and p.Ser415Phe are highly conserved residues with conservation score of 9 and three nsSNP were predicted to be involved in post translational modification. The p.Arg160Gly and p.Gly210Arg may interfere in phosphopeptide binding site on FHA conserved domain. The p.Ser415Phe may interfere in formation of activation loop of protein-kinase domain and might interfere in interactions of CHK2 with ligand. The study concludes that mutation of serine to phenylalanine at position 415 is a major mutation in native CHK2 protein which might contribute to its malfunction, ultimately causing disease. This is the first comprehensive study, where CHK2 gene variants are analyzed using in silico tools hence it will be of great help while considering large scale studies and also in developing precision medicines related to these polymorphisms in the era of personalized medicine.",
        "Introduction": "    Of all cancers, one of the main cause of cancer related deaths is breast cancer among women worldwide, with 5% to 10% of cases being due to hereditary risk. The CHK2 gene is moderately penetrance gene most extensively studied as possible third high risk susceptibility gene in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. CHK2 gene is the human homolog of Rad53 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Cds1 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Human CHK2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, located on long arm of chromosome 22 at q12.1 and encoded by CHK2 serine/threonine kinase. It consists of three major domains. 1) N-terminal has SQ/TQ cluster domain that serves as a site for phosphorylation in response to DNA damage, 2) forkhead-associated protein interaction domain (FHA) which is essential for activation in response to DNA damage and is rapidly phosphorylated in response to replication blocks and DNA damage. In FHA domain residues 112-175 are involved in dimerization of CHK2 molecules in phosphorylation manner, for full activation of CHK2 by trans-autophosphorylation of the activation loop. The major function of FHA domain is to regulate the kinase activities in CHK2 by interacting with other proteins thus mediates protein-protein interactions and 3) C-terminal which has serine/threonine kinase activity. CHK2 is activated by the kinases ATM and ATR in response to DNA double-strand breaks or replicative stress. These proteins catalyze the phosphorylation of threonine 68 of CHK2 causing its transient dimerization via the FHA domain leading to CHK2 trans-autophosphorylation and its full activation. In response to DNA damage, CHK2 gene is involved in different pathways such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and apoptosis. CHK2 phosphorylates downstream cell cycle regulators such as p53, Cdc25, and BRCA1 to activate checkpoint repair or recovery responses, as well as concurrently delay entry into mitosis. Deviation from its normal physiological function is likely to contribute to disease pathogenesis. In particular, the missense variants of CHK2 p.Ile157Thr, p.Asp252Gly, c.1100delC, p.His371Tyr, p.Glu161del, p.Ser428Phe, c.591delA, p.Arg117Gly, p.Thr476Met and p.Asp438Tyr were significantly associated with germ-line variants in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Finnish population (1.4%) and Polish population (0.2%) confer a relative risk for developing breast tumors of about 2 for women and 10 for men if c.1100delC mutation is present. Variant p.Ile157Thr, present in 5.3% of the Finnish population and in 4.8% of the Polish population, confers a relative risk of breast cancer of 1.5. A recent analysis by the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) estimated a relative risk of 2.26 for p.Thr367MetfsTer15 (rs555607708). Limited data is available for whole CHK2 gene for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Further, impact of missense variants on protein function is not known fully, although substitutions in the FHA domain and the kinase domain have been shown to abolish activity.\n\n    Single nucleotide polymorphism is a common genetic variant in human and about 93% SNPs are present in human genes. SNPs can be present in coding, noncoding or intergenic regions. Both non-coding and intergenic SNPs may have slight impact, but non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) have more impact on protein. Identification of the impact of variants on structure, stability and function of the protein is an important task as not all reported polymorphisms are deleterious. Therefore there is a need to understand the deleterious impact of nsSNPs on protein structure and function using different recent molecular biology techniques. Till now large numbers of SNPs are reported in NCBI data, to screen these nsSNPS for their impact on biological function through experimental work is very tedious and costly. However, utilization of computational methods could be an efficient alternative for the same.\n\n    Nowadays, different computational tools have been extensively used for predicting deleterious nsSNP and their role in protein function, stability and structure maintenance. Taking all these in consideration, the present study is aimed to determine various deleterious nsSNPs of human CHK2 gene using SIFT, Align GVGD, SNAP-2, PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, I-Mutant, iPTREE-STAB, Mupro etc. Conservation of amino acid residues was predicted using ConSurf. ModPred was used to identify post-translational modification site present in protein. The 3D structure of the CHK2 protein was generated using SPARK-X and refined using ModRefiner. The quality of model was checked using RAMPAGE and Varify3D. The ligand binding sites were predicted using FTsite and COACH. The visualization of 3-D structure and labelling of native as well mutant amino acid was done using Pymol and Swiss PDB viewer.",

Only nsSNP of CHK2 were selected for this investigation.\n\n    The CHK2 single nucleotide variants obtained from dbSNP analysis were subjected to computational analysis through variety of tools. According to SIFT result out of 753 nsSNPs of CHK2 gene total 78 SNP were predicted to be tolerated or deleterious and rest of 675 were not found in SIFT results. From these 78 SNPs, SIFT classified 35 nsSNPs as damaging, 43 as tolerated. To increase the accuracy of computational techniques, all the 78 SNPs predicted in SIFT were further validated by Align GVGD, SNAP2, PROVEAN, PolyPhen2 and PANTHER tools. Align GVGD is a method that combines Grantham Variation (GV) and Grantham Deviation (GD) scores to predicts whether the missense substitution is deleterious or not. In Align GVGD, if GD score is less than C15 then substitution is less likely affected and score is greater C65 then substitution is most likely affected. Out of 78 nsSNP Align GVGD predicted 43 SNPs as most likely affected and 10 nsSNPs as less likely affected. SNAP2 predicts whether the impact of amino acid variation is neutral or has effect on a query protein function by evaluating mutability landscape of the entire query protein sequence. Out of 78 SNPs subjected to SNAP2 prediction, 41 showed effect on protein function and 37 predicted as neutral SNPs. Among 78 SNPs subjected to PROVEAN analysis, 35 SNPs were predicted as deleterious and 43 SNPs were predicted as neutral. Out of 78 SNPs subjected to PolyPhen2 analysis 41 were predicted probably damaging, 10 predicted possibly damaging, 26 predicted benign and 1 was not predicted by PolyPhen2. For every input variant PolyPhen2 calculates PSIC (Position specific independent score). Out of 78 nsSNPs, 37 SNPs were predicted probably damaging, 17 predicted possibly damaging and rest 24 SNPs predicted probably benign by PANTHER cSNP. The nsSNP predicted as probably damaging by PolyPhen and PANTHER were considered as damaging and used for further analysis.\n\n    All the 78 nsSNPs of CHK2 gene were further analyzed for correlation with disease after functional impact through PhD-SNP. PhD-SNP is a SVM based classifier which predicts the result through evolutionary information and hybrid predictive method with the accuracy of 78% of human protein. PhD-SNP revealed the most unique results showing only 20 nsSNPs as diseased and rest of 58 SNPs as neutral.\n\n    We predicted any stability alteration in the CHK2 protein with the help of MuPro and iPTREE-STAB which predict the result by considering single site variant. MuPro predicted 56 nsSNP which decrease stability of CHK2 protein and rest of 22 SNPs increase stability. iPTREE-STAB result revealed to decrease stability of 74 nsSNP and 4 nsSNP showed increase in protein stability. According to some studies, decreased protein stability causes increase in degradation, misfolding and aggregation of proteins. We shortlisted those nsSNP which are common in all 9 different algorithm tools and predicted as deleterious SNPs. Total 7 SNPs out of 78 SNPs met the criteria and classified them as high risk and selected for further analysis. Result of SIFT, Align GVGD, SNAP2, PROVEAN, PANTHER, Ph-D SNP, MuPro and iPTREE-STAB is shown in Table 1.\n\n    Evolutionary information is used to predict whether the substitution of amino acid affects the protein functions or not. Consurf web server was used to calculate the conservation score of amino acid residue of CHK2 protein to further analyze possible effect of 7 most deleterious nsSNP predicted through different computational tool. Results were obtained in the form of structural representation of the protein (S1 Fig). Highly conserved residues are predicted as either functional or structural based on their location either on protein surface or inside its core. Results obtained via conSurf represented all residues of CHK2 showing their structural and functional conservation levels. But we focused only on those residues which matched their positions with 7 high risk nsSNPs which we have identified. Taking this into consideration, those nsSNPs which are located at these conserved regions are considered immensely damaging to protein as compared to those at non-conserved sites. According to consurf output, p.Arg160Gly, p.Gly210Arg, p.Ser415Phe are highly conserved residues with conservation score of 9. Four amino acids were predicted average conserved. The result of consurf is shown in Table 2. The summary of deleterious prediction for each SNP is shown in Fig 2.\n\n    Post translational modification sites present within human CHK2 protein were predicted using ModPred. Out of 7 most significant nsSNPs, three amino acids p.Arg160Gly, p.Arg223Cys, p.Arg188Trp were predicted to be involved in post translational modification sites including proteolytic cleavage and ADP ribosylation. The results of modpred are shown in Table 2.\n\n    The minor allele frequency (MAF) was retrieved from ExAC Browser Beta (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000183765) for the nsSNPs of human CHK2 gene. The result of minor allele frequency of nsSNPs is shown in Table 2.\n\n    According to Interpro and NCBI Conserved Domain Search tool two major domains were predicted in CHK2 protein. One was STKc_Chk2 domain (serine/threonine kinase, cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2) which comprises 256-529 amino acids and another one was FHA domain (Forkhead associated domain) which comprises 156 to 244 amino acids. In CHK2 amino acid sequences 269-411 were predicted catalytic domain of ATP Binding site; 264-471 were predicted catalytic domain of dimer interface; 269-434 amino acid sequences were present in active site; 273-434 amino acid sequences were present in polypeptide substrate binding site. The 22 amino acid residues present in activation loop (Thr, Asp, Phe, Gly, His, Ser at 415, Lys, Ile, Leu, Gly, Glu, Thr, Ser, Leu, Met, Arg, Thr, Leu, Cys, Gly, Thr, Pro, Thr) of STKc_Chk2 domain. The 160 to 210 amino acid sequences present in polypeptide binding site on conserved domain of FHA domain (Arg at 160th and Gly at 210th position).\n\n    The 3D structure of full length CHK2 protein was not available in protein data bank. SPARKS-X modeled 3D structure of CHK2 protein by submitting FASTA amino acid sequences, where 10 best full length models were generated using different similar templates. The quality of full length models were predicted based on (>6) Z-score. All the templates were subjected to BLASTp analysis to identify the sequence similarity of the templates with CHK2 protein. The 3D structure generated using 3i6wA as a template was used for further analysis. The 3D structure was further refined by submitting structure in ModRefiner server which showed RMSD value 2.821 and TM-score of 0.9685 to initial model. After that refined structure was further validated using Verify3D and RAMPAGE tools. Ramachandran plot analysis by RAMAPAGE for the native protein model showed 541 (92.6%) residues in favoured region, 38 (6.5%) residues in allowed region and 5 (0.9) residues in outlier region. Varify-3D showed 66.21% of the amino acids have scored >=0.2 in 3D-1D profile. The results of both tools are shown in Table 3.\n\n    FT site server predicted 3 binding sites present in CHK2 protein. First binding site consisted residues Lys at 292th, Leu at 320th, Ile at 329th, Ile at 342th, Ile at 331th, Leu at 344th, Thr at 410th, Asp at 411th, Phe at 412th, Gly at 413th,His at 414 and Ser at 415th position. Second binding site consisted residues Trp at 93th, Tyr at 199th, Ile at 200th, Ala at 201th, Pro at 225th, Leu at 226th, Asn at 227th and Asp at 246th position. Third binding site constituted Trp at 93th, Asn at 197th, Ser at 198th, Tyr at 199th, Asp at 246th, Thr at 248th and Val at 249th position. Two binding sites are presented using PyMOL in Fig 3. Coach server also predicted Ser at 415 within ligand binding sites. The detailed results of COACH prediction are shown in Table 4.\n\n    The 3D structure of mutant of CHK2 protein was generated by substituting serine with phenylalanine at 415th position in wild type sequence and the sequence was submitted to SPARKS-X server. The 3D structure generated was further refined by submitting structure in ModRefiner server which showed RMSD value 2.310 and TM score of 0.9517. The prediction of TM score suggested the structural deviation of mutant protein as compared to native. After that refined structure was further validated using Verify3D and RAMPAGE. Verify 3D showed 60.75% of the amino acids have scored >=0.2 in 3D-1D profile. Mutant model is a good quality as having more than 90% region in favoured region. Mutant model showed (93.3%) residues in favoured region, 31 residues (5.3%) residues in allowed region and 8 (1.4%) residues in outlier region.",
        "Conclusion": "    The present study suggests that structure and function of CHK2 can be distributed by various nsSNPs. In native protein of CHK2 gene, out of 79 SNPs, seven major variants found were: p.Arg160Gly, p.Arg188Trp, p.Ile203Thr, p.Gly210Arg, p.Arg223Cys, p.Pro225His and p.Ser415Phe. Among seven most significant SNPs, 3 were highly conserved and 4 SNPs were averaged conserved residues. Among 7 most significant SNPs, 3 were predicted to be involved in post translational modifications. A variant of Serine Phenyl alanine at position 415 occurs in activation loop of protein-kinase domain of CHK2 protein hence is of particular concern as this is the functional domain of the protein. The one SNP p.Ser415Phe might interfere in interactions of CHK2 with ligand. Therefore, these nsSNPs can be strongly considered as key candidates in causing diseases related to CHK2 malfunction and hence will help in effective drug discovery and developing precision medicines. Wet lab experiments are needed to explore the effects of these polymorphisms on structure and function of protein.",
        "Discussion": "    The CHK2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, involved in cell-cycle regulation, in response to DNA damage, DNA repair and apoptosis pathway. Variants of CHK2 have been implicated in various types of cancer including breast cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphism plays an important role in most of the diseases. About more than 4 million unique human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) have been described by dbSNPs and 2% of the reported SNPs associate with monogenic diseases are present in protein coding region and hence predicted that these SNPs can be related to complex inherited disease traits. Testing the functional consequences of variant by using functional assay can be the best approach but it is quite costly and time consuming too. Hence, for this purpose we have exploited computational approach by using various in silico tools of different algorithms for the analysis of SNVs in CHK2 gene. To date, 13929 human CHK2 gene SNPs are reported in NCBI dbSNP (database) which have been located in non-coding, coding and regulatory regions. The coding SNVs cause amino acid variation which further alters the protein function and leads to disease susceptibility. All the nsSNPs may not have major deleterious effect on protein function, some may have neutral effect. Therefore it is necessary to differentiate deleterious SNPs from the neutral SNPs to analyze susceptibility of individual SNPs to diseases, and also to focus on those SNVs which are responsible for structural and functional consequences of CHK2 protein. However, to predict the pathogenic effect of nsSNP using single bioinformatic tool may not be reliable. In present study prediction of CHK2 genetic variants was accomplished by utilizing sequence and structure based bioinformatics tools- SIFT, Align GVGD, SNAP2, PolyPhen 2, PROVEAN, PANTHER, PhD SNP, MuPro and iPTREE-STAB. According to study of Hicks et al., and Thusberg and Vihinen, to identify most deleterious nsSNPs, SIFT and PolyPhen 2 were reported as best performing tools. To check the stability of protein, MuPro and iPTREE-STAB were used. Out of 79 nsSNP subjected to functional analysis 7 SNPs (p.Arg160Gly, p.Arg188Trp, p.Ile203Thr, p.Gly210Arg, p.Arg223Cys, p.Pro225His and p.Ser415Phe) were predicted to be most deleterious nsSNP in human CHK2 protein. To the best of our knowledge none of the studies showed the genetic risk of p.Arg160Gly, p.Arg188Try, p.Ile203Thr, p.Gly210Arg, p.Arg223Cys, p.Pro225His and p.Ser415phe with any known disease condition. p.Arg160Gly, p.Arg188Try, p.Ile203Thr, p.Gly210Arg, p.Arg223Cys and p.Pro225His all nsSNP are part of FHA domain which is activated in response to DNA damage. p.Arg160Gly marks the substitution of arginine (basic amino acid) by glycine (non-polar amino acid) and vice-versa in p.Gly210Arg substitution. p.Ile203Thr entails the substitution of isoleucine (nonpolar) to threonine (-OH containing amino acids) leading to decrease in stability of protein. In FHA domain, 2 SNPs (p.Arg223Cysand p.Arg188Try) leads to substitution of arginine (basic amino acids) to cysteine (sulphar containing amino acid) and tryptophan (nonpolar aromatic amino acid) which decrease protein stability. R160, G210, S415 are highly conserved residues with conservation score of 9. Four amino acids (R160, I203, R223 and P225) were predicted average conserved. p.Arg160Gly, p.Gly210Arg and p.Arg223Cys might interfere in post-translational modification of CHK2 protein as these residues were predicted to be involved in post translational modifications through ModPred. The Arg at 160 and Gly at 210 residue present in polypeptide binding site on conserved site of FHA domain. Ser 415 residue is present in STKc_Chk2 domain. In p.Ser415Phe substitution of serine (-OH containing amino acid) to phenyl alanine (non-polar amino acid). This residue is part of aimer interface, catalytic domain of ATP binding site and active site of STKc_Chk2 domain. Any change in this residue alters the stability of protein which is predicted by Mupro and iPTREE_STAB. Two amino acids S415 and P225 were predicted to be involved in ligand binding site interactions. These suggest that p.Pro225His and p.Ser415Phe might interfere in ligand binding site interactions. Several studies have investigated the role of CHK2 polymorphism as a genetic determinant for susceptibility to diseases. Several polymorphisms (p.Ile157Val, p.Asp252Gly, c.1100delC, p.Asp438Tyr and p.His371Tyr) have been reported for the CHK2 gene. Pritzlaff and their colleagues assessed multi-gene panel testing using male breast cancer patients and identified pathogenic variants i.e.c.591delA, p.Arg117Gly, p.Thr476Met, p.Ser428Phe, p.Iso157Thr, p.Gln29* andc.1100delC in different population. CHK2*c.1100delC and p.Ile157Thr were most studied in populations all over the world. The inherited variants CHK2 c.1100delC truncates the kinase domain of the CHK2 protein and is responsible for a two fold increase in breast cancer risk in families of northern and north-western European ancestry. According to Delimitsou and his colleagues study, p.Ile160Arg and p.Ile160Thr variants were characterized as damaging and p.Asp203Gly variant was characterized as benign. All these variants were located within the kinase domain. p.Ile160Arg was characterized as intermediate according to study done by Roeb et al in 2012. Different CHK2 variants were categorized as damaging according to in silico tools and yeast based assay i.e p.Trp93Arg, p.Cys108Arg, p.Arg117Gly, p.Arg145Trp, p.Arg148Gly, p.Ile160Arg, p.Ile160Thr, p.Asp162Gly, p.Asn166Ser, p.Gly167Arg, p.Leu183Ser, p.Leu183Phe, p.Leu236Pro, p.Ile251Phe, p.Arg346Cys, p.Arg346His, p.Asp347Ala, p.Asn352Asp, p.Gly370Glu, p.Cys385Arg, p.Thr387Ser, p.Tyr390Ser, p.Ala392Pro, p.Ala392Val, p.Glu394Lys, p.Cys420Thr, p.Tyr424His, p.Arg474Cys and p.His483Arg. Avraham Shaag and his team discovered two novel amino acid substitutions, p.Ser428Phe in the kinase domain and p.Pro85Leu in the N-terminal region. The individual having CHK2 sequence variants (c.1100delC) may contribute to the Li-Fraumeni syndrome in Dutch families. In Pakistan, two novel mutations p.Gln20X and p.Glu85X at exons 1 and 2 respectively have been identified in breast cancer patients. However the results were contradictory among different studies. By means of in silico, deleterious prediction done in the present study, the p.Gln20His and p.Pro85Leu were not predicted highly deleterious. However, Pro at 85 and Gln at 20th were predicted as conserved residue with conservation score of 7. However none of the study till now available that identify p.Pro225His and p.Ser415Phe nsSNPs as damaging. CHK2 variants found in this study have not been reported earlier so they need to be validated to check its significance. The major limitation of this study is the fact that it is in silico study thus the results cannot be blindly extrapolated to humans without validation by wet lab study. When we predict pathogenicity of CHK2 variants, it is important to conduct functional assay in cell-lines. In addition to this, analysing data from epidemiological and genetic studies as well as segregation analysis would provide more accurate classification.\n\n    As multiple CHK2 variants of unknown clinical significance emerge every day when performing genetic testing analyses in patients with cancer, a rapid variant assessment is of great importance. Therefore, the in silico assay used herein provides essential, fast and low -cost evaluation for the largest series of tested CHK2 variants to date, thus providing valuable information that can be ultimately implemented in clinical practice. Thus, the present study indicates that the procedure of computational approach provides an alternative approach to select SNPs targets by considering the role of SNPs on the functional attributes or molecular phenotype of protein. These results may be helpful for further understanding of CHK2 SNPs in disease susceptibility by laboratory experiments.",

        "Title": "    Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency: a clinical-genetic overview",
        "Abstract": "    Severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disorder, leading to development of emphysema in smokers at a relatively young age with disability in their forties or fifties. The emphysema results from excessive elastin degradation by neutrophil elastase as a result of the severe deficiency of its major inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT). The AAT expression is determined by the SERPINA1 gene which expresses codominant alleles. The three most common alleles are the normal M, the S with plasma levels of 60% of normal, and the severely deficient Z with levels of about 15% of normal. Homozygosity for the Z mutant allele is associated with retention of abnormal AAT in the liver, which may lead to neonatal hepatitis, liver disease in children, and liver disease in adults. Regular intravenous infusions of purified human AAT (AAT augmentation therapy) have been used to partially correct the biochemical defect and protect the lung against further injury. Two randomized controlled trials showed a trend of slower progression of emphysema by chest computerized tomography. Integrated analysis of these two studies indicated significantly slower progression of emphysema. AAT is quantified by immunologic measurement of AAT in serum, the phenotype characterized by isoelectric focusing, the common genotypes by targeted DNA analysis, and by sequencing the coding region of the gene when the AAT abnormality remains undefined. AATD is often unrecognized, and diagnosis delayed. Testing for AATD is recommended in patients with chronic irreversible airflow obstruction, especially in those with early onset of disease or positive family history. Testing is also recommended for immediate family members of those with AATD, asthmatics with persistent airflow obstruction, and infants and older subjects with unexplained liver disease. There are over 100 different AAT gene variants; most are rare and only some are associated with clinical disease.",
        "Introduction": "    The association between alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and emphysema was reported in the early 1960s by Laurell and Eriksson, who discovered five subjects with absent alpha1-globulin peaks when reviewing a large series of serum protein electrophoresis gels. They found out that three of the five had emphysema at an early age, 35-44 years, and that this was an inherited deficiency. The protein was named alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) because trypsin inhibition was initially used for its measurement; it is also termed alpha1-protease inhibitor, because it is the major protease inhibitor in plasma and its major function is inhibition of neutrophil elastase. Smokers with severe AATD are prone to develop panacinar emphysema with disability in their early forties and fifties. The subject has been reviewed in detail by the joint statement of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) in October 2003, and available free of charge from either Society's website, and in recent concise reviews.\n\n    Severe AATD is a relatively common inherited deficiency, based on newborn screening, with the highest frequency of 1/1640 found in Sweden, and about 1/5000 in the white population in Oregon, USA. Severe AATD is mostly unrecognized, and there may be several years of delay in the diagnosis after symptoms develop. Only about 20% of AATD subjects have been recognized in Sweden, which has the highest rate of detection of severe AATD. The prevalence of severe AATD in clinics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may depend on the pattern of referral; in one study from California, severe AATD was detected in about 2% of 965 patients with COPD.\n\n    This article briefly reviews clinical features of AATD, based partly on a previous article, provides an update of AAT augmentation therapy, and covers the biochemical and molecular genetic evaluations of AATD.\n\n    The AAT protease inhibitor (Pi) is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene and secreted into the plasma by the liver cells as a mature glycoprotein of 394 amino acids (molecular weight 52,000). The plasma AAT diffuses passively into the lung interstitium and alveolar lining fluid. Two co-dominant alleles determine the AAT Pi phenotype. The normal AAT genotype is termed MM, while severe deficiency is mostly due to the ZZ genotype having AAT serum levels of about 15% of normal. The Z protein is due to a single amino acid substitution of glutamine to lysine at residue 342 of the processed protein. This substitution results in conformational changes in the molecule leading to its polymerization and retention in the hepatocyte. This retention leads to deficient plasma levels as well as predisposing to liver disease. The Z antitrypsin is retained as inclusions in the liver, which stain positively with the periodic acid Schiff stain.\n\n    The heterozygote state (MZ) occurs in about 2%-3% of the Caucasian population, is more prevalent in northern than southern Europeans, and results in AAT levels about 50%-70% of normal. This genotype is associated with only slightly increased risk of development of COPD in smokers, as reviewed recently. The S protein variant has an amino acid substitution of glutamine to valine at residue 264 of the processed protein. The MS genotype has a prevalence of about 4%-11% in Europe, being highest in Spain and lowest in Scandinavia. The MS genotype is associated with AAT levels that are about 80% of normal, and is not a risk factor for disease. In contrast SZ smokers have an increased risk of developing emphysema, greater than MZ subjects but not as great as ZZ subjects, since their AAT serum levels are not as severely reduced. This statement is supported by a recent study comparing computerized tomography (CT) scan data and health status in 63 SZ subjects matched by age, gender, and smoking with ZZ subjects. The authors reported that less than half of the SZ individuals had CT scan evidence of emphysema, even among index cases, and had more frequent apical predominance of emphysema. In comparison, 86% of the ZZ subjects had emphysema. The SZ subjects had less impairment on pulmonary function testing, but had similar impairment with regard to health status as compared with the ZZ subjects.\n\n    Smokers with severe AATD are prone to develop disabling COPD with emphysema in their forties or fifties; however, a significant proportion present in their sixties. Severe deficiency is due to the ZZ genotype in about 95% of cases. Rarely, severe AATD is due to homozygous (\"null\") alleles resulting in no detectable plasma AAT. Severe AATD predisposes to hepatocyte injury and panacinar emphysema (involving the whole acinus), which tends to have a basal predominance, in contrast to the upper lobe predominance of centriacinar emphysema (involving the center of the acinus around the respiratory bronchiole), that is characteristic of smokers with MM genotype. However, in the ZZ subjects studied by Holme and Stockley, 58% had only panacinar emphysema, 16% had both panacinar and centriacinar emphysema, and 26% had only centriacinar emphysema. Only a minority of lifetime ZZ nonsmokers develops severe emphysema, and many do not develop pulmonary symptoms. The yearly decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in ZZ subjects is greater in smokers than in ex-smokers or never-smokers, but differs depending on whether the ZZ individuals were patients presenting with symptoms, or detected by family studies of AATD patients with COPD, or were detected by screening of the general population. A Danish study of ZZ patients reported that the 43 current smokers had a yearly FEV1 decline of 132 mL/year, significantly greater than the decline of 52 mL/year in the 100 ex-smokers. In a study of 608 adult ZZ individuals from the Swedish national antitrypsin register, only 45% of whom were identified through respiratory symptoms, the mean FEV1 decline was 70 mL/year in the 46 current smokers, 41 mL/year in the 351 ex-smokers, and 47 mL/year in the 211 never-smokers, compared with decline of about 30 mL/year in healthy nonsmokers. A recent study from the United Kingdom related the yearly decline in FEV1 to the severity of airflow obstruction in ZZ subjects, and found a mean annual decline over 3 years of 49.9 +- -7.4 mL/year. The fastest decline was in the group with moderate obstruction with FEV1 50%-80% predicted and lower in the severe group with FEV1 < 30% predicted. Genetic variations outside of the SERPINA1 gene, eg, polymorhpisms within the IL-10 or SFTPB (surfactant protein B) genes, are associated with reduced FEV1, and a specific tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha genotype is associated with the clinical phenotype of chronic bronchitis. These reports may partly explain the finding that ZZ individuals detected by screening family members of AATD emphysema patients have worse lung function than ZZ subjects detected by screening the general population, suggesting other inherited or familial factors. In addition, occupational and environmental air pollution can have an adverse effect on lung function, with a rapid decline in FEV1 with higher particle pollution (P = 0.024), and a rapid decline in lung diffusing capacity with higher ozone levels.\n\n    Emphysema with severe airflow obstruction at an early age (starting about 40-50 years) is the most common clinical manifestation of severe AATD in smokers; some patients present in their sixties. Chronic bronchitis may also be present in a significant proportion of patients. There is also an association with bronchiectasis and asthma. In a study of 424 ZZ patients who had clinical evaluation, CT scanning, and detailed lung function tests to determine clinical phenotype, 279 had emphysema, 159 had chronic bronchitis, and 83 had bronchiectasis. In this study, 124 subjects had two overlapping conditions, and 33 had all three conditions overlapping.\n\n    Treatment is similar to the treatment of usual COPD and emphysema, including complete abstinence from smoking, bronchodilator therapy including long acting bronchodilators, antibiotic therapy of respiratory tract infections and pneumonia, and pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations. By analogy to COPD without AATD, combination inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta-agonists may be helpful in subjects with reversible airflow obstruction or co-existing asthma or history of frequent exacerbations.\n\n    Severe AATD can lead to neonatal jaundice and hepatitis in infancy and childhood or liver disease and cirrhosis in childhood but most children recover without overt clinical liver disease. Although adults with severe deficiency are at increased risk for liver cirrhosis, clinical liver disease is not common. The liver disease is due to the abnormal retained Z AAT polymerizing and causing injury to liver cells. Research on prevention of polymerization and autophagy of the retained AAT, may lead to future therapy by increasing the AAT plasma level and preventing progression of liver and lung disease. At autopsy of cases with liver cirrhosis, hepatoma is frequently present.\n\n    There is also an association of severe AATD with the rare condition, necrotizing panniculitis (skin and subcutaneous inflammation), and with anti-neutrophil- cytoplasmic-antibody-positive vasculitis. Additional information is provided in a recent review.\n\n    In severe AATD, the predominant pathogenic mechanism in emphysema is elastolytic lung injury due to an imbalance between proteolytic and elastolytic enzymes released in the lung, and the reduced antiprotease protection in the lung. An imbalance, favoring elastin degradation and emphysema, occurs because of the severe deficiency of AAT, the lung's major antiprotease, combined with an increased release of neutrophil elastase in the lung. Neutrophil elastase release is induced by smoking and by the polymerized abnormal Z AAT acting as a neutrophil chemo-attractant. This pathogenic mechanism of protease-antiprotease imbalance may be partially corrected by regular intravenous infusions of purified human AAT (AAT augmentation therapy) to restore blood and lung antiprotease activity, and by smoking cessation to decrease the lung burden of neutrophil elastase release.\n\n    AAT intravenous augmentation therapy became available in America in 1989 after it was shown that regular intravenous therapy with purified human AAT at a weekly dose of 60 mg/kg in AATD subjects, partially corrected the AATD and the elastase inhibiting capacity in blood as well as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The half-life of the infused AAT was about 5 days. At that time, a randomized controlled clinical trial was considered not feasible because of the logistics and cost. Until about 10 years ago, there was only one commercial preparation of human AAT available (Prolastin , formerly by Bayer Inc and now by Talecris Biotherapeutics). It is prepared from pooled plasma that had individual units screened for viruses, and the purified preparation treated rigorously to protect against virus transmission. The aim of weekly intravenous therapy is to increase the AAT serum levels above a theoretically protective threshold level, of 0.8 g/L using the old commercial standard, and 11 umol/L (0.6 g/L) using a purified National Institutes of Health standard. This protective level is putative and contentious, and was based on studies in SZ subjects with moderate AATD, who exceeded this level and had only a slightly increased risk of developing emphysema. The aim of therapy is to reduce the excessive decline in lung function or slow down the progression of emphysema, but it is not expected to improve lung function or repair emphysema. Although monthly infusions of 250 mg/kg33 and biweekly infusions of 120 mg/kg34 have also been used, they are not officially approved since they do not achieve consistent serum protective levels. Recently, three other commercial preparations of AAT purified from pooled human plasma have been approved in the United States.\n\n    In 1989, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommended AAT augmentation therapy for severely deficient patients with significant airflow obstruction, if they had quit smoking and were receiving optimal medical therapy. In contrast, the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) in 1992 considered that augmentation therapy was still not established as definitive therapy, and required confirmation by a randomized clinical trial.\n\n    In 2001, the CTS published its position paper on AAT augmentation, reviewing three studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of AAT intravenous augmentation therapy. The same authors published an updated review in 2005, and used evidence-based criteria, to assess the studies with the highest level of evidence assigned Category A, and the lowest, Category D. Level A is from well designed randomized controlled trials with adequate numbers and consistent findings, level B is from randomized controlled trials with limited numbers or inconsistent results, and level C is from nonrandomized trials or observational studies.\n\n    Table 1 summarizes studies using objective data to assess clinical efficacy, published up to November 2010. The first two studies are observational studies evaluating the decline in FEV in subjects receiving augmentation therapy with subjects not receiving therapy, but since this was not a randomized allocation of therapy, the lower decline observed could be due to confounding factors as discussed in detail previously. In the US AAT Registry study subjects receiving augmentation therapy may have had better economic status and access to medical care which could have resulted in decreased mortality and the lower decline in FEV1. The third was a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of AAT augmentation (250 mg/kg every 4 weeks over 3 years) in 56 ZZ ex-smokers with moderate emphysema. In this study, CT scanning and computerized quantification was used to assess progression of emphysema. CT of the chest showed a trend (P = 0.07) favoring a slower progression of emphysema with AAT augmentation. (Level of evidence B; not enough power, small number of subjects). A fourth retrospective study compared the rate of decline in FEV1 in 96 patients with AATD, who were followed for a minimum of 12 months with a minimum of two lung function tests, both before and after weekly AAT augmentation.\n\n    Chapman et al reported a meta-analysis of the effect of augmentation therapy on the decline in FEV1 from published studies and data from their AAT Registry, but only one was a prospective randomized and placebo controlled trial, while all the others were observational studies with possible confounding factors. AAT augmentation reduced the rate of decline in FEV1 by 26% (17.9 mL/year) in the whole group of 1509 subjects; this effect was due to the subjects with FEV1 30%-65% of predicted (level of evidence C).\n\n    Recently, a randomized trial of AAT augmentation therapy over a period of 2.0-2.5 years was performed in 77 subjects with ZZ emphysema, to explore the role of CT densitometry in evaluating progression of emphysema. Thirty-eight subjects received weekly infusions of purified AAT and 39 received placebo. Four different techniques were used to evaluate the changes in CT densitometry, and there was a trend suggestive of a reduction in the rate of progression of emphysema with AAT augmentation compared with placebo, and P values ranged from 0.049 to 0.084 (Level of evidence B). A Cochrane review of this study and the previous 1999 randomized controlled trial, reported that when the two studies were combined in a meta-analysis, lung density measured by CT scan deteriorated a little less in the treated group than in the placebo group (difference 1.14 g/L; 95% confidence interval 0.14-2.14; P = 0.03). However, the Cochrane reviewers concluded that AAT augmentation therapy could not be recommended, because of the lack of evidence of clinical benefit, and the cost of treatment. An integrated analysis of the two randomized placebo controlled trials using CT scan progression of emphysema as the primary endpoint was recently published, and showed a lower rate of progression of emphysema as indicated by lung density (P = 0.006).\n\n    In conclusion, AAT augmentation has been generally safe and well tolerated in a large number of patients, both in the US and in Germany, with only a low incidence of adverse effects. The CTS guidelines in 2001 concluded that there was a suggestion of possible benefits to augmentation therapy and recommended reserving it to AATD subjects with FEV1 35%-50% predicted who quit smoking but continue to show a rapid decline in FEV1 > 80 mL/year. This rate of decline was based on the mean decline in FEV1 of about 80 mL/year in the Danish untreated patients with FEV1 35%-49% predicted in the German-Danish study. The same authors recommended in 2005 extending augmentation therapy to subjects with FEV1 > 35% and <65% predicted (instead of <49%) who had a rapid decline in FEV1. The executive summary of the joint ATS/ERS statement on AATD recommended AAT augmentation for individuals with severe AATD and airflow obstruction, and suggested it would be of more benefit in subjects with moderate airflow obstruction (FEV1 35%-60% of predicted). It should be noted that AAT augmentation therapy was available for treatment in only a few countries in Europe in 2005, but the number increased by the end of 2008 to 15.\n\n    Multiple routine laboratory tests are available to facilitate the diagnosis of AATD. The tests can be grouped into one of three general types: an initial investigation, a preliminary diagnostic test, and a definitive diagnostic test (Table 2). The initial investigation is a serum or plasma alpha1-antitrypsin level and is required in all cases. Preliminary diagnostic tests can be performed using targeted DNA analysis or Pi isoelectric focusing (PiIEF) tests. In either case, the preliminary diagnostic test distinguishes between the presence or absence of the common Z and S mutations. Of note, the ATS/ERS lists PiIEF in conjunction with serum AAT levels as the gold standard for the diagnosis of AATD. However, a more sensitive and specific test is gene sequencing of the coding region of the SERPINA1 gene, the gene which codes for the AAT protein. For this reason, we consider the SERPINA1 gene sequencing to be the definitive test for AATD. Although, the definitive test (gene sequencing) is most sensitive, it is expensive and unnecessary for the vast majority of case investigations. These methods will be discussed individually below before describing how they can be used in concert to optimally diagnose patients with AATD. Other test utilization strategies have been described since the ATS/ERS guidelines were published.\n\n    The initial investigation for AATD is a serum (or plasma) AAT level. This test is typically performed by immuno-nephelometry or other antibody-based detection methods. The test quantifies the serum level of the protein that is deficient in the disease and, as such, is the first step in the investigation of any patient at risk for the disorder. AAT levels can also be measured on capillary blood collected on filter paper cards. The test result can be compared to published genotype specific reference intervals. Of note, the serum AAT levels discussed in this paper refer to levels measured with methods calibrated to Certified Reference Material 470. A new protein reference material has been proposed. AAT methods standardized to this new reference material will yield results that are modestly different.\n\n    A serum AAT level relatively close to or above 1.5 g/L excludes AATD as the primary cause of symptomatic lung or liver disease and voids the need for further investigation. The threshold value of serum AAT used to identify those at risk for AATD is debatable. Ideally, a testing program will identify all patients who carry the ZZ, Z null, and SZ genotypes. The highest serum AAT levels of these three genotypes would be seen in the SZ patients who have a median serum AAT level of 0.6 g/L with the 97.5th percentile at 0.82 g/L. In the case of an acute phase response, or exposure to high estrogen states, the serum AAT level may double. Therefore, a cutoff of approximately 1.20 g/L would identify the vast majority of the ZZ, Z null, and SZ mutations. Similarly, the MZ patients would also be identified in most cases as the mean serum AAT level (in the absence of an acute phase response) is 0.85 g/L with the 97th percentile being 1.25 g/L. Therefore, setting the threshold at 1.20 g/L will identify all symptomatic patients with serum AATD and most asymptomatic carrier patients.\n\n    Once the serum AAT level has been identified as being relatively low, a preliminary diagnostic test to determine the presence or absence of the S and Z mutations is the most expedient next step. From this preliminary test, a presumptive genotype can be obtained: no Z or S mutation, heterozygous for Z mutation, homozygous Z mutation, heterozygous S mutation, homozygous S mutation, or compound heterozygous for S and Z. The serum AAT level and the patient's presumptive genotype are compared to determine whether the results are discordant or concordant (eg, homozygous Z patients should have serum AAT < 0.7 g/L, whereas no mutation should be >1.0 g/L - see Snyder reference). If the presumptive genotyping test is concordant with the observed serum AAT level, then the relatively low serum AAT level does not require further investigation. Patients with discordance between the presumptive genotyping test and the observed serum AAT level may require definitive testing. The roles of the respective tests in the diagnosis of AATD testing are summarized in Table 2. Of note, this algorithm will identify the vast majority of cases of clinical AATD but not all. Patients with rare mutations that do not affect serum AAT concentrations may be missed. To avoid missing these relatively mild and rare cases requires performance of AAT gene sequencing or PiIEF in all cases submitted for investigation. All published algorithms will miss some rare causes of AATD.\n\n    Either targeted DNA analysis or PiIEF test can be performed as a preliminary diagnostic test. Both tests are effective in identifying patients with symptomatic AATD due to ZZ or SZ mutations. Both methods are also effective in identifying carriers of either the S or Z mutations. The two methods do have practical and interpretive differences, which are discussed in more detail below. However, for the most part, the two tests can be used interchangeably.\n\n    Targeted DNA analysis strategies can take various forms. These methods require small amounts of DNA and can be done on noninvasive or minimally invasive samples such as a capillary blood collected on a filter paper card. The test results unambiguously indicate the presence or absence of heterozygosity or homozgyosity for both the S and the Z mutations.\n\n    The analysis of the data from most targeted DNA analysis methods is straightforward in that it is similar to that required for any other gene mutation screening method. This simplicity is in contrast to the more difficult task of interpreting PiIEF tests (see below). The major limitation of the targeted DNA analysis strategy is that this method is unable to detect SERPINA1 mutations aside from the common S and Z mutations. As such, patients with null mutations and other pathologic mutations (eg, Mmalton) would go undetected if these methods were utilized in isolation.\n\n    The PiIEF test, also known as AAT phenotyping test, is based on the principle that mutations in the AAT gene (SERPINA1) will impart changes to the isoelectric point of the AAT protein. Serum samples are electrophoresed usually on a polyacrylamide gel upon which a narrow pH gradient (pH 4.0-5.0) has been established. This pH range has been selected so that the range of isoelectric points of the various AAT variants is encompassed and maximum separation of variants can be achieved. Each of the proteins will migrate through the gel from the point of application toward the pH that is equal to its isoelectric point, whereupon it will stop and focus. Following this focusing step, the gel is stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the proteins. Visualization can be enhanced by antibody detection. However, immunofixation is not often necessary for interpretation, as the level of AAT protein is adequate (even for the Z variant) to be detectable by stain alone, and because a fairly clean background is obtainable due to the low level of non-AAT proteins in this pH range. The normal M variant yields a characteristic five-band pattern: two major bands and three minor bands. This microheterogeneity has been attributed (at least in part) to differences in the post-translational sialic acid content of the protein. The same microheterogeneity is also exhibited by the other variants, but the minor bands are more difficult to visualize in the deficient variants because of the amount of sample that is typically applied for analysis. The S and Z variants are readily distinguished because of the characteristic separation of their major bands from the major bands of the normal M variant; the S bands have a higher isoelectric point than the M bands, and the Z bands have an even higher isoelectric point still. Correct identification is further ensured by including patient controls corresponding to these variants to serve as markers with each analytical run. PiIEF techniques thereby result in the straightforward detection of the S and Z mutant proteins as well as normal AAT proteins, including M1, M2, M3, and F variants. Due to the co-dominant expression of AAT alleles, both heterozygotes and homozygotes of these variants may be identified by this methodology. Additionally, atypical banding patterns - ie, those that are not consistent with the aforementioned variants - may be observed, and can suggest the presence of a rare (normal or deficiency-causing) variant, which would be missed by the previously mentioned targeted DNA analysis for S and Z mutations. PiIEF alone, however, cannot positively identify these rare variants without running the corresponding patient control, which is often not available. Therefore, gene sequencing may be needed for definitive determination.\n\n    It is important to recognize additional challenges and limitations of the AAT phenotyping test. A high level of technical expertise and experience is required for both performing the test and for the interpretation of results. Despite that, with practice and optimizing of protocols, consistently interpretable gels can be routinely achieved. A recently available commercial method produced by Sebia  (Norcross, GA, USA), should facilitate consistent high quality PiIEF results. Of note, dried capillary blood collected on filter paper cards may also be used for PiIEF. This development enables the full range of initial and preliminary diagnostic tests to be available via this minimally invasive and efficient sample collection method.\n\n    Still it remains, as for the polymerase chain reaction-based detection method, that routine testing using PiIEF can only definitively detect certain AAT mutations that are associated with clinical AATD. Specifically, it cannot directly detect mutant AAT proteins that result from null mutations, or those mutations that do not result in an altered isoelectric point of the AAT protein (eg, Mmalton).\n\n    Definitive testing is required when neither the preliminary diagnostic tests nor the patient's clinical information explain an observed low serum AAT level. Some patients will have a clinical explanation for a low serum AAT level, including protein energy malnutrition, protein losing states (nephropathy, protein losing enteropathy), and liver disease. In most cases, such clinical explanations will be associated with a general deficiency of hepatic plasma protein levels (eg, albumin). When identified, a clear clinical explanation may obviate the need for gene sequencing. When no clinical explanation is identified, the definitive test of sequencing the coding region of the AAT gene (SERPINA1) is required to investigate discordance between the presumptive genotype and the observed serum AAT level.\n\n    The SERPINA1 gene codes for an unprocessed immature protein of 418 amino acid residues. The canonical isoform of the AAT protein results from cleavage of the 24 amino acid signal peptide from the N-terminus, creating the mature protein of 394 amino acids; therefore, current recommended nomenclature differs from legacy nomenclature by 24 amino acids. The Z and S mutations account for approximately 95% of mutations reported in individuals with AATD; other SERPINA1 mutations associated with AATD have been reported throughout the gene (Table 3). Of note, the AAT mutations are assigned letter names based on the electro-phoretic mobility of the protein product, which is in turn determined by its isoelectric point. As researchers have identified additional mutations, many of them sharing a common letter designation, the naming convention has become less useful. The M designation in particular is a nonspecific term that refers to proteins with severe mutations (eg, Mmalton) as well as to the common normal variant (M1, M2, M3). In Table 3, the common genetic mutations of the SERPINA1 gene are listed using standard mutation description nomenclature alongside the traditional or legacy letter names.\n\n    Sequencing of the four coding regions and their intron/exon boundaries will detect the majority of all SERPINA1 mutations reported in association with clinical AATD. The exceptional mutations not detected by sequencing include large scale deletions, insertions, inversions, or complex rearrangements and mutations within the regulatory regions or introns of the gene. To date, only large-scale deletions and mutations within the regulatory regions of the SERPINA1 gene have been described, representing only four of all described mutations. When sequencing is used routinely in the investigation of AATD, SERPINA1 mutations as well as silent variant changes are often identified. Resources to discriminate mutations from silent polymorphism are readily available (eg, https://research.cchmc.org/LOVD/home.php). The limitations of the definitive method include those of cost, which is related to both the material and technical cost of gene sequencing and to the necessary expertise required to interpret the significance of any identified changes in the gene sequence.\n\n    The tests discussed above are useful to diagnose patients with symptomatic AATD as well as to identify patients who carry AAT gene mutations but who are currently asymptomatic. Knowledge of AAT mutation status may motivate patients to stop exposure to tobacco smoke and to minimize exposure to other environmental pollutants. The ATS/ERS guidelines recommend testing for AATD in siblings of affected probands with severe AATD, and consideration and discussion of testing in offspring, parents, and relatives of affected probands. Testing of potentially affected family members would involve utilizing a diagnostic method that is sensitive to the mutation type carried by the proband (eg, if the proband is ZZ, targeted DNA analysis or PiIEF), as well as measurement of the serum AAT level. The preliminary diagnostic test and the serum AAT level can then be compared to determine the need for additional definitive testing.\n\n    Prenatal genetic testing may also be required in the case of an expectant parent who carries or is homozygous for the Z or a null mutation. The potential partner would need to be screened for the S and Z mutations by targeted DNA analysis or by PiIEF. These results require correlation with the individual's serum AAT level. Where the serum AAT level is lower than expected relative to the preliminary diagnostic test result, gene sequencing may be necessary to exclude rare mutations.",

        "Conclusion": "    AATD is a well studied disorder that remains an area of active research. The clinical awareness of AATD by physicians has been suboptimal for a number of years and has not improved on follow-up. However, this concern may be alleviated in the future as there are continued efforts to increase the clinical awareness of AATD, and improve laboratory facilities for AAT evaluation. These efforts are buoyed by the expectation that AAT augmentation therapy will ultimately improve clinical as well as radiologic outcomes. When clinicians do consider AATD, they will have access to screening and confirmatory diagnostic investigations which are both less invasive and more sensitive due to improvements in laboratory technology.\n\n    Disclosure\n\n    Dr Abboud has participated in two advisory board meetings for Talecris Biotherapeutics.
