        "Title": "    Germline MLH1 and MSH6 mutations from two Lynch syndrome families identified in a patient with early-onset of endometrial cancer: A case report",
        "Abstract": "    Patients harboring different MMR gene mutations from two Lynch syndrome families are rare.\n\n    The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome-related endometrial cancer at the age less than 40 is uncommon.\n\n    We reported a case with germline MLH1 and MSH6 mutations from two families, developing endometrial cancer at the age of 37.\n\n    An earlier cancer screening for patients carrying two MMR mutations might be needed.\n\n    Lynch syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, leading to the loss of expression of MMR heterodimers, either MLH1/PMS2 or MSH2/MSH6, or isolated loss of PMS2 or MSH6. Concurrent loss of both heterodimers is uncommon, and patients carrying pathogenic variants affecting different MMR genes are rare, leading to the lack of cancer screening recommendation for these patients.\n\n    Case presentation:\n\n    Here, we reported a female with a family history of Lynch syndrome with MLH1 c.676C > T mutation. She developed endometrial cancer at 37 years old, with loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression. Immunohistochemical staining on tumor samples incidentally detected the additional loss of MSH6 expression. Whole exome sequencing on genomic DNA from peripheral blood revealed MSH6 c.2731C > T mutation, which was confirmed to be inherited from her mother, who had an early-onset ascending colon cancer without cancer family history.\n\n    This is a rare case of the Lynch syndrome harboring germline mutations simultaneously in two different MMR genes inherited from two families with Lynch syndrome. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer at the age less than 40 years is uncommon for Lynch syndrome-related endometrial cancer. This suggests an earlier cancer screening for patients carrying two MMR mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Lynch syndrome (LS), is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with a spectrum of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), endometrial cancer, and other malignancies. The syndrome results from germline mutations primarily in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, such as mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), mutS homolog 6 (MSH6), and PMS1 homolog 2 (PMS2). The pathogenesis involves a germline mutation in one of the MMR genes, followed by a second hit in the remaining wild-type allele, resulting in the inactivation of MMR proteins and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). This deficiency triggers tumorigenesis as base-base mismatches and insertions/deletions generated during replication remain unrepaired. Tumors with dMMR typically exhibit increased alterations in tandem repeat lengths within microsatellite regions, referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI).\n\n    Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for MMR protein expression and/or MSI testing is currently recommended by guidelines for all endometrial cancer patients to maximize LS screening sensitivity. Confirmatory germline genetic testing follows to establish the LS diagnosis. Risk for specific cancer types in LS varies with specific MMR gene mutations. Tailored surveillance and prevention strategies, based on cancer type risk and age of onset, are recommended. For instance, LS-associated endometrial cancer risk increases significantly after age 40, with suggested screening starting at 30-35 years. However, LS with two MMR gene mutations is rare, requiring more data to establish cancer risk and screening recommendations. Here, we present a case of LS with germline mutations in two different MMR genes inherited from two LS families. Notably, endometrial cancer developed at 37, an unusual age for LS-associated cases.",

        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Deficient MMR tumors typically exhibit loss of expression in one of the MMR heterodimers, either MLH1/PMS2 or MSH2/MSH6, or isolated loss of PMS2 or MSH6. Concurrent loss of expression in proteins from both MMR heterodimers is uncommon. In this case, we present an endometrial cancer patient from a LS family with a MLH1 c.676C > T mutation. In addition to the expected loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression, IHC staining on the tumor sample incidentally revealed an additional loss of expression in MSH6. ES on genomic DNA from blood identified an MSH6 c.2731C > T mutation. Subsequent confirmation showed that this mutation was inherited from her mother, who had early-onset ascending colon cancer despite no cancer family history. The unusual pattern of MMR loss underscores the importance of routine assessment of MMR protein expression in patients with endometrial cancer. Moreover, diagnosing LS in a case without a cancer family history, such as the patient's mother, emphasizes the necessity of genomic testing for patients when dMMR is detected, because the negative family history could be caused by the small families, lack of knowledge of the family history, and the death of relatives at a relatively young age from non-cancer causes. Additionally, the diagnosis of endometrial cancer before the age of 40 is uncommon for LS-related endometrial cancer, suggesting that earlier cancer screening may be warranted for patients carrying two MMR mutations.\n\n    Cases with concurrent loss of expression in proteins from both MMR heterodimers have been reported in various studies. This uncommon MMR protein expression pattern, observed in less than 5 % of all dMMR tumors, is mostly documented in gastrointestinal tract tumors. A recent study by Freitas et al reported a relatively high incidence of concurrent loss of MMR heterodimers in endometrial carcinoma. Out of 116 cases, 15 (12.9 %) showed loss of both MLH1/PMS2 and MSH2/MSH6. However, this elevated occurrence of unusual MMR protein expression in endometrial cancer contrasts with findings from prior studies. Therefore, further research is necessary to clarify the frequency of concurrent loss of MMR heterodimers in endometrial cancer.\n\n    The loss of MMR protein expression can result from either germline mutations in one of the MMR genes or acquired inactivation of MMR protein expression. Previous studies have indicated that most cases with concurrent loss of expression in proteins from both MMR heterodimers were caused by the epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 gene and somatic mutations in the other MMR gene. In some instances, germline mutation in one MMR gene was followed by somatic mutations affecting the second MMR gene. While Yilmaz et al reported the presence of germline mutations in two different MMR genes leading to the concurrent loss of proteins in MMR heterodimers, it remained unclear whether the germline mutation was inherited from the maternal, paternal, or was a de novo mutation. In our case, germline sequencing analysis identified a well-known pathogenic variant in MLH1 and MSH6, respectively. The patient is a member of LS family with an MLH1 mutation. Further genomic analysis of blood from her mother, who did not have any family history of cancer, confirmed the diagnosis of LS and the origin of the MSH6 mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first case demonstrating LS with germline mutations in two different MMR genes simultaneously, inherited from two LS families.\n\n    Cancer risks linked to germline mutations in the four MMR genes exhibit notable differences. The cumulative incidence of any cancer by age 70 is higher for MLH1 (72 %) and MSH2 (72 %) mutation carriers, while it is lower for those with PMS2 (18 %) and MSH6 (54 %) mutations. Specifically, the cumulative incidence of endometrial cancer by age 70 is 34 %, 24 %, 51 %, and 49 % for carriers of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 mutations, respectively. Although lifetime risks for endometrial cancer associated with MMR gene mutations are high, the risks do not see a significant increase until after the age of 40. Cumulative risks in MLH1 and MSH6 mutation carriers at age 40 are relatively low, standing at 3 % and 2 %, respectively. In our case, germline mutations in both MLH1 and MSH6 genes were detected, and endometrial cancer manifested at the age of 37, which is younger than the median age at diagnosis for LS-related endometrial cancer. The co-occurrence of MLH1 and MSH6 mutations may contribute to this earlier onset of endometrial cancer, suggesting that earlier screening should be considered for patients with concurrent germline mutations in different MMR genes.",

        "Title": "    The proportion of endometrial tumours associated with Lynch syndrome (PETALS): A prospective cross-sectional study",
        "Abstract": "    Lynch syndrome (LS) predisposes to endometrial cancer (EC), colorectal cancer, and other cancers through inherited pathogenic variants affecting mismatch-repair (MMR) genes. Diagnosing LS in women with EC can reduce subsequent cancer mortality through colonoscopic surveillance and aspirin chemoprevention; it also enables cascade testing of relatives. A growing consensus supports LS screening in EC; however, the expected proportion of test positives, and optimal testing strategy is uncertain. Previous studies from insurance-based healthcare systems were limited by narrow selection criteria, failure to apply reference standard tests consistently, and poor conversion to definitive testing. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of LS and the diagnostic accuracy of LS testing strategies in an unselected EC population.\n\n    This was a prospective cross-sectional study carried out at a large United Kingdom gynaecological cancer centre between October 2015 and January 2017. Women diagnosed with EC or atypical hyperplasia (AH) were offered LS testing. Tumours underwent MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC), microsatellite instability (MSI), and targeted MLH1-methylation testing. Women <50 years, with strong family histories and/or indicative tumour molecular features, underwent MMR germline sequencing. Somatic MMR sequencing was performed when indicative molecular features were unexplained by LS or MLH1-hypermethylation. The main outcome measures were the prevalence of LS in an unselected EC population and the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and tumour testing strategies for risk stratifying women with EC for MMR germline sequencing. In total, 500 women participated in the study; only 2 (<1%) declined. Germline sequencing was indicated and conducted for 136 and 135 women, respectively. A total of 16/500 women (3.2%, 95% CI 1.8% to 5.1%) had LS, and 11 more (2.2%) had MMR variants of uncertain significance. Restricting testing to age <50 years, indicative family history (revised Bethesda guidelines or Amsterdam II criteria) or endometrioid histology alone would have missed 9/16 (56%), 8/13 (62%) or 9/13 (69%), and 5/16 (31%) cases of LS, respectively. In total 132/500 tumours were MMR deficient by IHC of which 83/132 (63%) had MLH1-hypermethylation, and 16/49 (33%) of the remaining patients had LS (16/132 with MMR deficiency, 12%). MMR-IHC with targeted MLH1-methylation testing was more discriminatory for LS than MSI with targeted methylation testing, with 100% versus 56.3% (16/16 versus 9/16) sensitivity (p = 0.016) and equal 97.5% (468/484) specificity; 64% MSI-H and 73% MMR deficient tumours unexplained by LS or MLH1-hypermethylation had somatic MMR mutations. The main limitation of the study was failure to conduct MMR germline sequencing for the whole study population, which means that the sensitivity and specificity of tumour triage strategies for LS detection may be overestimated, although the risk of LS in women with no clinical or tumour predictors is expected to be extremely low.\n\n    In this study, we observed that age, family history, and histology are imprecise clinical correlates of LS-EC. IHC outperformed MSI for tumour triage and reliably identified both germline and somatic MMR mutations. The 3.2% proportion of LS-EC is similar to colorectal cancer, supporting unselected screening of EC for LS.\n\n    Emma Crosbie and colleagues investigate the prevalence of and strategies for identifying Lynch syndrome among women with endometrial cancer.\n\n    Endometrial (womb) cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological cancer in the developed world, and its incidence is rising. A significant minority (around 3%) of EC are caused by an inherited genetic predisposition called Lynch syndrome (LS).\n\n    EC may be the first sign that a woman has LS. She is likely to survive this cancer but develop other preventable cancers related to LS later in life. Her family members are also at risk.\n\n    Identifying women with LS can enable them to reduce their risk of new cancers, for example, through bowel (colorectal) cancer surveillance (colonoscopy).\n\n    We do not know how many women with EC have LS or how best to identify them; current practice is based on experience in bowel cancer and may not be accurate in EC.\n\n    We tested 500 women with EC treated in a large tertiary referral centre in the North West of England for LS.\n\n    We did not preselect women to test based on clinical or tumour characteristics. We tested tumours for features of LS called mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI). Women with strongly suggestive clinical or tumour characteristics underwent germline LS testing.\n\n    In total, 16 of 500 women (3%) had LS, and these women could not always be predicted by their age or family history.\n\n    MMR deficiency was more accurate than MSI at identifying LS-EC, picking up 16/16 (100%) versus 9/16 (56%).\n\n    In our study, we found that 3% of women with endometrial cancer have LS and can benefit from strategies to reduce their future cancer risk.\n\n    Our results suggest that it may be best to test everyone because preselecting women to test based on clinical or tumour characteristics misses cases of LS.\n\n    In this population, tumour MMR deficiency was more accurate than MSI at identifying LS in EC.\n\n    Our results should be interpreted with caution because we did not do germline testing on all women, and the number of women we tested was relatively small.",
        "Introduction": "    Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological cancer in developed countries, and incidence is rising. Although mostly driven by obesity and decreased parity, a significant minority is caused by Lynch syndrome (LS), an inherited susceptibility to defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR). At least 1:280 of the general population carries a pathogenic variant in an MMR gene:MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 (path_MMR):the vast majority of whom are undiagnosed. The risks of EC, ovarian cancer (OC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) in path_MMR heterozygotes are approximately 35%, 11%, and 46%, respectively. These risks are significantly higher than for the general population (EC-3%, OC-1%, and CRC-5.5%).\n\n    Often the first malignancy affecting women with LS, EC provides a unique diagnostic opportunity. Most women survive EC but remain at increased risk of associated cancers, particularly CRC. Cascade testing of relatives generates on average 3 further diagnoses per index case. These path_MMR carriers can benefit from chemoprophylaxis, risk-reducing surgery, family planning, and cancer surveillance. Unselected screening of EC for MMR deficiency and/or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H, a hallmark of MMR deficiency) has advantages that extend beyond LS carrier identification. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade immunotherapy is most effective in MMR deficient tumours, and molecular characterization defines prognosis and treatment eligibility.\n\n    Path_MMR carriers' association with EC is well established; however, the proportion of EC patients likely to test positive for LS is uncertain, with estimates spanning <1% to >10%. The variation in estimates comes from methodological heterogeneity, small sample sizes, and incomplete testing. Initial tumour triage by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or MSI with/without MLH1-methylation testing selects women for definitive constitutional analysis. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these strategies is unknown in EC. For instance, MSI testing has reduced sensitivity in path_MSH6 tumours. Selecting test populations by age and/or family history, failure to apply reference standard tests consistently, and poor conversion to definitive testing are all potential sources of bias. Most previous studies involve insurance-based healthcare systems; this is fraught with difficulty because fear of lack of reimbursement by services and increased insurance premiums in individuals influences testing decisions. Thus, the aims of this prospective study were to (1) establish the prevalence of LS and (2) evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of common LS testing strategies in an unselected EC population within a non-insurance-based healthcare system.",
        "Methods": "    The Proportion of Endometrial Tumours Associated with Lynch Syndrome (PETALS) study was sponsored by the University of Manchester, United Kingdom, and approved by the North West Research Ethics Committee (15/NW/0733; S1 Protocol). The study was prospectively registered (Cancer Research-UK clinical trial database, ref-13595). It is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (S1 Checklist), and the primary data set is also provided (S1 Data).\n\n    Women were recruited from gynaecology clinics at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT), a large gynaecological cancer centre, between October 2015 and January 2017. Women diagnosed with EC or atypical hyperplasia (AH) over the preceding 5 years were eligible for recruitment without demographic or histological restrictions. AH was included to capture the full spectrum of endometrial neoplasia. All women gave written, informed consent to participate, providing blood-DNA, tumour, and clinical data (age, body mass index [BMI], self-reported ethnicity) including detailed family histories (pedigrees). The latter were scored using revised Bethesda, Amsterdam II, and Prediction of MMR Gene Mutations-v.5 scores (PREMM5). Additional samples were procured from women with EC who had consented to their clinical data, tumours, and DNA being used for future research between 2013 and 2014 at MFT; their detailed pedigrees were not available.\n\n    Hysterectomy and biopsy specimens were assessed by 2 specialist gynaecological pathologists according to FIGO-2009 staging criteria (EC) and WHO classification system (AH). Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were reported as previously described. Tumour molecular profiling used the hysterectomy specimen when possible, but diagnostic endometrial specimens were used when hysterectomy was not performed or when equivocal IHC was repeated. All tissue was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded according to local clinical protocols. Tissue blocks with the greatest tumour content (>70%) were chosen for DNA extraction. Tumour was either microdissected from 5 x 10 mum unstained sections or cored from tissue blocks, depending on tumour content. Nonmalignant adjacent tissue was selected for comparative constitutional MSI analysis.\n\n    IHC for the 4 MMR proteins was performed using the automated Ventana BenchMark ULTRA IHC/in situ hybridisation (ISH) staining module and the OptiView, 3'diaminobenzidine version 5 detection system (Ventana Co., USA) in a laboratory that participates successfully in external quality assurance (EQA; UK NEQAS ICC and ISH, Module 7B; https://www.ukneqasiccish.org; S1 Text). The proportion of stained tumour epithelial component and intensity of staining was scored by 2 expert independent observers using tumour stroma as internal control as previously described. Examples of complete and 'patchy' MMR protein loss are illustrated in S1 Text.\n\n    MSI (and MLH1-methylation) analysis was performed in a UKAS ISO15189-accredited MSI testing reference laboratory that successfully participates in EQA (https://www.genqa.org). DNA was extracted and underwent sodium bisulfite conversion using the Epitect Plus FFPE kit (Qiagen, UK). The MSI analysis system version 1.2 (Promega, USA) was used with standardised clinical protocols. Fluorescent-labelled primers were used to co-amplify 7 markers, including 5 mononucleotide-repeat markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, and MONO-27), and 2 control pentanucleotide-repeat markers (Penta-C/Penta-D). MSI status was determined by 2 independent scientists. Identical fragment profiles between tumour and matched normal tissue for all 5 mononucleotide loci was considered microsatellite stable (MSS); discordance in one mononucleotide locus was MSI low (MSI-L). Discordance in 2 or more mononucleotide loci was MSI high (MSI-H). Only those with MSI-H tumours were considered at risk of LS; this is consistent with expert consensus.\n\n    Reflex MLH1-methylation testing was performed on MLH1 and/or PMS2-deficient and/or MSI tumours as previously described. Purified DNA was amplified with bisulfite specific primers in triplicate. An MLH1 promoter region containing 4 CpG dinucleotides whose methylation status is strongly correlated with MLH1 expression was analysed using pyrosequencing (PSQ 96MA). Two independent scientists interpreted the pyrograms. 'Hypermethylation' described >10% mean methylation across the 4 CpG dinucleotides on over two-thirds of replicate analyses. A proportion of MLH1-hypermethylation cases underwent reference standard germline MMR sequencing to exclude co-existing path_MLH1 variants.\n\n    Indications for germline analysis were age <50 years; meeting revised Bethesda guidelines/Amsterdam II criteria; PREMM5 score >10%; and indicative tumour molecular features, specifically MMR deficiency (MMRd, tumour epithelial loss of >=1 MMR protein on IHC) and/or MSI-H unexplained by somatic MLH1-hypermethylation.\n\n    DNA was extracted from 2 mL lymphocyte blood (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] anticoagulant) using Chemagic DNA blood chemistry (CMG-1097-D) on an automated Perkin Elmer Chemagic-360 Magnetic Separation Module and a JANUS Integrator 4-tip Automated Liquid handling platform. DNA was eluted into 400 muL buffer. The concentration and quality of extracted DNA samples were measured using a Nanodrop ND-8000 spectrophotometer. MMR genes MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 were amplified using long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by next generation sequencing (NGS) using Illumina SBS version 2 2 x 150 bp and Illumina MiSeq to analyse the coding region, flanking sequences to +-15 bp and known splicing variants (minimum 100x coverage depth) of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 (S1 Text). Variant identification and calling was via an in-house bioinformatic pipeline. Reported sequence changes and regions with <100x coverage were retested via Sanger sequencing using BigDye version 3.1. Copy number analysis to detect large genomic rearrangements affecting the MMR genes was performed using MLPA MRC-Holland probe mixes: P003-D1 MLH1/MSH2 and P072-C1 MSH6. Variant nomenclature followed Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) guidelines (http://www.hgvs.org/vamomen) using reference sequences: LRG_216,t1(MLH1); LRG_218,t1(MSH2); LRG_219,t1(MSH6). Exons were numbered consecutively starting from exon 1 as the first translated exon for each probe mix. Cases with PMS2 protein loss, normal MLH1-methylation, and no path_MLH1/MSH2/MSH6 variant underwent path_PMS2 analysis at the regional specialist Yorkshire and North East Genomic Laboratory. When pathogenicity of the variant was unclear, Ian Frayling was consulted as InSiGHT representative to adjudicate. Somatic MMR sequencing was performed for discordant tumour/germline results (S1 Text).\n\n    We determined that a sample size of 497 was required to find a prevalence of LS-EC of 3% (95% confidence intervals 1.5%-4.5%). The statistical analysis plan was devised a priori. Diagnostic accuracy measures were conducted to establish the utility of clinical parameters and tumour triage strategies for risk stratifying women with EC for MMR germline sequencing, including age, family history, histological subtype, density of TILs, MMR deficiency by IHC, MSI status, and MLH1-methylation status. There were no data-driven changes to analyses. Descriptive univariate analysis was performed using Student t test or two-way ANOVA for normally distributed continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed continuous variables. Normality of the data was assessed by the Belanger and D'Agostino method with the Royston adjustment (alpha = 0.05). Pearson's chi-squared test was used to test for independence of categorical variables. Diagnostic accuracy measures (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) were calculated using standard formulae, with confidence intervals estimated by the Clopper-Pearson method. The reference standard was germline analysis and only women with path_MMR variants (not variants of unknown significance [VUS]) were considered to have LS (disease positive). Women were treated as disease negative (no LS) when germline analysis was not indicated. The exact McNemar's test was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of IHC-based versus MSI-based testing for LS identification. Logistic regression was used to identify clinical predictors of MSI, MMR deficiency, MLH1-hypermethylation, and germline path_MMR variants.",
        "Results": "    In total, 305 women were invited to participate in PETALS and undergo testing for LS (pedigree cohort). Only 2 declined, and 3 were ineligible (not EC/AH on final pathology; Fig 1). A further 200 women treated for AH/EC at MFT in the preceding 2 years (2013-2014) were included, but detailed family histories were unavailable (nonpedigree cohort). The final study population comprised 500 women with median age and BMI of 65-years and 32kg/m2, respectively, of predominantly white British ethnicity (81%; Table 1). There were 470 EC cases (94%) and 30 AH (6%). Most EC were low grade (62%) and early stage tumours (72%) of endometrioid subtype (70%). All 500 women underwent both MMR-IHC and MSI analysis, with targeted MLH1-methylation testing. Of these, 135 women underwent germline LS testing for the following indications: MSI-H MMR deficient tumour with normal MLH1-methylation (n = 6); MSI-H MMR deficient tumour (MLH1-methylation testing not indicated; n = 13); MMR deficient and MSS/MSI-L (n = 19); MSI-H MMR-proficient tumour (n = 6); age <=50 years (n = 35); and strong family history (n = 12). A subset of women with tumour MLH1-hypermethylation (n = 26) and subset of MSS/MSI-L patchy tumour MMR deficiency (n = 18) also underwent testing (see Fig 1).\n\n    We identified 16 path_MMR variant carriers, giving a 3.2% overall LS prevalence (95% CI 1.84%-5.14%). There were 8 path_MSH6, 4 path_MSH2, 2 path_MLH1, and 2 path_PMS2 variant carriers (Table 2). Three had known LS, 2 died shortly after EC diagnosis, and the remaining 11 were offered, of whom 10 accepted, genetic counselling. To date, 14 relatives have also received genetic counselling. One woman carried 2 VUS_MSH6, considered pathogenic in combination (S2 Text). A further 10 women had MMR variants that were not recognized by InSiGHT (https://www.insight-group.org), including 5 previously unreported variants (S3 Text). Greatest discrepancy between IHC and MSI findings was observed for those with a germline path_MSH6 variant with 5/8 demonstrating MSH6 loss on IHC but MSS. One path_MSH6 variant (MSH6 c.2731C>T p.(Arg911Ter) was observed in 3 index cases and therefore could represent a local founder mutation; however, review of the local clinical database indicates this variant only affects 5/487 of local LS families.\n\n    In total, there were 73 women <=50 years, of whom 7 (10%) had LS. All 7 had indicative tumour molecular features (MMRd +- MSI-H). Only screening women <50, <60, and <70 years would have missed 9, 6, and one LS diagnosis, respectively (Table 3). A further 35 women <50 years with MSS/MSI-L MMR-proficient tumours underwent germline testing for LS; 4 (11.4%) had VUS_MMR, but no further path_MMR variants were identified.\n\n    Comprehensive pedigree data were available for 300 women. Only 7/300 (2%) and 9/300 (3%) women with detailed pedigrees met the Amsterdam II criteria and revised Bethesda guidelines, of whom 4 (57%) and 5 (56%) had LS, respectively. All women with LS also had indicative tumour molecular features. The overall mean PREMM5 score was 3.2% (SD 2.4%). A total of 164/299 (55%) women had scores greater than the 2.5% recommended cut-off for germline testing, with mean PREMM5 score 4.3% in this subgroup, and 11 (6.7%) having LS. An additional 12 women with MSS/MSI-L MMR-proficient tumours underwent germline testing because of a previous LS-associated cancer (n = 3) or an indicative family history (including Amsterdam II [n = 2], revised Bethesda [n = 4], and PREMM5 > 10% [n = 3]). None carried a path_MMR variant or VUS_MMR.\n\n    In total 132/500 (26%) tumours were MMR deficient (Table 4), of which 83 were MSI-H. Women with MMR deficient tumours were older than those without MMR loss (mean difference 3.3 years, t test [unequal variances] p = 0.007). Of the 24 women who had tumours with patchy MMR loss, one had a germline VUS_MMR but none had LS. One MSS AH case had patchy MSH6 loss and was subsequently found to have a VUS_MSH6, but all other AH samples had intact MMR. Thirteen tumours failed first attempt but not repeat MMR-IHC testing.\n\n    In total, 89/500 (18%) tumours were MSI-H, and 21/500 (4%) were MSI-L. None of the 6 MSI-H MMR-proficient tumours were LS-associated (Table 4). Women with MSI-H tumours were older than those with MSS tumours (mean difference 4.7 years, p < 0.001). Mononucleotides BAT-25 and/or BAT-26 accounted for 95% of MSI-H events. No AH samples were MSI-H. Eights tumours failed first attempt but not repeat MSI analysis.\n\n    In total, 100 tumours underwent reflex MLH1-methylation analysis because of MLH1-deficiency on IHC. Of these, 83 (16% of 500) were hypermethylated (Table 4), and none of the 26 hypermethylated cases (31%) who underwent germline analysis had LS. One sample failed MLH1-methylation analysis several times. Women with MLH1-hypermethylated tumours were older than those with MMR-proficient tumours (t test [unequal variance] p < 0.001) and those with normal MLH1-methylation MMR deficient tumours (t test [unequal variance] p = 0.0034). Of 15 women with normal MLH1-methylation MMR deficient tumours, 3 (20%) had LS, all of which had complete IHC loss (3/10, 30%).\n\n    Somatic MMR testing was performed when indicative tumour molecular features were unexplained by LS or MLH1-hypermethylation: MSI-H MMR deficient (n = 8), MSS/MSI-L MMR deficient (n = 7), MSI-H MMR-proficient (n = 6), patchy MMR deficient (n = 18), and germline VUS_MMR (n = 1) cases (S4 Text). Six tumours failed (MSI-H MMR deficient [n = 2], MSI-H MMR-proficient [n = 1], and patchy MMR deficient [n = 3] cases). This comprehensive testing left just 1.9% (2/106) MMR deficient tumours unexplained by a path_MMR variant/epigenetic silencing (Table 4).\n\n    MMR-IHC was superior to MSI analysis for the identification of LS (Table 3). Sensitivity and specificity were 100% versus 56.3% (16/16 versus 9/16; difference 43.75%, 95% CI 13.2%-74.3%, p = 0.016) and 80.6% versus 83.5% (390/484 versus 404/484; difference -2.9%, 95% CI -5.2% to -0.6%, p = 0.013), respectively. Specificity was increased to 97.7% for both MMR-IHC and MSI with reflex MLH1-methylation testing (p = 1). The area under the ROC curve for PREMM5 and age was 0.73 versus 0.71, respectively, with PREMM5 superior to age, although neither matched MMR-IHC for selecting women for germline LS testing (S5 Text). Eleven LS-associated tumours (69%) were of pure endometrioid histotype, and 15 (94%) had high tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte counts. MMR germline sequencing was conducted for 135/500 women, which means that the sensitivity and specificity of tumour triage strategies for LS detection may be overestimated in this study, although the risk of LS in women with no clinical or tumour predictors is expected to be extremely low.\n\n    Increased age was positively associated with tumour MMR deficiency (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.04, p = 0.013), MSI-H (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p = 0.003), and MLH1-hypermethylation (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06, p < 0.001) (tumours in which methylation testing was not indicated were assumed to have normal MLH1 methylation), whilst negatively associated with LS (0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.006). PREMM5 was positively associated with LS (OR 3.88, 95% CI 1.74-8.65, p = 0.001) but not with tumour test outcomes (IHC, MSI, or MLH1-hypermethylation). BMI was negatively associated with MMR deficiency (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00, p = 0.036) and marginally negatively associated with LS (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-1.00, p = 0.055). Smoking was not consistently associated with any test outcomes.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this prospective study, we found a 3.2% prevalence of LS in an unselected EC population and established MMR-IHC with targeted MLH1-methylation testing as the most accurate method of selecting women for germline LS testing. MSI was insufficiently sensitive, missing nearly half of all LS-EC. Family history by PREMM5 score showed excellent sensitivity but poor specificity; the reverse was true for Amsterdam II criteria/revised Bethesda guidelines. Restricting testing to women <60 years would miss a third of all LS cases, but only one case was >70 years.\n\n    The 3.2% prevalence of LS-EC is consistent with the results of our recent systematic review. Only 6 previous studies tested unselected EC populations of >=500 women for LS, all of which were conducted in the insurance-based healthcare systems of the US and Australia. This impacted both the proportion of eligible women consenting to study participation as well as their willingness to undergo definitive germline testing. To our knowledge, this is the first unselected EC population-based study of LS testing conducted in the fully state-funded healthcare system of the UK. We recruited >99% of newly diagnosed EC patients attending our institution during the recruitment period, all tumours underwent both IHC and MSI analysis, and germline LS testing was conducted for 135/136 eligible women. We found MSI analysis had a poor sensitivity, most notably in path_MSH6 carriers. This phenomenon has been described previously; however, no large EC studies to date have germline tested all women with both MMR deficient and MSI-H tumours to enable a direct comparison between the 2 tumour triage strategies. For example, Goodfellow and colleagues carried out germline LS testing on just 5% of their population-based cohort, including those with MSH6-deficient MSI-H tumours (15/107 MMR deficient tumours with normal MLH1 methylation) but not MSH6-deficient MSI-L or MSS tumours (6/107); it is therefore not possible to calculate the sensitivity of MSI analysis for path_MSH6 carriers from these data. Hampel and colleagues found all 6 endometrial tumours from path_MSH6 carriers were MMR deficient, but just 3/6 were MSI-H; despite this, tumours were triaged for MMR germline sequencing using the results of MSI analysis, and only a subset underwent MMR-IHC. Our comprehensive testing strategy also identified somatic path_MMR variants in MMR deficient and/or MSI-H tumours unexplained by LS. This had been noted to a lesser extent in previous studies [33,34] and is an important finding because it removes many of the tumours that would otherwise have been considered 'Lynch-like' and posed a clinical management dilemma.\n\n    There were 5 key strengths to our study. First, we recruited 99% of eligible women, ensuring an unbiased population of consecutive patients unrestricted by age, histological subtype, or treatment modality. Recruitment rates of around 50% have been reported previously, mainly from insurance-based healthcare systems. Second, all tumours underwent MMR-IHC, MSI, and targeted MLH1-methylation testing, and all but one woman with indicative tumour features underwent germline path_MMR testing. This compares favourably to most studies with incomplete testing and allowed us to test selection criteria and tumour-based triage strategies. Third, all analyses were carried out to quality-assured clinical standards in specialist pathology and genetics referral laboratories. Fourth, all but 2 of the 106 (1.9%) MMR deficient tumours were explained by MLH1-hypermethylation, somatic MMR mutation, or LS. Fifth, our inclusion of AH, part of the spectrum of LS-EC, is unusual but justified because identifying LS in women with AH not only supports future risk-reducing interventions but also impacts their immediate treatment decisions.\n\n    The main limitation was failure to conduct germline LS sequencing on the whole study population. In total, 135/500 (27%) women underwent germline testing, including every woman with established clinical (age <=50 years, positive family history) or tumour characteristics (MMR deficient or MSI-H unexplained by MLH1-hypermethylation) predictive of LS; thus the prevalence of LS in the 365 (73%) women who did not undergo germline LS sequencing is expected to be extremely low. Further, our 27% germline sequencing rate is considerably higher than that reported by other population-based studies in EC. Other limitations include the small sample size with concomitantly few LS diagnoses and correspondingly wide CIs around our sensitivity and specificity estimates. Nevertheless, our study was large enough to detect a significant difference in sensitivity between MMR deficiency and MSI-based tumour triage. All women were treated at one gynaecological cancer centre in North West England; although this might hinder generalizability to other populations, the clinicopathological characteristics of our EC population reflect the UK national picture. The relatively high proportion of path_MSH6 variant carriers in our cohort affected the sensitivity of MSI-based tumour triage, and our study may underestimate its true value within a wider geographical distribution, although 2 women with path_MSH2 and homozygous path_PMS2 variants also demonstrated MSS tumour phenotypes. Pedigree data were not available for all patients and were self-reported and therefore prone to error, mirroring the situation in routine clinical practice.\n\n    Our findings support the unselected screening of EC for LS. We show that age, family history, and pathological findings are of limited value in selecting women for testing. Universal germline testing is not financially feasible, mandating tumour-based triage. How best to achieve this is contentious, but the prevailing wisdom is that MSI and IHC are equivalent, despite limited evidence to support this. Our data provide strong evidence that MMR-IHC with targeted MLH1-methylation testing is superior to MSI-based testing in EC. It reduces the proportion of women requiring germline sequencing without missing any cases, lowering costs, and improving cost-effectiveness. The identification of MMR deficient EC is of clinical importance. It allows clinicians to tailor treatments, explain prognosis, predict cancer recurrence, and individualize follow-up. Furthermore, women want to be tested; it is striking that 99% of eligible women approached during routine gynaecological cancer care agreed to participate, and 10/11 newly identified LS carriers attended genetic counselling and supported cascade testing of at-risk family members.\n\n    Unselected screening of EC for LS leads to the discovery of VUS_MMR. These create a clinical conundrum because new variants can be challenging to classify. Indeed, 15 of our 27 MMR variants were not previously reported to either the ClinVar or InSiGHT data sets. This highlights the need for international multidisciplinary expert teams to explore the clinical significance of VUS_MMR and/or investment in saturation genome editing platforms for high throughput analysis. Such infrastructure is established for MMR variant interpretation and behoves all clinical laboratories to interpret variants according to a single set of defined criteria (https://www.insight-group.org/criteria/) before universal screening for LS in EC begins in earnest.\n\n    To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date exploring the prevalence of LS in an unselected EC population treated within a non-insurance-based healthcare system. Consent for LS testing was taken by gynaecologists during routine clinical care. In this cohort, we found IHC outperforms MSI as a means of tumour-based triage and reliably identifies both germline and somatic MMR deficient tumours to inform clinical care. The overall prevalence of LS in EC was 3.2%, which is comparable to that of CRC, and justifies a similar recommendation for unselected LS screening. We endorse, when resources allow, the universal screening of EC for LS using IHC, targeted MLH1-methylation testing, and, where indicated, germline sequencing for path_MMR variants.",

        "Abstract": "    Familial brain tumor incidences are low. Identifying the genetic alterations of familial brain tumors can help better understand the pathogenesis and make therapy regimens for these tumors.\n\n    An elder female and a younger male were diagnosed with brain tumors at the age of 10 and 5, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of the two patients' blood, primary brain tumor tissues, and their parents' blood samples was performed, which revealed that the two tumor samples harbored extremely high somatic mutation loads. Additionally, we observed pigmentation on the male patient's skin.\n\n    Germline, biallelic mutation of MSH6:a gene related to DNA mismatch repair whose defect will result in constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD):is causal for the brain tumors of these two siblings.",
        "Introduction": "    Brain tumors are the most common and lethal type of solid tumors in children. They range from the least common, non-invasive, surgically curable pilocytic astrocytoma to the common, highly malignant glioblastoma (GBM) and medulloblastoma (MB). Both of GBM and MB are classified as grade IV in malignancy by the World Health Organization (WHO). Familial brain tumor incidences, on the other hand, are relatively low. Gorlin syndrome patients caused by inherited PTCH1 mutations can develop MB and Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients resulted from germline TP53 inactivation are associated with malignant gliomas. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome, which was called Turcot syndrome for many years, is also associated with an increased risk of brain cancer.\n\n    CMMRD syndrome is a distinct childhood cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by diverse malignancies in hematological organs, the brain, the large intestine and other organs. Patients mostly fail in reaching their adulthood. The most prevalent are brain tumors and the age at diagnosis has been estimated to be 10.3 years old. The majority of the brain tumors are malignant gliomas, but MB and other central nervous system tumors have also been reported. GBM is the most lethal tumor in CMMRD patients. The disease is caused by biallelic germline mutations that occur in one of the four mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). The protein products of these MMR genes are highly conserved from bacteria to humans, which are responsible for the correction of mismatches, insertions and deletions during DNA replication and recombination. Humans have two types of MMR enzymes: MutS (hMSH2, hMSH3 and hMSH6) and MutL (hMLH1, hMLH3, PMS1 and PMS2). MutS enzymes first recognize mismatched nucleotides in DNA and then work in combination with MutL enzymes to activate other proteins to remove the mismatched DNA strand and synthesize a new DNA strand. In MutS, hMSH6 and hMSH2 function as a heterodimer to recognize single base mismatches as well as 1-2 base insertions and deletions, while the complex of hMSH3 and hMSH2 recognizes larger insertion or deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides. Patients with MSH6 nullizygous mutations commonly develop brain tumors before the age of 10.\n\n    The diagnosis of CMMRD syndrome is difficult due to many reasons. Firstly, CMMRD syndrome is caused by biallelic germline mutations of MMR genes but their parents with only one allelic mutation show a low risk of cancer predisposition. Secondly, CMMRD syndrome lacks unique clinical features and clear diagnostic criteria. Its clinical presentation varies and the phenotypes also overlap with other tumor syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.\n\n    In this case report, an elder sister and a younger brother were diagnosed with GBM and MB, respectively. Further genomic sequencing confirmed that both patients harbored biallelic MSH6 mutations, thus confirming the diagnosis of CMRRD syndrome.",
        "Methods": "    Genomic DNA was extracted from the tumor and blood samples using a genomic DNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech, DP304). The library was constructed and sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with 150 bp pair-end reads (GeneWiz Inc.).\n\n    The raw 150 bp pair-end reads were trimmed using fastp and aligned to hg38 human genome using Sentieon's bwa mem algorithm (Sentieon Inc, San Jose, CA). The germline variations were called following Sentieon's DNAseq pipeline  and the somatic variations were called using TNseq pipeline . The germline and somatic variations were annotated by Annovar. The genomic alignment result was visualized by Integrative Genomics viewer (IGV). MutSignatures was used to analyze and visualize mutation signatures. Circos map was produced using Circos.",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    CMMRD syndrome is a rare childhood cancer susceptibility syndrome. The lack of awareness and broad cancer spectrum of malignancies contributes to diagnosis difficulty. Most CMMRD patients have multiple CALM reminiscent of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). It has been demonstrated that NF1 is a frequent somatic mutation target of MMR deficiency. Parents of CMMRD patients commonly have no symptoms of NF1, while the offspring may present NF1-associated signs when they inherit both of the mutant MMR alleles from their parents. In the two cases, for clinicians, CMMRD syndrome was not taken into consideration, and the two patients were diagnosed as common brain tumors in the beginning because of scarce knowledge of this syndrome and little attention to the diffuse and irregular hyperpigmented macules and the absence of a family history of neoplasms. The diagnosis was confirmed only when germline biallelic inactivation of MSH6 and a huge somatic mutation load in the tumor were discovered by high throughput sequencing. Of note, microsatellite instability (MSI) is a recognized biomarker for MMR deficiency, which is also can be an auxiliary index for diagnoses. In addition, immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of MMR proteins could be an inexpensive alternative method to help CMMRD diagnosis.\n\n    The parents of the two cases had no history of colorectal cancers but they did carry a heterozygous mutation of MSH6. Compared with MSH2 and MLH1, the clinical severity of heterozygous MSH6 and PMS2 mutations is lower, and the diagnosis of CMMRD syndrome often lacks a family history of cancer. It is significant for clinicians to be aware of CMMRD syndrome and assess cancer risk in these patients and their relatives. Early cancer surveillance and timely interventions may benefit their future lifetime. There have been clinical diagnostic criteria and guidelines for surveillance proposed by the European Consortium \"Care for CMMR-D\" (C4CMMR-D). Commencing MRI scanning at 2 years old and scanning once every 6-12 months is suggested, but whether it will help improve survival has not been validated.\n\n    In the two cases, radiotherapy received an effective therapeutic outcome, but the information available for optimal treatment is still an urgent requirement. Radiotherapy and adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy are the commonly used treatment for brain tumors. However, for CMMRD patients with brain tumors, chemotherapy is typically not a feasible choice because commonly used chemotherapeutic alkylating agents can only initiate efficient tumor damage with a functional MMR system. According to the statistics collected by the European C4CMMRD Consortium, five out of six patients showed poor response to chemotherapy. The therapeutic efficiency of TMZ has also been reported to be limited in two patients with MSH6-mutated recurrent GBM, and its use should be avoided due to its known ability to accumulate somatic mutations and promote neoplastic progression. In the previous case reports regarding children with brain tumors carrying biallelic MSH6 mutations, the survival was mostly 12-36 months after surgery and subsequent chemoradiotherapy, and many demonstrated resistance to TMZ. Effective chemotherapeutic drugs for CMMRD syndrome are still lacking, but early detection of tumors may allow for the most effective chemotherapeutic approach.\n\n    In summary, accurate diagnoses, long-time surveillance and effective therapies for CMMRD patients are still difficulties to be overcome. Several case reports have elaborated immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) can improve the survival of CMMRD patients with malignant gliomas. One of them reported that a 5-year-old female GBM patient with biallelic MSH6 mutations was treated with nivolumab and showed a durable response to ICPI treatment and regression of the tumor. For the siblings in this report, ICPI may be taken into consideration if the tumor reoccurs.",

        "Title": "    Retained Mismatch Repair Protein Expression Occurs in Approximately 6% of Microsatellite Instability-High Cancers and is Associated with Missense Mutations in Mismatch Repair Genes.",
        "Abstract": "    Immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair protein expression is widely used as a surrogate for microsatellite instability status- an important signature for immunotherapy and germline testing. There are no systematic analyses examining the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry for microsatellite instability-high status. Mismatch repair immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability testing were performed routinely as clinically validated assays. We classified germline/somatic mutation types as truncating (nonsense, frameshift, in/del) versus missense and predicted pathogenicity of the latter. Discordant cases were compared to concordant groups: microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair-deficient for mutation comparison and microsatellite stable/ mismatch repair-proficient for immunohistochemical comparison. 32 of 443 (7%) microsatellite instability-high cases had immunohistochemistry. Four additional microsatellite instability-high research cases had discordant immunohistochemistry. Of 36 microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant immnohistochemistry, 30 were mismatch repair-proficient while 6 (5 MLH1 and 1 MSH2) retained expression of the defective mismatch repair protein and lost its partner. In microsatellite instability-high tumors with discordant immunohistochemistry, we observed an enrichment in deleterious missense mutations over truncating mutations, with nearly 70% (25/36) of cases having pathogenic germline or somatic missense mutations, as opposed to only 17% (6/36) in a matched microsatellite instability-high group with concordant immunohistochemistry (p=0.0007). In microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant immunohistochemistry and MLH1 or PMS2 abnormalities, less cells showed expression (p=0.015 and p=0.00095 respectively) compared to microsatellite stable/ mismatch repair-proficient cases. Tumor mutation burden, MSIsensor score, and truncating mismatch repair gene mutations were similar between microsatellite instability-high cases with concordant versus discordant immunohistochemical expression. Approximately 6% of microsatellite instability-high cases have retained mismatch repair protein expression and would be missed by immunohistochemistry-based testing, hindering patient access to immunotherapy. Another 1% of microsatellite instability-high cases show isolated loss of the defective gene's dimerization partner, which may lead to germline testing of the wrong gene. These cases are enriched for pathogenic mismatch repair missense mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Mismatch repair protein expression via immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability status are integral parts of the management of many patients with solid cancers. Microsatellite instability testing is performed using DNA, either by polymerase chain reaction or next generation sequencing. Microsatellite instability polymerase chain reaction measures the degree of indel mutations involving microsatellite loci via a set of 5 mononucleotide microsatellites in the tumor vs normal DNA. Microsatellite instability assessment via next generation sequencing with MSIsensor is performed via assessment of all available microsatellites covered by a given panel. We have previously validated use of MSIsensor with our institutional next generation sequencing assay, MSK-IMPACT. Immunohistochemistry is used to assess the presence or absence of mismatch repair protein expression, and complete absence of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and/or MSH6 usually correlates with the presence of microsatellite instability-high status in the DNA. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) universally recommends microsatellite instability testing/ mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry screening for all patients with colorectal carcinoma as well as various other types of solid cancer . In addition, patients with stage II-III microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair-deficient colorectal carcinoma are managed differently than mismatch repair-proficient/ microsatellite stable colorectal carcinoma as the former do not benefit from 5-fluorouracil adjuvant therapy. More broadly, mismatch repair protein loss or microsatellite instability-high status signifies eligibility for immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment  as well as the possibility of Lynch syndrome in all types of solid malignancies. Patients with microsatellite instability-high status and advanced malignancies are often eligible for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy based solely on microsatellite instability status whereas microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient status in itself is not diagnostic of Lynch Syndrome but is generally a pre-requisite before further work-up with clinical, personal, and family history as well as germline sequencing to rule in or out the possibility of Lynch Syndrome. It is important that mismatch repair-deificent/ microsatellite instability-high status is detected when present so that patients do not miss an opportunity to be treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab.\n\n    Mismatch repair protein expression status corresponds with DNA-based microsatellite instability (microsatellite instability) testing results over 90% of the time. Due to the high concordance rate and certain advantages that immunohistochemistry has over microsatellite instability testing, including turnaround time, knowledge of which mismatch repair gene is abnormal, use of only 4 slides, and sensitivity in low tumor purity cases; many institutions perform mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry rather than microsatellite instability testing.\n\n    However, in certain circumstances, mismatch repair protein expression status and microsatellite instability status are discordant. Low tumor purity affects microsatellite instability results, usually by resulting in an underestimation of the degree of microsatellite instability. Neoadjuvant therapy can induce loss of MSH6 expression in cases with microsatellite stable status. Even rarer, authors have described isolated microsatellite instability-high cases with proficient (some degree of nuclear expression) mismatch repair protein expression as well as MLH1 germline mutant Lynch syndrome cancers with retained MLH1 expression. Here, we systematically review 443 microsatellite instability-high cases also assessed by mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry and report the incidence, molecular, and clinicopathologic features of mismatch repair-proficient yet microsatellite instability-high cases.",
        "Methods": "    Selection criteria for this study included formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples with MSK-IMPACT results from January 2014 to December 2018, microsatellite instability-high status by MSIsensor, and mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry results available.\n\n    The microsatellite instability status of all cancers sequenced with MSK-IMPACT from January 2014 to December 2018 was reviewed. MSK-IMPACT is a hybridization capture based assay that assesses somatic mutations, copy number, structural variants in 468 genes in its current iteration (410 in v5 and 341 in v3) against a patient's matched blood sample. Microsatellite instability status is also routinely assessed using a modified and clinically validated version of MSIsensor v0.2 (github: https://github.com/ding-lab/MSIsensor). MSIsensor is a bioinformatic program that interrogates all available microsatellite loci with coverage of at least 20x against a matched normal. The median number of loci assessed by each version of MSK-IMPACT was 1152 in v3, 1241 in v5, and 1581 in v6. Each available locus is evaluated with a goodness of fit test to determine whether the locus is stable or unstable loci. The percentage of unstable loci are then expressed as a score .\n\n    We used all non-silent exonic and splicing (within the +/- 2bp of intron/exon boundary) mutations (single nucleotide and insertions/deletions) that were reported to the patients and divided the total number of bases where we report mutations in each version of the panel: v3: 896,665 ; v5: 1,016,478 and v6: 1,139,322.\n\n    Immunohistochemical results for mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) were reviewed for tumors that were microsatellite instability-high on MSK-IMPACT; and slides for any immunohistochemistry results signed out as 'retained,' 'equivocal,' 'weak,' or 'faint' were further reviewed. Mismatch repair-deficient status was defined as complete loss of nuclear expression of mismatch repair protein(s) within the tumor as per prior studies. Mismatch repair-deficient cases with discordant patterns of germline or somatic mutations (ex: isolated PMS2 deficiency with MLH1 hypermethylation and negative germline results) were also reviewed. When available, immunohistochemistry slides were reviewed for cases with discordant mismatch repair statuses and the percent of tumor cells expressing each mismatch repair protein was estimated. A 3:1 control set of immunohistochemistry slides from mismatch repair-P/ microsatellite stable cases was also assessed, and the percent of tumor cells expressing each mismatch repair protein was visually estimated by JFH for all tumor cells available and recorded from microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant mismatch repair protein expression statuses as well as the control set of mismatch repair-proficient /microsatellite stable cases.\n\n    MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing was performed via bisulfite conversion followed by pyrosequencing as previously described  on samples that were microsatellite instability-high with no known germline or somatic mismatch repair gene mutations.\n\n    All immunohistochemistry and molecular assays were clinically validated and performed in CLIA accredited laboratories.\n\n    All coding regions of EPCAM, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 are covered in all versions of MSK-IMPACT. Because truncating mutations (frameshift, stop gain, and splicing) should result in a premature stop codon, nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript, and subsequent lack of mismatch repair protein expression, we theorized that deleterious mismatch repair gene missense mutations are a potential cause for retained mismatch repair protein expression in microsatellite instability-high cases. We therefore assessed whether deleterious mismatch repair gene missense and in-frame indel mutations were enriched in this subset, as compared to truncating mutations (frameshift, stop gain, and splicing). The pathogenicity of somatic missense mutations was predicted using Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL). The number of cases with a pathogenic mismatch repair gene missense mutation was compared against a 3:1 control set of microsatellite instability-high cases with concordant immunohistochemistry to investigate whether microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant mismatch repair protein expression statuses are enriched in mismatch repair gene missense mutations which lead to expressed but potentially dysfunctional proteins.\n\n    A Mann-Whitney Test was used for comparison of percentage of tumor cells expressing mismatch repair immunohistochemistry, and the frequencies of mismatch repair gene mutations were compared with two-sided Fisher's exact test.",
        "Results": "    Examination of 29,530 clinical cases sequenced with MSK-IMPACT assay revealed 582 (2%) tumors were microsatellite instability-high. We reviewed 443 microsatellite instability-high cases with available mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry, which identified 32 cases (7.2%) with discrepant immunohistochemistry results. These 32 tumors included 17 colorectal carcinomas, 9 endometrial carcinomas, and 1 each of various other cancer types (Table 1). Discordant mismatch repair immunohistochemistry occurred in 6.4% of microsatellite instability-high colorectal carcinomas and 4.9% of microsatellite instability-high endometrial carcinomas.\n\n    Four additional microsatellite instability-high colon cancers from Lynch syndrome patients with discordant mismatch repair protein expression statuses were also identified via MSK-IMPACT testing performed in the research setting, for a total of 36 discordant cases identified for further analysis. These cases were compared against mutation data from a 1:1 matched cohort of 36 microsatellite instability-high, mismatch repair immunohistochemistry concordant cases and mismatch repair immunohistochemistry data from a 1:1 matched cohort of 36 microsatellite stable, mismatch repair-proficient cases.\n\n    Nuclear dot-like MLH1 staining has been reported in the literature in cases with abnormal mismatch repair expression and MLH1 germline mutations. In the current study, 2 microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair immunohistochemistry discordant case showed nuclear dot-like MLH1 expression (Figure 1A): 1 of these cases had MLH1 promoter hypermethylation while the other had a truncating somatic MLH1 mutation (p. P300Hfs*40). Interestingly, 1 of 108 microsatellite stable/ mismatch repair-proficient cases also showed nuclear dot-like MLH1 expression, demonstrating that while nuclear dot-like (also called nucleolar or granular) MLH1 expression is rare, it is not specific for mismatch repair-deficient/ microsatellite instability-high status.\n\n    While the majority of cases displayed a degree of expression of all 4 mismatch repair proteins (Figure 1B), 5 cases with MLH1 abnormalities displayed isolated loss of PMS2 (Figure 1C, 1D) while 1 case with MSH2 abnormalities (both somatic and germline) displayed isolated loss of MSH6. The DNA level abnormalities in these 6 cases are specified in table 1. The remaining 30 cases displayed varying degrees of expression of all 4 mismatch repair proteins, with the abnormal mismatch repair gene often showing a decreased percent of tumor cells with mismatch repair protein expression in comparison to a mismatch repair-proficient/ microsatellite stable cohort (Figure 2): the decreased percentage of tumor cells expressing mismatch repair proteins was statistically significant for cases with abnormal MLH1 (p=0.015) and PMS2 (p=0.00095), yet cases with abnormal MSH2 and MSH6 did not show statistical significant decreased expression despite trends.\n\n    To assess whether microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant immunohistochemistry have a lesser degree of microsatellite instability or lower mutation burden, we compared them against microsatellite instability-high cases with concordant immunohistochemical results. The median tumor mutation burden and MSIsensor score for microsatellite instability-high cases with concordant mismatch repair immunohistochemistry was 44.6 mutations/ megabase and 29.96, respectively. The median tumor mutation burden and MSIsensor score for microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant mismatch repair immunohistochemistry were similar: 54.1 mutations/ megabase and 27.08, respectively.\n\n    Deleterious somatic mismatch repair gene missense mutations were more common in microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant immunohistochemistry:16 (44%) discordant cases harbored deleterious missense mutations in comparison to only 6 (17%) microsatellite instability-high cases in a matched cohort of concordant mismatch repair-deficient/ microsatellite instability-high cases (p=0.02). Nine (25%) microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant mismatch repair protein expression harbored pathogenic germline alterations in an mismatch repair gene (Lynch syndrome), while 1 (3%) microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair-deficient cases harbored a pathogenic germline missense mutation in an mismatch repair gene. Together, 25 (69%) microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair immunohistochemistry discordant cases harbored either a pathogenic germline or somatic mismatch repair gene missense mutation while only 6 (16%) microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair-deficient cases harbored a pathogenic germline or somatic mismatch repair gene missense mutation (p=0.0001). The incidence of truncating mismatch repair gene mutations in microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant mismatch repair immunohistochemistry was not significantly different from that in microsatellite instability-high cases with concordant immunohistochemistry (Table 2).\n\n    Several mismatch repair gene missense mutations occurred repeatedly in multiple microsatellite instability-high cases with discordant immunohistochemistry. These recurrent missense mutations included 2 patients with germline MLH1 p. E102K (c. 304G>A) mutations as well as a germline MLH1 p. E102A (c. 305 G>A), 2 cases of germline MSH2 p. A636P (c. 1906G>C), and 4 cases with the somatic MSH6 mutation p. T1219I (c. 3656C>T). Each case mentioned above had retained expression of the mutated mismatch repair gene.\n\n    Three patients with microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair immunohistochemistry discordant cancers were treated with the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab as monotherapy. All 3 patients benefited from treatment with best response, one each, of complete response, partial response, and stable disease. All three patients remained on pembrolizumab for over 12 months without progression of disease. Response data are summarized in table 3.",

        "Discussion": "    We found that approximately 7% of microsatellite instability-high cancers in our study population have discordant (either retained expression or different pattern of protein loss) mismatch repair immunohistochemistry staining patterns, so the presence of microsatellite instability-high status would be missed with immunohistochemistry testing. These tumors are enriched in both germline and somatic mismatch repair gene missense mutations and often have a decrease in the percentage of tumor cells expressing the abnormal mismatch repair protein. Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in three of the patients with discordant immunohistochemistry indicated prolonged clinical benefit, validating the identification of these cases as microsatellite instability-high by next generation sequencing and highlighting the importance to properly classify these cases.\n\n    Mismatch repair protein expression is often interpreted as 'retained' or 'lost' with 'lost' meaning complete loss of expression, and the literature to date has only scarcely dealt with mismatch repair gene missense mutations associated with patchy mismatch repair protein expression. Our findings warrant caution in the interpretation of mismatch repair immunohistochemistry, especially when focal or when dot-like nuclear MLH1 expression is present. Potential DNA-based reflex testing for microsatellite instability (next generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction) may be warranted and may uncover microsatellite instability-high status that would otherwise have been missed, along with opportunities for immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Particularly, colorectal carcinomas undergoing next generation sequencing testing benefit from having microsatellite instability testing integrated into the next generation sequencing test, even if mismatch repair immunohistochemistry shows proficient expression by clinical standards. Additionally, when mismatch repair expression status and microsatellite instability polymerase chain reaction results are discordant, deciphering which test result is accurate is challenging. In these scenarios, certain findings including germline or somatic missense mutations in mismatch repair genes or patchy staining may help with clinical decision making (whether to manage the case as microsatellite instability-high/ mismatch repair-deficient or mismatch repair-proficient/ microsatellite stable). For example, rare next generation sequencing cases may show falsely elevated MSIsensor scores, resulting in a false microsatellite instability-high status. This may be due to low or borderline coverage. Other factors that elevate the MSIsensor score with the version we used include unmatched analysis (no matched blood sample, history of bone marrow transplant). Further scrutiny may reveal a problem with the next generation sequencing/ microsatellite instability result in some cases. Yet in other cases, mismatch repair immunohistochemical expression is retained and microsatellite instability-high status is called confidently. In the latter scenario, presence of a mismatch repair gene missense mutation helps to verify the microsatellite instability-high result and explain the discordance.\n\n    Mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry is often performed without microsatellite instability polymerase chain reaction/ next generation sequencing in patients with early stage malignancies such as colorectal carcinoma as a screen for Lynch Syndrome. The sensitivity of immunohistochemistry remains high in general, yet we have shown that for some patients with Lynch Syndrome (including several with a pathogenic germline missense mutation), immunohistochemistry may still show retained mismatch repair protein expression. We recommend further work-up with a DNA-based microsatellite instability assessment method if tumor purity is sufficient when any of the 5 Revised Bethesda Guidelines criteria are met or if staining is focal and/or weak. If tumor purity and/or coverage is low, the degree of microsatellite instability might be underestimated, and germline sequencing should be offered. Patients with advanced (metastatic or unresectable) malignancies should be offered comprehensive molecular testing that covers targets for currently approved tumor agnostic therapies including NTRK1-3 fusions and microsatellite instability status, as well as targets for their specific malignancy (for example, extended RAS mutation testing in colorectal carcinoma). If tumor purity or coverage is lower than a specific DNA based assay's limit of detection for microsatellite instability-high status, mismatch repair immunohistochemistry should be considered based on the type of cancer (colorectal, endometrial, and esophagogastric all having relatively high rates of microsatellite instability-high) and the discretion of the oncologist and pathologist.\n\n    Rare studies have demonstrated the phenomenon of MLH1 gene missense mutations (particularly germline mutations) resulting in retained MLH1 expression and occasionally isolated loss of PMS2 expression. This study confirms that association on a larger scale, yet the mechanism behind the isolated loss of PMS2 expression in MLH1 germline mutant Lynch patients has yet to be elucidated.\n\n    Abnormal dot-like patterns of MLH1 expression may sometimes be associated with mismatch repair-deficient status, specifically deficient MLH1. However, we also identified this pattern of expression in the mismatch repair-proficient/ microsatellite stable control group, indicating that dot-like 'nucleolar' MLH1 expression is not specific for abnormal MLH1 function or microsatellite instability-high status. Since this phenomenon is relatively rare (occurring in only 1 of 108 mismatch repair-proficient/ microsatellite stable cases in the current study), further testing for microsatellite instability is warranted.\n\n    The main limitation of this study is a relatively low number of discordant mismatch repair immunohistochemistry cases due to rarity, which decreases the power for statistical analyses and makes a retrospective approach necessary.\n\n    In conclusion, retained mismatch repair protein expression occurs in approximately 6% of microsatellite instability-high cases while another 1% of microsatellite instability-high cases harbor isolated loss of the defective mismatch repair gene's dimerization partner. Microsatellite instability-high cases with retained mismatch repair protein expression do not have a lower mutation burden or degree of microsatellite instability and benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. The majority of these cases harbor germline or somatic mismatch repair gene missense mutations and often express mismatch repair proteins in a lower percentage of tumor cells.\n\n    This study was approved by the institutional review board at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.",

        "Title": "    Utility of exome sequencing in routine care for metastatic colorectal cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a heterogenous disease and its prognosis depends on clinical features, such as tumor sidedness, and whether it is metachronous or synchronous. However, little is known about the overall genomic characterization of mCRC in these clinical subtypes. This single-center observational study included 77 patients with mCRC who underwent somatic and germline exome analysis during the first or second line of therapy in 2018. Somatic and germline variants were determined in addition to tumor mutational burden, ploidy, clonality, human leucocyte antigen typing, neoantigens, and mutational and copy number signatures. Variables associated with sidedness, synchronous status and RAS status were determined using Fisher's test; and variables associated with overall survival were determined using univariate Cox survival models. The present study successfully generated whole exome sequencing analysis in 77 mCRC cases. Among them, 50 were left- and rectal-sided, while 27 were right-sided. Furthermore, 27 were metachronous and 46 were RAS-mutated. The median OS was 3.75 years. It was observed that signature single nucleotide variation (SNV) 26, oncogenic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinase and nucleotide excision repair pathways were associated with tumor sidedness. SNV signature 3, Hedgehog signaling and mismatch repair pathways were associated with synchronous status. Phosphatidylinositol signaling system, ERK signaling and chromatin organization pathways were associated with RAS mutant status. In the whole cohort, metachronous metastasis was associated with improved survival. On gene variation, PTEN, PDGFRA, MYCN and SMAD4 were associated with poor prognosis, as was SNV signature 15. In conclusion, this study highlighted that structural and pathway genomic features are associated with sidedness, synchronous status, RAS status and overall survival and could be helpful to improve the stratification of patients with colorectal cancer.",
        "Introduction": "    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The estimated number of deaths due to CRC in Europe was 243,000 in 2018. Approximately 25% of patients present metastases at the time of diagnosis (synchronous disease) and about half of the remaining patients will develop metachronous metastases, contributing to the high mortality rates reported for CRC.\n\n    The treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC) is based on chemotherapy when metastases cannot be removed by surgery. Treatment is guided by molecular information. Microsatellite unstable tumors are treated with immunotherapy, while microsatellite stable tumors, which account for 95% of mCRC, are treated by cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies. The principal cytotoxic agents currently used are fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The chemotherapy regimen often consists of fluorouracil and folinic acid combined with either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or both (FOLFOXIRI). These chemotherapies are associated with two different classes of target therapies: Anti-angiogenesis drugs, and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). While antiangiogenics can be used broadly, anti EGFR therapy is only effective in patients with RAS wild type status.\n\n    It is currently established that mCRC is a heterogeneous disease. Tumor sidedness carries strong prognostic value while synchronous mCRC is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. These data suggest that the biological characteristics of these tumors are different. Several papers have introduced CRC molecular subtyping systems, which are currently summarized in consensus molecular subtypes. This transcriptomic typology classifies patients into 4 consensual subtypes with different prognostic behavior. Using large panel sequencing data, a recent analysis detailed the molecular landscape of mCRC. This study observed different gene variations between left and right-sided tumors. However, the genomic structural pattern was not assessed in this study.\n\n    Here, using exome analysis of 77 mCRC patients, we aimed to determine genomic structural patterns and gene or pathway variations associated with overall survival, sidedness, RAS mutation status and synchronous disease.",
        "Methods": "    Seventy-seven patients with mCRC in whom WES (Whole Exome Sequencing) analysis was performed in 2018 as part of routine care, and interpreted according to the Molecular Tumor Board of the Georges Francois Leclerc Cancer Center, were included in this single-centre, retrospective study. WES analyses were performed during first or second line therapy. WES analysis is performed as part of routine care in our center in order to find potential targetable mutations for second line therapy. Before patients consented to WES of their tumoral tissue, they were informed by their oncologist. Germline testing was performed after counseling by a clinical geneticist.\n\n    Only patients from whom informed consent was obtained and recorded in the medical chart were included in this retrospective study. The study was approved by the CNIL (French national commission for data privacy) and the local ethics committee, and was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and European legislation.\n\n    Physicians selected an archival tumor sample (primary or metastasis) for genomic analysis. At the discretion of the physician, a new tumor biopsy could be proposed to the patient. Tumor cellularity was assessed by a senior pathologist on a hematoxylin and eosin slide from the same biopsy core used for nucleic acid extraction and molecular analysis.\n\n    DNA was isolated from archival tumor tissue using the Maxwell 16 FFPE Plus LEV DNA purification kit (Promega Corp.). DNA from whole blood (germline DNA) was isolated using the Maxwell 16 Blood DNA Purification kit (Promega Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The quantity of extracted genomic DNA was assessed by a fluorometric method with a Qubit device.\n\n    Two hundred ng of genomic DNA were used for library preparation, using the Agilent SureSelectXT reagent kit (Catalog number G9642B, Agilent Technologies, Inc.)and the All Exon v5 probeset (5190-8863, Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Following hybridization, the libraries were purified according to the manufacturer's recommendations and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (12 cycles). DNA integrity was verified using TapeStation (SCREENTAPE D1000 tapestation 5067-5582, reagents D1000 tapestation 5067-5583). Concentrations were measured using Qubit  dsDNA BR Assay Q32853. Loading concentrations were 22 nM for fragmentation and 6 pM for NextSeq injection. Normalized libraries were pooled, and DNA was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 device using 2x111-bp paired-end reads and multiplexed. Names, catalog numbers and suppliers of the Illumina sequencing kit were following: NextSeq 500 High Output Kit FC404-2004/2140817 and NextSeq 500 Mid Output Kit FC404-2003/2140816. More than 90% of the target sequence was covered with a read depth of at least 10X for somatic DNA.\n\n    Reads in FASTQ format were aligned to the reference human genome GRCh37 using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA v.0.7.15). Local realignment was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v.3.6). Duplicate reads were removed using Picard v.2.5. To identify somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), a validated pipeline was used that integrates mutation calls from three different mutation callers. Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) were called with VarScan (v2.4.3) and Mutect (v1.1.7) insertion/deletions (indels) were called with VarScan and Strelka (v2.9.2). Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) was calculated using the number of significant SNV (UTRs, synonyms, introns and intergenic SNVs filtered out) divided by the number of megabases covered at a defined level. TMB was calculated with and without splicing sites mutations. Splicing site mutations were excluded because it has been demonstrated that variants present in splice regions have predominantly no impact. To identify tumor-specific mutant peptides, pVAC-Seq v4.0.3 (personalized Variant Antigens by Cancer Sequencing) was used; pVAC-Seq is based on HLA typing obtained by HLAminer. TITAN was used to infer the number of copy number alterations (CNA) subclones, the number of large deletions, as well as loss of heterogeneity (LOH)>15 Mb from whole-exome sequencing data. It was also used to estimate tumor ploidy. SNV signatures were generated using DeconstructSigs (v1.8.0) and COSMIC signatures identified by Alexandrov et al . CNV signatures were inferred according to the methodology of Macintyre et al. MSI score was computed using MSIsensor HRD score was obtained through scarHRD pipeline.\n\n    Patient and disease characteristics were compared across the different groups of interest using the Chi-2 or Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables and the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables, as appropriate. Enrichr analysis using KEGG database was performed on genes differentially mutated given sidedness, metastases and KRAS mutation status. Genes with a P-value <0.1 were selected for this analysis. Enrichr is a web-based tool for analysing gene sets; it returns any enrichment of common annotated biological features, here KEGG database.\n\n    Survival analysis was performed using the survival R library. Continuous variables were dichotomised using Lausen et al methodology through the maxstat library. The prognostic value of the different variables was tested using univariate Cox regression for overall (OS) survival. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis to death from mCRC. Survivors were censored at the end of study. Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test.\n\n    Statistical analyses were performed using the R software (http://www.R-project.org/) and graphs were drawn using GraphPad Prism version 7.03 (GraphPad Software, LLC).\n\n    The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available in the Sequence Read Archive repository, (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP318854).",
        "Results": "    We included 27 (35%) patients with right primary colon cancer and 50 (65%) with rectal or left primary colon cancer. Twenty-seven (35%) patients had metachronous metastasis and 50 (65%) were synchronous. Forty-six (60%) patients were RAS mutated. The most frequent metastasis site was the liver (54 patients, 70%). Liver metastasis were more frequently synchronous (44 patients, 57%), than metachronous (10 patients, 12%) (P-value=0.01). The most common sites of first metastasis were the liver (74%) and the lung (27%), two metastatic sites that are potentially curable by resection. The other identified sites of metastases were the lymph nodes, peritoneal, adrenal and bone metastasis.\n\n    The presence of lung or liver metastases at time of diagnosis of metastatic disease did not vary significantly by primary tumour site (19% of right-sided tumors versus 32% of left-sided mCRC for lung metastasis, and 18% of right-sided tumors versus 36% of left-sided mCRC for liver metastasis). In contrast, peritoneal and omental metastases were more frequent among right-sided primary tumors (P-value=0.001). The main differences between clinical variables according to tumor sidedness are presented in Table SI, according to synchronous or metachronous status in Table SII, and between RAS/WT mutations in Table SIII.\n\n    All patients received a doublet or triplet of chemotherapy as first-line therapy; fluorouracil and folinic acid were used consistently. Patients with synchronous metastasis significantly more frequently received oxaliplatin in their chemotherapy regimens (P-value=0.01). Thirty patients were treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), without any significant difference concerning the sidedness or the time to metastasis (P-values 0.13 and 0.61 respectively). Sixty-four patients (83%) were treated with anti-angiogenesis drugs (bevacizumab or aflibercept). Fifty-four patients (70%) received a therapeutic proposition from the molecular tumor board. Only 18 patients (23%) received a treatment based on the molecular tumour board recommendations, most frequently using an oral MEK-inhibitor called Trametinib (Table I). Three patients yielded significant clinical benefit from these therapeutic strategies, with more than 6 months of progression-free survival. Two of these three patients had unstable microsatellite status and were treated with immunotherapy.\n\n    The most frequent mutation in the whole cohort was APC followed by TP53 and RAS (Fig. 1A). A summary of the genomic characteristics is presented in Table II. Thirty one patients presented WT mutational status, 44 patients presented KRAS and 2 patients NRAS mutational status. We identified 8 patients (10%) with BRAF mutation. The most frequent RAS mutation was KRAS (60%).\n\n    Mean tumor mutational burden (TMB) without splicing regions in the whole cohort was 8.87 (median=5.50, IQR=3.07). The mean number of neoantigens was 13 (median=11, IQR=7.75). Five patients had a high HRD score, using the classical cut off value 42. The two most frequent SNV signatures were 1 and 25. The two most frequent CNV signatures were 3 and 5.\n\n    Seventy-two (94%) patients had proficient mismatch repair status (pMMR) and 5 (6%) had deficient mismatch repair status (dMMR) on immunohistological analysis (Table SIV). Median MSI score and TMB score were significantly higher in the dMMR group (respectively P-value=0.02 and P-value=0.01) (Fig. 1B). There was no significant enrichment of signature 6 in patients with dMMR status (P-value=0.7).\n\n    To evaluate whether we could isolate a genetic basis for the difference in survival between disease that originates in the right versus left side of the colon, we analysed genomic structural and gene alterations for the primary tumor site. The only difference in structural variants was significant enrichment of signature 26 in left-sided primary tumors (Fig. 2A). Signature 26 is associated with homologous repair deficiency (defective DNA mismatch repair).\n\n    For gene base analysis (Fig. 2B), there was significant enrichment of oncogenic alterations in AMER1, SMARCB1, ERBB4, FUBP1 and PTEN in right-sided primary tumors. Nevertheless, we did not identify any significant differences according to sidedness or frequencies of KRAS/BRAF mutations. Mutations observed in these genes are further described in Table SV. Results of Enrichr analysis using KEGG database are described in Table SVI.\n\n    Beyond the gene-level associations, analysis at the level of oncogenic pathways showed that mutations related to certain pathways differed according to primary tumor site. These pathways consisted in significant enrichment of Nucleotide excision repair for right-sided tumors, and RTK for left-sided ones (Fig. 2C). No significant association was found between sidedness and TP53/ATM, WNT/CTNNB1, TGF-beta or IGF2/PI-3-kinase pathways, which are frequently mutated in CRC.\n\n    Using structural genome analysis, SNV signature 3, which is associated with failure of DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, was significantly associated with synchronous presentation (Fig. 3A). We did not find additional differences at this genomic level.\n\n    P53 loss of function mutations were significantly more frequent in synchronous metastasis. In contrast, metachronous metastasis was associated with PTCH, PTPRD and CSF1R mutations (Fig. 3B). Mutations observed in these genes are further described in Table SV. Results of Enrichr analysis using KEGG database are described in Table SVI.\n\n    When pooling mutations in gene pathways, we observed that Mismatch repair and Hedgehog signaling were significantly more frequently affected in metachronous tumors (Fig. 3C).\n\n    In our series, the prevalence of RAS mutations was not significantly different according to tumor location. On gene variation, KMT2B and RET were significantly associated with RAS wild type tumors. In contrast, KMT2C and GNAS were significantly more frequent with RAS mutated tumors (Fig. S1A). Mutations observed in these genes are further described in Table SV. Results of Enrichr analysis using KEGG database are described in Table SVI.\n\n    An analysis at the level of oncogenic pathways demonstrated that ERK signaling and chromatin organisation pathways were significantly associated with RAS mutation, while Phosphatidylinositol signaling was associated with WT tumors (Fig. S1B).\n\n    Median OS was 3.75 years. Regarding genomic structural variants, low SNV signature 15 was associated with poor overall survival (Fig. 4A). In gene variation, PDGFRA, SMAD4, PTEN, MYCN mutations were significantly associated with poor prognosis (Fig. S2A-D). We also estimated a multivariate model involving the 4 genes; all genes remain significant. At the level of oncogenic pathways, cell-cycle, NFKappaB signaling and mismatch repair pathways were significantly associated with better survival (Fig. 4B-D). We did not observe a significant association between any WNT-signaling pathway and CRC survival.\n\n    Overall survival was significantly better in patients with metachronous metastatic disease, but this difference was no longer significant after removing MMR deficient tumors, thus suggesting a link between the prognosis of metachronous disease and enrichment in MMR deficient tumors (Fig. 4E and F).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    CRC is caused by multiple risk factors, including environmental, lifestyle and genetic risks. All these elements cause mutations and epigenetic alterations, conferring on cells the capacity to transform and grow, with aberrant DNA editing and defective DNA maintenance.\n\n    Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has identified a diversity of driver mutations in genes and altered signaling pathways in CRC. In addition, genomic structural patterns within gene pathway mutations could be used to identify prognostic features. Recent studies have revealed a mutational landscape of colorectal cancer and defined different subtypes that could guide therapeutic decisions. Increasing access to WES and the increasing rapidity of analysis offers new opportunities to implement such tests in the care of mCRC. WES analysis is performed in routine care in our center in order to find potentially targetable mutations for second line therapy.\n\n    Like in previous studies of precision medicine, we found that only very few mCRC patients yielded a benefit from precision medicine. In our study, we used WES analysis to identify genomic mutational profiles linked to tumor sidedness and metastatic occurrences, as well as genomic features related to prognosis.\n\n    In a systemic review and metanalysis, left-sided primary tumors were associated with improved prognosis, for both localized and metastatic tumors, in comparison to right-sided disease. Peritoneal and omental metastases, which are metastatic sites known to be associated with poor survival, were more frequent among right-sided primary tumors. Moreover, the survival differences seen between patients with right-sided vs. left-sided primary tumor sites in mCRC are supported by differences in transcriptomic patterns.\n\n    Like other authors, we showed that metachronous metastatic status is associated with better outcome. However, the molecular mechanism remains obscure, and the prognostic role seems to be less impactful than that of MMR status.\n\n    Our findings indicate that differences in survival could also be explained by genomic differences. Our analysis relied on structural information and on mutated genes grouped in pathways. We showed in particular that SNV signature 26, associated with MMR deficiency 29 (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt), was surprisingly associated with left-sided mCRC, while SNV signature 3 was associated with synchronous metastasis. Signature 3 is associated with better overall survival in ovarian and breast cancer, by the better response to platinum therapy. At present, no data link signature 3 to oxaliplatin efficacy in mCRC. This question may be relevant for further clinical trials.\n\n    Moreover, somatic mutations in TP53 genes, which are present in the majority of cancers, are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, in several cancer types, including CRC. P53 loss of function mutations were significantly more frequent in synchronous metastasis.\n\n    In contrast, when we looked at more classical genomic features such as tumor mutational burden, there was no significant difference between tumors according to sidedness or time to metastasis occurrence. Conversely, we observed that MMR deficiency was associated with better outcome. MMR deficiency is more frequent in metachronous tumors and this genetic event may explain the better prognosis of these patients.\n\n    Oncogenic alterations-KRAS, NRAS and BRAF, which exhibit resistance to EGFR therapy with panitumumab and cetuximab, did not differ in our cohort, as previously reported, according to sidedness or metastatic occurrence, thus suggesting that these parameters are probably weak prognostic factors. The RAS pathway is a cell signaling pathway that plays a key role in regulation of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, cellular differentiation and migration and angiogenesis. This pathway is often dysregulated in mCRC. The association between RAS mutations and activation of the ERK signaling pathway is already well known.\n\n    When we looked at classical somatic mutations in mCRC, we observed that APC was frequently mutated in our series. However, APC was not associated with survival. The WNT signaling pathway is also frequently mutated in CRC and we did not observe a significant association between any WNT-signaling pathway and CRC survival. SMAD4 loss was found to be associated with poor outcome in our series. Similarly, a recent report also showed an association between SMAD4 loss and poor CRC survival, resistance to chemotherapy and decreased tumor immune infiltration.\n\n    Both PDGF and PDGFR families play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, and PDGFR is frequently overexpressed in CRC. Activation of this pathway is frequently related to angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and poor survival. In our study, mutations in PDGFRA were associated with poor prognosis.\n\n    The main limitation of our work is the low number of patients included, which may impact the statistical significance, and precluded multivariate analysis. Moreover, WES was made during first or second line of treatment, so mutation profiles were generated under therapeutic pressure, which changed the cancer characterizations. Unfortunately, we do not dispose of samples before treatments as a baseline. In addition, considering the sequencing result of PTEN, PDGFRA, MYCN or SMAD4, the lack of PCR verification step is a limitation of this study and should be done in future works. Thus, our results should be considered as descriptive and exploratory, and warrant confirmation in further studies including larger sample sizes.\n\n    In conclusion, with the development of targeted therapies, it seems necessary to be able to rapidly identify the molecular status of mCRC tumors. Large panel or exome sequencing is slightly effective in improving patient care with precision medicine; however, such analyses could reveal structural and pathway genomic features that are associated with sidedness, synchronous status, and overall survival. Although the cost of NGS is steadily declining, WES nonetheless remains expensive, and currently, this is one of the major limitations on the routine use of exome sequencing. Moreover, the number of tumour mutations that could be used to treat a given patient is limited in conventional clinical practice or clinical trials, and it is difficult to determine which patients will clinically benefit from exome sequencing. In all likelihood, before being used in routine practice, exome sequencing will be reserved for patients with advanced mCRC, after one or more lines of treatment, or for patients with very poor outcomes, who fail to respond to classical targeted therapy and chemotherapy. Indeed, the knowledge of the molecular status could lead to inclusion in therapeutic clinical trials with a direct benefit for our patients. More generally, patients with right-sided mCRC, synchronous metastasis or peritoneal and omental metastasis may benefit the most from such analysis. This important information could be used to improve patient stratification for clinical trials, and will lead to a new molecular classification of patients that could be helpful to finetune the future of mCRC therapy.",

        "Title": "    Comprehensive characterization of CRC with germline mutations reveals a distinct somatic mutational landscape and elevated cancer risk in the Chinese population",
        "Abstract": "    Hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for approximately 5%-10% of all CRC cases. The full profile of CRC-related germline mutations and the corresponding somatic mutational profile have not been fully determined in the Chinese population.\n\n    We performed the first population study investigating the germline mutation status in more than 1,000 (n = 1,923) Chinese patients with CRC and examined their relationship with the somatic mutational landscape. Germline alterations were examined with a 58-gene next-generation sequencing panel, and somatic alterations were examined with a 605-gene panel.\n\n    A total of 92 pathogenic (P) mutations were identified in 85 patients, and 81 likely pathogenic (LP) germline mutations were identified in 62 patients, accounting for 7.6% (147/1,923) of all patients. MSH2 and APC was the most mutated gene in the Lynch syndrome and non-Lynch syndrome groups, respectively. Patients with P/LP mutations had a significantly higher ratio of microsatellite instability, highly deficient mismatch repair, family history of CRC, and lower age. The somatic mutational landscape revealed a significantly higher mutational frequency in the P group and a trend toward higher copy number variations in the non-P group. The Lynch syndrome group had a significantly higher mutational frequency and tumor mutational burden than the non-Lynch syndrome group. Clustering analysis revealed that the Notch signaling pathway was uniquely clustered in the Lynch syndrome group, and the MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways were uniquely clustered in the non-Lynch syndrome group. Population risk analysis indicated that the overall odds ratio was 11.13 (95% CI: 8.289-15.44) for the P group and 20.68 (95% CI: 12.89-33.18) for the LP group.\n\n    Distinct features were revealed in Chinese patients with CRC with germline mutations. The Notch signaling pathway was uniquely clustered in the Lynch syndrome group, and the MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways were uniquely clustered in the non-Lynch syndrome group. Patients with P/LP germline mutations exhibited higher CRC risk.",
        "Introduction": "    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third and second most common cancer in men and women worldwide, respectively, and the fifth most common cancer in China. Although most cases of CRC are sporadic, inherited factors are known to contribute to approximately 30%-35% of CRC cases. Approximately 5%-10% of patients with CRC carry high-risk germline mutations that are associated with known hereditary CRC syndromes, including Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary non-polyposis CRC), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, and serrated polyposis syndrome. The germline mutations associated with these syndromes have been extensively investigated at both the genomic and individual gene levels, and the heritability of many of these mutations has been confirmed in population and/or family studies. New germline mutations with suspected heritability have also been reported in recent years. Many hotspot mutations have been identified in hereditary CRC syndromes, primarily involving APC, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Therefore, hereditary CRC syndromes are associated with both hotspot and non-hotspot germline mutations.\n\n    Previous research has shown that pathogenic germline mutations increase the risk of cancers, including not only CRC but also hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and lung cancer. However, this risk remains to be clearly defined for Chinese patients with CRC. Furthermore, the somatic mutational landscape of hereditary CRC syndromes has yet to be characterized and compared with that of sporadic CRC. This comparison may aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying hereditary CRC syndromes. In this study, we recruited a large cohort of 1,923 unselected patients with CRC, investigated both the germline and somatic mutational landscapes, and performed extensive comparisons between patients with and without pathogenic germline mutations. More importantly, by comparing the incidence of individual mutations in our cohort with that in the general population, we clarified the risk associated with the identified germline mutations. This study provides important information regarding the mutational landscape, cancer risk, and potential carcinogenic mechanisms of CRC-related germline mutations in the Chinese population. Our findings may help establish preventive and therapeutic strategies for patients with CRC with suspected heritability.",
        "Methods": "    All experimental plans and protocols for the study were submitted to the ethics/licensing committees of the indicated participating hospitals for review and approval before the start of the clinical study, and were approved by the corresponding committees of the participating hospitals (Approval No. S2015-032-02). Because the study had a retrospective design and used retrospective samples collected by the participating hospitals, informed consent was not required. Patients with pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) germline mutations were informed of the test results. All experiments, methods, procedures, and personnel training were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of the participating hospitals and laboratories.\n\n    The study was designed and implemented in 7 Chinese hospitals, and both cancer tissue and blood samples were collected retrospectively. The study was designed to include as many patients with CRC as possible, provided that the tissue or blood samples were available for next-generation sequencing (NGS). Samples collected between January 2016 and August 2020 from 1,923 patients with CRC were obtained according to the availability of samples for NGS testing in the participating hospitals. The details of patient demographic information, pathological information, family history, and microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair (MMR) information are summarized in Table 1. Family history was defined as confirmed CRC patients with at least one immediate family member (first degree relative) with a history of CRC diagnosis. The immediate family members included parents, siblings, and children. The collected samples comprised tissue samples [formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples or frozen samples from surgery] and blood samples obtained at the time of CRC diagnosis confirmation. Diagnosis was confirmed with imaging examinations and subsequent pathological examinations. No participants received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy before the tissue and blood samples were collected. The somatic sequencing data presented in this study were from FFPE samples or frozen tissue samples. Germline sequencing data were obtained from the corresponding genomic DNA of white blood cells.\n\n    For the FFPE samples, ten 5 mum tumor slices were used for DNA extraction with a QIAamp DNA FFPE Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For tissue samples, a minimum of 50 mg tissue was used for DNA extraction with a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). For blood samples, 2 mL of blood was collected in tubes containing EDTA and centrifuged at 1,600 x g for 10 min at 4  C within 2 h of collection. The peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) debris was stored at -20  C until further use. DNA from PBLs was extracted with a RelaxGene Blood DNA system (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both cancer tissue and white blood cell genomic DNA were quantified with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fragmented genomic DNA underwent end-repair, A-tailing, and ligation with indexed adapters sequentially, followed by size selection with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA). DNA fragments were used for library construction with a KAPA Library Preparation kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization-based target enrichment was performed with a HaploX germline gene panel (58 known hereditary cancer-related genes, HaploX Biotechnology; gene list in Supplementary Table S1) for white blood cell genomic DNA or a HaploX pan-cancer gene panel (605 cancer-relevant genes, HaploX Biotechnology; gene list in Supplementary Table S2) for cancer tissue sequencing. Depending on the amount of DNA used, 7 to 8 polymerase chain reaction cycles were performed with pre-capture ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotides (Kapa Biosystems, Inc.) in 50 muL reactions. DNA sequencing was then performed on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 system according to the manufacturer's recommendations at an average depth of 2,200x for tissue and FFPE samples.\n\n    Data meeting the following criteria were included in subsequent analysis: ratio of remaining data filtered by fastq in raw data >=85%; proportion of Q30 bases >=85%; ratio of reads on the reference genome >=85%; target region coverage >=98%; and average sequencing depth in tissues >=2,200x. The called somatic variants were required to meet the following criteria: read depth at a position >=20x; variant allele fraction (VAF) >=2% for tissue and PBL genomic DNA; somatic-P value <=0.01; strand filter >=1. VAF values were calculated for Q30 bases. The copy number variation (CNV) was detected with CNVkit version 0.9.3 (https://github.com/etal/cnvkit). Further analyses of genomic alterations were also performed, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion (indels), and CNVs.\n\n    The pathogenicity of germline mutations was defined and predicted according to the 5-grade classification system of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence. All germline mutations were categorized into P, LP, or non-pathogenic (non-P) groups. The variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and benign and likely benign mutations were defined as the non-P group in this study. TMB was calculated by division of the total number of tissue non-synonymous SNP and indel variations (VAF > 2%) by the full length of the exome region of the 605-gene NGS panel (Supplementary Table S2). The genomic sequence from the DNA of PBLs was used for genomic alignment when calling the somatic mutations.\n\n    Statistical analysis was performed, and figures were plotted in GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). Student's t-test was performed when 2 groups were compared, and analysis of variance and post hoc tests were performed when 3 or more groups were compared. Chi-square test and Fisher's test were performed when rates or percentages were compared for significance. Figures for the mutation spectrum were produced with R software (https://www.r-project.org/). Data for pathway enrichment analysis were analyzed with the method described by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and were visualized with corresponding packages for R software. The protein-protein interaction network was analyzed with the STRING database, and the hub genes were determined with Cytoscape software (cytoscape.org); the Degree method was used to rank the genes. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated on the basis of the frequency of a certain germline mutation from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) in the general population and the corresponding mutation frequency obtained from this study. The OR and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each germline mutation was calculated in SPSS 17.0 software (IBM China Company Limited, Beijing, China). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; and ***P < 0.001.",
        "Results": "    First, we investigated the genetic landscape of germline alterations in all 1,923 recruited patients with CRC, among whom we identified 92 P germline mutations in 85 patients (Figure 1A) and 81 LP germline mutations in 62 patients (Figure 1A). The remaining 1,776 patients carried VUS, benign, or likely benign germline alterations (non-P). The proportion of patients with P or LP germline mutations was 7.6% (147/1,923). The highest number of P mutations was seen in APC and MSH2 (n = 14), followed by BRCA1 (n = 8), MLH1 (n = 7), and RAD50 (n = 7). MLH1 and MSH2 exhibited the highest number of LP mutations (n = 10), followed by MSH6 (n = 7), NTRK1 (n = 7), and ATM (n = 6). Further analysis indicated that 27 of 92 P mutations were detected in patients who had been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome (Figure 1B, left panel). MSH2 was the gene associated with the most mutations in Lynch syndrome (14) and was followed by MLH1 (n = 7), MSH6 (n = 4), and PMS2 (n = 2) (Figure 1B, middle panel). For patients without Lynch syndrome, APC was identified as the gene associated with the most mutations (n = 14) and was followed by BRCA1 (n = 8), RAD50 (n = 7), MUTYH (n = 5), ATM (n = 5), and BRCA2 (n = 4) (Figure 1B, right panel).\n\n    Interestingly, we observed a significantly higher ratio of patients with MSI-H or dMMR in the P or LP group than the non-P group (Table 1). We also identified a significantly higher ratio of patients with family history in the P and LP groups than the non-P group. Patients with P or LP mutations were significantly younger than those in the non-P group (Table 1). A significant difference in stage distribution was observed between the LP and the non-P group, possibly because of the low number of patients in the LP group in stages I and III. We observed no significant differences in P and LP germline mutations between males and females (Table 1).\n\n    Next, we identified the specific types of mutations related to the P and LP alterations. Most mutations involved frameshift (deletion and insertion), nonsense, nonsynonymous (single nucleotide mutations), or splicing (Figure 2A). These mutations may cause large fragment changes or key amino acid alterations in proteins and therefore substantially influence gene function and potentially lead to high susceptibility to CRC. APC, MSH2, and MLH1, identified as the 3 genes with the highest number of P and LP mutations, might lead to familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome.\n\n    The distribution of germline mutations in the highly mutated genes is shown in Figure 2B. Both P (red) and LP (blue) mutations of APC, ATM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 are plotted on individual gene schemes. Most germline mutations were located in key functional domains (blue bars). This effect was most prominent for APC, in which several mutations were distributed in the suppressor APC, APC_u9, and PTZ00449 superfamily domains. This observation suggested that P/LP germline mutations within key functional domains are more likely to be pathogenic than other mutations.\n\n    We identified several novel, previously unreported germline mutations in the dbSNP, gnomAD, and ClinVar databases (Table 2). These mutations included frameshift, nonsense, and splicing mutations potentially causing large fragment alterations in genes. All were classified as LP mutations, owing to their deleterious properties and undetermined clinical significance. Interestingly, patients with mismatch repair-related gene mutations (MSH2 and MSH6) and NTRK1 germline mutations exhibited very high levels of somatic TMB and a high ratio of MSI-H, thus suggesting that these mutations might behave in the same manner as known P mutations, although further clinical evidence is needed to validate this hypothesis.\n\n    The somatic mutational features of CRC with germline mutations, and how this condition relates to sporadic CRC, remain to be investigated in detail. Here we studied the somatic mutational features of CRC with or without P/LP germline mutations (Supplementary Figure S1A), focusing specifically on the differences among the P, LP, and non-P groups in terms of individual gene mutational frequency (Figure 3A-D), TMB (Figure 3E), and mutations significantly affecting pathways or functions (Figure 4).\n\n    We identified substantial differences in the SNV/indel mutational frequency of highly mutated genes (Figure 3A). For many genes, including TP53, SYNE1, and KMT2D, a significantly higher mutational frequency was identified in the P group than the non-P group. Similarly, a higher mutational frequency was found in the LP group than the non-P group in several genes, including ZFHX3 and KMT2D. Interestingly, the mutational frequency of APC and KARS did not differ among the 3 groups. In contrast, most CNV alterations did not differ significantly across the 3 groups, except for NCOA3 (P < 0.05), although we did observe a trend toward higher CNV alterations in the non-P group (Figure 3B). The overall CNV rate of the P group was significantly lower than that of the non-P group (P < 0.001).\n\n    Next, we investigated the difference between the Lynch syndrome and non-Lynch syndrome groups with P mutations (Supplementary Figure S1B). Patients with Lynch syndrome exhibited a significantly higher mutational frequency than those who did not have Lynch syndrome (Figure 3C); this was the case for most genes, except APC, TP53, and PIK3CA, whose mutational frequency did not significantly differ. In contrast, patients without Lynch syndrome exhibited a trend toward a higher frequency of CNV alterations than those with Lynch syndrome, although this association was not significant (Figure 3D). Next, we examined and compared the TMB for the P (including both patients with and without Lynch syndrome), LP, and non-P groups. Patients with Lynch syndrome and P mutations exhibited a much higher TMB than patients without Lynch syndrome with P mutations, and patients from the LP and non-P groups (Figure 3E).\n\n    To further investigate the similarities and differences in somatic mutations among the P, LP, and non-P groups, and to study the mechanistic discrepancies between Lynch syndrome and patients without Lynch syndrome with CRC, we performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) clustering analysis and compared the results from each group. Figure 4A shows the most significant clustering in the GO (upper row) and KEGG (lower row) analysis for the P, LP, and non-P groups. Some common biological processes, functions, and pathways were observed among the groups, together with several substantial differences. The common clustering for GO and KEGG findings across the 3 groups is summarized in Supplementary Table S3. Although the 3 groups of patients had distinct hereditary backgrounds, they shared several common aberrant pathways, thus potentially indicating common carcinogenic mechanisms, including the Wnt signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, and human papillomavirus infection. In contrast, we observed distinct differences between the P/LP groups and the non-P group in terms of biological processes, functions, and pathways, as shown in Supplementary Table S4 (GO clustering) and Supplementary Table S5 (KEGG clustering). Notably, the Notch signaling pathway was clustered in the P/LP groups but not the non-P group (Supplementary Table S5).\n\n    Similarities and differences were also compared between the Lynch syndrome and non-Lynch syndrome groups with regard to P germline mutations. Figure 4B shows the most significant clustering in GO (upper row) and KEGG (lower row) analysis for the Lynch syndrome and non-Lynch syndrome groups. Common clustering is shown in Supplementary Table S6. The most common pathways were the Wnt signaling pathway, the calcium signaling pathway, and human papillomavirus infection. Differences in the biological processes in terms of GO clustering are listed in Supplementary Table S7; interestingly, a large amount of Lynch-unique clustering was observed. Differences in KEGG clustering are shown in Supplementary Table S8. Notably, the Notch signaling pathway was clustered in the Lynch syndrome group but not the non-Lynch syndrome group, whereas the MAPK signaling pathway and AMP signaling pathway were clustered in the non-Lynch syndrome group but not the Lynch syndrome group. Information related to the genes enriched in each GO and KEGG category in Figure 4 is provided in Supplementary Table S9 (GO enrichment) and Supplementary Table S10 (KEGG enrichment).\n\n    Next, we used the STRING database to analyze the protein interaction network for each subgroup. The top 20 genes in terms of protein interaction are listed in Supplementary Table S11. Each subgroup was compared with the P group, and the same genes are labeled with identical colors. In all groups, TP53 was the most common interacting gene. However, EGFR and SRC genes were found in the LP, non-P, and non-Lynch syndrome groups, but not in the P group, thus suggesting substantial differences in the protein interaction network. NOTCH1 was found only in the P and P-Lynch syndrome groups but not in the other groups, thus verifying the results of the pathway enrichment analysis. These findings strongly suggest that the mechanism of carcinogenesis in patients with P germline mutations is distinct from that in patients with no P germline mutations.\n\n    P or LP germline mutations may increase cancer susceptibility and risk. To quantify the risk of CRC in individuals carrying P or LP germline mutations, we calculated the ORs for individual germline mutations and all mutations as a whole. The prevalence of all germline mutations in the general population was determined by gnomAD screening. By comparing the prevalence in the general population and the mutation frequency identified in this study, we calculated the OR for each mutation site, or all mutations as a whole, as an indicator of CRC risk. Table 3 shows the detailed demographic information, gene names, variation sites, allele counts, allele frequencies in the general population, and ORs for each P germline mutation detected in this study. The overall OR for all P mutations was 11.13 (95% CI:8.289-15.44). Similarly, Table 4 shows demographic and mutational information, along with the calculated OR of all LP mutations, with an overall OR of 20.68 (95% CI: 12.89-33.18). These results indicated strong enrichment in P or LP mutations in the studied population of patients with CRC, thus indicating a significantly higher risk of CRC in patients carrying these germline mutations.\n\n    Some patients with CRC recruited for this study lacked prognostic data. Consequently, we were unable to perform prognostic analysis. However, prognostic data were successfully obtained from a previous report; the patient prognosis was then compared between those with and without germline mutations. As shown in Supplementary Figure S2, patients with germline mutations exhibited significantly poorer overall survival than those without germline mutations (P = 0.0087). The median survival time for the germline group was 1,323 days, whereas the median survival for the non-germline group had not been reached.",
        "Conclusion": "    In this study, we fully characterized germline and somatic mutations in Chinese patients with CRC. We found that 7.6% of our study cohort carried germline variants linked to greater susceptibility to CRC. Patients with P or LP mutations had a higher proportion of MSI-H, dMMR, family history of CRC, and significantly lower age. The somatic mutations in Chinese patients with patients with CRC were fully characterized and found to exhibit distinct features. The Notch signaling pathway was uniquely clustered in patients with Lynch syndrome, whereas the MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways were uniquely clustered in patients with CRC who did not have Lynch syndrome. Our findings provide important information for potential molecular typing and therapy for patients with CRC with germline mutations.",
        "Discussion": "    Previous research has identified correlations between P germline mutations and hereditary CRC, including MLH1/MSH2/MSH6/PMS2 mutations with Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary non-polyposis CRC), APC mutations with FAP, MUTYH mutations with MUTYH-associated polyposis, STK11 mutations with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, SMAD4/BMPR1A mutations with juvenile polyposis syndrome, PTEN mutations with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, and RNF43 mutations with serrated polyposis syndrome. Although the relationships among these diseases and mutations are known, the frequency, location, and distribution of germline mutations in the Chinese population, and their quantitative relationships with CRC risk have yet to be elucidated. The distribution of rare germline mutations and their roles in the pathogenesis of CRC are also worthy of exploration. In addition, no systematic studies have investigated the similarities and differences in the somatic mutational landscape between patients with and without P/LP germline mutations. In this study, we recruited a large cohort of 1,923 cases and systematically investigated germline mutations and corresponding somatic mutational alterations in a Chinese population.\n\n    As expected, a significantly higher proportion of patients with P or LP mutations had a family history of CRC than did non-P patients, thus suggesting that these germline mutations increased the risk of CRC in affected families. Because of the high proportion of affected MMR genes in P and LP mutations, the proportion of patients with dMMR and MSI-H was significantly higher in these groups; therefore, these patients may respond well to immunotherapy. Our results also confirmed the early onset of CRC in patients with P or LP mutations, thereby indicating a similar trend to those of FAP and Lynch syndrome. Although some novel mutations were not determined to be pathogenic, their overall influence appeared to be similar to that of confirmed hereditary CRC.\n\n    We found that 7.6% of patients (147/1,923) carried P/LP mutations, and 1.4% of patients (27/1,923) had Lynch syndrome; these findings are similar to the proportions previously published for both Chinese and Western populations. However, because of a lack of sufficient evidence for LP germline mutations, many mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PSM2 could not be confirmed as Lynch syndrome mutations. Therefore, the incidence of Lynch syndrome might have been underestimated, and the actual incidence could have exceeded 2%, as described in previous reports. The APC gene had the highest number of P germline mutations, thus indicating that FAP is the most common form of hereditary CRC in Chinese population, followed by Lynch syndrome. In addition, ATM gene germline mutations have been detected in other malignant tumors. Because ATM is an important candidate member of the DNA damage and repair (DDR) pathway, germline mutations may directly lead to abnormal DNA repair. The present evidence suggests that ATM germline mutations are not cancer type-specific, because they have been reported in many cancers and have been suggested to potentially increase the risk of some cancers. In the present study, the OR of P ATM mutations varied from 6.4 to 63.87, thus suggesting an increased risk in patients with CRC carrying these mutations. We also identified several BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in this study. BRCA1/2 genes, encoding products that participate in the DDR and HRR pathways, represent confirmed carcinogenesis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. BRCA1/2 germline mutations have also been reported in CRC. All BRCA1/2 P germline mutations reported herein are associated with CRC, on the basis of clear clinical evidence. Our previous studies have also confirmed that BRCA2 germline mutations increase the risk of lung cancer. Because no hotspot mutations have been reported in BRCA1/2 in the Chinese population, many mutations were categorized as LP or VUS. Additional clinical evidence is necessary to confirm their pathogenicity in cancer.\n\n    We compared the ratio and distribution of germline mutations between Chinese and Western populations by using the data from the present study and data reported by Hahnen et al. in 2017. We found that PALB2 was ranked as the top P mutation in the Western population but had a much lower ranking in the Chinese population (Supplementary Figure S3A). In contrast, APC was ranked as the top P mutation in the Chinese population but was not detected in the Western population. Moreover, ATR was ranked as the top LP mutation in the Western population but was not detected in the Chinese population. Differences between these populations were also reflected in the proportion of patients with Lynch syndrome. The proportion of patients with Lynch syndrome with P mutations in the Chinese population was 29.3% (27/92), compared with a ratio of 15.0% in the Western population (3/20) (Supplementary Figure S3B). These comparisons indicate a potential differential germline mutational landscape in CRC.\n\n    Frameshift and nonsense mutations were the 2 most common types of mutations detected in the study, followed by missense and splicing mutations. Frameshift and nonsense mutations lead to the partial or complete loss of function of corresponding proteins, thus increasing the risk of cancer in mutation carriers. Missense mutations in key amino acids can also induce substantial changes in protein function, whereas splicing mutations can influence transcription and subsequent translation. We found that most mutations in highly mutated genes were located in known functional domains, thus reflecting the roles of these domains in maintaining normal protein function. Indeed, because all mutations identified in this study were heterozygous, a partial loss of function might be compensated for by the other normal allele. These heterozygous mutations might not be lethal but could increase the risk of cellular aberrant transformation and carcinogenesis.\n\n    In this study, we conducted the first comparative study of somatic mutational landscapes on the basis of the pathogenicity classification of germline mutations. We found that the mutational frequency of most of the highly mutated genes in the P group was higher than that in the non-P group; the LP group also showed a similar trend toward a higher mutational frequency, possibly because the mutations in the P group affected the MMR, DDR, and homologous recombination deficiency pathways, thus leading to abnormal DNA repair and a large number of somatic mutations. The patients with and without Lynch syndrome in the P group showed a similar trend, and the mutational frequency in patients with Lynch syndrome was much higher than that in patients without Lynch syndrome. This finding was also confirmed by TMB statistics: the TMB of patients with Lynch syndrome was significantly higher than that of the other 3 groups. TMB has been suggested to be an effective indicator for patient prognosis stratification in immunotherapy. Our data provided strong evidence supporting the use of immunotherapy in patients with Lynch syndrome. Interestingly, we observed no difference in the frequency of APC and KRAS mutations across the 3 groups, thus suggesting that major driver gene mutations may be common driving factors for CRC, regardless of P germline mutations. In addition, our data showed that the CNV variation in the non-P group was higher than that in the P group, and that CNV variation in the patients without Lynch syndrome was also higher than that in patients with Lynch syndrome, thus indicating a seesaw effect. That is, a higher proportion of SNV/indel mutations corresponded to a lower proportion of CNV alterations, whereas a lower proportion of SNV/indel mutations corresponded to a higher proportion of CNV alterations. This observation suggests that CRC is a highly heterogeneous cancer in which pathogenesis is diverse and depends on different types of genetic alterations. The co-existence and balance of mutations and CNVs may be related to both genetic and environmental backgrounds. Similar observations of the seesaw effect have also been reported in other studies.\n\n    Our detailed clustering analysis led to interesting discoveries. We found the first reported evidence that the Notch pathway is clustered in only patients with Lynch syndrome with P germline mutations, but not patients without Lynch syndrome. Furthermore, we observed that the MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways were clustered in patients without Lynch syndrome but not patients with Lynch syndrome. In contrast, the Wnt and calcium signaling pathways, along with the human papillomavirus infection pathway, were all clustered in CRC. This finding suggests that the Notch pathway is specific to patients with Lynch syndrome, whereas the MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways are specific to patients without Lynch syndrome. The Wnt and calcium signaling pathways, along with human papilloma virus infection, may be common pathogenic factors for CRC, regardless of germline mutations. The Notch pathway plays an important role in embryonic development, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Furthermore, the role of the Notch pathway has been investigated for many different types of tumors, including CRC. However, the role of the Notch pathway in Lynch syndrome has not been studied previously. Our identification of Lynch-specific Notch pathway activity demonstrated the existence of distinct pathogenic mechanisms in patients with Lynch syndrome and patients without Lynch syndrome with CRC; therefore, our research provides key information that may facilitate molecular typing.\n\n    In this study, we report the first quantification of the risk of CRC associated with P and LP germline mutations. We also calculated the overall OR for the P and LP groups. The frequency of mutations identified by gnomAD screening represents the frequency of a certain alteration in the general population. Because most P or LP germline mutations exhibited very low incidence, the frequency in the general population, and in patients with cancer, may exhibit a certain degree of randomness and may not accurately represent the true frequency. Thus, the overall OR for the P or LP group as a whole may have greater relevance and significance for the population. For some relatively common germline mutations, such as those from APC and the 4 MMR genes, the risk associated with individual genes can be calculated; for the less frequent gene mutations, larger population studies and familial evidence are urgently needed. In this study, the overall OR of both the P and LP groups exceeded 10, thus suggesting that patients with such germline mutations had a significantly greater risk of CRC than the average-risk population. Previous studies of other cancers also support this method for evaluating the risk of germline mutations from population data. From the perspective of treatment, personalized therapeutic strategies should be given to patients with such mutations, and more frequent and detailed examinations should be performed on their unaffected family members carrying these mutations. This practice would enable detection of tumors as early as possible and support early intervention.",

        "Title": "    Exome sequencing of familial high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma reveals heterogeneity for rare candidate susceptibility genes",
        "Abstract": "    High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) has a significant hereditary component, approximately half of which cannot be explained by known genes. To discover genes, we analyse germline exome sequencing data from 516 BRCA1/2-negative women with HGSOC, focusing on genes enriched with rare, protein-coding loss-of-function (LoF) variants. Overall, there is a significant enrichment of rare protein-coding LoF variants in the cases (p < 0.0001, chi-squared test). Only thirty-four (6.6%) have a pathogenic variant in a known or proposed predisposition gene. Few genes have LoF mutations in more than four individuals and the majority are detected in one individual only. Forty-three highly-ranked genes are identified with three or more LoF variants that are enriched by three-fold or more compared to GnomAD. These genes represent diverse functional pathways with relatively few involved in DNA repair, suggesting that much of the remaining heritability is explained by previously under-explored genes and pathways.\n\n    Around half of the heritability underpinning familial high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma remains unidentified. Here, the authors show that extremely rare protein encoding loss-of-function variants, with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, may account for some of this missing heritability.",
        "Introduction": "    Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is a heterogeneous disease, representing approximately 3.7% of all new female cancer diagnoses. It comprises several distinct histological subtypes (including high- and low-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid and mucinous), each one displaying different behaviours at both the clinical and molecular levels. Around 70% of epithelial ovarian tumours are high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), which are relatively aggressive and have a poor prognosis.\n\n    There is a significant genetic component to the risk of ovarian carcinoma, with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 identifiable in 11-23% of affected women with HGSOC, rising to as high as 42% of affected women with a family history of two or more ovarian carcinomas. Other genes make a smaller contribution to HGSOC risk (e.g. RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1), but the hereditary basis of approximately 50% of cases remains unexplained, which compromises risk management for these women and their families.\n\n    Efforts to identify additional moderate-to-high-risk hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) genes have largely been restricted to candidate gene approaches using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels of known cancer predisposition genes, which have collectively only resolved a very small proportion of unexplained families. Although three studies utilised data from whole-exome sequencing (WES) of BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative ovarian carcinoma patients, these analysed only a subset of candidate genes in the available data and included non-HGSOC tumour types in their case cohorts. Others utilised germline sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), but this approach is limited by the diverse technologies used to generate TCGA data along with the absence of any linked family history information. None of the previous studies have identified candidate HBOC genes that have been validated in multiple independent studies; nor has there been any consistency of the candidates identified across different studies.\n\n    As a first step in resolving the missing heritability of ovarian carcinoma, we present WES data from a large cohort of women diagnosed with HGSOC, who were tested through a familial cancer clinic but returned negative findings for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Our results indicate that familial HGSOC is enriched for rare protein-coding loss-of-function (LoF) variants, but displays high genetic heterogeneity, with no single proposed candidate gene identified in our cohort found in more than 2.4% of cases. These genes are functionally diverse, with only a small number associated with DNA repair as with other known HGSOC predisposition genes, suggesting that much of the remaining missing heritability may lie in genes and pathways that are currently overlooked.",
        "Methods": "    Cases consisted of 516 women from Australia recruited to the Variants in Practice (ViP) study between 2013 and 2018 (Table 5) with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of HGSOC, as well as those with tumours of similar histology arising in the fallopian tube and peritoneum (which share similar clinical and molecular characteristics to HGSOC and are all thought to originate from foci of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma). Represented histological subtypes were high-grade serous (including carcinosarcomas) (n = 443); high-grade endometrioid (n = 35), which is considered a subtype of HGSOC, distinct from low-grade endometrioid tumours; mixed epithelial types with a predominant high-grade serous component (n = 11); and suspected high-grade serous tumours that were previously classed as adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified or as unknown (n = 27). All women were referred to a specialist familial cancer centre and assessed as fulfilling local criteria for offering them BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing (https://www.eviq.org.au/p/620). Clinical testing for germline variants in both genes was performed using validated, standard techniques (next-generation panel sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing for exon variants, along with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for structural variants) in a certified diagnostic lab, and all tested individuals had no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants nor any large deletions in these genes. These results were reconfirmed on analysis of their exome sequencing data for BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants.\n\n    Population control frequencies of gene variants were obtained from publicly available sequencing data in GnomAD version 2.1.1 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), containing 125,748 exome sequences and 15,708 genome sequences from unrelated individuals worldwide. Filtering options within GnomAD were used to remove data from individuals with a cancer diagnosis (including those sourced from TCGA) as well as those that were not from a non-Finnish European ethnic background, leaving 59,095 individuals.\n\n    Exome sequencing was performed on leucocyte DNA extracted from patient whole-blood samples utilising the Agilent SureSelect (Human All Exon v4 for six samples, and v6 for the remainder) capture and Illumina HiSeq 2500 (150 paired-end reads) sequencing platforms at two commercial sequencing companies (BGI and Novogene). An in-house bioinformatics pipeline constructed using Seqliner v0.7 (http://bioinformatics.petermac.org/seqliner) was used to process raw sequencing data. Raw sequencing reads were quality checked using FastQC v0.11.2 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc), trimmed using cutadapt v1.5  then aligned to the GRCh37/hg19 human reference genome using BWA-MEM v0.7.10 . Duplicate reads were filtered using Picard MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Base quality score recalibration and indel realignment were then performed on the filtered reads using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v3.8.0 . Variants were called using GATK HaplotypeCaller and Platypus v0.8.1 , then annotated for predicted consequences using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) database version v85  and LoFTEE (https://github.com/konradjk/loftee).\n\n    Principal component analysis was performed in PLINK v1.90  using a set of all SNPs passing filters in at least two samples that were targeted by both the Human All Exon v4 and v6 captures and passed linkage disequilibrium pruning (r2 threshold: <0.3, window size: 100 kb, step size: 5 kb). Clusters in the PCA results were classified to ethnicities informed by markers from the major sub-population groups as defined in the GnomAD database.\n\n    A series of filters were applied to the variant data (Fig. 1), using R v3.5.2 (2018) with tidyverse v1.2.1 installed, and the output viewed and analysed in Microsoft Excel v16.25 for Mac. For the discovery analysis, only variants classed by VEP as 'HIGH' impact were retained; these included classic LoF variants (stop-gain, start-loss, frameshift and essential splice site) in protein-coding transcripts, as well as equivalent variants in non-protein-coding transcripts (e.g. non-coding RNAs). Variants classed as 'MODERATE', 'LOW' or 'MODIFIER' impact (including missense, in-frame indel, stop-loss, cryptic splice site, synonymous etc. in protein-coding sequences) were removed. Analysis aimed to identify rare variants with strong pathogenic effect and good-quality sequencing metrics; hence, variants with GnomAD total population minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.005 or those annotated to non-canonical transcripts (as defined by Ensembl) were removed and a number of quality filters applied (Fig. 1). Following ranking (described below), additional filtering removed variants in transcripts that were not classed as 'protein_coding' in their Ensembl Biotype annotation, leaving only protein-coding LoF variants. Common variants (i.e. MAF > 0.005) in one or more of the major outbred population groups represented in GnomAD (i.e. excluding Finns, Ashkenazi Jewish and 'other' populations) were also removed, using the 'popmax' annotation. The latter filter facilitated the removal of common variants within the other major non-European ethnic groups (e.g. East Asian) represented in the patient sample, abrogating the need to use ethnicity-specific GnomAD data when performing filtering with these cases.\n\n    After excluding samples with deleterious variants in known ovarian cancer predisposition genes (Table 1), remaining genes were ranked by degree of enrichment for presumed deleterious variants in the case population. To facilitate this, total control population frequencies of 'HIGH' impact variants for every gene transcript were calculated using the GnomAD non-cancer reference data for the non-Finnish European (NFE) sub-population; these figures excluded common variants with MAF > 0.005, and were adjusted for genes with multiple variants per individual using the formula 1 -  (1 - AFi) i.e. one minus the combined probability of not containing any of the variant alleles. Variants that were flagged in GnomAD as failing their 'InbreedingCoeff', 'AC0' or 'RF' (random forests) QC filters were excluded from these figures, to match our filtering. Total frequencies for every gene with retained variants in the sample were calculated, and a risk ratio between figures for the two population groups (case cohort and GnomAD non-cancer NFE) was derived.\n\n    A two-tailed chi-squared test was then used to compare the total number of rare (i.e. AF <= 0.005) LoF variants in the case cohort vs. the equivalent number in the GnomAD non-cancer NFE sub-population for all genes represented on the Agilent SureSelect v6 exome panel with 'protein_coding' Biotype transcripts (n = 19,818). p values, odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals for every gene were then calculated using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test, incorporating allele counts in the sample vs. equivalent counts in the GnomAD non-cancer NFE sub-population (with the denominator as the maximum number of alleles from that population with available data in GnomAD for that specific gene). Genes were ranked in order of increasing p value, with the most enriched genes having the lowest p values, and the calculated risk ratios were used to prioritise variants in genes that were enriched by three-fold or more in the case cohort for further analysis. Additional two-tailed chi-squared tests were used to compare the observed vs. the expected distribution of Fisher's test p values < 0.01 for odds ratios >1 and <1 for genes with 'protein_coding' Biotype transcripts. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple testing was applied to the ranked list of p values to establish a 'discovery' threshold p value for prioritising top-ranked genes for further study, specifying a false discovery rate of 0.3. It is important to note that the p values used for ranking candidate genes do not imply a statistically significant difference in total LoF allele frequency between cases and the GnomAD sub-population for any individual gene, since the case cohort lacked the size and power required to demonstrate this. A two-tailed Fisher's exact test was also used to compare the total frequency of LoF variants in known DNA repair genes grouped by functional pathway (from Chae et al.) in the discovery cohort (n = 510) with those in the GnomAD non-cancer NFE sub-population; this analysis did not include BRCA1 and BRCA2 or any of the other known ovarian carcinoma predisposition genes that had been analysed for LoF variants in the case cohort during filtering (described below). All graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism v8.1.1 for Mac, and all statistical tests (Fisher's exact test, chi-squared tests and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) were performed in R or Prism.\n\n    Ranked genes and LoF variants were curated and scrutinised using available online databases (NCBI Gene, OMIM and COSMIC) to annotate their function and possible role in cancer predisposition. GnomAD data for each gene were also reviewed, to identify those genes with problematic sequencing data, or variants that were found at an AF > 0.005 in one of the GnomAD sub-populations; any genes or variants affected as such were excluded from the top-ranked gene list. Finally, the candidate gene variants with borderline quality sequencing metrics (i.e. failed QC sequencing quality score < 500, read depth < 60, alt allele read frequency < 0.35 or variants not called bidirectionally) were manually reviewed within the raw sequencing (bam) files using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) software; any doubtful variants were excluded when collating the top-ranked gene list. A two-tailed Fisher's exact test was used at this point to compare the likelihood of being a candidate gene carrier in those with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in one or more first- or second-degree relatives (n = 262) vs. those with no family history (n = 254).\n\n    For known and proposed ovarian carcinoma predisposition genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, FANCM, ATM, TP53, CHEK2, BARD1, STK11, CDH1, PTEN, FANCC, RECQL, BLM, NF1 and the MRN protein complex genes i.e. MRE11A, NBN, RAD50), any identified LoF variants annotated to RefSeqGene transcripts were considered pathogenic and retained, but additionally checked in NCBI ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar) to exclude any that had been classed in this database as 'benign' or 'likely benign'. Only missense variants classed as pathogenic in ClinVar with multiple sources of supporting evidence and consensus opinion were considered deleterious.\n\n    This study protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at each participating ViP study recruitment centre and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (approval nos. 11/50 and 09/29). All participants provided informed consent for genetic analysis of their germline and tumour DNA.\n\n    Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
        "Results": "    Whole-exome sequencing was successfully performed on all germline DNA samples to an average depth of 126x with 98.4% of the bases covered to >20x. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using common single nucleotide polyporphisms (SNPs), demonstrating that over 95% of participants were of Western European origin (Supplementary Fig. 1). Numerous quality and variant frequency filters (as summarised in Fig. 1) were applied to the data to remove artefacts, common variants and lower-impact variants that are unlikely to represent moderate-to-high-risk alleles. Implementing these filters left 6733 unique, rare 'HIGH' impact variants in 4901 genes.\n\n    Sequence data were analysed for deleterious variants in known ovarian carcinoma predisposition genes, including RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1 and the Lynch syndrome genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). As expected, no BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants were identified in this pre-screened group and only six of the 516 cases (1.2%) had clinically actionable variants in one of the other genes (Table 1). Five individuals carried LoF variants in one of MSH6, RAD51C, RAD51D or BRIP1, and one had a likely pathogenic missense variant in RAD51C. These six cases were removed from the discovery cohort, since the presence of deleterious variants in one of these genes is likely to explain their personal and family history of cancer.\n\n    Amongst the remaining 510 cases, 28 individuals (5.5%) had a LoF or known deleterious missense variant in 16 genes that have been proposed as ovarian cancer predisposition genes and are commonly included on HBOC gene testing panels (Table 2). After applying Fisher's exact tests as described below, only PALB2, ATM and MRE11A were enriched for LoF variants in the cases compared to GnomAD, although the number of variants and cases was small, and caution should be exercised interpreting the odds ratios as risk estimates. As it is currently unclear whether variants in these genes have a genuine role in HGSOC predisposition, these individuals were retained in the discovery cohort for subsequent analysis.\n\n    To assess for variant enrichment, the gene-level frequency of 'HIGH' impact variants in the remaining 510 cases was compared to the gene-level frequency in the GnomAD sub-population (n = 59,095), as detailed in the Methods. Overall, for all protein-coding genes represented on the WES panel (n = 19,818), there was a significantly higher number of rare LoF variants in the cases compared to GnomAD (p < 0.0001, chi-squared test). Two-tailed Fisher's exact tests were performed to rank genes by level of enrichment (as represented by their p values), and plotting their distribution (Fig. 2) demonstrated a significantly greater number of genes enriched for rare LoF variants (n = 133, OR > 1 and p < 0.01) compared to genes depleted for rare LoF variants (n = 19, OR < 1 and p < 0.01) in the cases vs. GnomAD (p < 0.0001, chi-squared test).\n\n    To identify the most likely candidates with an excess of LoF variants from amongst the remaining 4863 genes (Supplementary Data 1), a number of additional steps were applied (Fig. 1). First, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for multiple testing was used on the ranked list of Fisher's test p values to establish a 'discovery' threshold of 0.0094 (number of p values = 4863, false discovery rate = 0.3). Next, only protein-coding genes enriched with rare LoF variants (in any of the major GnomAD sub-populations) by at least three-fold in the cases were retained, reducing the list to 1700 unique LoF variants in 1307 genes amongst 491 individuals. Of these genes, the vast majority had a LoF variant in just one individual (n = 942) with most of the remainder occurring in 2-4 individuals (Fig. 3). Finally, genes with LoF variants in three or more individuals and p values below the calculated multiple testing threshold (n = 66) were prioritised for curation, including detailed GnomAD and bam file review. Twenty-three genes with low-confidence LoF variants were removed during curation; these included 15 genes that were removed due to their remaining valid variants occurring in fewer than three individuals, or falling below our three-fold enrichment threshold.\n\n    The remaining 43 highest-ranked candidate genes with high-confidence, rare LoF variants are displayed in Table 3 (for individual variants and associated case data, refer to Supplementary Data 2). The top-ranked genes are involved in very diverse functional pathways (e.g. transporter proteins and metabolic enzymes), and of note, few appear to have a role in DNA repair despite the fact that all known HBOC genes to date are directly or indirectly involved with that function. The majority of these candidate genes have not been reported to contain pathogenic somatic mutations in serous ovarian tumour samples from the COSMIC database (Table 3), and for those that do, the frequency of somatic variants is low (<1% of samples). Comparing the family history distribution of candidate gene carriers (n = 138) and non-carriers (n = 378), there was no significant difference in the likelihood of being a carrier in those with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in one or more first- or second-degree relatives vs. those with no family history (p = 0.55, Fisher's exact test).\n\n    To assess if this reflected a genuine lack of enrichment of DNA repair genes, the total frequency of rare LoF variants in DNA repair genes grouped by functional pathway amongst the cases in the discovery cohort was compared with the GnomAD sub-population (Table 4), excluding known HBOC genes that were previously searched for in the total case cohort (Table 1). One-hundred-and-five cases (21%) harboured at least one LoF variant across all DNA repair and associated genes, but the total frequency of LoF variants across all functional categories in the cases was very similar to GnomAD (0.063% vs. 0.061%, p = 0.60, Fisher's exact test). Although the frequency of LoF variants in the subset of genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination repair, Fanconi anaemia and non-homologous end-joining pathways were higher in the cases vs. GnomAD, only the homologous recombination repair category was significantly enriched (p = 0.032, Fisher's exact test).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Reported here is the largest WES study to date of HGSOC patients with no detectable BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations. The extreme degree of genetic heterogeneity underlying HGSOC predisposition is demonstrated by the fact that 1307 genes are enriched for LoF variants by a minimum of three-fold, along with the fact that amongst the 43 high-priority candidates, the median number of LoF variants was only four. Although a proportion of these genes are likely to be false positives, the fact there is a significantly higher number of rare LoF variants in the case cohort compared to GnomAD as well as significantly more genes with ORs > 1 compared to those with ORs < 1 indicates that the list likely includes many genuine HGSOC predisposition genes.\n\n    Among the top-ranked genes (Table 3), a small number function in a manner analogous to other known tumour suppressor genes. For example, RPA3, USP50 and RAD1 are thought to participate in arresting cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage. Others, such as SLC12A4 (a potassium and chloride ion co-transporter) and IMPDH2 (the rate-limiting enzyme in guanine nucleotide synthesis), are known to have an oncogenic role in various tumour types. Assuming their biological function as described in the literature is accurate and complete, it is unclear how germline LoF variants in these genes might predispose to tumour development. However, the vast majority of top-ranked genes either have no known role in tumorigenesis (e.g. LOXL2) and/or their function is currently unknown (e.g. ZBTB45). This uncertainty suggests that approaches to gene discovery that emphasise candidate gene function above other considerations (such as relative frequency of LoF mutations in cases vs. controls) may fail to identify HGSOC predisposition genes functioning in pathways other than those classically inactivated in HBOC, such as DNA repair pathway genes. Of these, only homologous recombination repair pathway genes were modestly enriched for rare LoF variants in the cohort, indicating that mutations in these genes cannot alone explain the missing heritability of HGSOC.\n\n    Only 16 top-ranked genes had any somatic mutations recorded in COSMIC (Table 3), none of which exceeded 1% of serous ovarian tumour samples present in the database. This is consistent with the finding that established germline susceptibility genes, with the exception of TP53, are also rarely found to harbour somatically-acquired mutations in sequenced tumour samples. BRCA1 pathogenic somatic mutations, for example, are only present in 1.59% of serous ovarian carcinoma samples in the COSMIC database.\n\n    Only a small fraction of cases (6.6%) were potentially explained by genes known or suggested to be linked with a higher risk of HGSOC, which is consistent with the low frequency reported in other studies. Of note, there was no enrichment for Lynch syndrome genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), despite the large size of the cohort. This reflects the fact that the ovarian tumour types most often associated with Lynch syndrome (i.e. clear cell and low-grade endometrioid) were not represented in this patient group.\n\n    Although many of the suspected HBOC-associated genes harboured LoF variants (Table 2), the frequencies were low and only PALB2, ATM and MRE11A showed some degree of enrichment compared to GnomAD. The level of enrichment was relatively modest, with very wide confidence intervals due to the small numbers present, making it challenging to interpret their true significance. Previous work suggested a similarly modest increase in risk for ATM and PALB2, but not for MRE11A, casting doubt on whether the latter is truly an ovarian carcinoma predisposition gene. Recent additional data from PALB2 families found that pathogenic variants are associated with a two-to-three-fold increased risk of ovarian carcinoma, independently of the known strong association with breast carcinoma.\n\n    The remaining proposed HBOC genes with LoF variants present in the cohort (BLM, CHEK2, FANCM, NBN, NF1, RAD50, RECQL) have similar or lower frequencies of LoF mutations compared to GnomAD. Whilst these results do not exclude the possibility they may be associated with an increased risk of hereditary ovarian carcinoma, it does suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting their causative role in the context of germline genetic testing for women with suspected hereditary ovarian carcinoma and no personal or family history of breast carcinoma.\n\n    To date, no studies have applied a wholly unbiased WES-based approach to ovarian carcinoma predisposition gene discovery in a case cohort selected for HGSOC and enriched for hereditary cases where BRCA1 and BRCA2 involvement have been excluded. Stafford et al. conducted WES on 48 BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative ovarian carcinoma cases with a high prior likelihood of genetic susceptibility, but restricted their candidate gene variant analysis to 155 genes involved in DNA damage response or cell cycle regulation, along with 64 ovarian carcinoma-associated genes listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Similarly, Lu et al. interrogated WES data from Ambry Genetics for 2051 women with ovarian carcinoma for only a small number of known 'cancer-associated' genes, and demonstrated significant enrichment for variants in six genes (ATM, CHEK2, MSH6, PALB2, RAD51C and TP53). Recently, Zhu et al. analysed WES data from 158 BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative ovarian carcinoma cases and identified ANKRD11 and POLE as putative risk genes following validation studies. Neither gene was found to be enriched for LoF variants in our cohort. However, their analysis of the exome data excluded variants in genes based on expression data and residual variation intolerance scores, and retained predicted pathogenic missense variants. The selective focus of these studies on certain genes also reflects a prevailing assumption about the importance of DNA repair pathway genes in HGSOC that is not supported by our data, which further emphasises the importance of applying an open approach to candidate gene identification.\n\n    Other groups alternatively used TCGA germline WES data to search for disease-associated genetic variants, although as noted earlier, this approach has limitations. Kanchi et al., using data from 429 serous ovarian carcinoma TCGA cases and 557 controls, identified several genes enriched for germline deleterious variants that were not previously associated with ovarian carcinoma (e.g. ASXL1, MAP3K1 and SETD2). However, their subsequent studies did not validate their predisposition gene discoveries. Dicks et al. also used TCGA data from 412 HGSOC cases to identify disease-associated variants in 12 DNA repair genes, and subsequently assessed them in 3107 HGSOC cases and 3368 controls. Of these candidate genes, only FANCM had a significantly higher mutation frequency in cases vs. controls. None of the genes identified by Dicks et al. (including FANCM) were enriched for LoF mutations in our cohort.\n\n    Limitations of the current study include the use of GnomAD as the control population, given the differences in sequencing platforms and variant callers that could result in both false-positive and false-negative associations. Detailed review of variants in the top-ranked genes in both the cases and GnomAD to identify potentially unreliable calls aimed to reduce this problem. While ethnicity differences between the cases and GnomAD exist, these were demonstrated by PCA to be minimal with their predominant (over 95%) Western European ancestry being well matched with the GnomAD NFE non-cancer cohort. In addition, the frequencies of LoF mutations in HBOC genes in GnomAD were broadly comparable to our local population control figures from prior studies, giving us confidence that in the context of a gene discovery phase, GnomAD is a suitable surrogate control population.\n\n    The largest potential source of uncertainty in this study is the extreme genetic heterogeneity of HGSOC predisposition, with most of the candidate genes only having LoF mutations in less than 0.5% of individuals, meaning that the risk of false-positive associations in the discovery set due to chance or to rare, benign variants will be high (up to 30% for ranked genes with p values < 0.0094 after multiple testing correction). Consequently, it will be essential to conduct further validation using very large case-control studies as well as orthogonal approaches such as tumour sequencing, which can provide powerful evidence of bi-allelic inactivation or other somatic genetic features consistent with the candidate gene actively driving carcinogenesis.\n\n    In summary, WES of the largest cohort of BRCA1 and BRCA2-negative HGSOC cases assembled to date has demonstrated the extensive genetic heterogeneity that exists in the remaining unresolved cases of hereditary HGSOC. Furthermore, the lack of enrichment for LoF mutations in genes either directly or indirectly involved in DNA repair posits an explanation for the lack of success of previous candidate gene studies that have prioritised such classes of genes. This study provides an important, unbiased catalogue of 'function-agnostic' candidate genes based solely on mutation frequencies, which will facilitate additional genetic epidemiological and functional studies with the potential to translate the findings into future clinical practice.",

        "Title": "    Repurposing non-invasive prenatal testing data: Population study of single nucleotide variants associated with colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    In our previous work, genomic data generated through non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) based on low-coverage massively parallel whole-genome sequencing of total plasma DNA of pregnant women in Slovakia was described as a valuable source of population specific data. In the present study, these data were used to determine the population allele frequency of common risk variants located in genes associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and Lynch syndrome (LS). Allele frequencies of identified variants were compared with six world populations to detect significant differences between populations. Finally, variants were interpreted, functional consequences were searched for and clinical significance of variants was investigated using publicly available databases. Although the present study did not identify any pathogenic variants associated with CRC or LS in the Slovak population using NIPT data, significant differences were observed in the allelic frequency of risk CRC variants previously reported in genome-wide association studies and common variants located in genes associated with LS. As Slovakia is one of the leading countries with the highest incidence of CRC among male patients in the world, there is a need for studies dedicated to investigating the cause of such a high incidence of CRC in Slovakia. The present study also assumed that extensive cross-country data aggregation of NIPT results would represent an unprecedented source of information concerning human genome variation in cancer research.",
        "Introduction": "    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second most common cancer in Europe, causing an estimated 9.4% of all cancer deaths in Europe. CRC is also a serious societal problem in Slovakia, with an incidence rate of 15,7% and a mortality rate of 15,6% [ GLOBOCAN 2020 data]. Many risk factors and causes are associated with the likelihood of developing CRC, but the main reason is still not fully understood. The considerable geographical variability suggests that CRC is a complex polygenic disease caused by genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. Age, sex, lifestyle, and dietary habits, including meat and alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, obesity and lack of physical activity play a major role in the pathogenesis of CRC. Other well-known risk factors may also be inflammatory bowel diseases, acromegaly, renal transplantation with long-term immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance, cholecystectomy, or androgen deprivation therapy.\n\n    Beside these, inherited susceptibility plays a significant role in the etiology of CRC because it can be responsible for about 35% of all cases of colorectal cancer. However, high-penetrance germline variants in known genes (APC, BRCA2, KRAS, NTS, SMAD4, POLE, BRAF, BMPR1A, POLD1, STK11, MUTYH and DNA mismatch repair genes), which are associated with severe hereditary syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), account for only 5-7% of total CRC cases. Therefore, the remaining unknown heritability is probably explained by the interaction of common, low-penetrance variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS in ethnic/racial minority populations offers the opportunity to uncover genetic susceptibility factors and discover new genomic regions and loci that contribute risk for CRC development. Since 2007, more than 100 common risk variants have been successfully identified in GWAS, which have helped to elucidate the etiology of CRC.\n\n    Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome that accounts for approximately 3% of all colorectal cancer cases. From a clinical point of view, 10-82% of LS cases are associated with a lifetime risk of developing CRC, unless the risk is significantly lower in other types of cancer. LS is caused by pathogenic germline mutations in a class of genes called DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, mainly MLH1, located in 3p22.2 chromosome, and MSH2, located in 2p21 chromosome, which represent 70-85% of cases of LS. Mutations found in MSH6 (2p16.3), PMS2 (7p22.1) and MLH3 genes have lower incidence. Molecular investigations have also shown that MSH3 and germline 3'deletions of the EPCAM gene, which lead to epigenetic silencing of MSH2, are also implicated in the pathogenesis of LS. As a consequence of MMR pathway inactivation and loss of expression of MMR proteins, DNA replication errors accumulate typically resulting in microsatellite instability (MSI), which is generally detected in LS patients' tumor tissues. The diagnosis of LS involves three main steps, identification of patients and their familial history that meet the Amsterdam or Bethesda guidelines, presence of MSI in tumors and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of MMR protein expression. A definitive diagnosis of LS must be confirmed by detecting the germline mutations in MMR genes.\n\n    Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) based on low-coverage massively parallel whole-genome sequencing of plasma DNA from pregnant women generates a large amount of data that provides the resources to investigate human genetic variations in the population. In our previous studies, we described the re-use of the data from NIPT for genome-scale population specific frequency determination of small DNA variants and CNVs. Since pregnant women represent a relatively standard sample of the local female population, we assumed this NIPT data could also be used in the population study of CRC, the most common cancer in Slovakia. Some research concerning on genomic analysis of plasma from NIPT has also demonstrated NIPT data's efficiency and utility for viral genetic studies, genetic profiling of Vietnamese population or detection of CNV aberrations.\n\n    The main aim of our study was a detailed analysis of common variants (MAF >0,05) that showed evidence of association with CRC in GWAS datasets and characterization of population variability from data generated by NIPT. We assumed that the genetic factors, mainly the increased specific population frequency of CRC and LS variants could be responsible for the high incidence of CRC in Slovakia. To test this hypothesis, allele frequencies of risk CRC variants identified in the Slovak population were compared with allele frequencies of risk CRC variants in 6 worldwide populations. As LS is among the most common hereditary CRC syndromes, the aim of our study was also to analyze population allele frequencies and describe clinical impacts of relevant variants located in known LS predisposing genes. To our knowledge, this was the first population study of CRC using NIPT data conducted exclusively in the Slovak population.",
        "Methods": "    The laboratory procedure used, to generate the NIPT data, were as follows: DNA from plasma of peripheral maternal blood was isolated for NIPT analysis from 1,501 pregnant women after obtaining a written informed consent consistent with the Helsinki declaration from the subjects. The population cohort consisted from women in reproductive age between 17-48 years with a median of 35 years. Genomic information from a sample consisted of maternal and fetal DNA fragments. Each included individual agreed to use their genomic data in an anonymized form for general biomedical research. The NIPT study (study ID 35900_2015) was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Bratislava Self-Governing Region (Sabinovska ul.16, 820 05 Bratislava) on 30th April of 2015 under the decision ID 03899_2015. Blood samples were collected to EDTA tubes and plasma was separated in dual centrifugation procedure. DNA was isolated from 700 microl of plasma using DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen) according to standard protocol. Sequencing libraries were prepared from each sample using TruSeq Nano kit HT (Illumina) following standard protocol with omission of DNA fragmentation step. Each sample was normalized to 4 nm library and the final concentration of libraries was 2,8 pM. Individual barcode labelled libraries were pooled and sequenced using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform (Illumina) by performing paired end sequencing of 2x35 bases.\n\n    The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available in the DSpace repository, .\n\n    We combined genotype data from all previously reported GWAS studies available online  for the years 2007-2020, specifically 66 GWAS studies of CRC risk variants that included individuals with European, Asian and African American ancestry. Using data from these GWAS datasets, we identified 116 risk variants associated with CRC, which were then merged with our data of identified variants from NIPT. Risk variants that were not found in NIPT data were excluded from the analysis. All identified variants in the Slovak population used for further analyses were common (MAFs >0.05). Subsequently, allele frequencies of CRC risk variants for each population (East Asian, South Asian, African, American, Finnish European and non-Finnish European) were extracted from the gnomAD database available online (v3.0, downloaded from ) and compared with our frequencies determined for the Slovak population from NIPT data. Allele frequency in each population and allele frequency differences were plotted using boxplots. Outliers of boxplots that represent variants with highly different frequencies between Slovak and non-Finnish populations were annotated via published literature and studies [in dbSNP  and GWAS ]. To assess the relations between allele frequency of CRC risk variants in each population, we also used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using matplotlib.pyplot library, which reduces the dimension of the data to a graphically interpretable 2D or 3D dimension. Consequently, we obtained information on which populations have similar or different allele frequencies of the identified CRC risk variants.\n\n    After analyzing variants associated with CRC, we focused on the study of variants associated with LS. First, we filtered out a group of variants located in 7 genes known to be associated with LS (MLH1, PMS2, MSH6, MLH3, MSH2, TGFBR2, EPCAM). The genomic locations of genes were determined by the GeneCards database . From the dataset of identified variants in LS associated genes, we excluded variants in low complexity genomic regions (soft masked in the reference FASTA file), eliminating the variants that could represent sequencing artifacts or repetitive regions. All variants that were used for further analysis were annotated using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP, version 101_GRCh38). In our dataset, based on ClinVar database annotation of the most common types of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants associated with LS , we selected variants including frameshift, missense, nonsense, splice site, non-coding and UTR variants. After this filtering, allele frequencies for both groups of variants (all variants identified in LS genes and selected types of variants) for each population (East Asian, South Asian, African, American, Finnish European and non-Finnish European) were extracted from the gnomAD database (v3.0, downloaded from ) and compared with our frequencies determined for the Slovak population from NIPT data. Allele frequency in each population and allele frequency differences were plotted using boxplots and PCA analysis using matplotlib.pyplot library. Outliers of boxplots representing variants with allele frequency differences more than 10% were annotated via published literature and studies [in dbSNP  and GWAS .\n\n    The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available in the DSpace repository, .",
        "Results": "    In the analysis of the 66 GWAS studies that included all identified risk variants associated with colorectal carcinogenesis from 2007-2020, we investigated 116 variants. There were 25 independent CRC risk variants in Asian population, 62 risk variants found in European population, 27 risk variants in both European and Asian population and 2 risk variants located in African American population that were previously reported in GWAS (Table I).\n\n    After merging all identified variants from GWAS (116 risk variants) with our NIPT data, we identified 106 common risk CRC variants (Table SI), while 10 risk variants that were not called in the Slovak population were excluded from further analysis. The allele frequencies of 106 variants identified in our population sample (Slovak population) and the allele frequencies of variants for 6 world populations (East Asian, South Asian, African, American, Finnish European and non-Finnish European) obtained by gnomAD database (Table SII) are shown in graphical comparison by Boxplots (Fig. 1) and principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1, the MAF ranged from 0.0-0.963109 in 6 world populations that is comparable with the Slovak population (0.0521-0.931). The median allele frequency for the Slovak population reached the value of 0.4072, which is closest to the value of the median of the American population (MED=0.3991) and Finnish population (MED=0.4166). PCA placed our sample set most closely to the two gnomAD population sample sets, i.e., to the Finnish and non-Finnish European population.\n\n    Next, we compared known allele frequencies of 106 CRC risk variants in our sample set from the Slovak population to allele frequencies of CRC variants in six world populations. The final findings of allele frequency differences are shown in Fig. 3. The median allele frequency for comparing the Slovak population and non-Finnish European population reached the value of 0.002285. Together, we identified 14 outliers in Fig. 3 (3 of 14 variants reached a similar value and overlapped, so they are not clearly visible in Fig. 3). Since the same variant rs4246215 was identified in 4 different population comparisons (Slovak-American, Slovak-Finnish European, Slovak-non-Finnish European, and also identified in Slovak-East Asian population comparison) and the rs3131043 variant in 2 population comparisons (Slovak-Finnish European and Slovak-non-Finnish European population comparison), we identified a total of 10 variants, whose difference in population allele frequency was more than 10%. Table II includes annotation information about these variants by dbSNP NCBI, ClinVar database, and population comparison in which they were identified.\n\n    In the analysis of LS, we identified 1212 variants in our sample set from NIPT that were located in genes known to be associated with LS, i.e., MLH1, PMS2, MSH6, TGFBR2, MLH3, MSH2 and EPCAM. After excluding variants from low complexity regions, we obtained 648 variants that were finally annotated by VEP and used for further analysis. The allele frequencies of 648 variants identified in our population sample (Slovak population) and the allele frequencies of variants for 6 world populations (East Asian, South Asian, African, American, Finnish European and non-Finnish European) obtained by gnomAD database (Table SIII) are shown in graphical comparison by Boxplots (Fig. 4) and principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 4, the MAF ranged from 0.0-1.0 in 6 world populations. In the Slovak population, all variants were with MAF>0.05 (0.0502-1.0). The median allele frequency for the Slovak population reached the value of 0.2204, which is closest to the value of the median of the South Asian population (MED=0.221274). PCA placed our sample set most closely to the non-Finnish European population (Fig. 5).\n\n    In the next step, to identify variants having significantly different frequencies, we compared known allele frequencies of 648 variants located in genes associated with LS identified in our sample set from the Slovak population to allele frequencies of these variants in six gnomAD world populations. The final findings of allele frequency differences are shown in Fig. 6. The median allele frequency for the comparison of the Slovak population and non-Finnish European population reached the value of -0.01093. By comparing the allele frequency of variants of the Slovak and non-Finnish populations, we identified a total of 64 outliers. Most outliers were found in the MSH2 gene, others in MSH6, TGFBR2, PMS2, MLH1 and EPCAM. We did not identify any outlying variant in the MLH3 gene. The variation type of all outliers was 'intronic variant' and the clinical significance of all outliers was not reported in ClinVar. All this annotation information, also including chromosome position, variants ID, reference and alternative allele, genes, is available in Table SIV.\n\n    Our analysis also included allele frequency comparison of selected variants from 648 variants identified in our sample set of NIPT data. We focused on frameshift, missense, nonsense, splice site, non-coding and UTR variants, annotated in the ClinVar database as the most common types of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants associated with LS. However, from these selected types of variants, we found only UTR and non-coding variants in our dataset of 648 variants. Other types of variants (downstream, upstream, and intron) were excluded from further analysis. Finally, we selected 18 variants, 10 UTR and 8 non-coding variants (all selected variants with annotation information by VEP and ClinVar are available in Table III). We compared known allele frequencies of these 18 selected variants identified in our population sample (Slovak population) to the six gnomAD world populations. The final findings of allele frequency differences are shown in Fig. 7. The median allele frequency for the comparison of the Slovak population and non-Finnish European population reached the value of 0.014215, which is closest to the value of the median allele frequency comparison of the South Asian and Slovak population (MED=0.014186). By comparing the allele frequency of variants of the Slovak and six gnomAD world population, we identified a total of 4 outliers-rs10951973, rs10951972 (identified in Slovak-American population comparison), rs6791557 (in Slovak-American and Slovak-non-Finnish European population comparison) and rs9852378 (in Slovak-South Asian population comparison). All outliers were non-coding variants, rs10951973 and rs10951972 located in the PMS2 and rs6791557 located in the TGFBR2 were not reported in ClinVar. The rs9852378 SNP, detected in the MLH1, was reported as benign by ClinVar.\n\n    Finally, we analyzed allele frequencies of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants associated with Lynch syndrome annotated in the ClinVar database. From 229 SNPs with pathogenic and likely pathogenic clinical significance, only 15 have non-zero AF records in the gnomAD database. As shown in Fig. 8, all found AF are significantly below 5% (Table IV and Fig. 8).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Population genetic studies currently have a huge impact on the study of genomics. The detection of risk variants in a population and identifying their genetic relationships have advanced our understanding of the human genome's variability and led to the elucidation of many factors that influence cancer risk. In recent years, NGS technologies have played a key role in colorectal cancer research and have become a useful tool for cancer diagnostics and screening. Due to the high incidence of colorectal cancer in the Slovak population, it is crucial to determine the possible causes of the high incidence of this disease in Slovakia.\n\n    Non-invasive prenatal testing of common fetal chromosomal aberrations, using low-coverage massively parallel whole-genome sequencing of maternal plasma cfDNA of pregnant women, has become the fastest low-cost genomic DNA test that is rapidly implemented in clinical practice. Currently, more than 3 million NIPT tests are carried out worldwide each year, and the large amount of data generated during NIPT provides the resources to investigate human genetic variations in the population. In our study, we analyzed low-coverage massively parallel whole-genome sequencing data of total plasma DNA from pregnant women generated for NIPT screening to characterize the variants in genes associated with CRC and LS in the Slovak population. To our knowledge, the present study is the first population analysis of CRC and LS variants worldwide and also in the Slovak population using NIPT data. We illustrate the utility of these genomic data for clinical genetics and population studies.\n\n    Over the past two decades, GWAS offer the opportunity to uncover genetic susceptibility factors for CRC and provide insights into the biological basis of CRC etiology. These studies have demonstrated that only a fraction of CRC heritability is explained by known risk-conferring genetic variation, whereas the remaining genetic risk of CRC may be accounted for by a combination of high-prevalence and low-penetrance of common genetic variants. To date, a large number of common genetic variants have been identified by the GWAS approach, which has intimately connected to the onset of CRC.\n\n    By pooling GWAS data of risk variants associated with colorectal carcinogenesis from 2007-2020 and data variants in our population sample from NIPT, we have identified 106 common risk CRC variants. When we compared allele frequencies of these variants to allele frequencies in six gnomAD world population, finally 13 common risk variants were found that showed statistically significant differences in population allele frequencies-rs5934683, rs7252505, rs4779584, rs1535, rs174550, rs4246215, rs11196172, rs10904849, rs6928864, rs3131043, rs1476570, rs12659017, rs397775554.\n\n    The SNP rs5934683 is located on chromosome Xp22.2 between two genes, GPR143 (G protein-coupled receptor 143), which is expressed by melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium and SHROOM2 (shroom family member 2), a human homolog of the Xenopus laevis APX gene that has important functions in cell morphogenesis including endothelial and epithelial tissue development. Missense mutations in this gene have been detected in large-scale screens for recurring mutations in cancer cell lines. Both GPR143 and SHROOM2 play a role in melanosome biogenesis and retinal pigmentation. It is known that abnormal retinal pigmentation, similar to the congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium lesions, are typical of the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome (FAP), one of the inherited syndromes of CRC. The relationship between Xp22.2 and CRC risk represents the first evidence for the role of X-chromosome variation in predisposition to non-sex-specific cancer.\n\n    The SNP rs7252505, located in the 19q13 risk locus, is in an intron of the gene GPATCH1 (G-patch domain containing 1). Although GPATCH1 is expressed in the colon, little is known about its function other than the fact that it contains a G-patch domain, a domain typically associated with RNA processing. One study found that rs7252505 was associated with CRC in African Americans.\n\n    Intergenic variant rs4779584 in chromosomal region 15q13.3 lies between SCG5 and GREM1, and the association between this SNP to CRC has been identified in several GWAS studies.\n\n    The rs4246215 polymorphism is located in the FEN1 in the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q12.2). The association between this SNP and the potential risk of different types of cancers, including esophageal, lung, gastrointestinal, gallbladder, breast cancer in Chinese and Iran populations, glioma and childhood leukemia, has been previously studied. The rs4246215 variant was also associated with colorectal cancer in East Asians and the Chinese population.\n\n    To identify variants that may predispose to LS and may cause the high incidence of CRC in Slovakia, we used NIPT data, including variants with at least 5% AF and coverage at least 100 reads per variant. To verify the reliability of the found variants using NIPT, we selected 15 variants with AF below 5% and validated them using Sanger sequencing. For this reason, it is not possible to find rare variants with AF under 5%. Initially, we selected gene variants known to be associated with LS and we focused on their population AF in gnomAD database and as well as on pathogenicity as reported in public database ClinVar. No publications are available for all variants showing statistically significant differences in population allele frequencies and selected 18 variants. The rs9852378 SNP was reported as benign by ClinVar, and other variants were not reported in ClinVar.\n\n    Our study has several key shortcomings. None of the variants identified in this study are pathogenic or likely pathogenic due to their extremely low frequency in the general population (Fig. 8). From the total number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants annotated in the ClinVar database, we could determine the population frequency of only 15 variants even when using the gnomAD database (Table IV). Second, the sample size was relatively small and it is strongly biased towards females. We assume that even larger sample sets will also not offer opportunities to detect such low frequencies of LS variants in the population using NIPT data. Third, a substantial portion of identified variants was removed from analyses due to technical limitations, mainly because of their location in low complexity regions. Although these could be technical artifacts, they could also be real variants having biological effects that are yet generally hardly determinable, but likely existing. Moreover, colorectal cancer is a disease caused by a combination of multiple genes and environmental factors. To assess the relationship between the variants identified in population and CRC development, it is very important in future research to study the interaction between genes and also the environment on the colorectal cancer risk. Although suitable for the determination of general population frequencies of independent variants, NIPT data are unsuitable for calculations (such as polygenic risk score determinations) based on exact combinations of these variants in individuals, which may de facto determine the risk of individuals to develop certain diseases.\n\n    The underlying mechanism for a high incidence of CRC in the Slovak population is still unclear at the moment; however, it is possible that genetic factors, like the most common inherited syndrome-LS, play a crucial role in colorectal etiology. We have performed a literature search in PubMed focused on population studies of CRC and LS in Slovakia from 2010-2020 using next-generation sequencing. In the Slovak population, only a few population studies of risk variants have been conducted to elucidate the etiology of CRC. In general, little is known about risk variants associated with CRC or LS in the Slovak population.\n\n    Identifying mutations associated with CRC in populations with high mortality rate, such as the Slovak population, is important to reduce the incidence of this multifactor disorder. The findings from these studies suggest a lack of understanding of the mechanism of many risk variants of CRC. Due to study limitations, we could not identify any pathogenic variants associated with LS in the Slovak population using NIPT data. On the other hand, NIPT data is not a major obstacle to better results, as pathogenic variants have extremely low frequencies in the general population. Even in most cases, the frequencies are not known. However, we identified several promising common risk variants associated with CRC previously reported in GWAS studies that represent variants with highly different frequencies between Slovak and non-Finnish populations in boxplots. Since NIPT expands rapidly to millions of individuals each year, the reuse of these data reduces the cost of large-scale population studies and likely provides an acceptable background for information about genomic variation. Finally, future population studies on larger sample sets with various types of mutations are needed to reveal new mechanisms of pathogenicity and links to new biological pathways, which may be useful in designing preventive strategies and treatment of CRC.",

        "Title": "    Genetics and RNA Regulation of Uveal Melanoma",
        "Abstract": "    Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare eye cancer with a high mortality rate due to metastases, leading to death in up to 50% of patients within 10 years from UM diagnosis. Moreover, patients show a median survival of 6 to 12 months after metastasis diagnosis. UM and cutaneous melanoma (CM) have the same melanocytic origin; however, they are very different in terms of molecular alterations and biological behavior. In this review, we will discuss the complex genetic and non-coding RNA-based epigenetic landscapes underlying the transformation, progression, and dissemination of UM. This knowledge will pave the way for the future identification of new biomarkers of the pathology and therapeutic targets.\n\n    Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular malignant tumor and the most frequent melanoma not affecting the skin. While the rate of UM occurrence is relatively low, about 50% of patients develop metastasis, primarily to the liver, with lethal outcome despite medical treatment. Notwithstanding that UM etiopathogenesis is still under investigation, a set of known mutations and chromosomal aberrations are associated with its pathogenesis and have a relevant prognostic value. The most frequently mutated genes are BAP1, EIF1AX, GNA11, GNAQ, and SF3B1, with mutually exclusive mutations occurring in GNAQ and GNA11, and almost mutually exclusive ones in BAP1 and SF3B1, and BAP1 and EIF1AX. Among chromosomal aberrations, monosomy of chromosome 3 is the most frequent, followed by gain of chromosome 8q, and full or partial loss of chromosomes 1 and 6. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms regulated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), namely microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have also been investigated. Several papers investigating the role of ncRNAs in UM have reported that their dysregulated expression affects cancer-related processes in both in vitro and in vivo models. This review will summarize current findings about genetic mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and ncRNA dysregulation establishing UM biology.",
        "Introduction": "    Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults and the most common non-cutaneous melanoma. UM accounts for about 3-5% of all melanoma cases; it develops in the uveal tract of the eye, primarily involving the choroid (85-90%) but also the ciliary body (5-8%) and the iris (3-5%). The average age of diagnosis is about 60 years; however, UM has been reported in patients of all ages, with younger patients under the age of 18 accounting for only 1% of all cases. UM incidence rises with age, peaking at 70 years old. In children, UM is uncommon, and congenital diseases are extremely sporadic. The prevalence of UM also appears to be gender related. Population-based studies have shown that males have a higher age-adjusted incidence than females, with a 20-30% higher rate in males. The prevalence of UM is also related to ethnicity. In Europe, the incidence of UM decreases along a north-south gradient due to increased ocular pigmentation in southern populations, which protects the eyes from UV radiation. In 2007, the European incidence ranged from 2 cases per million in southern Italy and Spain to >8 cases per million in Scandinavian countries, with a Central European incidence of 6 cases per million. During the same time period, the incidence in the United States was estimated to be 4.3 cases per million, a value that rises with latitude. The average age at diagnosis varies by population, with Asian patients having a lower average.\n\n    While the rate of occurrence is relatively low, UM has a high mortality rate due to metastatic spread, with up to 50% of patients dying within 10 years from diagnosis; indeed, a median survival of 6 to 12 months after metastasis diagnosis has been reported. Because of the absence of lymphatic drainage from the eye, metastases form via hematogenous spread and are rarely found at the time of initial diagnosis. Due to the lack of effective treatments and the high tumor burden at the time of detection, the 1-year survival rate of UM patients drops dramatically to 15% once it has metastasized. The liver is the most common site of metastasis (60-89%), followed by lungs (24-29%), skin and soft tissue (11-12%), bone (8-17%), and lymph nodes (11%).\n\n    The prognosis of UM has been associated with tumor location, age, and sex: indeed, iris melanoma has a 5-10-fold lower mortality rate than posterior UM, while younger age and female sex appear to be protective against metastatic disease. Other relevant prognostic factors are (i) the potential infiltration of ciliary bodies, representing a marker of poor prognosis with respect to the solitary choroidal involvement; (ii) presence/absence of extraocular extension with emphasis on sclera invasion; (iii) pathologic tumor staging based on the greatest thickness and largest basal diameter of the neoplasm, according to the 8th edition of TNM staging. It is recommended that pathologists also report mitotic activity (number of mitoses/mm2) and Ki-67 (MKI67, marker of proliferation Ki-67) score as a measure of proliferative activity.\n\n    Despite a common melanocyte origin, UM and cutaneous melanoma (CM) are distinct diseases in terms of both genetic alterations and biological behavior. Although UV exposure is clearly a major risk factor for CM, the contribution of UV exposure to UM pathogenesis is not well established. Several studies showed a weak positive association between UV exposure and the development of UM, but others did not confirm this evidence. On the contrary, it has been reported that increased UV exposure may have a protective effect, as people who work outdoors have been shown to have a lower risk of developing UM compared to those who work indoors. Nonetheless, low levels of melanin in eyes and skin have been associated with UM, implying that UV radiation may play a role in UM, although considerably weaker than in CM.\n\n    Ophthalmologists use clinical examination to diagnose UM; several ancillary tests can be performed, including fundus oculi biomicroscopy, color fundus photography, ultrasonography (USG), ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in case of anterior location of the tumor (iris or ciliary body), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Patients may be asymptomatic or exhibit symptoms such as blurred vision, photopsia, floaters, and loss of visual field. Because UM is often asymptomatic, it is frequently detected during a routine ophthalmology examination by instrumental methods, the results of which are sometimes unclear due to an overlap in size between small UM and benign choroidal nevi. UM is one of the few cancers in which biopsy is not usually used to confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, biopsy analysis in UM is rarely feasible, especially for diagnostic purposes, because the presumed tumor tissue must be extracted from the eye after enucleation, nullifying the diagnostic significance of the analysis. Otherwise, an intraocular tumor biopsy could be performed. The latter technique is highly debated due to the theoretical risk of tumor dissemination caused by its invasiveness; additionally, the lesions' small size and posterior location increase the risk of insufficient sampling and sight-threatening ocular complications. However, in UM lesions, biopsies are commonly used for prognosis.\n\n    Despite advancements in primary tumor treatment, metastasis rates and overall survival (OS) have remained unchanged over the past decades. OS is approximately one year after the diagnosis of metastatic disease. In fact, patients who have metastasis at the time of primary tumor diagnosis are less likely to receive aggressive primary tumor treatments. There are two types of primary UM treatment: globe-preserving treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, laser, and surgical therapy) and enucleation. Enucleation surgery is typically used to treat large tumors, multifocal and diffuse iris melanoma, poor visual function, and recurrent tumors. Local tumor recurrence is typically treated in the same way that the primary tumor was. Secondary orbital involvement is difficult to treat and requires radiotherapy and surgery (excision, debulking, or exenteration). Systemic monitoring is used to early detect metastasis and may have clinical implications because some selected cases of hepatic metastasis may be managed with surgical resection, resulting in improved survival. Because UM has a proclivity to metastasize to the liver, surveillance imaging is often centered on hepatic monitoring.\n\n    The only effective therapeutic approach against metastatic disease is tebentafusp, which was approved by the FDA in January 2022. Several chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin, dacarbazine, fotemustine, temozolomide, treosulfan, have been studied, with underwhelming results. Unlike CM, immunotherapy did not improve the outcome of patients with UM. One reason for such a disparity in immunotherapy response could be due to the biological and immunogenic differences between CM and UM. Given the prevalence of GNAQ (G protein subunit alpha q)/GNA11 (G protein subunit alpha 11) mutations in UM, agents targeting downstream effectors of GNAQ/GNA11 pathways, such as MEK (now named MAP2K7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7) (e.g., selumetinib and trametinib) and PKC (now named PRRT2: proline-rich transmembrane protein 2) (e.g., sotrastaurin), have been studied. However, as with other therapeutic approaches, unsatisfying results have been reported, with overall response rates <15%.\n\n    Recently, there has been an increase in interest in the molecular mechanisms involved in UM carcinogenesis, progression, and dissemination, which could lead to the discovery of valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as new potential therapeutic targets. Cellular, genetic, and RNA-based epigenetic features of UM will be described in this review to provide a useful tool for both clinicians and researchers to better understand the molecular bases of UM.\n\n    UM frequently appears on gross examination as a dome-shaped or ring-shaped mass protruding into the posterior chamber of the eye. Hemorrhagic and/or necrotic foci, as well as the presence of extraocular extension and retinal detachment, may be found in some cases. UM can exhibit different degrees of pigmentation, ranging from highly pigmented to grayish in color mass. Callender proposed the first histopathologic classification of UM based on the predominant cell component. Six UM subtypes have been identified: (i) spindle A, (ii) spindle B, (iii) fascicular, (iv) mixed, (v) epithelioid, and (vi) necrotic. Spindle-shaped cells with elongated and slender nuclei, fine chromatin, small/inconspicuous basophilic nucleoli, and nuclear folding were typical of the spindle A subtype. Spindle B UMs exhibited spindled and cohesive cells with plump fusiform/cigar-like nuclei, coarse chromatin, and prominent basophilic or eosinophilic nucleoli. Fascicular UM subtype showed spindle-shaped cells arranged in a fascicular growth pattern with nuclear palisading and an overall morphology closely reminiscent of that of soft tissue schwannoma. The presence of a mixture of spindled and epithelioid cells (large, polygonal-shaped cells with abundant cytoplasm, distinct cell membranes, and large nuclei) and the absence of the spindle cell component were histologic features of the mixed and epithelioid UM subtypes, respectively. Finally, necrotic UMs were described as tumors in which extensive necrosis prevented a more accurate classification. According to Callender, the outcome of patients affected by mixed, epithelioid, and necrotic UM was poorer than that of patients with spindle A, spindle B, or fascicular tumors.\n\n    Because this \"old\" classification lacked reproducibility among pathologists and prognostic relevance, it was simplified over time, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) now recognizes three histologic subtypes of UM: (i) spindle cell type (typically composed of both spindle A and spindle B cells and exhibiting spindle cell morphology in 90% of tumor); (ii) epithelioid cell type (exhibiting epithelioid cell morphology in 90% of tumor); and (iii) mixed cell type. Further unusual morphological variants of UM have been described: (a) diffuse UM, defined as tumors involving at least one-quarter of the uvea; (b) clear cell UM, characterized by diffuse clear cell morphology caused by glycogen dissolution after fixation; and (c) balloon cell UM, showing large tumor cells with abundant lipid-rich cytoplasm. UM cells are commonly stained with melanocytic differentiation markers such as S-100, human melanoma black 45 (HMB45), melan-A/melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1), melanocyte-inducing transcription factor (MITF) and sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10). Unlike in CM, the immunoreactivity for S100 is often weak and focal in UM, and the other abovementioned markers should be preferred, accordingly.\n\n    Other UM histopathologic features, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and vascular patterns, have been classically correlated with the prognosis of UM. Although TILs are less frequently found in UM than in CM, two patterns of lymphocytic infiltration have been described: patchy or diffuse. High levels of TILs have been correlated with poor prognosis and chromosome 3 loss in UM patients, while it has been widely accepted that they are predictive of a better outcome in other malignancies such as breast carcinoma, CM, and non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, nine vascular patterns were described by some clinicians: (i) unaffected choroid vessels; (ii) absence of tumor vessels; (iii) straight vessels; (iv) parallel vessels; (v) parallel vessels with cross-linking; (vi) arcs or incomplete loops; (vii) branching arcs; (viii) complete loops; (ix) networks of >=3 closely packed vascular loops. Based on these findings, the admixture of epithelioid cell morphology, mitoses, and at least 1 closed loop of vessels has been reported as a relevant predictive factor of poor prognosis of enucleated UM.\n\n    Chromosome and gene alterations are genetic factors that contribute to cancer's emergence, progression, and tumor metastasis. In UM, a variety of chromosome and gene functional and numerical derangements in critical molecular pathways (such as cell cycle regulation, signaling transduction, apoptosis, or angiogenesis) have been identified and described. Particular genetic signatures at the chromosomal or gene mutation level influence tumor biology and lead to aggressive phenotypes (metastases, poor response, and low survival rates). The identification of driver mutations for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes has become a focal point of cancer precision medicine. BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1), EIF1AX (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A X-linked), GNA11, GNAQ, and SF3B1 (splicing factor 3b subunit 1) are the most frequently mutated genes that are thought to be drivers in UM development and progression. To follow, these mutations and their significance in the biology of UM will be described (Table 1).\n\n    BAP1\n\n    BAP1 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a nuclear deubiquitinase involved in cell growth and cancer pathogenesis, mapping on chromosome 3 (3p21.1). BAP1 loss of function mutations or loss of expression are linked to an increased risk of metastatic disease. For a long time, chromosome 3 loss was the strongest indicator of metastatic disease in UM patients. Subsequently, the identification of various gene expression profiles (GEPs) enhanced prognostic accuracy: using next-generation sequencing, it was discovered that the large majority of class 2 tumors carried a mutation in the BAP1 gene. Uner et al. suggested that BAP1 mutations occur early in the growth of UM, well before the primary tumor is diagnosed, and coincide with the seeding of micrometastases.\n\n    Furthermore, it was observed that tumors with monosomy 3 and BAP1 mutations have lower disease-free survival (DFS) rates. BAP1 encodes a nuclear ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH), which is one of the several deubiquitinating enzyme classes. BAP1 contains a UCH37-like domain (ULD), binding domains for BRCA1 (BRCA1 DNA repair associated) and BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain 1), which form a tumor suppressor heterodimeric complex, and a binding domain for host cell factor-1 (HCFC1), which interacts with histone-modifying complexes during cell division by removing ubiquitin molecules from histone H2A. BAP1 also interacts with ASXL1 (ASXL transcriptional regulator 1) to form the Polycomb group repressive deubiquitinase complex (PR-DUB), which is implicated in stem cell pluripotency and other developmental processes; this activity modulates Hox (homeobox) gene expression, implying that BAP1 regulates transcription during development. BAP1 has also been found to be involved in other important cellular functions, such as cell proliferation via interaction (by deubiquitination) with HCFC1, which acts as a transcriptional coactivator with E2F proteins during cell division. BAP1 mutations were previously discovered in a small number of breast and lung cancer cell lines, as well as in malignant pleural mesotheliomas, CM, and possibly other cancers such as meningioma. BAP1 was discovered during a protein interaction screening for BRCA1 and has been shown to collaborate with BRCA1 in tumor suppression in cultured cells. Depletion of BAP1 in UM in vitro models leads to loss of differentiation and gain of stem-like properties, such as stem cell marker expression and an increased ability of self-replication, suggesting a role as a regulator of differentiation of uveal melanocytes. No correlation between GNAQ and BAP1 has been reported in literature. In rare cases, a germline BAP1 mutation can be found. These mutations are associated not only with an increased risk of UM but also with other types of tumors.\n\n    GNAQ and GNA11\n\n    GNAQ and GNA11 genes map on chromosomes 9q21.2 and 19p13.3, respectively. They are paralogous genes with roughly 90% sequence homology and a coding region of seven exons.\n\n    GNAQ encodes the alpha q subunit (Galphaq), while GNA11 encodes the alpha 11 subunit (Galpha11), both of which are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins from the heterotrimeric protein family that are important in transmembrane signaling networks. The alpha subunits act as a switch between the active and inactive states of G-proteins, active when bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and the inactive when GTP is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). GNAQ and GNA11 genes regulate several intracellular pathways, including the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. When the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is activated, the cell-cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 (CCND1) is overexpressed, which leads to the inactivation of the tumor suppressor RB1 (RB transcriptional corepressor 1).\n\n    GNAQ/GNA11 mutations are present in approximately 80-90% of UM cases. Alterations in the downstream pathway are thought to be an early event in the development of cancer, as they activate multiple cascade pathways involved in cell growth and proliferation. GNAQ mutations have been found in all stages of malignant progression, indicating that it is an early event in UM, but it is unrelated to DFS. The oncogenic conversion of GNAQ results in constitutive activation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, culminating in a situation in which the cell receives continuous growth signals in the absence of extracellular stimuli, resulting in cell proliferation. GNA11 mutations, on the other hand, can occur at various stages of UM progression. The majority of uveal nevi has either GNAQ or GNA11 mutations, with GNA11-mutated tumors being potentially more aggressive than GNAQ-mutated ones. This is most likely due to the fact that, unlike GNA11, GNAQ requires a second hit to fully activate. The first driver mutations in UM are thought to be GNAQ/GNA11-activating mutations. Mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 occur in a mutually exclusive pattern and are found almost exclusively in codon 209 and, in some cases, codon 183. Mutations at these positions result in constitutive activation of the Galphaq and Galpha11 subunits by removing their intrinsic GTPase activity, preventing the subunits from reverting to an inactive state. When constitutively activated, both GNAQ and GNA11 have been shown to upregulate the MAPK pathway in the same way that BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase) and NRAS (NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase) mutations do. Activating mutations in BRAF are very common in CM, whereas UM rarely carries any BRAF mutation.. Mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 have not been linked to the two GEP molecular classes of UM tumors. Furthermore, GNAQ/GNA11 mutations have not been shown to be prognostic, and they occur at similar rates in metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. Mutational hotspots in both genes have already been reported in the literature, defined by the presence of activating missense variants that only affect exons 4 and 5, and more precisely, the arginine 183 (R183) and glutamine 209 (Q209) codons; cell lines with GNAQ Q209L mutation have also been found to be highly sensitive to MEK inhibition. The huge percentage of GNA11 codon 209 mutations results in glutamine to leucine (p.Q209L) and proline (p.Q209P) substitutions. These mutations result from one-base substitutions at codon 209 (CAG), with A>T (94.5%) and A>C (2.7%) being the most prevalent. In contrast, a one-base change at codon 209 (CAA) in GNAQ gene leads to the substitution of glutamine by leucine (A>T, p.Q209L) and proline (A>C, p.Q209P) in the majority of cases. Other mutations in exon 5 have been described, including p.Q209M, p.Q209H, p.Q209I, p.F228L, and p.M203V in GNAQ and p.Q209Y, p.E234K, and p.E221D in GNA11. Overall, the frequency of mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 exon 4 is lower. Most mutations in GNA11 are induced by C>T transitions at codon 183 (CGC) and CC>TT transitions at codons 182-183, that cause arginine to cysteine (p.R183C) or histidine (p.R183H) replacement. Similarly, the few mutations known to affect GNAQ codon 183 (CGA) are all induced by G>A transitions. Other GNAQ exon 4 mutations are p.P170S, p.I189T, p.Q176R, and p.P193L, which have an overall recurrence of 8.9% in some cohorts. Mutations in the codon p.Q209 result in the complete loss of GTPase activity, causing a prolonged constitutive activation of GNAQ and GNA11, which leads to permanent downstream signaling. Mutations that affect the p.R183 residue, on the other hand, result in a more tenuous activation due to a partial loss of GTPase activity.\n\n    Less is known about the prevalence and significance of GNAQ and GNA11 mutations in metastatic UM (MUM). The first studies on the role of these genes in UM prognosis reported that the distribution of GNA11 and GNAQ mutations varied between primary tumors and MUM, with a GNA11 to GNAQ ratio of 0.7 in primary UM and 2.6 in MUM. Griewank et al. discovered that GNA11 mutations were significantly more common than GNAQ mutations in metastatic specimens. Furthermore, patients with GNA11-mutant tumors had lower disease-specific survival and OS compared to wild-type patients. The authors proposed that the survival data, combined with the predominance of GNA11 mutations in metastasis, raises the possibility that GNA11-mutant tumors may be associated with a higher risk of metastasis and a worse prognosis than GNAQ-mutant tumors.\n\n    Terai et al. recently investigated the existence of a relationship between metastasis-to-death and the frequency of GNAQ and GNA11 mutations in eighty-seven MUM patients. The authors reported a similar mutation rate for GNA11 and GNAQ mutations (47.1% and 44.8% of patients, respectively). This result was consistent with previous findings for primary UM. Moreover, they discovered that differences in the type of mutation (p.Q209 vs. p.Q209L) rather than the GNAQ and GNA11 genes themselves could predict MUM patient survival.\n\n    Functional differences between GNA11 and GNAQ might be determined by different interaction partners. To investigate this aspect, Piaggio et al. conducted a study using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry (TAP-MS/MS) to identify proteins that interact with GNAQ or GNA11. The comparison of the protein interaction networks of the two Galpha-proteins only showed a very limited overlap, indicating functional differences between GNAQ and GNA11. The interaction of mutated GNAQ with the dioxygenase TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2), which is not observed for mutated GNA11, was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Interestingly, TET2 plays an active role in DNA demethylation, and high-risk UMs are characterized by widespread demethylation.\n\n    Another alteration caused by GNA11 and GNAQ mutations concerns the calcium signaling pathway, whose dysregulation has a well-documented association with cancer survival, proliferation, migration, and metastatic potential. For example, calcium signaling has been reported to be involved in the proliferation of Ras-driven cancers through the interaction between calmodulin and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) and the promotion of invasion and metastasis via ERK activation in both BRAF- and non-BRAF-driven CM cells. Constitutive activation of Galphaq signaling by mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 occurs in over 80% of UMs and activates MAPK signaling. Chen et al. reported that Ras oncoproteins are required for GNAQ-mediated MAPK activation and identified PRKCD (protein kinase C delta), PRKCE (protein kinase C epsilon), and RASGRP3 (RAS guanyl-releasing protein 3) as components of a signaling module necessary and sufficient to activate the Ras/MAPK pathway in GNAQ-mutant UM. RASGRP3 is selectively overexpressed in response to GNAQ/GNA11 mutations in UM; its activation occurs via PRKCD- and PRKCE-dependent phosphorylation and PKC-independent, DAG (diacylglycerol)-mediated membrane recruitment, possibly explaining the limited effect of PKC inhibitors in durably suppressing MAPK in UM. The results achieved by Chen et al. suggested RASGRP3 as a therapeutic target for cancers driven by oncogenic GNAQ/GNA11.\n\n    EIF1AX\n\n    EIF1AX, mapping on the chromosome Xp22, encodes for the X-linked eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (EIF1A) protein, which regulates protein translation initiation through a combination of ribosome stabilization and recognition of target mRNA, thereby preparing mRNA for translation. EIF1AX is required for the transfer of methionyl initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal unit (40S) during the initiation phase of translation in eukaryotic cells. Whole-exome sequencing identified EIF1AX as an UM driver gene. This gene is mutated in approximately 14-20% of all UM, with the majority of mutations found in exons 1 and 2. EIF1AX mutations are typically found in non-metastatic cases, are associated with class 1 GEP tumors and a favorable prognosis, and are inversely correlated with metastasis. EIF1AX mutations are typically reciprocally exclusive with BAP1 mutations and, to a lesser extent, with SF3B1 mutations. Most EIF1AX mutations are observed in tumors with disomy 3 (48%), and only rarely in tumors with monosomy 3 (3%). In contrast to BAP1 mutations, which mainly are truncating and loss-of-function variants, the majority of EIF1AX mutations are heterozygous non-synonymous variants, or in some cases splicing variants, leading to deletions of one or two amino acids; thus, in most cases, the core protein remains unchanged. EIF1AX mutations are commonly found in tumor cells in heterozygosis, indicating that EIF1AX functions as a dominant-acting oncogene. However, UM tumors with an EIF1AX mutation only express the mutant allele, suggesting that EIF1AX may also function in a recessive manner. Mutations in this gene have also been found in thyroid and ovarian cancers, as well as the rare neoplasm primary leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms (LMNs).\n\n    SF3B1\n\n    SF3B1 encodes a core component of the RNA splicing machinery, the spliceosome, which processes precursor mRNA into mature transcripts, and maps on chromosome 2q33. SF3B1 mutations are mostly identified in hematolymphoid malignancies. Mutations in codon 700 represent 50% of all of the reported alterations; other mutations were found in codons 666, 662, 622, and 625. In UM, SF3B1 mutations almost exclusively occur in codon 625 and have been identified in 4% to 24% of primary tumors. Accordingly, it is yet another driver gene discovered through whole-exome sequencing of UM tumors. SF3B1 is required for pre-mRNA splicing because it encodes a unit of the splicing factor 3b protein complex, which is a component of both major (U2-like) and minor (U12-like) spliceosomes. SF3B1 has been identified in recent years as a DNA damage repair factor. Missense mutations in specific regions of the SF3B1 gene have also been reported to alter the splicing of many target genes: these mutations principally modify codon Arg625 in exon 14 and have been observed in UM tumors with mutation rates ranging from 10% to 21%. By using RNA-seq analyses of UM, Alsafadi et al. showed that the SF3B1 mutations resulted in deregulated splicing at a subset of splice junctions, mostly by the use of alternative 3' acceptor splice sites (3'ss). At first, they observed that SF3B1 hotspot mutations in UM were associated with the deregulation of a restricted subset (~0.5%) of splice junctions, mostly caused by the usage of alternative 3'ss (AG') upstream of the canonical 3'ss (AG). Second, they showed that splicing alterations induced by SF3B1 mutations were not reproduced either by knockdown or by overexpressing the wild-type protein, indicating that SF3B1-mutants may be qualified as change-of-function mutants. Third, their results provided significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying alternative 3'ss regulation by mutated SF3B1. Such a mechanism involves a misregulation of branchpoint (BP) usage, which has been largely overlooked in previous studies on alternative splicing.\n\n    Some studies related SF3B1 mutations to a better prognosis, a younger age at diagnosis, and the presence of disomy 3. Moreover, in a longer-term study, tumors with disomy 3 and an SF3B1 mutation had a significantly worse prognosis and more frequent development of late metastasis than wild-type tumors; most metastases occurred later than 5 years after diagnosis. According to Martin et al., 29% of disomy 3 tumors carried a heterozygous SF3B1 mutation, compared with only 3% of monosomy 3 tumors. In addition, 54% of partial monosomy 3 tumors (preferentially with 3q loss and preservation of 3p) carried the Arg625 mutation in SF3B1. SF3B1 mutations are frequently found in tumors expressing the PRAME (PRAME nuclear receptor transcriptional regulator) oncogene. PRAME expression has been linked to class 1 tumors with an intermediate risk of metastasis, implying that there is a risk class that occurs between high-risk tumors characterized by BAP1 mutations and low-risk tumors frequently harboring EIF1AX mutations.\n\n    Other mutations\n\n    A recurrent gain-of-function mutation in the phospholipase C, beta 4 (PLCB4) gene was discovered using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of UM tumors. In addition to the known driver genes in UM, this was the only gene with a recurrent mutation. The mutation (c.G1888T, p.D630Y) is located in the Y-domain of PLCB4's highly conserved catalytic core and was predicted to be harmful using the prediction tools SIFT and PolyPhen. PLCB4 is a downstream target of GNA11/GNAQ, and the p.D630Y PLCB4 mutation was found to be mutually exclusive with mutations in GNA11 and GNAQ.\n\n    CYSLTR2 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) encodes for the G protein-coupled receptor cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 2. Different authors found a recurrent gain of function mutation in CYSLTR2 (p. L129Q) leading to a CYSLT2R mutant protein constitutively activating endogenous Galphaq, which is a signaling pathway convergent with the one induced by GNAQ and GNA11 oncogenic mutations. Mutations of CYSLT2R show a pattern of mutually exclusive activating mutations (GNAQ and GNA11) in almost all tumors and appear to be an early oncogenic event in GNAQ and GNA11 wild-type uveal nevi and UM. Mutant CYSLT2R increased the expression of the melanocyte-lineage-specific transcriptional program and promoted tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.\n\n    SRSF2 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2) encodes serine/arginine-rich proteins that bind exonic splicing enhancers. SRSF2 mutations result in misregulated exon inclusions that cause an aberrant splicing pattern of many genes, including the tumor suppressor genes ARMC10 (armadillo repeat containing 10) and EZH2 (enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit). SRSF2 mutations are also commonly found in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (47%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (15%). In their study, van Poppelen et al. detected SRSF2 deletions affecting amino acids 92-100 in two UMs (5%) of 42 selected tumors and in three The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) UM specimens. Both the samples with an SRSF2 mutation from their cohort and the ones from the TCGA showed more than four structural chromosomal aberrations, including a partial gain of chromosomes 6 and 8, although monosomy 3 was observed in two TCGA UMs.\n\n    Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a component of the telomerase enzyme that adds the telomere repeat TTAGGG to the telomere ends. Telomerase deregulation and abnormal TERT expression have been found in a variety of cancers, including thyroid and bladder cancers. Approximately 70% of CM have mutations that impact TERT expression levels by creating a new binding site for the transcription factor E-twenty-six (ETS). Following the discovery of driver mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene associated with UV-induced cytidine-to-thymidine transitions in CM, Dono et al. investigated the presence of this event in UM, discovering that TERT promoter mutations are extremely rare in UM tumors: indeed, only one out of the fifty patients in their study had one of the previously described TERT promoter mutations. The promoter mutation was found in this study along with mutations in GNA11 and EIF1AX, as well as two chromosome 3 normal copies.\n\n    MBD4 (methyl-CpG binding domain 4, DNA glycosylase), mapping on chromosome 3, encodes for a DNA glycosylase involved in the repair of C>T mutations arising from spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Given the high frequency of chromosome 3 monosomy in UM (see below Section 3), MBD4 is often present in a single copy; in this scenario, a single mutation is sufficient for the inactivation of MBD4. Hence, MBD4 may act as a tumor suppressor in UM. Accordingly, Derrien et al. reported that some UMs display a high level of CpG>TpG mutations in association with the mutational inactivation of MBD4. In particular, germline protein truncating variants (PTVs) and somatic loss of the wild-type allele were reported in UM patients with a CpG>TpG mutator phenotype. MBD4 was suggested as a new predisposing gene for UM; indeed, it was associated with hypermutated tumors with monosomy 3 and conferred a predisposition to high-risk tumors. Recently, MBD4 was reported as a prognostic factor for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in MUM patients.\n\n    Furthermore, UM has been linked to a variety of cancer-related genes in solid tumors, including BRCA1 (c.C2603G: pSer868), CHEK2 (c.T470C:p.Ile157Thr), PALB2 (c.49-1G>A), SMARCE1 (c.373G>T: p.Glu125*), MSH6 (c.C2731T: p.Arg911), and MLH1 (c.200G>A:p.Gly67Glu).\n\n    In comparison to many other cancer types, most UMs have relatively low levels of genomic instability and aneuploidy. Recurrent chromosome aberrations in chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, and 16 characterize primary UM. These cytogenetic changes are strongly linked to prognosis and are used to categorize patients into risk groups. 1p loss (28-34%), 1q gain (24%), 3 loss (50-61%), 6p gain (28-54%), 6q gain (28-54%), 6q loss (25-38%), 8p loss (17-28%), 8q gain (36-63%), 9p loss (24%), and 16q loss (16%) are the most common chromosomal aberrations in primary UM. These abnormalities were initially identified by standard karyotypic analyses and then confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), spectral karyotyping, microsatellite analysis (MSA), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.\n\n    Chromosome 1\n\n    A quarter of UMs have a partial or complete loss of chromosome 1p, which is more common in concert with monosomy 3. Kilic et al. demonstrated that loss of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p36) in conjunction with monosomy 3 is prognostic: indeed, when these abnormalities occur concurrently, they have a stronger correlation with reduced survival than monosomy 3 or loss of 1p alone, the latter having no prognostic value. APITD1 (now named CENPS, centromere protein S), one of the suggested tumor suppressor genes mapping on the 1p36 region, was found to have no effect on patient survival. The smallest common region of 1p loss was identified as a region of about 55 Mb at 1p31 by microsatellite analysis of seventy UMs. No mutations were found in this region, but there are several potential candidates, including Notch signaling pathway members HES2 (hes family bHLH transcription factor 2) and HES5 (hes family bHLH transcription factor 5), as well as the TP53 (tumor protein p53) homolog TP73 (tumor protein p73).\n\n    Chromosome 3\n\n    The most common chromosomal aberration in UM is the loss of one of the two copies of chromosome 3. Monosomy 3 is found in approximately 50% of cases and appears to be very specific to UM, as it is rarely found in other cancer types. For nearly twenty-five years, several groups have demonstrated a strong correlation between monosomy 3 and metastasis development; indeed, metastases rarely develop in tumors with disomy 3. Furthermore, monosomy 3 is strongly associated with a number of clinical and histopathological parameters, including epithelioid cytology, closed vascular patterns, large tumor diameter, and ciliary body involvement. Furthermore, monosomy 3 is thought to be an early event in tumorigenesis because it frequently occurs in conjunction with all other known chromosomal abnormalities. In 5-10% of cases, one copy of chromosome 3 is lost and the remaining copy is duplicated. This chromosome 3 isodisomic state appears to be prognostically equivalent to monosomy 3. Clinical outcomes do not differ significantly between patients with partial monosomy 3 or disomy 3. When chromosome 3 has a normal copy number, tumors can have other chromosomal alterations, such as 6p gain and 1p loss. It is important to underline that the BAP1 locus is located at position 3p21.1; the importance of BAP1 in the progression of UM has been discussed above (Section 2).\n\n    Chromosome 6\n\n    Chromosome 6 alterations are common in UM; gain of 6p and loss of 6q occur in about a quarter to a third of UMs; both abnormalities are frequently present in the same tumor, implying the formation of an isochromosome 6p. The first chromosomal aberration to be reported in UM was gain of the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p), which has a lower prognostic value than monosomy 3 or gain of 8q. Gain of the short arm of chromosome 6 is found in 28-54% of UMs and is associated with spindle cell cytology and a low risk of metastasis. However, the simultaneous occurrence of monosomy 3 or 6p gain is rare: they are most likely involved in two mutually exclusive evolutionary pathways, as the occurrence of both is reported in only 4% of UMs. Overall, 6p gain has a better prognosis than monosomy 3, leading some researchers to speculate that 6p gain is \"protective\" against metastasis. However, 6p gain appears to be associated with a better prognosis simply because it occurs in the absence of monosomy 3. Loss of genetic material on the long arm of chromosome 6, observed in 25-38% of tumors, possibly represents another late event in tumorigenesis and correlates with poor prognosis.\n\n    Chromosome 8\n\n    Chromosome 8 is also frequently altered in UM patients. Gain of the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q) occurs in 37% to 63% of primary UM and is associated with poor prognosis. Gain of 8q has been shown to be a significant independent prognostic factor for shorter survival. It is frequently found in conjunction with monosomy 3, either as an 8q gain or as an 8q isodisomy, and this combination is associated with higher metastatic rates than a single aberration. Chromosome 3 and 8 abnormalities are more common in ciliary body-located UMs, whereas alterations of the long arm of chromosome 8 are more common in choroid-derived UMs. However, in the study by Kilic et al., chromosome 8q abnormalities were shown to correlate with large tumor diameter, but univariate analysis revealed no significant relationship between 8q gain and the metastatic phenotype, suggesting that it is a late event after the onset of monosomy 3. The 5-year mortality rate is reported to be 66% in cases of concomitant monosomy 3 and 8q gain, 40% in cases of monosomy 3, and 31% in cases with 8q gain. Dogrusoz et al. investigated whether chromosome 3 and 8q status information could improve the prognostic value of the AJCC staging system: tumors with monosomy 3 and 8q gain had an increased risk of metastatic death in the study cohort of 470 UMs with known chromosome 3 and 8q status.\n\n    It has not yet been determined which chromosomal change causes UM malignant transformation. Some researchers discovered that monosomy 3 is the first step and that 8q gain occurs later, while others discovered that 8q gain occurs before chromosome 3 loss. Finally, other researchers reported that the gain of the telomeric part of 8q is present in 92% of the UM studied, implying that it plays an important role in UM tumorigenesis. Several oncogenes on chromosome 8q have been suggested as potential factors involved in UM, among which MYC (MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor) (on 8q24), NBS1 (now named NBN, nibrin) (on 8q21), and DDEF1 (now named ASAP1, ArfGAP with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat, and PH domain 1) (on 8q24). Furthermore, in 50% of UMs, the NBS1/NBN gene is found to be overexpressed: the encoded protein is thought to be a component of a complex involved in DNA repair. Overexpression of NBS1/NBN may allow UM progression by promoting DNA repair, which happens more frequently in advanced-stage tumors with increased genetic instability. Ehlers et al. demonstrated that high DDEF1/ASAP1 (expression results in more motile low-grade UM cells and may thus be important in metastatic development.\n\n    Onken et al. identified a potential metastasis-suppressor gene in LZTS1 (leucine zipper tumor suppressor 1), mapping on 8p21; they also discovered that 8p loss was a better prognostic factor than 8q gain. Thus, 8p loss may be more significant than 8q gain, both prognostically and pathogenetically.\n\n    Chromosome 9\n\n    Almost a quarter of UMs have a cytogenetically detectable loss of chromosome 9p, and smaller regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) around 9p21, including the CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) locus, are found in up to a third of UMs. The CDKN2A promoter is methylated in 24-31% of cases. These findings suggest that CDKN2A inactivation may play a role in the progression of UM. However, germline CDKN2A mutations are extremely rare in UM patients.\n\n    Other Chromosomal Aberrations\n\n    Other less common aberrations are chromosome 16 abnormalities, specifically loss of 16q arm (16% of cases). Loss of chromosome 10, loss of 11q23-q25, and gain of chromosomes 7 and 10 have been reported, but a role in tumorigenesis and/or metastasis in UM is yet to be determined.\n\n    Lalonde et al. evaluated the clinical relevance of low-frequency copy number aberrations (CNAs) in UM. Their study, based on the genomic profiling of 921 primary tumors, revealed CNAs associated with the risk of metastasis and demonstrated a strong association between chromosomal instability and patient prognosis. Their results suggested that 1p and 16q deletions should be incorporated into clinical assays to assess prognosis at diagnosis and guide enrollment in clinical trials for adjuvant therapies.\n\n    Melanomas (both CM and UM) show a high frequency of metastatization, dramatically affecting patient survival and therapeutic approaches given the acquired drug resistance. Hence, it is fundamental to predict which tumors will develop metastasis to select the best clinical approach for each patient. Unfortunately, melanomas lack a definite staging because of the manifestation of heterogeneous alterations at clinical, cytologic, and morphologic levels. For such reasons, markers of predisposition to metastatization have been investigated.\n\n    In this scenario, GEPs have been analyzed in UM biopsies. The first report was published in 2003, when Tschentscher et al. reported the differential expression of 7902 genes detected by using an oligonucleotide microarray in twenty primary UM samples, comparing tumors with monosomy or disomy of chromosome 3. Indeed, monosomy 3 is highly associated with metastatization (see above Section 3). The authors showed that the expression profile of the 7902 genes allowed to discriminate two different groups of samples, one comprising nine out of the ten disomic tumors and the other with all the monosomic plus the last disomic tumors. No significant association was observed between these clusters and chromosomal aberrations or clinicopathological features. The same clusterization was confirmed when performing the same analysis excluding the genes mapping on chromosome 3, which could have altered the analysis because of the different dosages in monosomic tissues. Only a sample showed variable classification in bootstrap sampling; interestingly, this sample was not classified as consistent concerning chromosome 3 status. Moreover, clusterization was maintained by randomly reducing the number of genes, reaching a minimum of 300 random genes. Collectively, these results suggest that GEP plays an important role in the phenotype and classification of UM. The high number of dysregulated genes suggests that the two tumor clusters are deeply different from a molecular point of view, making them two different entities. The different status of chromosome 3 may suggest a different pathogenetic process sustaining UM onset. It is also conceivable that tumors originate from melanocytes from distinct regions of the uveal tracts (iris, ciliary body, or choroid), as it is known that tumors located in the posterior chamber of the eye or in the ciliary body differ in chromosome 3 status. The limits of this study were the recruitment of patients with a recent diagnosis and the lack of follow-up.\n\n    In 2004, Onken et al. performed gene expression profiling in primary UM biopsies from patients followed up for a long period. Microarray analysis allowed to identify 3075 genes expressed in twenty-five tumor samples. Principal component analysis of gene expression data defined two clusters comprising fourteen and eleven samples, respectively, named class 1 and class 2. Among the 3075 expressed genes, 62 were identified as discriminating between the two clusters, including some genes mapping on chromosome 3 and 8q that showed decreased and increased expression, respectively, in class 2. This observation is congruent with literature data reporting the association of metastasis with loss of chromosome 3 and gain of 8q (see above Section 3); nevertheless, a more stringent analysis led to the exclusion of most of these genes from the results. This molecular classification showed a correlation with increased patient age, a feature known to be associated with an increased risk of metastasis development. It was also observed that there was a strong positive correlation with the cytologic rank, with class 1 biopsies being low-grade spindle tumors and class 2 high-grade tumors with a higher proportion of epithelioid cells. The authors reported that multiple signatures of three genes were sufficient for a correct classification of tumors without errors, with PHLDA1 (pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1), FZD6 (frizzled class receptor 6), and ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2) representing one of the best combinations of discriminating genes. The possibility of analyzing a small number of genes may pave the way for clinical applications of this classification. This molecular signature was used to classify a total of fifty tumors; subsequent survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier curves showed one and eight deaths for metastasis in classes 1 and 2, respectively, with a higher survival probability for class 1 patients. Importantly, the molecular signature was the best survival predictor when compared to the other clinicopathological prognostic factors. A strong correlation between the molecular classification and chromosome 3 and 6p aberrations was reported; noteworthy, the gene expression profile may improve the identification of high-risk patients compared to the sole analysis of chromosome status. The same group analyzed the pathways regulated by the discriminating genes, showing that their altered expression between class 1 and class 2 tumors may be the reason for the different cytologic morphology observed. In the following years, several studies reported that GEP outperformed chromosome 3 monosomy and other clinicopathological parameters in predicting metastasis; an enhancement of the prognostic performance of GEP was reported when it was associated with tumor size measurement. The association between GEP and chromosomal aberrations in UM was also evaluated, showing that BAP1 and EIF1AX mutations were associated with class 2 and class 1 tumors, respectively. However, Stalhammar and Grossniklaus reported that BAP1 expression was heterogeneous in UM tumors and showed limited prognostic importance, despite adding significant prognostic information to GEP.\n\n    Aiming to apply GEP classification to clinical practice, Onken et al. identified a signature of fifteen genes (twelve discriminating and three endogenous control genes) that can be analyzed in PCR in small samples such as fine needle aspirate biopsies, characterized by low quantities of RNA. The introduction of such a prognostic test in clinical practice would allow to identify patients with a high risk of metastasis and improve their clinical management. A prospective multicenter study and an independent report from another research group confirmed the efficacy of this signature. In recent years, another group identified a new molecular signature comprising ten genes by using expression data from TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets (GSE22138); again, the signature showed increased accuracy in predicting overall, progression-free, and metastasis-free survival compared to other prognostic parameters.\n\n    The same approach was also applied to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs). Following other reports from the same group, Worley et al. performed a microarray analysis in a cohort of twenty-four UM tissues. MiRNA expression allowed to classify the tumors in low (class 1) and high (class 2) risk of metastasis, and this classification was coherent with the one based on GEP. A set of sixty-eight miRNAs showed increased expression in class 1 tumors, while six were upregulated in class 2; the best discriminator miRNAs were let-7b and miR-199a. The set of six miRNAs upregulated in class 2 tumors, including let-7b, miR-199a, miR-199a*, miR-143, miR-193b, and miR-652, showed the highest accuracy in sample classification, with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Another study with a similar aim was performed in a cohort of twenty-six UM tissues classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-risk of metastasis according to DFS and mutational status of EIF1AX, SF3B1, and BAP1, respectively. MiRNA expression analysis by sequencing allowed to identify three sample clusters, one for each sample group, with the intermediate cluster partially overlapping the other two. The metastasis-related miRNAs showing differential expression in high- compared to low- and intermediate-risk tumors were thirteen, with overexpression of miR-132-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-21-5p, and downregulation of miR-181b-5p, miR-101-3p, miR-378d, miR-181a-2-3p, miR-99a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-1537-3p, and miR-99a-3p. A similar clusterization was observed with sequencing data of mRNAs, with a separate cluster for high-risk tumors and a partial overlap of low- and intermediate-risk tumors. Recently, ferroptosis, an iron-dependent mechanism of programmed cell death, has gained growing attention in cancer research. Jin et al. analyzed expression data from the TCGA and GSE84976 datasets to identify ferroptosis regulators showing differential expression in patients grouped according to OS. According to the expression of eleven genes (CHAC1, NQO1, SQLE, SLC1A5, GSS, LPCAT3, GPX4, AIFM2, ABCC1, ACSF2, FDFT1), tumor samples were classified into two clusters differing in prognosis and tumor microenvironment-infiltrating immune cells. Zheng et al. investigated the methylation of CpG islands associated with miRNAs in TCGA samples, showing fifty-five CpG sites with altered methylation in patients with different survival time. The authors identified a prognostic signature of thirteen miRNA-associated CpG sites able to classify patients into low- and high-risk groups. Altered DNA methylation at ncRNA loci has been previously reported in other cancer models.\n\n    NcRNAs are a heterogeneous class of RNA molecules that are not transcribed into proteins. Indeed, the function of these transcripts is to regulate several physiological and pathological processes with many different molecular mechanisms, most of which are still under investigation and may be classified as epigenetic mechanisms. NcRNAs may be classified according to length into: (i) small ncRNAs, including, among others, miRNAs, sized less than 200 nucleotides (nts) and all sharing the same molecular mechanism; (ii) long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including circular RNAs (circRNAs), ranging from 200 nts to kilobases in length and characterized by heterogeneous functions and molecular mechanisms.\n\n    Since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, ncRNAs have gained attention as strong epigenetic regulators of both physiological and pathological processes within cells. The most widely investigated class of ncRNAs is represented by miRNAs, small endogenous single-stranded RNA molecules sized 18-25 nts, which act as negative regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level. The crucial role of miRNA function in carcinogenesis is widely recognized, as demonstrated by the huge amount of literature published in the last few decades. Several studies reported the dysregulation of miRNAs in virtually all cancer models, proving that altered expression of these ncRNAs affects cell phenotype and cancer-related processes via epigenetic regulation of mRNA expression. In this context, UM is not an exception. Besides the most common analysis comparing tumor and normal tissues, several studies focus only on tumor tissues or start with expression data from TCGA (which includes only tumor samples in the UM dataset), aiming to investigate the prognostic value of miRNA dysregulation (Table 2).\n\n    The first study investigating altered miRNA levels was published in 2008 by Worley et al., proving that miRNA expression profile allowed to classify tumors according to the risk of metastasis. This analysis allowed to identify a signature of miRNAs with prognostic value including let-7b, miR-199a, miR-199a*, miR-143, miR-193b, and miR-652, all upregulated in high-risk tumors (see above Section 4). Venkatesan et al. analyzed UM tumors grouped according to chromosome 3 monosomy or disomy. Microarray expression data obtained from six formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples was subject to supervised and unsupervised analysis, showing fourteen upregulated miRNAs in common. Among these miRNAs, miR-149*, miR-1238, and miR-134 were validated in real-time PCR; no significant difference was observed for miR-149* and miR-1238, while miR-134 was upregulated in monosomic tumors. All these miRNAs showed increased expression in tumor samples compared to five samples of normal melanocytes from cadaveric eyes, regardless of chromosome 3 status or the presence of liver metastasis. The same study also investigated the expression of miRNAs used to classify tumors by Worley et al.: miR-214, miR-143, miR-146b, and miR-199a showed increased expression in monosomic compared to disomic tumors, while no difference was observed for let-7b. Moreover, miR-134 and miR-149* showed a significant association with liver metastasis. Metastasis-free survival analysis showed that all the dysregulated miRNAs may be used as prognostic factors in UM patients. However, the unfeasibility of miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers was reported in a cohort of twenty-six Danish patients. A similar study by Triozzi et al. showed six upregulated (miR-135a*, miR-624, miR-449b, miR-142-5p, miR-92b, miR-628-5p) and nineteen downregulated miRNAs (miR-509-3-5p, miR-508-3p, miR-514, miR-506, miR-513a-5p, miR-507, miR-509-3p, miR-513b, miR-876-3p, miR-378*, miR-935, miR-181a, miR-99a, miR-194, miR-592, miR-1296, miR-624*, miR-140-5p, miR-651) in monosomic compared to disomic tumors; eight miRNAs (miR-624, miR-509-3-5p, miR-508-3p, miR-506, miR-513a-5p, miR-509-3p, miR-513b, miR-935) were also differentially expressed in metastatic patients, all bearing chromosome 3 monosomy. The study by Smit et al. showed the dysregulation of miRNAs in high-risk compared to low- and intermediate-risk tumors (upregulation of miR-132-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-21-5p, and downregulation of miR-181b-5p, miR-101-3p, miR-378d, miR-181a-2-3p, miR-99a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-1537-3p, and miR-99a-3p) (see above Section 4). The association between miRNA expression and chromosomal aberration is still under investigation. Souri et al. investigated the association between miRNAs, HLA (human leukocyte antigen) expression, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and TILs; the authors also evaluated chromosome 3 status, as it is known that it is correlated with inflammatory infiltrates, and BAP1 expression. Two patterns of miRNAs have been identified, related to the up- or downregulation of HLAs and immune infiltrates, both related to chromosome 3 status and BAP1 expression. These miRNAs may be considered potential therapeutic targets or inhibitors of inflammation.\n\n    By analyzing the UM dataset of TCGA, a Cox univariate regression analysis allowed to identify a signature of risk miRNAs including miR-195, miR-224, miR-365a, miR-365b, miR-452, miR-4709 and miR-7702, while miR-873 and miR-513c were considered protective miRNAs. This nine-miRNA signature showed good accuracy as a prognostic tool for UM in the TCGA cohort. The same dataset was analyzed by Falzone et al. by stratifying tumor samples according to tumor stage (T3-T4 vs. T1-T2 or high- vs. low-grade) and patient status (deceased vs. alive). Expression analysis showed that seven top dysregulated miRNAs were common in both comparisons; in particular, miR-514a-3p, miR-508-3p, miR-509-3-5p, miR-513c-5p, and miR-513a-5p were downregulated, while miR-592 and miR-199a-5p showed increased levels in high- vs. low-grade tumors and deceased vs. alive patients. Dysregulated miRNAs showed a significant association with poor prognosis and worse OS, suggesting their prognostic value in UM. A small subset of eight samples from the TCGA dataset was analyzed, comparing metastatic and non-metastatic patients. Six miRNAs identified with such analysis were subsequently validated in a cohort of forty-six patients: miR-592, miR-346, and miR-1247 were upregulated, while miR-506 and miR-513c showed decreased levels in metastatic tumors; differential expression of miR-196b was not validated. The correlation between miRNA expression and chromosome 3 status or BAP1 expression showed: (i) a significant increase in miR-196b in patients with chromosome 3 monosomy and/or loss of BAP1 expression; (ii) a significant correlation of miR-592 with chromosome 3 status, with increased expression in monosomic tumors with or without loss of BAP1 expression. Another report on metastasis-related miRNAs re-analyzed the entire TCGA cohort of eighty tumor samples, grouped according to the development of metastasis. This new analysis showed the differential expression of twenty-two miRNAs, three upregulated (miR-199a-5p, miR-708-5p, miR-592) and nineteen downregulated (miR-508-3p, miR-509-3p, miR-508-5p, miR-514a-3p, miR-506-3p, miR-509-3-5p, miR-513c-5p, miR-513a-5p, and miR-513b-5p) in metastatic tumors. Expression data were used to cluster miRNAs, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism sustaining their dysregulation in UM. Almost all the dysregulated miRNAs, except for one, were associated with OS. Recently, Yu et al. used TCGA expression data to build a prognostic lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Concerning miRNAs, univariate Cox proportional hazard regression identified significant 214 miRNAs; 1490 mRNAs and 199 lncRNAs were also identified as potential prognostic factors for UM. These data were used to build the prognostic ceRNA network, which included five mRNAs (CGREF1, P4HA2, RGMB, PKNOX2, SLC6A6), four miRNAs (miR-181b, miR-507, miR-548, miR-181a), and six lncRNAs (PVT1, HCP5, EPB41L4A-AS1, BOLA3-AS1, SNHG7, GAS5). By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, low expression of the four miRNAs was associated with poor prognosis. In the last year, this topic has been investigated. Sun et al. re-analyzed TCGA expression data and identified a signature including five miRNAs (miR-513a-5p, miR-506-3p, miR-508-3p, miR-140-3p, miR-103a-2-5p) representing an independent prognostic factor able to predict the prognosis of UM patients. Another signature comprising three miRNAs (miR-1296, miR-199a, miR-508) was identified by using TCGA expression data and validated in two GEO datasets (GSE84976 and GSE68828); the authors suggested the prognostic application of this signature in predicting OS.\n\n    Recently, the existence of miRNA isoforms, called isomiRs, has been reported. Each miRNA may present several isoforms (even more than thirty different isomiRs), and the distinct isoforms may target dissimilar sets of RNA molecules. Londin et al. re-analyzed the eighty tumor samples from TCGA to evaluate the expression of isomiRs and tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) as prognostic factors in UM. The authors described an UM-specific expression pattern of miRNAs, miRNA-arms, and isomiRs, showing that for miRNAs originating from 44% of miRNA-arms the most abundant isoform is not the \"archetype\" reported in miRbase (, last accessed on 24 December 2022), stressing a misclassification of expression data and subsequent implications on miRNA targets. Moreover, thirty-two new miRNA loci exclusive or predominantly abundant in UM, which are the best candidate as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for the disease, were identified. By stratifying samples according to chromosome 3 status and BAP1 mutations, reduced levels of the miR-508/514 miRNA cluster were observed in monosomic or BAP1-mutated patients; interestingly, this miRNA cluster maps on chromosome X, not 3. Furthermore, isomiRs from other loci were upregulated in monosomic or mutant patients (e.g., miR-199a/b). The opposite patterns of expression were observed when samples were stratified according to protective mutations on SRSF2/SF3B1 or EIF1AX. Similarly, characteristic profiles of tRFs were reported, together with a correlation between tRF length and clinicopathological features. Differential expression of tRFs was reported in association with several clinical features. Specific isomiRs and tRFs were also associated with metastasis, showing differential expression in metastatic patients. These results show that both isomiRs and tRFs may be applied as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in UM.\n\n    Several studies focused on single miRNAs showing altered expression in UM patients, investigating their molecular function in UM cells. Reduced expression of miR-124a was observed in pairs of tumor and normal tissues from a small cohort of six UM patients; in vitro assays revealed that miR-124a ectopic expression inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of UM cells, also reducing tumor growth in vivo. The molecular function of miR-124a may be exerted through several targets, including CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6), CCND2 (cyclin D2), and EZH2. Lu et al. confirmed the downregulation of miR-124 and its role in the regulation of cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. A recent paper reported the downregulation of miR-130a in a cohort of sixty-two UM patients and forty-two unaffected individuals; miR-130a levels were especially reduced in metastatic patients, and low miRNA expression was associated with shorter OS. Enforced overexpression of miR-130a impaired cell migration and invasion in vitro by inducing downregulation of USP6 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 6) and inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway; moreover, miRNA overexpression inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Reduced levels of miR-137 were observed in tumors compared to normal tissues of UM patients; shorter OS and more adverse features were reported for patients with lower miRNA expression. Overexpression of miR-137 showed anti-tumor effects, decreasing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro by targeting EZH2, and inhibiting of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MiRNA expression was evaluated in a cohort of twenty-three choroid samples: after a first microarray analysis performed in ten samples (five UM vs. five normal tissues), validation in real-time PCR (microarray samples plus six UM and seven normal tissues) confirmed the upregulation of miR-378d and miR-378g, and the downregulation of miR-204-5p, miR-143-3p, and miR-145-5p. Ectopic expression of miR-145-5p in UM cell lines reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis by targeting IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1). The same group demonstrated that miR-145-5p tumor suppressive function was also performed through other targets, namely NRAS and VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), thus impairing invasion and angiogenesis in vitro, and also tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Lower expression of miR-145 and miR-205 was reported in both low- and high-invasive tumors compared to normal tissues. Ectopic expression of the two miRNAs (alone or in combination) impaired cell proliferation and invasion, with a stronger effect of miR-145 and miR-205, respectively. Both miRNAs synergistically regulated CDC42 (cell division cycle 42) and NRP1 (neuropilin 1 expression). MiR-155 showed increased levels in tumor tissues compared to paired normal tissues in a cohort of twenty-five UM patients; upregulation of miR-155 enhanced cell proliferation and invasion of UM cell lines through the target NDFIP1 (Nedd4 family interacting protein 1). The expression of the miR-181 family was investigated in a small cohort of UM and normal tissues (three vs. three) by microarray, showing upregulation of mir-181b-1, mir-181b-2, and mir-181a; miR-181a and miR-181b upregulation was confirmed in a set of UM cell lines compared to the RPE (retinal pigment epithelium) cell line. Overexpression of miR-181b promoted cell cycle progression by regulating CTDSPL (CTD small phosphatase-like) expression. Another study reported the downregulation of miR-182 in five out of seven UM clinical specimens, showing that its tumor suppressive function depended on TP53 activation and regulated cell proliferation by targeting MITF, BCL2 (BCL2 apoptosis regulator), and CCND2. In addition, overexpression of miR-182 inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The HDM2 (now named MDM2, MDM2 proto-oncogene) gene on 12q15 is highly expressed in 97% of UM. It has been demonstrated that high HDM2/MDM2 expression inhibits TP53 and its function of removing abnormal cells. BCL2, which is found on 18q21, is found to be highly expressed in both UM and normal melanocytes. This overexpression has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and is thought to be responsible for melanocyte resistance to chemotherapy or irradiation. Downregulation of miR-224-5p was observed in thirty pairs of tumor and normal tissues from UM patients. In vitro, increased expression of miR-224-5p reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating the expression of its targets PIK3R3 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3) and AKT3 (AKT serine/threonine kinase 3). Reduced levels of miR-224-5p and regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were confirmed by Zheng et al.. Zhou et al. investigated the expression of miR-20a, which was upregulated in ten UM tissues compared to ten normal ones. The authors showed that miR-20a promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of UM cell lines. Reduced levels of miR-34a were reported by northern blot in three tumor tissues compared to normal ones; miR-34a negatively regulated cell proliferation and migration by targeting MET (MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase) and affecting the AKT pathway. A few years later, the same group reported another target of miR-34a, namely LGR4 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4), through which the miRNA modulated cell migration, invasion, and EMT using MMP2 (matrix metallopeptidase 2) as a downstream effector. In contrast, upregulation of miR-34a, together with miR-146a and miR-21, was observed by our group in twelve FFPE tumors compared to choroidal melanocytes from five unaffected individuals. Reduced expression of miR-34b and miR-34c was reported by Dong and Lou by analyzing five pairs of tumor and normal tissues. In vitro assays showed that both miRNAs were involved in cell proliferation and migration by repressing MET expression. MiR-34b and miR-34c were also involved in sensitivity to doxorubicin treatment, and their expression was induced by the drug. Comparing tumor and normal tissues from twenty-eight UM patients, Ling et al. reported the upregulation of miR-367 and its role in promoting proliferation and migration in vitro by targeting the well-known tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog). Increased expression of miR-652 was shown in a cohort of twenty-six paired tumors and normal tissues; in vitro reduced miRNA expression impaired cell proliferation and migration through HOXA9 (homeobox A9) upregulation, which is an inhibitor of the HIF1A (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha) signaling pathway.\n\n    Other studies investigated miRNA functions in vitro without evaluating their expression in patient biopsies. Let-7b expression was reduced in UM cells treated with radiation; increased let-7b expression enhanced radiosensitivity by targeting CCND1, thus promoting G1 arrest. CCND1 has been found to be overexpressed in 65% of UM cases. CCND1 overexpression activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which phosphorylate and inactivate the RB1 protein. Overexpression of CCND1 is associated with large tumor size, epithelioid cytology, and poor prognosis. Chen et al. reported a reduced expression of miR-137 in UM cell lines compared to primary melanocytes, coherently with the downregulation in tumor tissues reported by Zhang et al. (see above Section 5.1.2). Restoring miR-137 expression in UM cells caused cell cycle arrest by downregulating the targets MITF and CDK6, thus modulating several signaling pathways. In another study, the role of miR-137 was also investigated in a few cancer models, including UM, where it regulated cell viability in vitro by downregulating SRC3 (now renamed NCOA3, nuclear receptor coactivator 3). The same study also proved that miR-106b, miR-106a, miR-20a-5p, miR-519d, miR-17-5p, miR-429, miR-200c, miR-93-5p, and miR-372 suppressed SRC3 expression and, except for miR-93-5p and miR-372, inhibited cell proliferation. Recently, Quemener et al. showed that miR-16 overexpression decreased cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in UM cell lines, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function in UM. The authors considered that the sole expression level of the miRNA is not useful to infer its activity because of the existence of ceRNA networks within cells. For this reason, the miR-16 interactome was investigated by RNA pull-down in UM cells compared to the same cells with ectopic miR-16 expression; downregulated genes were considered potential targets of miR-16, while upregulated genes were postulated to act as miRNA sponges. Sequence analysis showed that only 30% of downregulated miRNA targets and 2% of upregulated sponges contained miR-16-binding sites, suggesting a non-canonical base pairing. Indeed, a sequence motif found in the potential sponges suggested that the binding with miR-16 would create a bulge in the miRNA seed sequence, suppressing the miRNA-mediated silencing as expected according to the miRNA sponge hypothesis. In vitro assays showed that cell proliferation was impaired by decreased levels of miR-16 targets such as AMOT (angiomotin), TACC1 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 1), NRBP1 (nuclear receptor binding protein 1), and DNAJB4 [DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B4]. Among the potential sponges, PYGB (glycogen phosphorylase B) showed the highest expression in UM and most increased levels after transfection with miR-16 mimic, both as mRNA and protein; non-canonical binding sites found in PYGB sequence may allow the miRNA sponge to interact with miR-16. The fifty-seven potential sponges of miR-16 showed a prognostic value in predicting survival in TCGA patients with unchanged levels of the miRNA. A signature related to miR-16 activity including four mRNAs (TSPAN14, NLE1, FLNC, and LIPA) was identified and validated in an independent cohort (GSE22138), suggesting a potential application in clinical practice. Wang et al. observed an increased expression of MMP2 and MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9) in choroidal malignant melanoma (CMM) compared to non-tumoral choroidal tissues; the authors demonstrated that both metalloproteases are targeted by miR-296-3p, which showed reduced expression in CMM cell lines compared to normal melanocytes. Ectopic expression of miR-296-3p inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and enhanced apoptosis in vitro. The same study also reported that MMP2 and MMP9 expression was regulated by the lncRNA FOXCUT (FOXC1 upstream transcript); similar to miR-296-3p, FOXCUT increased expression, impaired cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis in vitro; it also showed decreased levels in CMM cell lines compared to normal melanocytes. Not surprisingly, miR-296-3p and FOXCUT expressions were positively correlated. Another study compared UM cell lines with normal tissues, reporting increased expression of miR-21, in agreement with miR-21 upregulation reported by our group in UM tissues (see above Section 5.1.2). In vitro assays showed that miR-21 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and reduced apoptosis by targeting TP53, while reduced expression of miR-21 impaired tumor growth in vivo. Because of its involvement in EMT regulation, Wang et al. investigated the effects of miR-23a in UM cell lines: increased miRNA levels reduced ZEB1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1) and VIM (vimentin) while enhancing CDH1 (cadherin 1) expression; moreover, ectopic expression of miR-23a impaired the migration of UM cells. Overexpression of ZEB1 decreased the expression of miR-23a and CDH1 while increasing VIM and CDH2 (cadherin 2) levels. Hence, the authors reported a negative feedback loop involving miR-23a and ZEB1 regulating EMT. Guo et al. showed that increased expression of miR-26a inhibited cell viability and proliferation and promoted apoptosis. These effects were mediated by the enhanced expression of TP53 and the reduction in MDM2 levels mediated by miRNA overexpression. Shortly after, another paper confirmed the data about miR-26a; the authors reported that EZH2, which showed increased expression in UM tissues, was targeted by miR-26a, which in turn was downregulated in UM cell lines compared to normal choroidal cells. EZH2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, such as miR-26a increased expression. Reduced levels of miR-216a-5p promoted cell proliferation in vitro by targeting HK2 (hexokinase 2), thus impairing glycolysis. Immunohistochemical staining of UM tissues showed a negative correlation of expression between miR-216a-5p and HK2; low miRNA levels were also associated with shorter OS and DFS. It was reported that genistein, an isoflavone isolated from soybean with an antitumor effect, reduced miR-27a levels, which in turn affected ZBTB10 (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 10) expression and reduced cell proliferation. Liu et al. reported a negative correlation between miR-9 expression and invasion of UM cells; ectopic miRNA expression reduced migration and invasion in vitro by decreasing NFKB1 (nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1) levels. By affecting NFKB1 levels, miR-9 indirectly inhibited MMP2, MMP9, and VEGFA expression. In vitro treatment of UM and CM cell lines with the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 affected the expression of the miR-17-92a cluster in different ways, but always reduced miR-92a-3p. In vitro experiments showed that miR-92a-3p targeted MYCBP2 (MYC binding protein 2), thus contributing to the apoptosis of UM cell lines. The authors also reported the upregulation of miR-92a-3p and the downregulation of MYCBP2 in UM tissues, although the comparison was performed against normal skin samples.\n\n    Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a crucial role in cancer progression. Joshi et al. showed that distinct UM cell lines had a different sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytolysis because of the expression and secretion of specific miRNAs regulating NK cells, namely miR-155 and miR-146a.\n\n    Another class of ncRNAs that has been discovered more recently is represented by lncRNAs, which are similar to mRNAs in size, structure, transcriptional regulation, and post-translational modifications. Indeed, lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, may contain introns, and are capped, spliced, and polyadenylated. Their size is heterogeneous, ranging from 200 nts to kilobases. Unlike miRNAs, it has been demonstrated that lncRNAs may play several different functions, and only for a few of them has the precise mechanism of action been described. One of the most commonly investigated functions is the participation in ceRNA networks, which causes the modulation of miRNA function on target mRNAs. The ceRNA hypothesis has been investigated in several tumor models, including UM. Our group recently developed an online tool to build ceRNA networks including lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, in UM using TCGA expression data. In recent years, lncRNAs have gained increasing attention as epigenetic regulators both in physiological and pathological processes. Accordingly, in the context of UM, a growing literature is available. Similar to miRNAs and mRNAs, lncRNAs have also been investigated as prognostic biomarkers in UM (Table 3).\n\n    The first study investigating the role of lncRNA in UM carcinogenesis reported the downregulation of PAUPAR (PAX6 upstream antisense RNA) in twelve UM compared to five unaffected tissues. Overexpression of the lncRNA impaired colony formation ability and migration in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. A potential downstream effector of PAUPAR was HES1 (hes family bHLH transcription factor 1), whose expression was higher in UM tissues and decreased after in vitro ectopic expression of the lncRNA. HES1 increased levels promoted migration of UM cells and were sustained by the inhibition of histone H3K4 methylation induced by PAUPAR, which localized within the nucleus of UM cells. The role of ANRIL, now named CDKN2B-AS1 (CDKN2B antisense RNA 1), was investigated in both CM and UM by Pan et al.: by analyzing CM and UM tissues compared to a unique cohort of normal tissues from both skin and choroid, the authors showed the increased expression of ANRIL/CDKN2B-AS1 in both diseases. In parallel, the expression of tumor suppressive proteins coded by the same locus but in a different direction was analyzed, showing a significant downregulation of INK4A (p16, now named CDKN2A) and INK4B (p15, now named CDKN2B, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B), while ARF (p14, now considered a splicing variant of CDKN2A) levels were unchanged. The transient silencing of ANRIL/CDKN2B-AS1 triggered an increase in INK4A/CDKN2A and INK4B/CDKN2B expression and impaired the metastatic ability of CM and UM cells in vitro; also, tumor formation induced by UM cells was inhibited both in vitro and in vivo by lncRNA knockdown. Upregulation of MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), a well-known oncogene in several cancer models, was also reported in twenty-five UM tissues compared to their normal counterparts; decreased expression of MALAT1 reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro. MALAT1 downregulation induced increased expression of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), Ki-67/MKI67, and miR-140-3p; downregulation of miR-140-3p was also confirmed in UM tissues. Wu et al. also demonstrated that MALAT1 regulated HOXC4 (homeobox C4) expression by binding miR-608, thus suppressing tumor growth in vivo. RHPN1-AS1 [RHPN1 antisense RNA 1 (head to head)] is a cytoplasmic lncRNA upregulated in UM tissues; its knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and also tumor growth in vivo. CASC15 (cancer susceptibility 15) is an lncRNA involved in many tumors. Xing et al. identified a new isoform of CASC15, which they named CASC15-NewTranscript 1 (CASC15-NT1 or CANT1), and reported decreased levels of this new lncRNA in seventeen UM patients compared to twelve normal individuals. Overexpression of CASC15-NT1/CANT1 impaired cell migration and colony formation ability in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo. A potential downstream effector of CASC15-NT1/CANT1 was identified in XIST (X inactive specific transcript): indeed, XIST levels increased after induction of CASC15-NT1/CANT1 expression in UM cells derived from female patients through the transcriptional activation of other lncRNAs, namely JPX (JPX transcript, XIST activator) and FTX (FTX transcript, XIST regulator). CASC15-NT1/CANT1 directly bound the promoter of JPX and FTX loci, inducing histone H3K4 methylation. Upregulation of HOXA11-AS (HOXA11 antisense RNA) was observed in five UM compared to matched control tissues, while its reduced expression inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. HOXA11-AS was prevalently localized within the nucleus, where it interacted with EZH2 and induced silencing of p21/CDKN1A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A); in the cytoplasm, HOXA11-AS acted as a sponge for miR-124, which was downregulated in UM tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-124 impaired cell proliferation and invasion (as previously discussed). FTH1P3 (ferritin heavy chain 1 pseudogene 3) showed increased expression in a cohort of twenty-five tumor samples compared to non-tumor matched tissues; this upregulation sustained increased cell proliferation and migration in vitro, promoted RAC1 (Rac family small GTPase 1) and Frizzle 5 (FDZ5, frizzled class receptor 5) expression, and induced downregulation of miR-224-5p, which in turn reduced the expression of the lncRNA in a loop regulative mechanism. MiR-224-5p was downregulated in UM tissues (coherently with Li et al.) and mediated the FTH1P3-induced effects on proliferation and migration. PVT1 (Pvt1 oncogene) upregulation in forty UM patients was reported by Huang et al.. Knockdown of PVT1 reduced cell proliferation and colony formation ability and increased apoptosis in vitro by downregulating EZH2. Another study confirmed PVT1 upregulation and reported its role in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro; the authors demonstrated the binding between PVT1 and miR-17-3p in the cytoplasm, which caused the increased expression of MDM2 and the consequent degradation of TP53. ZNNT1 (ZNF706 neighboring transcript 1), downregulated in twenty UM tissues, showed a prevalent localization within the nucleus and regulated the expression of ATG12 (autophagy-related 12), thus promoting autophagy of UM cells in vitro. ZNNT1 overexpression also increased cell death and impaired migration in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In a cohort of eight enucleated eyes and five normal eyes, GAS5 (growth arrest-specific 5) reduced expression was reported and associated with poor prognosis. Knockdown and ectopic expression of GAS5 showed its role in inhibiting cell viability, migration, invasion, and EMT in vitro, performed through the sponging of miR-21. Previously discussed papers showed the upregulation of miR-21, consistent with these results (see above Section 5.1.2). Recently, our group reported the increased expression of LINC00518 (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 518) and LINC00634, now named SMIM45 (small integral membrane protein 45), in a cohort of forty-one UM patients comparing tumor and normal adjacent tissues. In vitro experiments in UM cells showed that LINC00518 downregulation impaired cell proliferation and migration, while its expression was increased by triggering EMT and hypoxia-like response. We proposed that LINC00518 molecular effectors may be five mRNAs, namely LINGO2 (leucine-rich repeat and Ig domain containing 2), NFIA (nuclear factor I A), OTUD7B (OTU deubiquitinase 7B), SEC22C (SEC22 homolog C, vesicle trafficking protein), and VAMP3 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 3), showing decreased levels after lncRNA transient silencing. LINC00518 may regulate mRNA expression by acting as an miRNA sponge or by directly binding the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs, thus masking miRNA-binding sites and acting as an \"miRNA protector\". Finally, our data suggested MITF as a potential regulator of LINC00518 expression. By analyzing tumor-normal pairs from three UM patients, Li et al. identified a new isoform of the lncRNA LOC100505912 (uncharacterized LOC100505912), named Oncotarget in UM formation-transcript 1 (OUM1), showing increased expression in tumor tissues. Knockdown of its expression decreased cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, while tumor growth was impaired in vivo. LOC100505912/OUM1 reduced the expression of PTPRZ1 (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1), which was upregulated in UM tissues. LOC100505912/OUM1, mainly localized in the cytoplasm, was able to directly bind PTPRZ1, thus enhancing protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity. Since PTP is involved in chemoresistance, nanoparticles for the delivery of siRNAs against LOC100505912/OUM1 or PTPRZ1 were tested, showing a successful reduction in tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. As previously discussed, Wang et al. reported the downregulation of FOXCUT in CMM, showing its role in modulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in vitro by regulating MMP2 and MMP9 expression.\n\n    Also for lncRNAs, reports discussing their function in UM without appropriately investigating their expression in patient biopsies are available. Downregulation of the transcription factor HIC1 (HIC ZBTB transcriptional repressor 1) was observed in three UM samples compared to three normal tissues and in UM cell lines compared to normal dermal fibroblasts. Overexpression of HIC1 suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion; moreover, HIC1 altered the expression of seventy-six lncRNAs, among which LOC101928143 (uncharacterized LOC101928143) showed increased expression. Because of the position of this locus upstream of the protein-coding gene NUMB (NUMB endocytic adaptor protein), the authors called this dysregulated transcript lncRNA-numb; in particular, the 635 nt isoform was downregulated in UM cells compared to dermal fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of LOC101928143 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion of UM cells, suggesting that it may act as a downstream effector of HIC1. Pan et al. reported the overexpression of P2RX7 (purinergic receptor P2X 7) variant 3, called P2RX7-V3 (NR_033949.1), in invasive UM cell lines compared to ARPE-19, a human RPE cell line. Knockdown of this non-coding variant inhibited the migration and colony formation ability of UM cells in vitro. Decreased levels of P2RX7-V3 in vivo reduced the expression of Ki-67/MKI67 and VIM and increased CDH1 levels, repressing tumor growth and progression. Expression modulation of twenty lncRNAs has been reported after the treatment of UM cells with olaparib, a poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Investigation of PanCancer samples showed that these lncRNAs are often genetically altered in cancer and that some of these genetic alterations were associated with OS.\n\n    Concerning the potential application of lncRNAs as prognostic biomarkers, Xu et al. performed a transcriptome analysis in eleven UM tumors (six metastasized and five non-metastasized), identifying 329 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and 802 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs). RP1-272L16.1 and RP11-329N22.1 were the most significantly up and downregulated DELs. The authors showed that lncRNA deregulation was coherent with chromosomal status: indeed, DELs mapping on chromosomes 3 and 8 was down- or upregulated according to chromosome 3 loss and chromosome 8 gain. The dysregulation of twelve DELs randomly selected was confirmed in real-time PCR. PVT1, which plays oncogenic functions in several cancer models, was investigated in the TCGA dataset for its prognostic value. Increased levels of PVT1 were associated with malignant features of UM (older age, epithelioid morphology, distant metastasis, extrascleral extension, higher death rate) and predicted poor OS; this predictive value was specific to UM and was not observed in CM. Upregulation of PVT1 in UM was caused by DNA amplification and methylation and was also observed in UM tissues (see above Section 5.2.1). A previously discussed analysis of the TCGA dataset identified forty-seven CpG islands of lncRNAs with aberrant methylation in patients grouped according to survival time. A nine-lncRNAs-CpG-classifier with prognostic value for patient survival was identified (see above Section 4). In the TCGA dataset, decreased levels of SNHG7 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 7) were associated with poor prognosis, with significant downregulation of the lncRNA in metastatic patients compared to non-metastatic patients. Ectopic expression in UM cell lines promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro, potentially through EZH2 as a downstream effector. The same dataset allowed Wu et al. to identify SNHG15 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 15) as a prognostic factor for death in UM: indeed, high levels of SNHG15 were associated with worse prognosis, pathologic state, and metastasis. LOC100132707, now named PAXIP1-AS2 (PAXIP1 antisense RNA 2), was upregulated in tumors from metastatic patients in the TCGA cohort. In vitro assays showed it promoted cell migration and invasion by upregulating JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), while reduced expression of LOC100132707/PAXIP1-AS2 impaired tumorigenesis in vivo. By re-analyzing expression data from the GSE22138 dataset, Yang et al. reported decreased levels of ZNF667-AS1 [ZNF667 antisense RNA 1 (head to head)] in metastatic patients compared to non-metastatic UM patients; follow-up data from TCGA showed the association of the lncRNA with histological type, metastasis, recurrence, and death, with a poorer prognosis in the low expression group. Among the correlated genes, MEGF10 (multiple EGF-like domains 10) showed a high positive expression correlation and a prognostic value consistent with ZNF667-AS1. In vitro experiments showed that both ZNF667-AS1 and MEGF10 modulated cell viability, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis in UM cells. A signature of six autophagy-related lncRNAs (AL589843.1, AC016757.1, LINC00957, AP005121.1, PVT1, AC016747.1) with prognostic value was identified in TGCA and GSE22138 by comparing metastatic and non-metastatic patients. Another signature of autophagy-related lncRNAs was reported by Chen et al.; six lncRNAs (SOS1-IT1, AC016747.1, AC100791.3, AC018904.1, AC104825.1, AC090617.5) were prognostic for OS in UM patients both individually and in combination. Focusing on the post-transcriptional modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A), Liu et al. evaluated the prognostic value of lncRNAs related to m6A. First, they investigated the expression of m6A regulators in TGCA, reporting a prognostic value for a signature including RBM15B (RNA binding motif protein 15B), YTHDF3 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 3), and IGF2BP2 (insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2), and their association with immune infiltration in UM. By correlation analysis, a signature of thirty-eight lncRNAs correlated to the three regulators was identified; the expression of the lncRNAs allowed to classify TCGA samples into two clusters differing in immune infiltrate, OS, and progression-free survival. Five lncRNAs (AC008555.4, AC018529.1, AC104129.1, CYTOR, MIR4435-2HG) were associated with the prognosis of UM patients. Thirteen immune-related genes showing expression correlation with five lncRNAs and associated with poor prognosis showed differential expression in the two clusters, suggesting they may be downstream effectors of m6A regulators and lncRNAs. Classification of TCGA samples according to immune infiltrate led to the identification of eight immune-related lncRNAs (ZNF667-AS1, ZNF350-AS1, LINC02572, LINC02367, ACVR2B-AS1, DKFZP434A062, CYTOR, LINC01615) with prognostic value. The authors also suggested a possible application in therapy by identifying potential target genes and specific drugs. Increased expression of SAMMSON (survival-associated mitochondrial melanoma-specific oncogenic non-coding RNA) was observed in metastatic patients from the TCGA cohort. Knockdown of the lncRNA impaired cell viability and induced apoptosis in UM cell lines and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Several interactors of SAMMSON were identified, including p32 (C1QBP, complement C1q binding protein) and XRN2 (5'-3' exoribonuclease 2); the lncRNA interactome affected mitochondrial function and protein synthesis. Wang et al. investigated the expression, mutations, and prognostic value of BACE1-AS (BACE1 antisense RNA) in thirty-two cancer models from TCGA: higher expression levels of BACE1-AS were associated with a longer OS and progression-free interval in the TCGA UM dataset. Recently, the role of lncRNAs in the regulation of ferroptosis was investigated. A signature of five lncRNAs (AC136475.3, AC104129.1, PPP1R14B-AS1, LINC00963, ZNF667-AS1) related to ferroptosis was identified, showing a predictive value for mortality risk; tumors classified according to the lncRNA signatures also showed differences in the immune response. Three lncRNAs were further studied through in vitro assays, namely LINC00963 (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 963), PPP1R14B-AS1 (PPP1R14B antisense RNA 1), and ZNF667-AS1. Knockdown of the three lncRNAs impaired cell migration and invasion; effects on cell proliferation were different for each tested lncRNA. LncRNAs related to fatty acid metabolism (FAM) were identified by correlation with FAM-related mRNAs identified in TCGA expression data. Twenty-five FAM-related lncRNAs with prognostic value were identified: among them, AC104129.1, SOS1-IT1 (SOS1 intronic transcript 1), and DLGAP1AS2 (DLGAP1 antisense RNA 2) were associated with high-risk, while IDI2-AS1 (IDI2 antisense RNA 1) with low-risk. A recent analysis of the TCGA dataset allowed to identify 1664 immune-related genes and 2216 lncRNAs thanks to expression correlation analysis. Through regression analysis, a signature of three lncRNAs (AP005121.1, AC104117.3, and SOX1-OT) able to predict OS was identified. As previously discussed, Yu et al. used TCGA expression data to identify a prognostic signature including five mRNAs (CGREF1, P4HA2, RGMB, PKNOX2, SLC6A6), four miRNAs (miR-181b, miR-507, miR-548, miR-181a) and six lncRNAs (PVT1, HCP5, EPB41L4A-AS1, BOLA3-AS1, SNHG7, GAS5). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that low expression of EPB41L4A-AS1, BOLA3-AS1, SNHG7, and high levels of PVT1 were associated with low survival rates.\n\n    A particular class of lncRNAs is represented by circRNAs, including molecules with the peculiar characteristic of the covalent binding between the two ends achieved through a specific splicing mechanism, defined as backsplicing. As well as the other classes of ncRNAs, circRNAs act as epigenetic regulators and have been associated with several diseases, including cancer. To date, only a few data about circRNA involvement in UM are available. The first study was published in 2018 by Yang et al., who performed microarray analysis in five UM tissues and five normal samples. The microarray allowed to detect the expression of 170,340 circRNAs, among which 50,579 were differentially expressed in tumor tissues. Fifteen circRNAs were validated in twenty UM and twenty normal tissues, confirming the upregulation of seven circRNAs (circ_0119873, circ_0128533, circ_0047924, circ_0103232, and circRNA10628-6) and the downregulation of two (circ_0032148 and circ_0133460). Since circRNAs may act as miRNA sponges, the authors identified the potential miRNAs targeted by the dysregulated circRNAs, which included miR-145, miR-92a-3p, miR-193a, miR-193b, and miR-204. Reduced expression of miR-145 and miR-204 and upregulation of miR-92a-3p in UM have been previously discussed (see above). By analyzing microarray data of this first study about circRNAs, Liu et al. identified circ_0119872, transcribed from exons 4 and 5 of RASGRP3, as upregulated in tumor tissues. Circ_0119872 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The circRNA was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, where it directly interacted with miR-622, which in turn targeted G3BP1 (G3BP stress granule assembly factor 1). G3BP1 was upregulated in metastatic compared to non-metastatic tumors from the GSE44295 dataset and positively regulated cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro.",

        "Conclusion": "    UM generally shows a low mutational burden, and only a few mutually exclusive driver mutations and chromosomal abnormalities with relevant diagnostic/prognostic significance occur in patients. Although the primary oncogenic processes in UM are well understood, a greater comprehension of their succession and biological repercussions is required to reveal the evolution of UM and, accordingly, successfully prevent or treat metastases. Furthermore, the few genetic anomalies cause several dozen heterogeneous molecular alterations reported in UM both in vitro and in vivo, influencing many aspects of the tumor and being related to the prognostic features of patients. These findings depict a concealed complex scenario that combines some homogeneous genetic changes with a cascade of disparate epigenetic dysregulations inducing melanocyte transformation and UM dissemination.\n\n    To date, these epigenetic alterations, particularly those involving ncRNAs, are being studied in order to discover both therapeutic molecules that can be targeted using RNA-based therapies and new diagnostic and prognostic markers that can be measured in biological fluids in a non-invasive manner.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Title": "    MSH6 and PMS2 mutation positive Australian Lynch syndrome families: novel mutations, cancer risk and age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Approximately 10% of Lynch syndrome families have a mutation in MSH6 and fewer families have a mutation in PMS2. It is assumed that the cancer incidence is the same in families with mutations in MSH6 as in families with mutations in MLH1/MSH2 but that the disease tends to occur later in life, little is known about families with PMS2 mutations. This study reports on our findings on mutation type, cancer risk and age of diagnosis in MSH6 and PMS2 families.\n\n    A total of 78 participants (from 29 families) with a mutation in MSH6 and 7 participants (from 6 families) with a mutation in PMS2 were included in the current study. A database of de-identified patient information was analysed to extract all relevant information such as mutation type, cancer incidence, age of diagnosis and cancer type in this Lynch syndrome cohort. Cumulative lifetime risk was calculated utilising Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\n\n    MSH6 and PMS2 mutations represent 10.3% and 1.9%, respectively, of the pathogenic mutations in our Australian Lynch syndrome families. We identified 26 different MSH6 and 4 different PMS2 mutations in the 35 families studied. We report 15 novel MSH6 and 1 novel PMS2 mutations. The estimated cumulative risk of CRC at age 70 years was 61% (similar in males and females) and 65% for endometrial cancer in MSH6 mutation carriers. The risk of developing CRC is different between males and females at age 50 years, which is 34% for males and 21% for females.\n\n    Novel MSH6 and PMS2 mutations are being reported and submitted to the current databases for identified Lynch syndrome mutations. Our data provides additional information to add to the genotype-phenotype spectrum for both MSH6 and PMS2 mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)/Lynch syndrome (MIM 120435) accounts for approximately 2 percent of all diagnosed colorectal cancers (CRC). Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndrome characterised by early onset epithelial cancers. Patients with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of developing malignancies during their lifetime, at a mean age of disease onset that is significantly lower than that observed in the general population. In addition to the high risk of developing CRC, Lynch syndrome patients are also at risk of developing malignancies in a variety of organs that include the uterus, small bowel, stomach, ovary, bladder, pancreas and the urinary tract. A breakdown in the fidelity of DNA mismatch repair has been shown to be the basis of the disease. At present four genes encoding proteins that are integrally involved in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) have been clearly associated with Lynch syndrome and these are MLH1 (MIM 120436), MSH2 (MIM 609309), MSH6 (MIM 600678) and PMS2 (MIM 600259). MMR provides several genetic stabilisation functions; it corrects DNA biosynthesis errors, ensures the fidelity of genetic recombination and participates in the earliest steps of cell cycle checkpoint/control and apoptotic responses. MMR gene defects increase the risk of malignant transformation of cells, which ultimately result in the disruption of one or several genes associated with epithelial integrity.\n\n    Genetic testing of MLH1 and MSH2 for Lynch Syndrome has been available for over a decade and during this time significant advances in the technologies used for diagnosis have occurred. Together with improvements in technology the ability to rapidly screen additional genes associated with Lynch syndrome, MSH6 and PMS2, has become available. The MMR genes MSH6 and PMS2 have been shown to interact with MSH2 and MLH1, respectively. Impediments to screening these two genes for mutations have been the high cost of testing and the presence of pseudogenes in PMS2 . Notwithstanding, some information is available with respect to the frequency of MSH6 and PMS2 mutations but there is relatively limited information available regarding the spectrum of disease, especially in Australian Lynch syndrome families harbouring deleterious changes in one of these two genes.\n\n    Approximately 10 percent of Lynch syndrome families have a mutation in MSH6 and fewer families have a mutation in PMS2 . It is assumed that the cancer incidence is the same in families with mutations in MSH6 as in families with mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 but that disease tends to occur later in life as a result of the partial compensation provided by MSH3 in MMR. PMS2 mutations lead to an attenuated phenotype with weaker family history and older ages of disease onset. Phenotype information for MSH6 and PMS2 mutation carriers is therefore of great interest for the recognition of Lynch syndrome and the formulation of sufficient surveillance schemes.\n\n    In the current study we report on our findings on mutation type, cancer risk and age of diagnosis in 29 families (78 participants) with a mutation in MSH6 and 6 families (7 participants) with a mutation in PMS2.",
        "Methods": "    All the participants selected for this study had previously been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome and harboured a mutation in either MSH6 or PMS2. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval for the study was obtained from Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee. Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n    Since 1997, samples have been tested for Lynch syndrome/HNPCC at the Division of Genetics, Hunter Area Pathology Service in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. Information from all the samples collected between 1997 and 2008 has been placed into a database. The families were referred for genetic testing due to a clinical diagnosis of HNPCC according to the Amsterdam II criteria/Bethesda criteria or due to the tumour displaying microsatellite instability (MSI) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrating loss of MSH6/PMS2 expression.\n\n    A total of 78 participants (from 29 Caucasian families) with a mutation in MSH6 and 7 participants (from 6 Caucasian families) with a mutation in PMS2 were included in the current study. A database of de-identified patient information was analysed to extract all relevant information such as mutation type, cancer risk, age of diagnosis and cancer type in this patient cohort. Of the 29 MSH6 mutation positive families, 16 fulfilled the Amsterdam II criteria and 1 fulfilled the Bethesda criteria, while 6 did not fulfil the guidelines for either (5 cases had loss of staining of MSH6, while 1 was MSI-High) and in 5 families the status was unknown (no pedigree/uninformative pedigree). Of the 6 PMS2 mutation positive families, 4 fulfilled the Amsterdam II criteria, while 2 families did not due to lack of family history of cancer or uninformative pedigree.\n\n    The diagnosis of the cancers in the mutation positive participants was confirmed in histopathological reports, while information of cancers in family members with unknown mutation status is collected from the family pedigrees.\n\n    Cumulative lifetime risk for MSH6 mutation carriers was calculated using Kaplan Meier survival analysis, and was determined on the basis of CRC being the 1st primary tumour against cancer free individuals and endometrial cancer being the 1st primary tumour against cancer free females. The observation time for the different cases was from birth until first cancer diagnosis or last follow-up appointment.",
        "Results": "    We identified 26 different MSH6 mutations in the 29 probands; a list of the mutations is shown in Table 1. Eleven of the identified MSH6 mutations have been reported before and fifteen MSH6 mutations are novel mutations (six of these have been posted on the LOVD database and the remaining nine will be submitted). All mutations are considered causative and predictive testing has been offered to family members. Table 1 also lists available immunohistochemistry (IHC) and microsatellite instability (MSI) results from the participant's tumours. IHC results were available in 20 of the 29 families; the tumour of 16 probands showed lack of staining (-ve) for MSH6, 2 tumours were -ve MSH2 but positive (+ve) for MSH6, 1 tumour showed isolated loss of MSH6 while 1 was uninformative for MSH6 but +ve for MLH1, MSH2 and PMS2. MSI results were available from 6 probands, all displaying MSI-High (unstable), 4 of them belonging to the -ve MSH6 group.\n\n    Of the total 78 MSH6 mutation positive participants belonging to 29 families, only 21 participants (27%) had developed colorectal cancer (CRC). The average and median age of diagnosis of CRC was 48 years, ranging from 21 to 72 years. The median age of individuals who were cancer free at the time of sample collection was 44 years, ranging from 18-76, and the average age of this group was 45 years.\n\n    Cancer incidence in the MSH6 mutation positive families includes, in order of frequency (in how many families the cancer was observed): CRC in 23 families (79%); cancer of the endometrium in 17 families (59%); breast or prostate cancer in 7 families (24%); and ovarian cancer in 5 families (17%). Other extra colonic cancers, including lung, bladder, stomach, cervical, Hodgkin lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, liver, throat, lymphoma, thyroid, leukaemia, kidney, gallbladder, brain, melanoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and pituitary tumour can be seen in four or less families. In six families, cancer of an unknown site was recorded (Table 2). Extra colonic cancers were diagnosed in 2 individuals (9.5%) who had developed CRC and in 14 individuals (25%) who had not developed CRC. Table 3 provides detailed information about the extracolonic cancers in these patients. A wide spectrum of malignancies was present in the 29 MSH6 families and individuals with two primary tumours were observed in 14 of the 29 families (48%), see Table 2 for details.\n\n    Lifetime/cumulative risk of developing colorectal and endometrial cancer are shown in Figure 1 and 2 respectively. The cumulative risk of CRC in both male and female mutation carriers at 70 years of age was 61.5% for MSH6 mutation carriers (Figure 1A), which is similar if divided by gender (Figure 1B). A difference can be seen between males and females at an earlier age with females only being at 21% risk at age 50 years, while males have a risk of ~34% at 50 years of age. The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer in woman at age 70 years was 65%.\n\n    Of the 53 female participants in this study, 10 had developed endometrial cancer and the average and median age of diagnosis was 59 and 57 years respectively, ranging from 50-74 years. In 6 of the 17 families where endometrial cancer had been recorded, there were one or more individuals who had both endometrial plus another primary tumour.\n\n    In 4 families pedigree information was not accessible and in 3 families the proband was cancer free (the proband is the first person tested from the family in our laboratory, the index person of the family might have been tested in another laboratory either national or international). For the 22 families where full family history was available, cancer was present in one of the probands' parents in 13 families.\n\n    A list of the 4 identified PMS2 mutations can be seen in Table 4. Three of the identified PMS2 mutations have been reported before and one PMS2 mutation is a novel mutation. All mutations are considered causative and predictive testing has been offered to family members. Table 4 also lists the type of cancer and age of diagnosis in the probands of these families.\n\n    The 7 PMS2 participants include 6 probands and 1 family member. Five probands had been diagnosed with CRC at age 38, 41, 47, 55 and 60 years, one of them (CRC at 55 years) was also diagnosed with renal cancer at age 50 years. One proband has not developed CRC but was diagnosed with cancer of the small intestine at 63 years of age; the family member of this proband is currently cancer free at age 39 years.\n\n    Cancer incidence in the PMS2 mutation positive families includes, in order of frequency (in how many families the cancer can be seen): CRC (6 families); lung, stomach and brain cancer (2 families); endometrial + breast cancer, and ovarian + breast cancer (1 family); breast, cervical, Merkel cell and small intestine cancer (1 family).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The MSH6 participants included in this study are representative of all the HNPCC patients tested in New South Wales, Australia from 1997 to 2008, which we estimate is approximately half of the Australian HNPCC/Lynch syndrome families. The identified MSH6 mutations represent 10.3% of the pathogenic mutations identified in MMR genes in our Lynch syndrome families. This is in accordance with the expected frequencies of MSH6 mutations in already published material on Lynch syndrome. We report 15 novel MSH6 mutations and 1 novel PMS2 mutations in Lynch syndrome families not listed in the Mismatch Repair Genes Variant Database (Memorial University of Newfoundland), the InSIGHT database as a Lynch syndrome mutation or the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD).\n\n    Families with MSH6 mutations have been reported to have a lower incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and later age of disease onset than MLH1 and MSH2 families, while others suggest same high lifetime risk of CRC and later age of disease onset. In our Lynch syndrome cohort 27% had developed CRC, which is lower than expected. This could be due to there being an over-representation of woman (68%) in the MSH6 participants, as woman have been reported to be at lower risk of CRC than men. The median age of diagnosis of CRC was 48 years in the cohort studied, which is approximately 3-7 years younger than previously reported. The median age for the rest of the cohort was 44 years, which is an indication of the likelihood of more people developing CRC at a later age and thereby increasing the median age of diagnosis of CRC. Exclusion of missense mutations in this study could also influence the low age of CRC observed, as cases were selected due to more severe alterations and the chance of developing CRC earlier is therefore higher. In this patient cohort the lifetime risk for CRC at age 70 years was ~61% independent of gender, which is somewhat different from the lifetime risk of MSH6 mutation carriers presented in a previous study were there was a clear difference between males and females at age 70 years. The males in both studies had similar lifetime risk, but we fail to see the lower risk in woman. A meta-analysis of 5 different MSH6 mutation positive Lynch syndrome cohorts displayed a much lower lifetime risk of CRC at ~20%, which is an indication that our sample cohort might be too small to produce reliable lifetime risk figures.\n\n    The median age of endometrial cancer in this study was 59 years, supporting the much later onset of cancer in MSH6 mutation carriers. Females in this patient cohort had a lifetime risk of endometrial cancer of 65% at 70 years of age, which is similar to previously reported risk figures for MSH6 mutation carriers but again much higher than risk figures produced from a much larger study population. Endometrial cancer was seen in 59% of the MSH6 families as the second most common malignancy observed. Extra colonic cancers were observed with a higher frequency in the participants who had not developed CRC compared to the participants who had developed CRC. These observations are in accordance with the cancer frequencies seen in the German Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer Consortium. Cancer incidence in these families was as previously reported with CRC being the most common, followed by endometrial cancer. Breast and prostate cancer were observed in 23% of the MSH6 families, while ovarian cancer was observed in 17% of the families. Both ovarian and prostate cancer were expected to be observed in Lynch syndrome families but the inclusion of breast cancer in the cancer spectrum in Lynch syndrome is controversial. The high incidence of breast cancer in these families may genuinely reflect an increased risk of breast cancer, or it may indicate the high incidence of breast cancer in the general population (1 in 9 woman in Australia).\n\n    Previously, it has been reported that patients with pathogenic MSH6 mutations are less frequently affected by multiple tumours. This does not seem to be the case in our families as one or more individuals who had been diagnosed with two primary malignancies occurred in 14 of the 29 MSH6 families.\n\n    Currently the general consensus is that MSH6 mutations in HNPCC are under-diagnosed. This is thought to be due to MSH6 not being routinely tested in most laboratories and that the presence of MSH6 mutations is under-estimated due to a more atypical presentation of disease, making the patients less likely to fulfil diagnostic criteria. This is supported by a report of an unusual high incidence of MSH6 mutations (21%) in Amsterdam negative families. In the current study, participants were selected based on the molecular diagnosis of Lynch syndrome, nevertheless 24% of our families did not fulfil the Amsterdam II criteria. There is no routine screening for MSH6 in our laboratory and it is only performed when there is loss of MSH6 expression in the tumour (IHC) or a family history indicating MSH6 mutation.\n\n    PMS2 mutations lead to an attenuated phenotype with weaker family history and an older age of onset. Communicating cancer risk to PMS2 mutation carriers and deciding which surveillance protocol is adequate for the families is a difficult task for the genetic counsellor/geneticist. In this study, only 6 PMS2 families were included. While this is not enough families to be able to predict a PMS2 phenotype, it is important that the information is publicly available so that a PMS2 phenotype can be made in the future.\n\n    Lynch syndrome is a complex disease with variation in disease expression influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, as evidenced by differences in genotype-phenotype within and between families with the same mutations and by ethnicity and mutated MMR gene. To date, no worldwide genotype-phenotype correlation has been detected. Our data provides additional information to add to the genotype-phenotype spectrum for both MSH6 and PMS2 mutations. As approximately half of the clinically diagnosed HNPCC population can be classified as having Lynch syndrome (germline mutation in MMR genes), there are most likely other genomic regions that are also responsible for the disease. Future next-generation sequencing are likely to provide us with some answers by locating new genomic regions of interest, as shown by identification of the EPCAM deletion, but until the methodology is widely available the candidate gene approach in individual Lynch syndrome cohorts will help us in understanding the genotype-phenotype mystery.",

        "Title": "    Frequency of mutations in mismatch repair genes in a population-based study of women with ovarian cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations in genes for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) in ovarian cancer patients remains poorly defined. We sought to estimate the frequency and characteristics of HNPCC gene mutations in a population-based sample of women with epithelial ovarian cancer.\n\n    The analysis included 1893 women with epithelial ovarian cancer ascertained from three population-based studies. Full-germline DNA sequencing of the coding regions was performed on three HNPCC genes, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Collection of demographic, clinical and family history information was attempted in all women.\n\n    Nine clearly pathogenic mutations were identified, including five in MSH6, two each in MLH1 and MSH2. In addition, 28 unique predicted pathogenic missense variants were identified in 55 patients. Pathogenic mutation carriers had an earlier mean age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer, overrepresentation of cancers with non-serous histologies and a higher number of relatives with HNPCC-related cancers.\n\n    Our findings suggest that fewer than 1% of women with ovarian cancer harbour a germline mutation in the HNPCC genes, with overrepresentation of MSH6 mutations. This represents a lower-range estimate due to the large number of predicted pathogenic variants in which pathogenicity could not definitively be determined. Identification of mismatch repair gene mutations has the potential to impact screening and treatment decisions in these women.",
        "Introduction": "    It is estimated that 13% of all invasive ovarian cancer patients carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, and an additional proportion of patients carry mutations in genes that increase risk of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is an autosomal dominant syndrome of cancer predisposition of the colorectum, endometrium, stomach or ovaries associated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations. Other less frequent sites include cancers of the renal pelvis, ureter, small bowel, pancreas and brain. Patients may develop multiple primary cancers, and colorectal cancers are characterised by young age of onset. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is believed to account for 2-4% of unselected cases of colorectal cancer, but the fraction of ovarian cancer due to HNPCC is not well established. The lifetime risk of ovarian carcinoma in females carrying HNPCC mutations has been estimated to be up to 12%, with a recent report suggesting cumulative risks of 20% or higher for the MLH1 and MSH2 genes; however, risk may vary with the specific gene involved.\n\n    In most studies of HNPCC families to-date, MLH1 and MSH2 account for 80-90% of observed mutations in the MMR genes. However, most studies were clinic-based surveys of individuals tested based on clinical criteria, such as the Amsterdam criteria, and few included MSH6 testing. Mutations in MSH6 are infrequent in classical HNPCC families, and thus may have been underestimated in prior studies.\n\n    Identification of germline MMR genes enables individuals to benefit from up-to-date cancer risk management options as outlined in the NCCN guidelines. In fact, frequent colonoscopy has been shown to improve outcome. Furthermore, endometrial and ovarian cancer risk management options include both screening and prophylactic surgery, once childbearing is complete. In addition, preliminary studies in colorectal cancer suggest that knowledge of germline MMR gene mutations may provide an opportunity to refine cancer treatment.\n\n    The objective of the current study was to estimate the frequency of mutations in the three HNPCC genes in a population-based sample of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Secondary objectives included evaluation of demographic, clinical, histopathologic and family history characteristics of germline mutation carriers.",
        "Methods": "    Data for this study were drawn from three population-based studies of epithelial ovarian cancer: the Familial Ovarian Tumour Study (FOTS) in Toronto, the Tampa Bay Ovarian Cancer Study (TBOCS) at the Moffitt Cancer Center and the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS) at the Duke University, with details about study design, populations and data collection methods published previously. Briefly, FOTS cases were identified through monitoring of pathology reports submitted to the population-based Ontario Cancer Registry for province-wide recruitment. The TBOCS cases were recruited through a rapid case ascertainment mechanism in the two most populous counties in the Tampa Bay region. The NCOCS cases were identified through a rapid case ascertainment mechanism in a 48-county region located in the central portion of North Carolina. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each centre, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. There was no mechanism of rapid ascertainment in place to recruit the FOTS cases, in contrast to the TBOCS and NCOCS cases, which resulted in a longer time from diagnosis to ascertainment in the Toronto centre compared with the American centres.\n\n    Eligibility criteria for study enrolment included diagnosis of incident, pathologically confirmed primary epithelial ovarian cancer, either borderline or invasive, and age 20 years or above. Each study collected questionnaire data concerning demographic, clinical and family history information, and reviewed medical and pathology records for determining tumour histopathology. Specimen collection included blood for DNA extraction and analysis.\n\n    All 45 coding exons of the MLH1 (NM_000249.3), MSH2 (NM_000251.1) and MSH6 (NM_000179.2) genes were amplified and sequenced in 44 fragments in germline DNA. Primers were designed using Primer 3 software to cover at least 20 bp at each 5'- and 3'-side of the exons. The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced by using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Co., Foster City, CA, USA). Sequencing chromatograms generated by the analyser were examined for variant detection using Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics LLC., State College, PA, USA). All sequences were compared with the related NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) reference sequences for variant detection. The chromatograms of all the computationally determined variants were confirmed manually.\n\n    All insertions and deletions in the gene-coding regions, nonsense variants and variants located at the essential splice site sequences were considered as potentially pathogenic, and their DNA fragments were also sequenced in the reverse direction for confirmation. Insertions and deletions for which no functionality data were available were classified as 'unknown pathogenicity'. Missense variants first were searched in the colon cancer gene variant database (http://chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/colon_cancer/home.php) for functional effects. If functional effect was not known, we used Align-GVGD to predict the likely functional effect based on library alignments from human to pufferfish for MLH1 and MSH2. As no alignment data were available for MSH6 in the Align-GVGD website, a protein alignment was constructed for predicting the functional effect of MSH6 missense variants from MSH6 homologues in eight species (human, chimpanzee, dog, cow, pig, mouse, chicken, frog and zebrafish). Missense variants with class C45 and higher defined by Align-GVGD were classified as 'predicted pathogenic'. The class C45 was chosen as a cut-off point for Align-GVGD based on receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis using BRCA1 and BRCA2 missense variants with known functional effects reported in the Breast Cancer Information Core database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/projects/bic/) or Myriad's published data. The rationale for using BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations for the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was the limited sample size of known pathogenic missense mutations in the MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 genes. The chosen cut-off point corresponds to 90% specificity and 50% sensitivity. We also used PolyPhen2 and SIFT for predicting the functional effect of missense variants. We considered a missense variant as a predicted pathogenic if two of the three in silico tools (Align-GVGD, PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) predicted it as pathogenic and the carrier frequency of that mutation was less than 1% among 6481 study subjects of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500) (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).\n\n    All participants completed questionnaires by which demographic and family history information was obtained. Family history data included types and ages of cancer diagnoses in first-, second- and third-degree relatives. In addition, the FOTS data set included ages of relatives (current, or if deceased, age at death). Medical records were retrieved on all participants to abstract information on tumour histology. Information on date of diagnosis (based on pathology report) and date of study enrolment (based on date consent form was signed) were collected, to determine time between diagnosis and enrolment (calculated in days).\n\n    Site differences in descriptive statistics of clinical factors across the three sites were evaluated using analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables (e.g., time to diagnosis and attained age) and Pearson's chi2-tests for categorical variables. Similarly, clinical variables were compared across mutation subtypes (i.e., pathogenic, predicted pathogenic, predicted non-pathogenic, no mutation detected). Known benign polymorphic variants were combined with the 'no mutation' group. All reported P-values are two-sided. All analyses were carried out with SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\n    To compare the cumulative incidence of cancer among the first-degree relatives of proband carriers of different mutation subtypes, a survival analysis approach among the FOTS study subjects for whom we had detailed family history information was used. Each first-degree relative was considered as an observation and followed from birth until the occurrence of any type of cancer, death from another cause, or the date of the study interview, using the Cox proportional hazard model. Separate analyses were carried out for all cancer outcomes, all HNPCC cancer outcomes, colorectal cancer outcome and ovarian cancer outcome. Covariates for each observation included the proband's mutation status. Hazard ratios of mutation subtypes and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for each model.",
        "Results": "    In total, 1893 ovarian cancer patients were included, with 1521 from FOTS, 126 from TBOCS and 246 from NCOCS, as shown in Table 1. Overall, mean age at diagnosis and racial distribution were similar between sites, other than a higher proportion of Black subjects in the Duke sample. The median time between diagnosis and study enrolment was similar between the Duke and Moffitt cases, although longer for the Toronto cases because of the difference in participant ascertainment procedure. At all three sites, the majority of cancers were of serous histology. However, the proportion of non-serous cases was higher in the Ontario case than in the other two sites. Family histories of HNPCC-associated cancers were similar across the three sites.\n\n    Germline genetic testing of coding regions in the MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 genes revealed sequence changes at 161 different nucleotides. As shown in Table 2, nine pathogenic mutations were found, five in MSH6, two in MLH1 and two in MSH2. Four mutations were insertions or deletions and five were nonsense mutations. Seven of the nine pathologic mutations have been previously reported and each of the nine was seen in a single individual. We detected two additional changes of 'unknown pathogenicity' in MSH6: an in-frame deletion of two amino acids (MSH6 c.936_941delGAAAAG), not known to belong to any known functional protein domain, and a frame-shift insertion (MSH6 c.4065_4066insGTGA) at the C terminus that truncates two terminal amino acids. In addition, there were 101 missense variants (Supplementary Table 1), including 5 benign polymorphisms, and 96 unclassified variants (in 128 participants) and 49 silent variants (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, the frequency of pathogenic mutations was 0.5% (95% CI 0.2-0.8; Table 2). However, this frequency was 1.6% (95% CI 0.4-2.7) when considering only invasive cancers of the endometrioid and clear cell subtypes.\n\n    Through the Align-GVGD, PolyPhen and SIFT algorithms, pathogenicity was evaluated in the 96 unclassified variants, by which 28 unclassified variants (in 55 participants) were classified as 'predicted pathogenic' and 68 (in 99 participants) as 'predicted non-pathogenic'. To further evaluate our predictions of pathogenicity, we compared the penetrance among 9015 first-degree relatives of 1521 FOTS participants by mutation subtype. Results showed that cumulative risk to age 80 years of any cancer in those with pathogenic mutations was 56.7% compared with 44.2, 21.0 and 27.4% for those in the 'predicted pathogenic', predicted 'non-pathogenic', and no mutations groups, respectively. A similar result was seen for the risk of developing HNPCC-related cancer, but the difference between the groups did not reach customary statistical significance (Table 3). Cumulative risk of ovarian cancer among relatives of mutation carriers compared with relatives of non-carriers was not elevated, likely due to the limited number of relatives with ovarian cancer.\n\n    The average age of onset of ovarian cancer was 47.1 years in the 'pathogenic group' (Table 4) and 53.2 years in the 'predicted pathogenic group', compared with 56.1 years in those with no mutations. Non-serous cancers comprised 77.8% in the 'pathogenic group' and 66% in the 'predicted pathogenic group', compared with 41.9% in those with no mutations. The number of relatives with HNPCC-related cancers was highest in the 'pathogenic' group; however, findings in the other three groups indicated similar proportions. Of note, the proportion of mutations in the four mutation subgroups was similar across study sites (P=0.2). Specifically, the proportion of mutation carriers in the Moffitt, Duke and Toronto samples was 0.8%, 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, despite the longer time from diagnosis to enrolment in the Toronto cases.\n\n    Finally, review of family histories of those with pathogenic and predicted pathogenic mutations indicated the two families that met clinical criteria for HNPCC carried pathogenic MLH1 mutations. Furthermore, the two families with pathogenic MSH2 mutations had striking family histories, despite not meeting clinical criteria. All remaining families did not meet clinical criteria.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We determined the frequency of germline mutations in three MMR genes in a population-based sample of 1893 women with ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that pathogenic germline MMR mutations are found in less than 1% of unselected ovarian cancer cases, with a higher frequency in those with invasive cancers of the endometrioid and clear cell subtypes. Of the nine pathogenic mutations clearly identified, the majority (55%) were detected in the MSH6 gene.\n\n    The pathogenic mutations clearly identified in our study were classified based on protein truncation or on previous epidemiologic or functional studies. Our findings likely represent an underestimate of the true proportion, as there were several missense variants for which pathogenicity could not be definitively determined. Furthermore, we did not test for additional less common MMR genes (PMS2, EPCAM) or for large gene rearrangements, which may have detected additional pathogenic mutations.\n\n    For the many missense variants detected in the study, databases such as UniProt (www.uniprot.org) and Human Genome Mutation Database (www.hgmd.org) were explored to determine pathogenicity. Of note, UniProt, a protein database, had many errors in functional classification of missense variants and, thus, is unreliable for definitively determining the functional effect of individual variants. Similarly, the Human Genome Mutation Database, a manually curated database, classifies many missense mutations as disease-causing without providing compelling evidence from the literature to support the assignments. Consequently, we focused on bioinformatic tools to establish the pathogenicity of missense variants. Specifically, we used the Align-GVGD algorithm by means of a manually curated protein alignment across species of broad phylogenic scope in combination with a stringent cut-off point to predict the dysfunctional effect of a variant. This method outperforms other bioinformatic tools such as SIFT and PolyPhen2. However, we used the combination of these three tools for predicting the functional effect of the missense variants. We also looked at the carrier frequency of these variants in ESP6500 database and considered the frequently reported ones as predicted 'non-pathogenic'. We detected 28 missense mutations (in 55 participants) classified as 'predicted pathogenic' using these tools. Thus, if all of these are in fact pathogenic, the prevalence of MMR gene mutation carriers among ovarian cancer patients would be 3.6% or higher. Of note, we chose not use the MAPP-MMR tool (; which is another bioinformatics tool with no clear advantage to other tools), because it only predicts the functional effects in MLH1 and MSH2 genes, whereas over 40% of the missense variants identified in our sample were in MSH6. Furthermore, because of conflicting reports in the literature regarding pathogenicity of certain variants (e.g., MLH1 p.Lys618A1a, observed in 24 participants in our study, was previously reported as both non-pathogenic and pathogenic), we reported predictions of pathogenicity according to aforementioned criteria rather than based on prior published reports, which are in essence based on predictions.\n\n    Prior estimates of the frequency of germline MMR mutations in ovarian cancer patients have been less than 5%, based on studies of 116 patients or fewer and limited to the MLH1 and MSH2 genes only. Moreover, one of the studies was restricted to women aged 30 years or less at diagnosis. Thus, although our prevalence estimates are generally lower than prior reports, the validity and generalisability of our data is enhanced by the much larger sample size, performance of testing in all three genes (i.e., including MSH6) and inclusion criteria that encompassed a wider age group of participants.\n\n    Although most studies have focused on MLH1 and MSH2, several have reported ovarian cancer in the MSH6 tumour spectrum. However, in contrast to prior reports suggesting only 10% of HNPCC families harbour MSH6 mutations, such mutations accounted for over half of the clearly pathogenic mutations in our study. The low percentage of MSH6 mutations may be due to inadequate clinical criteria to accurately identify these families, who typically present with later age of colorectal cancer, and higher risk but later age of endometrial cancer in females. Thus, although infrequent in classical HNPCC families, our results suggest MSH6 mutations may be better represented in families with ovarian cancer. In fact, a recent study of 67 MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 mutation carriers ascertained through a family cancer clinic included 10 ovarian cancers, of which the majority were seen in MSH6 carriers, consistent with our study findings. Interestingly, none of the families with pathogenic MSH6 mutations in our study met clinical criteria for HNPCC. In contrast, both MLH1 families met clinical criteria, and both MSH2 families had striking family histories, despite not meeting clinical criteria. Of note, clinical criteria do not include cancers of the ovary and stomach, yet these cancers are much more common in HNPCC compared with those of the small bowel, ureter and renal pelvis, which are included. Ultimately, our study underscores the limitations of the use of HNPCC clinical diagnostic criteria based only on personal and family cancer history to identify MSH6 families.\n\n    Our results were consistent with prior reports, suggesting an earlier age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer in carriers (mean ranging from 41 to 49 years) compared with sporadic cases (mean ranging from 60 to 65 years). Moreover, our age of diagnosis ranged from 40 to 59 years, which suggests that prophylactic surgery offered before age 40 years is likely to prevent the majority of HNPCC-associated ovarian cancers. Furthermore, the overrepresentation of non-serous tumours, particularly of endometrioid and clear cell subtypes, reported in HNPCC is consistent with our findings. Finally, as in our prior studies, we used a cohort analysis to evaluate the Align-GVGD predictions. For example, if the predicted pathogenic mutations have the same penetrance, on average as the clearly pathogenic mutations, then we would expect to see cancer risks in first-degree relatives of patients in the two subgroups to be similar. In our study, although the penetrance of predicted pathogenic variants was slightly lower than the pathogenic variants, it was still consistently higher than the 'predicted non-pathogenic' and 'no mutation' groups, thus suggesting that many in this class are likely pathogenic. A deviation from this trend was seen in the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer illustrated in Table 3, which was lowest in the 'pathogenic mutation' group; however, this may be a spurious finding due to the limited number of relatives with ovarian cancer. Overall, the combined frequency of pathogenic and predicted pathogenic mutations was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9-4.6; Table 2). However, this frequency was 6.3% (95% CI 4.3-9.2) when considering only invasive cancers of the endometrioid and clear cell subtypes.\n\n    A number of strengths support the current study, including the large sample size, the population-based study design and comprehensive collection of clinical and demographic data. Despite these strengths, there remain some limitations, including our testing strategy that may have led to underestimating mutation frequency. Specifically, because of limited resources, large rearrangement testing was not performed, which may account for 10-20% of mutations in the MMR genes. Similarly, testing for the two additional MMR genes, which has recently become available (i.e., PMS2 and EPCAM) was also not performed in the current study. In addition, differences in demographic and clinical variables across sites (as reported in Table 1) could potentially affect our results. Notably, the time to diagnosis in FOTS cases was significantly longer than that for TBOCS or NCOCS, leading to overrepresentation of cases with longer survival in the FOTS data set. However, the main concern here is whether a longer time to diagnosis led to overrepresentation of mutation-positive cases in the FOTS data set, thereby biasing our mutation prevalence estimate. If this were true, the proportion of mutation-positive cases in the FOTS sample would be higher, which was not the case (as illustrated in Table 4). Therefore, it appears the longer time to diagnosis in the FOTS data set did not appear to substantially affect the mutation prevalence estimate. Nevertheless, the presence of survival bias within the FOTS data may have skewed the clinical characteristics within the overall data set as suggested by the higher proportions of non-serous cases observed. However, there remained an association between non-serous histologies and HNPCC mutations, which was likely underestimated because of the lower numbers of serous cases within the data set. Finally, we were limited in our ability to predict pathogenicity in many of the missense mutations because of sparse data available in the literature and mutation databases. To address this, we used an in silico approach to predict the dysfunctional effect of the detected missense variants, recognising that inherent inaccuracy of bioinformatics tools could result in some misclassification of the variants. However, our findings suggest that many are likely to be pathogenic based on similarities in the clinical and demographic characteristics with the pathogenic group (as shown in Tables 3 and 4).\n\n    In summary, we estimate that less than 1% of unselected ovarian cancer patients may have mutations in the MMR genes, with overrepresentation of MSH6 mutations in those with invasive cancers of the endometrioid and clear cell subtypes. Ovarian tumours with MMR-deficiency are characterised by early age of onset and overrepresentation of non-serous cancers. Our results suggest that current clinical criteria for HNPCC are insufficient to identify the majority of ovarian cancer patients with mutations. These findings highlight the need to consider HNPCC testing in women with ovarian cancer, particularly those with invasive cancers of the endometrioid and clear cell subtypes, even if they do not meet strict clinical criteria for the condition.\n\n    Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on British Journal of Cancer website (http://www.nature.com/bjc)\n\n    This work is published under the standard license to publish agreement.

        "Abstract": "    Reported prevalence, penetrance and expression of deleterious mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, may reflect differences in the clinical criteria used to select families for DNA testing. The authors have previously reported that clinical criteria are not sensitive enough to identify MMR mutation carriers among incident colorectal cancer cases.\n\n    To describe the sensitivity of the criteria when applied to families with a demonstrated MMR mutation.\n\n    Families with an aggregation of colorectal cancers were examined for deleterious MMR mutations according to the Mallorca guidelines. All families with a detected MMR mutation as of November 2009 were reclassified according to the Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria.\n\n    Sixty-nine different DNA variants were identified in a total of 129 families. The original Amsterdam clinical criteria were met by 38%, 12%, 78% and 25% of families with mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2, respectively. Corresponding numbers for the revised Amsterdam criteria were 62%, 48%, 87% and 38%. Similarly, each of the four clinical Bethesda criteria had low sensitivity for identifying MSH6 or PMS2 mutations.\n\n    Amsterdam criteria and each of the Bethesda criteria were inadequate for identifying MSH6 mutation-carrying kindreds. MSH6 mutations may be more common than currently assumed, and the penetrance/expression of MSH6 mutations, as derived from families meeting current clinical criteria, may be misleading. To increase detection rate of MMR mutation carriers, all cancers in the Lynch syndrome tumour spectrum should be subjected to immunohistochemical analysis and/or analysis for microsatellite instability.",
        "Introduction": "    The concept of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) was developed to denote families with inherited colorectal cancer (CRC). The Amsterdam (AMSI) criteria identified families with CRC. As extracolonic cancers, especially endometrial cancer, were shown to be part of the inherited syndrome, the revised Amsterdam criteria (AMSII) were introduced. The Bethesda guidelines included the tumour marker microsatellite instability (MSI), and the revised Bethesda criteria (BII) specified all cancers known at the time to be associated with the syndrome. Prostate cancer has recently been shown to possibly be part of the syndrome. Germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, have been identified to cause HNPCC (reviewed by Lynch and Lynch). However, it has become clear that not all families fulfilling the clinical criteria have an identifiable deleterious mutation (hereafter called 'mutation') in one of these genes. In addition, because MMR mutations confer an increased risk of several types of cancer in addition to CRC, it has been suggested that the term Lynch syndrome should replace HNPCC in families where a mutation has been detected. This definition of Lynch syndrome will be used in the present report. Families fulfilling the AMSII criteria without a demonstrable MMR mutation may be denoted HNPCC. Families with an aggregation of CRC and not corresponding to Lynch syndrome or HNPCC may be referred to as familial CRC.\n\n    Tumours caused by mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 show a high degree of MSI. It has been shown by immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) that the gene product from the mutated gene is absent in tumour tissue (reviewed by Vasen et al). IHC and MSI analysis have high sensitivity in detecting carriers of MMR mutations. It is now customary to examine tumours in families that fulfil clinical criteria by IHC/MSI analysis, and select those families with abnormal results for analysis of constitutional DNA. As a consequence, families not meeting the clinical criteria will not be subjected to mutation analyses.\n\n    Varying prevalence of mutations in the MMR genes has been reported. Some variations are obviously caused by geographically local and frequent founder mutations. It is, however, reasonable to assume that the criteria used to select families for testing may also have influenced the results.\n\n    Over the last two decades, Norwegian cancer genetic clinics have recruited families with an aggregation of cancers of any type. Thousands of cancer kindreds have been examined for hereditary cancer syndromes. Reports from this are listed on http://www.inherited-cancer.com. Upon referral, the families were classified using preset wide-ranging criteria, and IHC/MSI analyses were performed not only on the families that met the clinical criteria for HNPCC and familial CRC. We here report the sensitivities of the AMSI, AMSII and BII criteria when applied to families that were shown by genetic testing to have an MMR mutation. As Norwegian legislation dictates that genetic testing is restricted to clinical departments, and as all genetic departments collaborated in this report, we here present a complete report of all clinical genetic activity in a defined population up to November 2009.",
        "Methods": "    The initial material included all families investigated for inherited CRC in Norway until November 2009. Wide-ranging selection criteria were used to identify the families. Besides including all kindreds meeting the AMSII or BII criteria, we explored all families with four CRC cases irrespective of age and including skipped generations or with an aggregation of any cancer associated with Lynch syndrome. All activities were conducted as part of the healthcare system, all information was included in the patient files, all genetic testing was conducted according to national legislation, including genetic counselling before and after genetic testing, and all genetic testing was performed with written informed consent from the participants. All relevant diagnoses in the families were validated in the medical files or cancer registry after consent from relatives or descendants if the subject was dead. No research registry that included names was produced; only summarised data were taken from medical files for compilation of the present report. All information described has been disclosed to the patients/families, and family members were offered appropriate healthcare according to the Mallorca guidelines.\n\n    Upon referral and inclusion according to the wide-ranging criteria, families were subjected to examination for Lynch syndrome as described in the Mallorca guidelines, with IHC/MSI analysis of at least two affected family members if available, continuing to full mutation analysis of the relevant gene(s) of the patient (or obligate carrier in the family or offspring if dead) if an abnormal IHC result was obtained. A family was scored as having an abnormal IHC result if one or more tumour(s) showed lack of staining for the gene product of one or more of the MMR genes. Full mutation analysis of all MMR genes was performed if IHC was normal but the tumours were MSI (MSI-high). In some selected families, mutation analyses were also performed in the absence of MSI/abnormal IHC.\n\n    MMR mutation analyses included heteroduplex identification followed by DNA sequencing of the actual MMR gene(s). Analysis of gross deletions and duplications was performed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MLPA; SALSA P003 MLH1/MSH2, P008 MSH6/PMS2 and P072-MSH6; MRC-Holland, http://www.mrc-holland.com). Results for PMS2 exon 13-15 probes were disregarded because many related sequences are present in the genome and the probes provided very variable results. Sequencing analyses were performed on an ABI Genetic Analyzer model 3100 or 3130 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and DNA sequences were computed using SeqScape v2.5 software (Applied Biosystems). Primer and sequence details are available on request. In some cases of putative splice effects, cDNA analyses of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 were performed. The molecular analyses were performed according to standard procedures and manufacturers' instructions. Methods used varied over time and between the different laboratories involved. It was beyond our means to reanalyse the whole series so that one method was applied to all cases for the present report.\n\n    Reference sequences used were as follows (GeneBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank): MLH1, NT_022517 (transcript: NM_000249.2); MSH2, NT_022184 (transcript: NM_000251.1); MSH6, NT_0221844 (transcript: NM_000179.1); PMS2, AC005995.3 (transcript: BC093921.1). Detected DNA variants were checked against published mutations in the following websites: http://www.insight-group.org (LOVD: Leiden Open Variation Database), https://portal.biobase-international.com/hgmd/pro/start.php (Human Gene Mutation Database), Pub Med and http://www.med.mun.ca/MMRvariants. Mutations causing direct stop/nonsense, frameshifts, splice defects and large insertions/deletions were considered deleterious. Missense mutations or small in-frame deletions were subjected to segregation analysis when possible. If a review of the international databases or segregation analyses strongly suggested the variant to be deleterious, the mutations were scored accordingly. The reasons for scoring of each mutation are given in table 1. All other DNA variants were considered part of normal variation or the information available on the variant and family was insufficient for conclusive scoring. These variants were excluded from the report.\n\n    All families in which an MMR mutation (ie, with confirmed Lynch syndrome) had been detected were reclassified according to clinical criteria with the information obtained as of November 2009. Thus the classification does not reflect the starting point with the information at hand at referral, but rather the information obtained after having expanded all Lynch syndrome families and verified all relevant diagnoses for all family members in the medical files or cancer registry. The families were classified according to the AMSI, AMSII or BII criteria. Furthermore, the scoring for BII criteria was specified according to the subgroups given in Umar et al: BII_1 (CRC<50 years), BII_2 (synchronic/metachronic cancers), BII_4 (two affected relatives, one <50 years) and/or BII_5 (relatives with HNPCC-associated tumours). For precise definitions of groups as applied, see Umar et al. BII_3 includes MSI, which was a selection criterion for DNA analysis, and was not used to categorise mutation-carrying kindreds revealed this way. Also, MSI is a laboratory finding and not a clinical criterion. The combined BII criteria were possibly too close to our inclusion criteria for the total cohort studied, and scoring for the combined BII criteria could not be considered a result.",
        "Results": "    Sixty-nine different mutations were identified in a total of 129 families. Of these, 31 (45%) were detected in MSH2, 19 (27%) in MSH6, 15 (22%) in MLH1, and four (6%) in PMS2. Sixty-five (50%) of the families had a mutation in MSH2, 33 (26%) in MSH6, 23 (18%) in MLH1, and eight (6%) in PMS2. The total numbers of mutation carriers were 514, of whom 248 (48%), 146 (28%), 98 (19%) and 22 (4%) had a mutation in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2, respectively.\n\n    Frameshift mutations (n=24) and splice defects (n=18) were the most common aberrations. Other types of mutations were nonsense mutations creating new stop codons (n=13), large genomic (exon) deletions (n=8), in-frame deletions of three nucleotides (n=3) and missense mutations (n=3). There were no indications that the nature of mutations differed between the different genes, and no further statistical analyses based on the nature of the mutation were undertaken.\n\n    Details on the prevalence of each mutation are given in table 1. Forty-nine of the 69 mutations were exclusively found in one family. There were no mutations that were frequent enough to have a significant effect on the distributions observed between the different genes. The most recurrent mutation, MSH2 c.942+3A T, was found in 12 apparently unrelated families (49 people) from different geographical locations and has been described in other populations. It has possibly been introduced more than once into our population. The majority of the remaining recurrent mutations could be traced to confined geographical areas and were considered to be branches from a common origin (founder mutations). Families with deleterious PMS2 mutations were limited. One single mutation (c.989-1G T) accounted for the majority of PMS2 mutation-carrying kindreds, all from the same (small) area. Average numbers of demonstrated mutation carriers per family were similar for all mutations; details are shown in table 2.\n\n    Tumour tissue was available for IHC and MSI analysis for most of the families later demonstrated to have an MMR mutation. The IHC results are shown in table 1. All but five families showed abnormal IHC corresponding to the gene mutated. Tumours from three of five kindreds with the founder PMS2 splice variant, c.989-1G T, mentioned above expressed PMS2 normally but showed MSI (MSI-high). Similarly, tumour tissue from one family with a missense mutation in MLH1 (c.245C T (p.Thr82Ile)) showed normal IHC and MSI (MSI-high). Apparently normal expression of MLH1 indicated by IHC in MSI-high tumours is in agreement with another report. In the family with the c.1405delT, in MSH6, the tumour showed normal IHC and was microsatellite stable (MSS).\n\n    The mutation-positive families that fulfilled the various clinical criteria when reclassified are detailed in table 2. Thirty-eight per cent of MSH2 families, 12% of MSH6 families, 78% of MLH1 families and 25% of PMS2 families met the AMSI criteria. Corresponding sensitivity for the AMSII criteria for identifying mutations in the different genes were 62%, 48%, 87% and 38%. Similarly, each of the clinical Bethesda criteria had low sensitivity for identifying MSH6 and PMS2 mutations.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study in which all national activity was compiled, we found that most families with MLH1 mutations were identified by any of the clinical criteria used. The criteria that included extracolonic cancers (AMSII) identified two out of three MSH2 mutations, whereas MSH6 mutations were not identified with reasonable sensitivity by any of the single clinical criteria. As these results were obtained after expanding all mutation-carrying kindreds, we consider them to be maximum estimates. The sensitivities for detecting mutation-positive families upon referral were lower.\n\n    The most sensitive single clinical criterion for identifying MSH6 mutation carriers was the presence of two independent primary cancers (BII_2) (table 2). This information is, however, awaiting detailed validation of diagnoses in the families and may not be easily obtainable when interviewing a family member.\n\n    We have recently reported that, when applied to a consecutive series of unselected patients with CRC, the sensitivities of AMSII and BII criteria were as low as 25% and 50%, respectively. Moreover, awareness of hereditary cancer among clinicians involved in diagnosis and treatment of CRC is low, and families actually meeting the criteria may not be identified. These points highlight the challenges associated with using family history for detecting families with MMR mutations. Our combined findings support the suggestion by the Mallorca group to apply IHC and/or MSI analysis to all CRCs to identify MMR mutation carriers. As MSH6 mutation carriers are likely to develop extracolonic cancers, it may be justified to suggest that all cancer phenotypes associated with Lynch syndrome should be subjected to IHC and/or MSI analysis and subsequent DNA mutation analysis. Until such studies have been performed, we remain cautious when discussing the prevalence of MSH6 mutations. Correspondingly, the current estimates of penetrance/expression of MSH6 mutations may be (partly) derived from families fulfilling current clinical criteria. These estimates may be misleading, as they may reflect the criteria used to select the families from which the estimates were derived.\n\n    MLH1 mutations were less common than assumed from previous reports, and MSH2 mutations accounted for almost half of all kindreds with a mutation. Despite the fact that the criteria used were insensitive for detecting MSH6 mutations, the number of MSH6 mutation-carrying kindreds were higher than MLH1 mutation-carrying kindreds.\n\n    None of the mutations were common enough to affect the distribution significantly, with respect to neither number of mutation-carrying kindreds nor number of mutation-carrying people. Despite the difference in prevalence of mutations in the different genes, the mean number of mutation carriers per family was similar for all the genes.\n\n    A Danish study reported a relatively high prevalence of MSH6 mutations. If this were due to similarities between these neighbouring populations, we would have expected to detect founder mutation(s) in both populations, but this was not the case. The reason for the similar results may be the study designs. Both studies applied wide criteria for IHC and MSI analysis.\n\n    The number of carriers of PMS2 mutations was insufficient for sophisticated statistical analysis. Part of the explanation may be that testing for PMS2 mutations has not been available for as long as testing for mutations in the other genes. Also, most of the few PMS2 mutation carriers were included in several branches of one old family. Some of these branches were not identified by IHC, but the tumours displayed MSI (MSI-high). Thus, by performing only IHC and not MSI analysis to prescreen for mutation testing, a few mutations may have been missed. This indicates that MSI analysis is of importance if IHC shows normal expression of all MMR genes. MMR mutations cannot be excluded if neither analysis has been performed. Technical problems involved in DNA PMS2 mutation analyses are well known. Current procedures (including both technical aspects and clinical criteria) may be insufficient to detect PMS2 mutations, and current estimates of prevalence of PMS2 mutations may be too low.\n\n    IHC was used as a selection criterion for mutation analysis and could not be scored as a result. The result of all efforts to examine selected families without abnormal IHC or MSI for mutations was the identification of a single mutation-carrying family (family S254, MSH6 c.1405delT). The study was not designed to assess sensitivity of IHC/MSI, and we will not discuss this further. Our impression from other reports is, however, that IHC and MSI analyses are more sensitive than any clinical criteria for identifying kindreds carrying MSH2 or MSH6 mutations, in particular, and the present report is in keeping with that notion.\n\n    In conclusion, we observed that 87% of families with an MLH1 mutation, 62% with an MSH2 mutation, but less than half of families with an MSH6 or PMS2 mutation were identified by the AMSII criteria. Each of the clinical Bethesda criteria when considered individually also showed low sensitivity. We have, however, previously demonstrated that these criteria were neither sensitive nor specific in an unselected series of CRC cases. Our combined observations indicate that the prevalence of MSH6 mutations may be higher than currently assumed, and their penetrance and expression may differ from what is currently assumed. These findings are in keeping with the Mallorca guidelines, which recommend that MSI analysis and/or IHC should be performed on all CRCs. In addition, we suggest that such testing should be applied to all incident cancers in the Lynch syndrome tumour spectrum to increase the rate of detection of MMR mutation carriers.\n\n    Competing interests: None.\n\n    Contributors: Conception: WS, PM.

        "Title": "    Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency-associated brain tumors: report from the European C4CMMRD consortium",
        "Abstract": "    Malignant brain tumors (BT) are among the cancers most frequently associated with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD), a rare childhood cancer predisposition syndrome resulting from biallelic germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. This study analyzed data from the European \"Care for CMMRD\" (C4CMMRD) database to describe their clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcome with the aim of improving its diagnosis/treatment.\n\n    Retrospective analysis of data on patients with CMMRD and malignant BT from the C4CMMRD database up to July 2017.\n\n    Among the 87 registered patients, 49 developed 56 malignant BTs: 50 high-grade gliomas (HGG) (with giant multinucleated cells in 16/21 histologically reviewed tumors) and 6 embryonal tumors. The median age at first BT was 9.2 years [1.1-40.6], with nine patients older than 18. Twenty-seven patients developed multiple malignancies (including16 before the BT). Most patients received standard treatment, and eight patients immunotherapy for relapsed HGG. The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 30% (95% CI: 19-45) and 22% (95% CI: 12-37) after the first BT, with worse prognosis for HGG (3-year OS = 20.5%). Six patients were alive (median follow-up 2.5 years) and 43 dead (38 deaths, 88%, were BT-related). Other CMMRD-specific features were cafe-au-lait macules (40/41), multiple BTs (5/15), developmental brain anomalies (11/15), and consanguinity (20/38 families).\n\n    Several characteristics could help suspecting CMMRD in pediatric malignant BTs: giant cells on histology, previous malignancies, parental consanguinity, cafe-au-lait macules, multiple BTs, and developmental brain anomalies. The prognosis of CMMRD-associated BT treated with standard therapies is poor requiring new therapeutic up-front approaches.",
        "Introduction": "    CMMRD diagnosis is difficult in malignant brain tumors due to phenotypic overlaps.\n\n    Skin or brain anomalies and giant cell glioblastoma can guide towards CMMRD.\n\n    Prognosis of patients with CMMRD and brain tumor is poor and needs to be improved.\n\n    Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) is a cancer predisposition syndrome resulting from biallelic germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, leading to childhood malignancies. As CMMRD diagnosis is challenging in pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors, we analyzed data (personal and familial history, histological characteristics of the tumors, treatments, and outcome) concerning 49 patients with CMMRD and malignant brain tumors from the European C4CMMRD database to identify specific characteristics. This analysis allowed highlighting the following specific features that may guide practitioners: cafe-au-lait macules, high-grade gliomas (HGG) particularly those with giant multinucleated cells, asynchronous multiple brain tumors, developmental brain anomalies, and high rate of parental consanguinity. Most patients received standard treatments, and eight underwent immunotherapy for HGG at relapse. We also found that the prognosis of patients with CMMRD and brain tumor, especially HGG, is not good. We discussed new treatment and prevention strategies with immunotherapeutic approaches to improve their outcome.\n\n    Base substitution and insertion-deletion mismatches generated during DNA replication are corrected by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Germline mutations in one of the four MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) cause cancer predisposition. Heterozygous germline mutations in one of the four MMR genes cause Lynch syndrome which is associated with an increased risk of colorectal, gynecological, urinary tract, and other cancers during the fourth and fifth decades of life. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) (OMIM#276300), first described in 1999, is a rare autosomal recessive cancer predisposition syndrome caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous germline mutations in one of the four MMR genes. Patients with CMMRD may develop a large variety of neoplasms, including malignant brain, gastrointestinal tract, and hematologic tumors, most frequently in childhood and adolescence.\n\n    On account of its rarity, international collaborations have been put in place, such as the European \"Care for CMMRD\" (C4CMMRD) consortium and the International Biallelic Mismatch Repair Deficiency Consortium, to better identify and manage these patients. The European C4CMMRD Consortium was launched in Paris in 2013. It established and published diagnostic criteria and surveillance guidelines. Since the first reports, more than 200 patients with CMMRD and cancer have been described. International collaborations allowed increasing the knowledge on this syndrome, its phenotype, the pathophysiological mechanisms of tumor development, and potential therapeutic options. However, despite an increasing number of publications, CMMRD is still underdiagnosed. To increase awareness about the characteristics of malignant brain tumors in patients with CMMRD, we analyzed the data on patients with CMMRD and brain tumors collected in the database of the C4CMMRD consortium. In this study, we describe the family history, clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcome of these patients.",
        "Methods": "    The European C4CMMRD consortium includes pediatric oncologic centers in different European countries. Patients who may have CMMRD according to the diagnostic criteria established by the consortium are referred to the genetic clinics to perform a germline molecular analysis. All patients gave their informed consent before genetic testing, according to each country's legislation. Their clinical data and family history are retrospectively and prospectively collected in the C4CMMRD database.\n\n    Patients are considered to have CMMRD in the presence of i) biallelic pathogenic germline mutations in any of the four MMR genes, ii) monoallelic pathogenic germline mutation and variant of unknown significance (VUS) on the other allele, or iii) biallelic VUS in any of the four MMR genes. Loss of expression of one MMR protein by immunohistochemistry analysis in non-neoplastic cells, abnormal functional tests, and/or microsatellite instability in non-neoplastic tissue was mandatory for the diagnosis of CMMRD in patients with mono or biallelic VUS. After confirmation of the predisposition syndrome, patients are registered in the European C4CMMRD consortium database by the clinicians.\n\n    The study was approved by an institutional review board and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data on all patients with CMMRD and at least one brain tumor were extracted from the C4CMMRD consortium database. Clinical data, such as personal history of neoplasms, clinical features, detailed family history including a pedigree, tumor subtype, and type of treatment and response, were recorded. Histological diagnosis was performed according to the WHO guidelines available at diagnosis time. A histological review according to the 2016 WHO guidelines was performed using the available paraffin-embedded tumor sections, including hematoxylin-eosin-saffron (HES) staining for morphological description and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of PMS2, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 expression. A central review of the available presurgery brain MRI data was performed whenever possible.\n\n    Baseline values (i.e., at diagnosis) were expressed as medians and interquartile range for continuous variables, and as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using the nonparametric Student's t test, and categorical variables using the nonparametric chi-square test. Overall survival (OS) rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log rank method. OS rates were estimated from the date of diagnosis of the first malignancy or of the first brain tumor to death whatever the cause, or the date of the last follow-up. The 95% confidence interval (CI) values for survival rates were estimated with the Rothman method.",
        "Results": "    In total, 87 patients were registered in the C4CMMRD consortium database at the end of July 2017. Among them, 49 patients (56%; 26 females and 23 males) from 10 countries had at least one brain tumor, including 31 patients already described in previous studies.\n\n    Overall, 95 malignancies were diagnosed in these 49 patients: 56 central nervous system (CNS) malignant neoplasms, 21 Lynch syndrome-associated carcinomas, 15 hematological malignancies, and 3 sarcomas. One patient developed a meningioma within the radiation field more than 10 years after craniospinal irradiation. This tumor was most likely not related to the CMMRD syndrome. The median ages at onset of the first tumor and first brain tumor were 7 [1.1-22.6] and 9.2 [1.1-40.6] years, respectively. Nine patients developed their first brain tumor after the age of 18 years.\n\n    Twenty-seven patients (55%) had multiple malignancies (median: two tumors per patient), including two patients who developed five sequential cancers. Sixteen patients had 21 malignancies (10 gastrointestinal tumors, 9 hematologic malignancies, 2 sarcomas) before the first brain tumor, and 11 patients had another malignancy after the brain tumor. Seven patients (patients 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 32, and 34) developed two distinct malignant brain tumors with a median interval of 1.5 years [range 0.4-17.9] between tumors. In this series, only one patient had his brain tumor identified by screening after a first hematological malignancy (patient 19). Table 1 summarizes the clinical data of this series.\n\n    These patients belonged to 38 nuclear families. Consanguinity was reported in 20/38 (53%) families. In 16 families, siblings developed a CMMRD-associated malignancy, and in nine families more than one child had a brain tumor.\n\n    Histological diagnosis of the 56 malignant CNS tumors according to the WHO 2016 guidelines could not be provided in all cases because only 26/56 cancers could be histologically reviewed. According to the histological report at diagnosis, all 56 CNS neoplasms were malignant: high grade gliomas (HGG) (n = 50; 89%) and embryonal tumors (n = 5 medulloblastomas and n = 1 supra-tentorial tumor, formerly named \"primitive neuroectodermal tumor\"). HGGs were further classified in glioblastoma (n = 40), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 5), oligodendroglioma (=3), anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (n = 1), and anaplastic ganglioglioma (n = 1). No low grade lesion was reported, but for one meningioma.\n\n    The histological review of the 26 available tumor samples (Table 2) identified them as glioblastoma with wild type IDH except for one (patient 4.B) (n = 21), anaplastic astrocytoma with wild type IDH (n = 3; among which two had unusual angiocentric features), anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (n = 1), and anaplastic ganglioglioma (n = 1). Most of these gliomas displayed a particular pleomorphic appearance, and five were classified as giant cell glioblastomas (Figure 1A). Eleven glioblastomas included few giant multinucleated cells, but not enough to be considered as classic giant cell glioblastoma (Figure 1B), and only five did not have any giant cell. IHC results on MMR protein expression were available for 23 tumors and showed in all cases complete loss of expression of at least one MMR protein in the tumor and in normal cells that matched the genetic testing results (Table 2).\n\n    Presurgery brain MRI images were available for 15 patients. Brain developmental vascular anomalies were detected in 11 patients, but none was associated with cavernoma. Vascular abnormalities were visible on the enhanced T1 sequences (Figure 2a-d). They were located in the cerebellum (n = 4 patients) and in the supratentorial region (n = 7 patients), but not adjacent to the brain tumor. The radiological review indicated that five patients presented multiple brain tumors with asynchronous development at diagnosis (Figure 2e). Tumors were located in the parietal (n = 5), frontal (n = 5), temporal (n =4), and occipital (n = 2) brain lobes. No focal area of signal intensity was observed in this series.\n\n    Except for one, all patients with CMMRD and available clinical data (40/41) had cafe-au-lait macules (CALM) (2 to 10 macules). One patient had a giant hyperpigmented lesion, and 9/21 patients also presented hypopigmented skin macules. A plexiform neurofibroma was reported in 4 of the 18 patients with data on the presence of neurofibroma. Nineteen patients underwent colonoscopic examination at a median age of 16 years [range 9-24] before or after the brain tumor diagnosis, and all had at least one adenoma. Moreover, hepatic adenoma was detected in one patient.\n\n    Genetic screening for MMR gene variants in all patients with tumors (Table 1) showed the presence of biallelic pathogenic germline mutations (n = 33 patients), monoallelic pathogenic germline mutation and VUS on the other allele (n = 3 patients), and biallelic VUS (n = 13 patients). The diagnosis of CMMRD was confirmed in all patients with VUS by functional tests results and/or loss of expression of the MMR protein in non neoplastic cells (Supplementary Material). The affected MMR genes were: PMS2 (n = 27 patients), MSH6 (n = 12 patients), MSH2 (n = 6 patients), and MLH1 (n = 4 patients). The mutation in one of the MMR genes was homozygous in 29 children with CMMRD (22 families: 20 families with consanguinity and 2 without reported consanguinity) and compound heterozygous in 20 patients (16 families).\n\n    Data on tumor treatment were available for 45 patients and 50 tumors. Most patients received standard treatment that combined surgery, whenever possible (47/50), with radiotherapy (39/50) and various chemotherapy protocols (34/49). No unusual treatment-related toxicity was reported.\n\n    Moreover, eight patients received immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibodies for HGG at relapse. Disease progression was observed in seven of these patients within the first 2 months of immunotherapy (1 to 4 injections), and six of them died at 5.2 months [1.8-9.5] after the first injection. Two patients were still alive, one with progressive disease after immunotherapy discontinuation (follow-up: 8.6 months), and the other one was still on treatment.\n\n    The outcome of the entire series is summarized in Figure 3. The median follow-up from the date of diagnosis of the first brain tumor was 1.5 years [0-18.7]. Only six patients (including patient 19, who had his brain tumor identified by screening) were still alive with a median follow-up of 2.5 years [1.8-15] after the diagnosis of the first brain tumor among whom five were in complete remission (2.3 and 15 years after the diagnosis of medulloblastoma for two patients; 1.8, 2.1, and 3 years after the diagnosis of glioblastoma/anaplastic astrocytoma for the other three). The last patient who developed glioblastoma was still alive but with progressive disease. Overall, 43 (88%) patients died at a median age of 13.2 years [3.5-42]. Death was related to the first brain tumor in 31 patients (median survival of 11 months after diagnosis [2-108]), to a second brain tumor in seven patients, and to another cancer in five (hematological malignancy in three, and digestive adenocarcinoma in two patients).\n\n    The patients' outcome was evaluated by assessing the survival of each patient after the first brain tumor (Figure 4A), and after the first tumor (any type) (Figure 4B). Overall, the 3- and 5-year OS rates after the first brain tumor (n = 49) were 30% (95% CI: 19-45) and 22% (95% CI: 12-37) (Figure 4A). The 3- and 5-year OS rates were much lower in patients with HGG [20.5% (95% CI: 11-36) and 17% (95% CI: 8-32), respectively] than in patients with embryonal tumors [5-year OS rate: 60% (95% CI: 38-96)] (log rank: 0.0049). Among the six patients with embryonal tumor, only one child died due to her medulloblastoma at 3.7 years after diagnosis. Three patients died of a subsequent glioblastoma or of hematological malignancy.\n\n    The 5-year OS rate after the first tumor (any type) (n = 49) was 43% (95% CI 30-58). Comparison of the 5-year OS rate according to the type of first tumor (brain tumor versus any other tumor type) showed that it was significantly lower if the first tumor was a brain tumor (n = 33) [5-year OS = 28% (95% CI: 15-46)] compared with any other tumor type (n = 16) [5-year OS = 74.5% (95% CI: 50-90)] (log rank: 0.0092) (Figure 4B).",
        "Conclusion": "    CMMRD diagnosis is still challenging in patients with a pediatric malignant brain tumor, also due to the phenotypic overlap between NF1 and CMMRD. Nevertheless, specific features and a family history of cancer often in the context of consanguinity and/or affected siblings may guide the clinician. The prognosis of patients with a CMMRD-related brain tumor (especially glioblastoma) is not as good as originally thought. Therefore, treatment and prevention need to be improved, including immunotherapies and new upfront therapeutic approaches.",
        "Discussion": "    This detailed description of a large series of patients with CMMRD and at least one brain tumor using data collected by an international consortium shows that patients had a wide variety of cancers (brain, gastrointestinal and hematologic malignancies), as previously reported for other CMMRD series. As expected, malignant brain tumors were mostly HGGs, but we also observed embryonal tumors, including five medulloblastomas. Although medulloblastoma is not a frequent tumor in CMMRD, it represented 17% of all malignant brain tumors in our series. Therefore, it is very striking that a recent study on a large medulloblastoma sample (n = 1022) did not find any patient with biallelic germline mutations in MMR genes. As already reported, other rare malignant glial tumors, such as anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, and anaplastic ganglioglioma, were also observed. The outcome of CMMRD-associated brain tumors was poor (5-year OS = 22%), especially in patients with HGG. The 3-year OS of 20.5% for patients with glioblastoma is worse than the previously reported 3-year OS rate for pediatric glioblastoma without cancer predisposition syndrome (30%).\n\n    Since the first reports on patients with CMMRD, international collaborative research projects have considerably increased the knowledge on tumor characteristics and evolution. However, despite the delineation of clinical criteria that should raise the suspicion of CMMRD, which should entail molecular genetic diagnosis, CMMRD is still underdiagnosed in pediatric patients with a malignant brain tumor. From this series, we can highlight the following features that could guide the clinician towards the possible presence of CMMRD, thus justifying additional investigations on MMR proteins/genes by IHC and/or appropriate microsatellite instability analysis, functional assays, and MMR gene mutation analysis:\n\n    CALM: Except one, all patients had CALM that led to the initial misdiagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in some cases. In addition, plexiform neurofibroma was reported in four patients. This phenotypic overlap between NF1 and CMMRD, mostly based on skin pigmentation alterations, has been described previously. As malignant brain tumors are rare in NF1, CMMRD is a valid differential diagnosis in children with malignant brain tumor and a phenotype reminiscent of NF1. The correct diagnosis of the underlying disease must be based on the identification of a clearly pathogenic germline NF1 or MMR gene mutation in these children.\n\n    HGG with giant cells: Histological analysis highlighted that many gliomas were characterized by a malignant glial heterogeneous population with giant multinucleated and pleomorphic cells. When pleomorphic cells were abundant, tumors were identified as giant cell glioblastomas, in accordance with the WHO guidelines. This specific feature, already described in malignant HGG with germline MMR gene mutations, justifies the diagnostic work-up for CMMRD with at least IHC analysis of MMR proteins in the tumor and adjacent normal tissues, especially when found in \"ultramutated\" glioblastomas. However, we must stress that normal expression of all MMR proteins does not exclude the diagnosis of CMMRD in highly suggestive cases, as reported for some patients with CMMRD and missense MSH6 mutations.\n\n    Radiological findings of metachronous multiple brain lesions and/or brain vascular malformations: Patients with CMMRD may have multiple different tumor lesions (5/15 patients in our series). This feature has already been described at diagnosis in few case reports. Patients with CMMRD may also have non-neoplastic congenital brain malformations, usually asymptomatic. In contrast to the low reported incidence of brain developmental vascular anomalies in the general population (2.6%-6.4%), our radiological data on 15 patients with CMMRD and brain tumor highlighted a high rate (73%) of brain vascular anomalies, not adjacent to the brain tumor and not related to the tumor treatment. We suggest that this feature should be added to the current scoring system with the other brain malformations (corpus callosum agenesis and nontherapy-induced cavernoma), as indication criteria for CMMRD genetic testing in patients with cancer.\n\n    Family history of cancer, affected siblings, and/or consanguinity.\n\n    Although our knowledge on CMMRD-related tumor development and sensitivity to treatments has improved, specific therapeutic strategies are limited and often based on case report studies. In this series, the different therapeutic strategies often combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, in function of the time of diagnosis and tumor extension. Unlike other DNA damage repair syndromes, no excessive toxicity after chemoradiation therapies was observed, as already reported. The real impact of temozolomide, frequently used in the standard glioblastoma treatment, cannot be specifically studied. Nevertheless, it has become clear that, due to the strong resistance of MMR-deficient cells to alkylating anti-neoplastic agents, temozolomide is less effective in MMR-deficient tumors, and might even provide a growth advantage to tumor cells. Therefore, this drug should be avoided in patients with CMMRD. The hypermutated phenotype related to CMMRD could offer opportunities for new therapeutic approaches as MMR-deficient tumors are more responsive to PD-1 inhibition than MMR-proficient tumors. There is growing evidence that immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, prolong survival in patients with CMMRD with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma and in patients with MMR-deficient noncolorectal cancer (objective response rate of 71%). Information on our small group of eight patients who received immunotherapy at HGG relapse was very limited because most of them were included in a clinical trial, limiting access to data. However, in our patients, immunotherapy efficacy was slightly disappointing compared with the initial publications. This finding may be related to the advanced disease at the moment of such treatment.\n\n    To conclude, we still recommend surgical resection of the malignant brain tumor followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy not based on temozolomide. However, we think that upfront immunotherapy after the initial resection at the time of radiotherapy might represent a better option for these patients and should be evaluated.\n\n    The early identification of CMMRD and tumor prevention are probably the most important elements in the context of a tumor predisposition syndrome with high penetrance. Genetic counseling should give clear information on the risk in siblings and on the Lynch syndrome-associated cancer risk for the wider family. As patients with CMMRD are at high risk of developing multiple cancers, they should undergo regular cancer surveillance according to the guidelines recently published in consensus papers. Indeed, very early detection of asymptomatic tumors can facilitate their complete resection. Nevertheless, cancer surveillance does not guarantee cancer detection at a curable stage, and the development of preventive treatment strategies would be a major step forward. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are considered to be cancer-preventive mainly due to their antiproliferation and apoptosis-inducing activities and have been shown to reduce the colorectal cancer risk in patients with Lynch syndrome. Although the use of aspirin has been suggested for cancer prevention in patients with CMMRD, its efficacy has not been proven and the potential benefit has to be balanced with the hemorrhagic risk, especially in patients with frequent brain developmental vascular anomalies. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors also could be an attractive preventive strategy in healthy carriers of biallelic MMR gene mutations. It has been hypothesized that combining checkpoint inhibitors with neoantigen-based vaccines could increase the potential of immunotherapies. Although the safety and efficacy of such vaccines remain to been proven, these approaches are very promising.",

        "Title": "    Deep single-cell RNA sequencing data of individual T cells from treatment-naive colorectal cancer patients",
        "Abstract": "    T cells, as a crucial compartment of the tumour microenvironment, play vital roles in cancer immunotherapy. However, the basic properties of tumour-infiltrating T cells (TILs) such as the functional state, migratory capability and clonal expansion remain elusive. Here, using Smart-seq2 protocol, we have generated a RNA sequencing dataset of 11,138 T cells isolated from peripheral blood, adjacent normal and tumour tissues of 12 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, including 4 with microsatellite instability (MSI). The dataset contained an expression profile of 10,805 T cells, as well as the full-length T cell receptor (TCR) sequences of 9,878 cells after quality control. To facilitate data mining of our T cell dataset, we developed a web-based application to deliver systematic interrogations and customizable functionalities (http://crctcell.cancer-pku.cn/). Functioning with our dataset, the web tool enables the characterization of TILs based on both transcriptome and assembled TCR sequences at the single cell level, which will help unleash the potential value of our CRC T cell data resource.\n\n    Machine-accessible metadata file describing the reported data (ISA-Tab format)",
        "Introduction": "    CRC is among the common causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While immune checkpoint blocking antibodies (ICBs) have shown impressive clinical benefits in cancers, their benefits are highly uneven among CRC patients. Remarkably, only CRC patients with MSI showed pronounced responses to ICBs, while patients with microsatellite stability (MSS) derived no benefit. The underlying mechanisms of such discrimination remain elusive. T cells play vital roles in killing malignant cells and are associated with responses to ICB-treatment. It is thus important to understand the cellular underpinnings of TILs in CRC.\n\n    Single cell transcriptome analysis has become a compelling approach to decipher the properties of TILs, due to its ability to quantify gene expression and assemble TCR sequences simultaneously. In our recent Nature paper, we have performed single cell RNA sequencing of 11,138 T cells isolated from peripheral blood, adjacent normal and tumour tissues of 12 treatment-naive CRC patients (Fig. 1a and Table 1), and developed STARTRAC (single T cell analysis by RNA sequencing and TCR tracking) indices to analyse the dynamic relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets. Here, we provide the detailed description of our dataset and present a webserver to deliver comprehensive and customizable analyses.\n\n    The dataset contained an average of 1.25 million uniquely mapped read pairs per cell, with an average mapping rate of 96.6% (Online-only Table 1). After quality control, we obtained an expression profile of 12,547 genes for 10,805 cells, with an average of 3,182 genes detected per cell (Online-only Table 1). The expression data could be used to elucidate the expression distributions of genes including those currently pursued as immunotherapy targets in clinical trials (Fig. 2a), illuminating the potentially modulated T cell populations with different immunotherapies. Furthermore, the dataset can serve as a resource for further T cells exploration including the identification of novel regulatory mechanisms by depicting the specific expression patterns of transcription factors (Fig. 2b).\n\n    TCR sequences, composed of alpha- and beta-chains, play major roles in the selection and activation of T cells. Both alpha- and beta-chains contribute to the determination of TCR antigen specificity, and different T cells with the same TCR could be functionally distinct. To uncover information about T cell ancestry and clonality, we obtained full-length TCR sequences of 91.4% (9,878/10,805) cells with at least one pair of productive alpha-beta chains after eliminating non-productive alleles or low-abundance TCRs (Fig. 3a and Supplementary File 1). Accordingly, T cells with identical TCRs were defined to be from the same clonotype, and a total of 7,274 clonotypes were obtained (Supplementary File 1). Indeed, a strong correlation was observed between the recurring frequencies of alpha-chains and that of beta-chains, indicating a common ancestral cell of origin (Fig. 3b).\n\n    The TCR sequences can be utilized to delineate TCR sharing patterns of both inter/intra-tissues and inter/intra-clusters (Fig. 3c), shedding light on the properties of T cells including clonal expansion, developmental transition and cross-tissue migration. Furthermore, TCR sequences, as well as the transcriptome data elucidating T cell functions, could serve as a data resource for the discovery of antigen specificity in therapeutic applications.\n\n    In our related work, we have revealed important insights of the T cell biology based on STARTRAC indices. For instance, tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory and dysfunctional T cells showed mutually exclusive developmental transition patterns, suggesting a TCR-based cell fate decision. In addition, we found that a special subset of IFNG+ TH1-like T cells with CXCL13+BHLHE40+ were preferentially enriched in MSI tumours, which might contribute to the favourable responses of MSI patients to ICBs.\n\n    While some discoveries have been made, the unprecedented data resource of CRC T cells is still attractive to many biologists. To facilitate data mining of our T cell dataset, we developed iSTARTRAC (the interactive platform of STARTRAC), a web server to deliver customizable functionalities for further T cell investigation. iSTARTRAC provides key functions including cluster visualization, gene expression demonstration, differential expression analysis, TCR sharing illustration and discrimination of differences between MSI and MSS patients (Fig. 4).\n\n    The comprehensive and customizable analyses with simple clicking through iSTARTRAC could greatly facilitate data reuse in the field of cancer immunology, and the accompanying scientific discussion will further expedite the process of therapeutic discovery and understanding the mechanism of immunotherapies with respect to T cell functions.",
        "Methods": "    These methods are expanded version of descriptions in our related work, which provided detailed descriptions of experimental procedures including human specimens, single cell collection, cell sorting, reverse transcription, amplification and sequencing, and those of computational processing including quality control, data processing, TCR assembly, unsupervised clustering and definition of STARTRAC indices. While most part of the methods described here was cited from that report, we specifically aim to emphasize the samples and the methods used to generate the single cell RNA-seq data.\n\n    Twelve patients with CRC were enrolled and pathologically diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma at Peking University People's Hospital. All patients in this study provided written informed consent for sample collection and data analyses. This study was approved by the Research and Ethical Committee of Peking University People's Hospital and complied with all relevant ethical regulations.\n\n    The patients included eight with MSS (P0701, P1012, P1207, P1212, P1228, P0215, P0411 and P0309) and four with MSI (P0123, P0909, P0825 and P0413) status. Among these 4 MSI patients, 3 had positive lymph nodes (P0123, P0413 and P0909), two of them had poorly-differentiated disease (P0825 and P0909), and none of them had distal metastasis. There were eight females and four males, and the median age of diagnosis was 67, ranging from 35 to 82. Among these 12 patients, one was diagnosed at stage I, five at stage II, five at stage III, and one at stage IV, which was classified according to the guidance of AJCC version 8. None of them were treated with chemotherapy or radiation prior to tumour resection. The available clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\n\n    Fresh tumour and adjacent normal tissue samples (at least 2 cm from matched tumour tissues) were surgically resected from the above-described patients. Patients P0701, P0909, P1212, P1228, P0215, P0411, P0413, P0825, P0123 and P0309 had peripheral blood and paired tumour and adjacent normal tissues, whereas patients P1012 and P1207 had only fresh tumour tissue and matched peripheral blood.\n\n    Tumours and adjacent normal tissues were cut into approximately 1-mm3 pieces in the RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sciencell), and enzymatically digested with MACS Tumour Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min on a rotor at 37  C, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The dissociated cells were subsequently passed through a 40-microm cell-strainer (BD) and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min. After the supernatant was removed, the pelleted cells were suspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (Solarbio) and incubated on ice for 2 min to lyse red blood cells. After washing twice with PBS (Invitrogen), the cell pellets were re-suspended in sorting buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% FBS). PBMCs were isolated using HISTOPAQUE-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) solution as previously described. In brief, 3 ml of fresh peripheral blood was collected before surgery in EDTA anticoagulant tubes and subsequently layered onto HISTOPAQUE-1077. After centrifugation, lymphocyte cells remained at the plasma-HISTOPAQUE-1077 interface and were carefully transferred to a new tube and washed twice with PBS. Red blood cells were removed via the same procedure described above. These lymphocytes were re-suspended in sorting buffer.\n\n    Single-cell suspensions were stained with antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD25 (anti-human CD3, UCHT1; anti-human CD4, OKT4; anti-human CD8, OKT8; anti-human CD25, BC96; eBioscience) for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), performed on a BD Aria III instrument. Single cells of different subtypes including cytotoxic T (TC) cells, T helper (TH) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells were enriched by gating 7AAD-CD3+CD8+, 7AAD-CD3+CD4+CD25-/+ and 7AAD-CD3+CD4+ CD25++ T cells, respectively, and sorted into 96-well plates (Axygen) chilled to 4  C, prepared with lysis buffer with 1 microl 10 mM dNTP mix (Invitrogen), 1 microl 10 microM Oligo dT primer, 1.9 microl 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and 0.1 microl 40 U microl-1 RNase Inhibitor (Takara). The single-cell lysates were sealed and stored frozen at -80  C immediately. Single-cell transcriptome amplifications were performed according to the Smart-Seq2 protocol. The External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC; Ambion; 1:4,000,000) was added into each well as the exogenous spike-in control before the reverse transcription. The amplified cDNA products were purified with 1x Agencourt XP DNA beads (Beckman). A procedure of quality control was performed following the first round of purification, which included the detection of CD3D by qPCR (forward primer, 5'-TCATTGCCACTCTGCTCC-3'; reverse primer, 5 primer, 5'-TCATTGCCACT) and fragment analysis by analyser AATI. For those single-cell samples with high quality after quality control (cycle threshold <30), the DNA products were further purified with 0.5x Agencourt XP DNA beads, and the concentration of each sample was quantified by Qubit HsDNA kits (Invitrogen). Multiplex (384-plex) libraries were constructed and amplified using the TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina (Vazyme Biotech). The libraries were then purified with Agencourt XP DNA beads and pooled for quality assessment by fragment analyser. For all the 12 patients, purified libraries were analysed by an Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer with 150-bp pair-end reads. For patient P1207, only CD8+ T cells were collected due to the temporary lack of CD4 antibody.\n\n    Genomic DNA of peripheral blood and tissue samples of patients with CRC were extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's specification. The concentrations of DNA were quantified using the Qubit HsDNA Kits (Invitrogen) and the qualities of DNA were evaluated with agarose gel electrophoresis. Exon libraries were constructed using the SureSelectXT Human All Exon V5 capture library (Agilent). Samples were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencer with 150-bp paired-end reads.\n\n    OpalTM multi-colour immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were performed with antibodies of rabbit anti-human CD3 (Abcam, clone SP7, 1:400), mouse anti-human CD8 (Abcam, clone 144B, 1:500), rabbit anti-human CD4 (Abcam, clone EPR6855, 1:400) and mouse anti-human FOXP3 (Abcam, clone mAbcam22510, 1:500) to validate the existence of infiltrating TC, TH and Treg cells in tumour tissues. The specimens were collected and prepared for the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues sections as previously mentioned. Antigen was retrieved by AR9 buffer (pH 6.0, PerkinElmer) and boiled in the oven for 15 min. After a pre-incubation with blocking buffer at room temperature for 10 min, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with aforementioned antibodies. A secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (PerkinElmer) were added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Signal amplification was performed using TSA working solution diluted at 1:100 in 1x amplification diluent (PerkinElmer) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The multispectral imaging was collected by Mantra Quantitative Pathology Workstation (PerkinElmer, CLS140089) at 20x magnification and analysed by InForm Advanced Image Analysis Software (PerkinElmer) version 2.3. For each patient, a total of 8-15 high-power fields were taken based on their tumour sizes.\n\n    DNA purified from tumour tissues using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) was subjected to multiplex fluorescent PCRbased assay (Promega) by amplifying seven loci including five mononucleotide repeats (NR21, BAT26, BAT25, NR24 and Mono27) and two pentanucleotide repeats (PentaC and PentaD) and was compared with DNA extracted from matched adjacent normal tissues. Multiplex PCR products were analysed by ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    Low-quality read pairs of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were filtered out if at least one end of the read pair met one of the following criteria: (1) 'N' bases account for >=10% of the read length; (2) bases with quality <5 account for >=50% of the read length; and (3) the read contains adaptor sequence. The filtered read pairs were processed using HTSeqGenie pipeline (R package version 4.8) to obtain the gene expression table. Specially, read pairs were then mapped to human ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences (download from RFam database) and the read pairs with both ends unmapped were kept for downstream analysis. Read pairs passing this filter for rRNA were aligned to human reference sequence (hg19) using GSNAP, with parameters '-novelsplicing 1 -n 10 -i 1 -M 2'. To calculate the expression levels of genes, the gene model file 'knownGene.txt' (30 June 2013 version), downloaded from UCSC, was used. The R function findOverlaps was used to count the number of uniquely mapped read pairs located in each gene and the count table tabulated as genes by cells was used for downstream analysis. The transcripts per million (TPM) table was derived from the count table and the TPM value was calculated bywhere Cij is the count value of gene i in cell j. It should be noticed that the TPM here is a simplified version based on the hypothesis that all mapped reads are approximate the same length.\n\n    Low-quality cells were filtered if the library size or the number of expressed genes (counts larger than 0) was smaller than predefined thresholds. Both thresholds were defined as the medians of all cells minus 3x the median absolute deviation. Furthermore, if the proportion of mitochondrial gene counts was larger than 10%, these cells were discarded. Only cells with the average TPM of CD3D, CD3E and CD3G larger than 10 were kept for subsequent analysis. We further identified CD4+, CD8+, CD4-CD8- (double negative) and CD4+CD8+ (double positive) T cells based on the gene expression data. Given the average TPM of CD8A and CD8B, one cell was considered as CD8 positive or negative if the value was larger than 30 or less than 3, respectively; given the TPM of CD4, one cell was considered as CD4 positive or negative if the value was larger than 30 or less than 3, respectively. Hence, the cells can be in silico classified as CD4+CD8-, CD4-CD8+, CD4+CD8+, CD4-CD8- and other cells that cannot be clearly defined.\n\n    While TPM is an intuitive and popular measurement to standardize the total number of transcripts between cells, it is insufficient and could bias downstream analysis because TPM can be dominated by a handful of highly expressed genes. Therefore, we mainly used TPM for preliminary data processing and gene expression visualization. Recently, methods for normalizing scRNA-seq data including scran have been proposed to implement robust and effective normalization, and thus we used the size-factor normalized read count for main analyses in our study including dimensionality reduction, clustering and finding markers for each cluster.\n\n    After discarding genes with average counts of fewer than or equal to 1, the count table of the cells passing the above filtering was normalized by a pooling strategy. We applied the R package scran in Bioconductor to perform the normalization process. Specifically, cells were pre-clustered using the 'quickCluster' function with the parameter 'method = hclust'. Size factors were calculated using 'computeSumFactors' function with the parameter 'sizes = seq (20,100,by = 20)' which indicates the number of cells per pool. Raw counts of each cell were divided by their size factors, and the resulting normalized counts were then scaled to log2 space and used for batch correction.\n\n    Scran utilizes a pooling strategy implemented in 'computeSumFactors' function, in which size factors for individual cells were deconvoluted from size factors of pools. To avoid violating the assumption that most genes were not differentially expressed, hierarchical clustering based on Spearman's rank correlation was performed with 'quickCluster' function first, then normalization was performed in each resulting cluster separately. The size factor of each cluster was further re-scaled to enable comparison between clusters.\n\n    To remove the possible effects of different donors on expression, the normalized table was further centred by patient. Thus, in the centred expression table, the mean values of the cells for each patient were zero. A total of 12,548 genes and 10,805 cells were retained in the final expression table. If not explicitly stated, 'normalized read count' or 'normalized expression' in this study refers to the normalized and centred count data for simplicity.\n\n    The cell clusters used here were the same as defined in our related Nature paper. The expression tables of CD8+CD4- T cells and CD8-CD4+ T cells as defined by the aforementioned in silico classification but excluding MAIT cells and iNKT cells, were fed into an iteratively unsupervised clustering pipeline separately. Specifically, given expression table, the top n genes with the largest variance were selected, and then the expression data of the n genes were analysed by single-cell consensus clustering (SC3). n was tested from 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000. In SC3, the distance matrices were calculated based on Spearman correlation and then transformed by calculating the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Then the k-means algorithm was applied to the first d eigenvectors multiple times where d was chosen from 4% to 7% of the total number of input cells. Finally, hierarchical clustering with complete agglomeration was performed on the SC3 consensus matrix and k clusters were inferred. The SC3 parameters k, which was used in the k-means and hierarchical clustering, was tried from 2 to 10. For each SC3 run, the silhouette values were calculated, the consensus matrix was plotted, and cluster specific genes were identified. Such information was used to determine the optimal k and n. Once the stable clusters were determined, the above procedure was iteratively applied to each of these clusters to reveal the sub-clusters. After obtained the stable clusters by SC3, we further redefined the cluster labels of indeterminate cells with the silouatte values less than zero by R package XGBoost. The training datasets were composed of cells with the silouatte >0, while cells to be reclassified with the silouatte <0 were then redefined to clusters with the largest predicting score. The in silico classified CD8+CD4- MAIT cells had distinct gene expression patterns compared with other CD8+CD4- T cells, and were defined as cluster \"CD8_C08-SLC4A10\".\n\n    When the clustering results were obtained, one-way ANOVA implemented by R function aov was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes among the clusters. R function TukeyHSD was used to identify which cluster pairs showed a significant difference. A gene was defined as being significantly differentially expressed based on the following criteria: 1) adjusted P-value (Benjamini-Hochberg method) of F test less than 0.05; 2) the absolute difference of any one significant cluster pair (P-value of Tukey's 'Honest Significant Difference' method less than 0.01) larger than 1. The significantly differentially expressed genes were categorized in the cluster that showed the highest expression.\n\n    The t-SNE method implemented in R package Rtsne was used for clustering visualization. To visualize the cell density on the t-SNE plot, kernel density estimation was performed using R function kde (ks package), and the contour lines encompassing the top 10%, 20%, ...90% cells with highest densities were shown. A total of 8,530 T cells, including 3,628 CD8+CD4- and 4,902 CD8-CD4+ T cells with clustering definitions, were used in the t-SNE projection. Other cells such as CD8+CD4+ and CD8-CD4- T cells were not included in this visualization.\n\n    The bulk exome sequencing data were cleaned following the same procedure for the scRNA-seq data processing. The cleaned read pairs were then processed according to the BWA-Picard/ Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)-Strelka pipeline. In brief, the cleaned read pairs were aligned to human genome reference version b37 (downloaded from ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org:/bundle) by the BWA-MEM algorithm. The alignments were then sorted and de-duplicated by Picard (Broad Institute). GATK was used to realign multiple reads around putative INDEL by Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm and re-calibrate base quality. The analysis-ready bam files were input into the GATK UnifiedGenotyper module to call SNP/INDEL and into Strelka to call somatic SNV/INDEL and into ADTEx (version 1.0.4) to call somatic copy number alterations. The mutations were annotated with ANNOVAR.\n\n    TraCeR was used to deduce the TCR sequences of each cell. The outputs of TraCeR include the assembled nucleotide sequences for both alpha and beta chains, the coding potential of the nucleotide sequences (that is, productive or not), the translated amino acid sequence, the CDR3 sequences and the estimated TPM value of alpha or beta chains. Only cells with TPM values larger than 10 for the alpha chain and larger than 15 for the beta chain were kept. For cells with two or more alpha or beta chains assembled, the alpha-beta pair that was productive and of the highest expression level was defined as the dominant alpha-beta pair in the corresponding cell. If two cells had identical dominant alpha-beta pairs, the dominant alpha-beta pair was identified as clonal TCRs.\n\n    To integrate with the gene expression data, the TCR-based analysis was performed only for cells that passed the aforementioned quality control pipeline (total 10,805). Thus, 9,878 cells with TCR information were used in the integrative analysis (Supplementary File 1). If one cell had an alpha chain composed of V segment TRAV1-2 and one of the following J segments (TRAJ33, TRAJ20 and TRAJ12), the cell was classified as a MAIT cell. If the alpha chain of one cell was rearranged by V segment TRAV10 and J segment TRAJ18, the cell was classified as an invariant natural killer T cell. In the 9,878 cells with at least one pair of productive alpha and beta chains, only 3 cells were identified as invariant natural killer T cells, and 102 cells were identified as MAIT cells, including 71 CD8+CD4- T cells classified in silico.\n\n    We present STRATRAC as a framework, defined by four indices, to analyse different aspects of T cells based on paired single cell transcriptomes and TCR sequences. The first index, named as STARTRAC-dist (STARTRAC-distribution), utilizes the ratio of observed over expected cell numbers in tissues to measure the enrichment of T cell clusters across different tissues. Given a contingency table of T cell clusters by tissues, we first apply Chi-squared test to evaluate whether the distribution of T cell clusters across tissues significantly deviates from random expectations. We then calculate the STARTRAC-dist index for each combination of T cell clusters and tissues according the following formula:where Ro/e is the ratio of observed cell number over the expected cell number of a given combination of T cell cluster and tissue. The expected cell number for each combination of T cell clusters and tissues are obtained from the Chi-squared test.  can indicate whether cells of a certain cluster are enriched (Ro/e > 1) or depleted (Ro/e < 1) in a specific tissue.\n\n    The other three STARTRAC indices, STARTRAC-expa (STARTRAC-expansion), STARTRAC-migr (STARTRAC-migration) and STARTRAC-tran (STARTRAC-transition), are designed to measure the degree of clonal expansion, tissue migration, and state transitions of T cell clusters upon TCR tracking, respectively. The MAIT cells were not included in these types of analyses because they have distinct TCRs. For STARTRAC-expa, which uses the standard TCR clonality measurement but is specifically applied to different T cell clusters in our analyses, we first adopt the normalized Shannon entropy to calculate the evenness of the TCR repertoire of the given T cell cluster and then define the STARTRAC-expa index as 1-evenness. Mathematically, the STARTRAC-expa index of a specific cluster with N clonotypes is defined by the following formula:where pi is the cell frequency of clonotype i in the cluster, and a clonotype is defined by identical, full-length, paired alpha and beta TCR chains. STARTRAC-expa ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no clonal expansion for each clonotype while 1 indicating that the cluster is composed of only one clonally expanded clonotype, with high STARTRAC-expa indicating high clonality.\n\n    For T cells with identical TCR clonotypes, even if they are present in different tissues or in different development states, logically they could be likely derived from a single naive T cell, clonally expanded initially at one location and migrated across tissues or have undergone state transitions. Based on this principle, we define STARTRAC-migr and STARTRAC-tran to evaluate the extent of tissue migration and state transition of each clonotype, respectively. For each clonotype, given its distribution across tissues (peripheral blood, adjacent normal mucosa and tumour), we define its STARTRAC-migr index  as:where  is the ratio of the number of cells with TCR clonotype t in tissue j to the total number of cells with TCR clonotype t and . For two T cell clusters with similar clonal expansion and clonal size, the one with clonal cells broadly distributed in various tissues would likely be more mobile. Similarly, its STARTRAC-tran index  can be defined as:where  is the ratio of the number of cells with TCR clonotype t in cluster k to the total number of cells with TCR clonotype t, , and K is the total number of cell clusters. The input of STARTRAC-migr is the observed cell frequency across tissues of a certain clonotype, while the input of STARTRAC-tran is the observed cell frequency across cell clusters of a certain clonotype. By contrast, the input of STARTRAC-expa is the observed cell frequency across clonotypes of a certain cell cluster, and the input for the traditional TCR clonality measure is the observed sequence frequency across a TCR repertoire of a given sample.\n\n    After the extent of tissue migration of each clonotype is quantified by STARTRAC-migr, given a cluster with total T clonotypes, the STARTRAC-migr index at the cluster level  can be defined as the weighted average of all TCR clonotype migration indices contained in the cluster:where  is the ratio of the number of cells with clonotype t in cluster cls to the total number of cells in cluster cls.\n\n    Similarly, when the extent of state transition of each clonotype is quantified by STARTRAC-tran, given a cluster with total T clonotypes, the STARTRAC-tran index at the cluster level can be defined as the weighted average of all TCR clonotypes state transition indices contained in the cluster:where  is the ratio of the number of cells with clonotype t in cluster cls to the total number of cells in cluster cls.\n\n    Besides the overall evaluation of the extents of migration and state transitions by STARTRAC-migr and STARTRAC-tran, we also define pairwise STARTRAC-migr (pSTARTRAC-migr) and STARTRAC-tran (pSTARTRAC-tran) indices for precise quantification. For example, given a clonotype t and two tissue types (e.g., blood and tumour), the pSTARTRAC-migr index  is calculated by the following formula:where  is the ratio of the number of cells with TCR clonotype t in tissue j to the total number of cells with TCR clonotype t in tissues 1 and 2 (i.e., blood and tumour), and . In other words, pSTARTRAC-migr uses the same formula as STARTRAC-migr but limits the number of tissues to two and the frequencies of cells between two specified tissues are re-calculated. Likewise, given a clonotype t and two T cell clusters (e.g., TEM and TEX), the pSTARTRAC-tran index  is calculated by the following formula:where  is the ratio of the number of cells with TCR clonotype t in cluster k to the total number of cells with TCR clonotype t in clusters 1 and 2 (i.e., TEM and TEX), and . Thus, pSTARTRAC-tran uses the same formula as STARTRAC-tran but limits the number of clusters to two and the frequencies of cells between the two specified clusters are re-calculated. Once pairwise STARTRAC-migr and STARTRAC-tran for clonotypes are obtained, the corresponding indices for clusters are calculated via weighted average according to their clonotype compositions.\n\n    For all the 12 patients, a total of 35.5 G raw reads and 5.4 T raw bases were obtained after sequencing. After preprocessing, we obtained 32.5 G high-quality reads with an average high-quality rate of 91.3% (Online-only Table 1). Accordingly, we summarized the data processing procedures and tools used in each step in a flowchart, consisting of quality control filtering, TCRs assembly, expression quantification, data normalization and downstream analyses (Fig. 1b).\n\n    As described in our related research paper, the raw sequencing data have been deposited in the European Genome-phenome Archive database under study accession id EGAS00001002791 and dataset accession id EGAD00001003910, which are available in FASTQ file format upon request and approval. The DATA ACCESS AGREEMENT is provided at https://github.com/zhangyybio/single-T-cell-data-access. Applicants can request access to the data by directly downloading it or by sending an email to cancerpku@pku.edu.cn. The process that is used to approve an application includes verifying the institution, participants and research purposes of the application, and the authorization by EGA. In general this process will take about two weeks. In principal, any academic research institutions complying with the laws and bioethic regulation policies of China will be approved. The publication moratorium described in the Data Access Agreement officially expires concurrent with publication of this Data Descriptor. The processed gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession id GSE108989. The clinical data recording available clinical characteristics of the collected 12 CRC patients are summarized in Table 1 and the genomic features are summarized in Table 2 and Online-only Table 2. Online-only Table 3 lists the DNA fragment sizes of short tandem repeat loci from tested patients in microsatellite instability testing experiment. Basic statistics of single cell sequencing data are provided in Online-only Table 1. The cluster information and TCR typing data are presented in Supplementary File 1, which has also been uploaded to Figshare.\n\n    OpalTM multi-colour IHC staining were performed with anti-CD3, CD8,CD4, and FOXP3 antibodies to validate the existence of infiltrating TC, TH and Treg cells in tumour tissues (Fig. 5a).\n\n    Exome sequencing of bulk tumours from 12 patients showed that four patients harboured mutations in TP53 and five patients harboured mutations in APC/FBXW7. These genomic alterations were consistent with the characteristics of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Summarized tables were provided for the statistics of somatic mutations (Table 2) and selected cancer-associated somatic mutations (Online-only Table 2) that were detected in these patients.\n\n    Among the 12 CRC patients, 4 patients (P0123, P0909, P0825 and P0413) showed deficient in DNA mismatch repair based on IHC testing of four markers (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2), which was also supported by the much higher mutation load (Table 2). To further confirm the MSI status of these patients, we performed microsatellite instability testing by multiplex fluorescent PCR-based assay. Indeed, we found that 4 tumours from MSI patients were characterized by MSI-H phenotypes with two or more mononucleotide loci showing instability (Online-only Table 3).\n\n    Quality control procedure was performed following the first round of purification of amplified cDNA products, including the detection of CD3D by qPCR and fragment analysis. For single cell samples with high quality (cycle threshold <30), the DNA products were further purified and the concentration of each sample was quantified (Fig. 5b). The constructed multiplex libraries were purified and pooled for quality assessment (Fig. 5c).\n\n    Quality control analyses revealed that the raw sequence data were of high quality, with an average high-quality rate of 91.3% (Online-only Table 1). We assessed the qualities of clean data by statistics of per sequence quality scores and per sequence GC contents. For each sequence, an average of 87.9% bases have a quality score higher than phred quality 30 (Q30), and 94.5% bases have a quality score higher than phred quality 20 (Q20) (Online-only Table 1). In addition, the GC contents of each sample showed a similar normal distribution, with a mean value of 46.2% (Fig. 5d and Online-only Table 1). These statistics indicated that high-quality RNA-seq reads were obtained for downstream analysis.\n\n    To evaluate the accuracy of FACS, we examined the expression of conventional marker genes of T cell subsets, including CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD8A, CD8B, CD4, IL2RA and FOXP3 (Fig. 5e). While dropout event is prevalent and challenging in single cell RNA-seq data, the gene expression levels of classical T cell markers were consistent with protein levels measured by FACS. Specifically, all T cells were characterized by high expression of CD3 genes (CD3D, CD3E and CD3G). Most TC cells expressed high-level of CD8 (CD8A, CD8B) but low-level of CD4, whereas TH cells and Tregs exhibited the opposite pattern. Tregs showed high expressions of IL2RA encoding transmembrane protein CD25 and regulatory transcription factor FOXP3 compared with TH cells (Fig. 5e). Therefore, the expression patterns of classic T cell markers confirmed the reliability of T cell subtypes.\n\n    To facilitate reuse of our T cell dataset and broaden the user community, we developed a web server and will use the following sections to elaborate the design and functionalities provided by iSTARTRAC. iSTRATRAC is available at http://crctcell.cancer-pku.cn/.\n\n    Although we have provided an online portal at http://crc.cancer-pku.cn to depict gene expressions, only limited functionalities were presented, hindering the wide usage of our data. Here, to facilitate further exploration of our T cell data, we have developed a much enhanced web server iSTARTRAC to enable the comprehensive and customizable analyses.\n\n    The iSTARTRAC website is deployed on server with 64GB RAM and CPU Gold 6149 x 16 cores running the Ubuntu (version 16.04.4) Linux (version 4.4.0) operating system. The interface is constructed using the Shiny web application framework (version 1.2.0) in R (version 3.5.0) running on the Shiny-server (version 1.5.6.875).\n\n    iSTARTRAC is freely available to all users with no login requirement, and can be accessed by most web browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer. The website automatically adjusts the look and feel according to different browsers and devices, but Google Chrome is recommended to achieve the best visualization.\n\n    In each module of iSTARTRAC, four categories of basic options are available for modulating the input samples of interest, including Cluster, Cell Type, Tissue Type and Patient. The Cluster icon consists of 20 clusters including 8 for CD8+ T cells and 12 for CD4+ T cells, and the Cell Type icon is composed of five cell types including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD4+ CD25- T cells, CD4+ CD25+ T cells and CD4+ CD25++ T cells defined by FACS. Peripheral blood (P), adjacent normal (N) and tumour infiltrating (T) are included in the Tissue Type icon. The Patient icon contains eight MSS patients, as well as four MSI patients.\n\n    Moreover, iSTARTRAC presents interactive sliders that can be adjusted to change the dot sizes and line widths to achieve optimal visualization of the plots. Plots are regenerated on-the-fly as the user changes sliders or samples, providing an interactive experience that makes it possible to perform customizable analyses.\n\n    iSTARTRAC provides key interactive and customizable functions including cluster visualization, gene expression demonstration, differential expression analyses between clusters or cell types, TCR sharing illustration, customizable analysis of STARTRAC indices and discrimination of differences between MSI and MSS patients (Fig. 4).\n\n    iSTARTRAC dynamically demonstrates the tSNE plot of cell clusters for user-defined T cells derived from given cell clusters, tissue origins, cell types and patients (in the 'tSNE Plot' tab). In addition, an annotation table of basic information of T cells is shown and users are allowed to download the table by clicking the DOWNLOAD button (in the 'Table' tab).\n\n    In this module, iSTARTRAC interactively plots expression distribution of a given gene in different clusters according to user-defined sample selections. The results can be presented in tSNE plot (in the 'tSNE Plot' tab), violin plots (in the 'Violin Plot' tab), or box plots (in the 'Box Plot' tab).\n\n    iSTARTRAC performs differential expression (DE) analyses and identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between any two given clusters (in 'Cluster DEG' tab) or cell types (in 'Cell Type DEG' tab), illustrating the results in volcano plots. Single cell transcriptome data is exceptionally appropriate for dissecting the intrinsic cellular heterogeneity. In addition to the commonly used unsupervised clustering, pairwise gene expression distribution, a simple and effective approach similar to FACS with proteins, can also be utilized to detect cell subpopulations. Accordingly, iSTARTRAC allows users to input a pair of genes to dynamically compartmentalize cell subpopulations and performs differential expression analysis for any two subdivided populations (in 'in silico FACS' tab). Users can adjust the thresholds of low/high-expression, as well as the significance thresholds of fold change and p-values after multiple testing adjustments. Furthermore, summary tables of signature gene for CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are provided and can be downloaded (in 'Table' tab).\n\n    For any user-defined frequency of clonal cells, iSTARTRAC provides a tSNE plot to illustrate the distribution of clonal cells in each cluster, with non-clonal cells (cells harbouring TCRs with a frequency below the defined threshold) coloured in grey as background (in 'tSNE Plot' tab). The enormous TCR repertoire, which is essential for recognising foreign antigens and tumour neoantigens, could serve as tags to track T cell lineages. Accordingly, iSTARTRAC plots a heatmap to depict the TCR sharing patterns of various clusters enriched in different tissues (in 'TCR Sharing' tab), providing the clues of cross-tissue migration and state transition. In addition, iSTARTRAC presents bar plots to show the clonotype statistics of user-defined samples (in 'Clonotype Statistics' tab). A summary table of TCR typing is displayed and can be downloaded, which contains the information of TCR sequences and corresponding samples (in 'Table' tab).\n\n    For given samples, iSTARTRAC dynamically illustrates the STRATRAC-dist indices to dissect the tissue preference of T cell clusters, yielding a discrete enrichment table decorated with colours (in 'STARTRAC-dist' tab). Users are allowed to adjust the thresholds for discretizing enrichment levels quantified by Ro/e (the ratio of observed over expected cell numbers in tissues to measure the enrichment of T cell clusters across different tissues). To reveal dynamic relationships of T cell subsets with respect to clonal expansion, migration and development transition, iSTARTRAC plots STRATRAC-expa/migr/tran indices for samples of user interest (in 'STRATRAC-expa/migr/tran' tab). Furthermore, pairwise STRATRAC-migr (in 'pSTRATRAC-migr' tab) and pairwise STRATRAC-tran (in 'pSTRATRAC-tran' tab) could also be dynamically illustrated according to user defined sample selections.\n\n    With this module, users can delineate differences in term of cell compositions (in 'Cell Percentage' tab), STARTRAC indices (in 'STARTRAC-expa/migr/tran' tab) and gene expressions (in 'DEG Analysis' tab) between MSI and MSS patients for user-specified dataset of interest.\n\n    The compendium dataset provided here, was produced primarily to illustrate the dynamic relationships of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in CRC, including functional states, clonal expansions, migrations and developmental transitions.\n\n    The dataset can be further utilized to detect the transcript isoforms, non-coding transcripts and the potential splice variants. The differential isoform usages of T cell subtypes will shed new light on the underlying regulatory mechanisms of phenotypic differentiation and will provide opportunities for immuno-oncology modulation by determining the subtype specific expression of known and novel isoforms in TILs.\n\n    In addition, our dataset could serve as a resource for the comparison of different library preparation methods such as Smart-seq2 protocol and 10X platform, providing specific features of RNA-seq data produced with Smart-seq2 protocol.\n\n    The interactive platform, iSTARTRAC, could be explored by experimental biologists to dissect regulatory mechanisms of T cell differentiation, identify novel targets of immunotherapy, as well as to compare the differences of T cell compositions, gene expressions and STARTRAC indices between MSI and MSS patients. The comprehensive and customizable analyses with simple clicking through iSTARTRAC will facilitate data mining in cancer immunology community and help unleash the potential value of our CRC T cell data resource.",

        "Title": "    Germline mutations in the proof-reading domains of POLE and POLD1 predispose to colorectal adenomas and carcinomas",
        "Abstract": "    Many individuals with multiple or large colorectal adenomas, or early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC), have no detectable germline mutations in the known cancer predisposition genes. Using whole-genome sequencing, supplemented by linkage and association analysis, we identified specific heterozygous POLE or POLD1 germline variants in several multiple adenoma and/or CRC cases, but in no controls. The susceptibility variants appear to have high penetrance. POLD1 is also associated with endometrial cancer predisposition. The mutations map to equivalent sites in the proof-reading (exonuclease) domain of DNA polymerases epsilon and delta, and are predicted to impair correction of mispaired bases inserted during DNA replication. In agreement with this prediction, mutation carriers' tumours were microsatellite-stable, but tended to acquire base substitution mutations, as confirmed by yeast functional assays. Further analysis of published data showed that the recently-described group of hypermutant, microsatellite-stable CRCs is likely to be caused by somatic POLE exonuclease domain mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Mutations in at least 10 genes are responsible for Mendelian syndromes associated with colorectal cancer. For some of these genes (APC and MUTYH), the primary predisposition is to multiple adenomas, the benign precursors of many colorectal cancers (CRCs). For other genes (STK11/LKB1, SMAD4, BMPR1A and GREM1), CRC risk is mediated through the development of hamartomas or mixed polyps; and for yet other genes (MSH2, MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2), there is usually no great number of polyps and early-onset CRC or endometrial cancer is the usual presentation. The functions of these 10 genes vary, although it is notable that four encode (MSH2, MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2) encode DNA mismatch repair proteins and a fifth (MUTYH) codes for a glycolsylase that effects base excision repair (MUTYH). There exists a set of patients who appear a priori to have a strong chance of carrying a high-penetrance CRC predisposition allele, but who have no mutations in these genes. One such group of patients is characterised by multiple adenomas, typically 10-100 in number, often presenting before the age of 60 and frequently progressing to CRC unless treated. Some of these individuals come from extensive CRC pedigrees, but many have no significant family history of colorectal tumours.\n\n    As part of the Oxford-Illumina WGS500 project, we undertook whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 15 probands who had been diagnosed with at least 10 colorectal adenomas by 60 years of age (Supplementary Table 1). For three probands, a relative with more than 5 adenomas was also sequenced, and for one proband two additional affected relatives were sequenced. Eight of the 20 sequenced individuals had developed colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and all of the remainder had a first-degree relative with CRC. Known Mendelian cancer syndromes had reportedly been excluded previously in the clinical diagnostic setting, by mutation screening for APC, MUTYH and the mismatch repair genes, together with microsatellite instability (MSI) testing and immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins in some cases. The pedigrees of the 15 families showed a degree of heterogeneity in their phenotypes and patterns of inheritance, and we anticipated that this might reflect underlying genetic heterogeneity.",
        "Methods": "    All cases and controls were UK residents and had self-reported European ancestry. For most individuals, large-scale genotyping data were available that allowed ethnic clustering with HapMap CEU samples to be checked. None of the groups described below overlapped. All studies were performed with UK national ethical committee approval (MREC/06/Q1702/99).\n\n    These were obtained from the COloRectal tumour Gene Identification (CORGI) study . The study has recruited through Clinical Genetics Departments from throughout the United Kingdom since 1999 and has to date enrolled 1,698 families. General eligibility criteria for the study are given below. Discovery Phase cases were selected from among the set of CORGI probands for a disease phenotype that was most strongly reminiscent of a high-penetrance predisposition. We specifically enriched for multiple tumours and/or an early age of presentation and/or multiple family members with CRC or adenomas. Formal criteria were not set owing to the impossibility of weighing these different features against each other and the heterogeneity of clinical data (for example comparing an individual who had had fewer adenomas but also a colectomy against one who had more adenomas but only polypectomies). Our prioritisation resulted in the identification of a set of 15 unrelated individuals who had been diagnosed with >=10 colorectal tumours before the age of 60 years (Supplementary Table 1). All individuals had CRC or a first- or second-degree relative with CRC, but they were not otherwise selected for family or personal history of other tumour types. All individuals had been screened for APC and MUTYH mutations by their local Genetics service and Lynch syndrome had been screened by microsatellite instability and/or mismatch repair protein expression in tumours and/or direct MSH2, MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2 mutation testing. DNA from these samples and 5 additional family members was sequenced across the entire genome as part of the Oxford University-Illumina WGS500 collaboration.\n\n    Multiple adenoma cases comprised 271 individuals who had developed >=5 colorectal adenomas at any age, irrespective of family history of colorectal tumours. Germline APC and MUTYH mutations had been excluded. These individuals were recruited principally from St Mark's Hospital, London and were included in the study irrespective of other personal or family history. The mean number of adenomas was 16 (range 4-65), mean age of presentation was 54 (range 23-80); 21% had had CRC and 31% reported a family history of CRC.\n\n    CORGI cases comprised 1,476 individuals from the COloRectal tumour Gene Identification study . All recruits had developed CRC at age <=80, and/or \"significant\" colorectal adenoma(s) that fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: >=3 in number; severe dysplasia; villous histology; and presentation at <45 years of age. All adenoma-only cases (N=503) had a first or second degree relative with CRC. Mean age of participants was 58 years (range 18-80).\n\n    National Study of Colorectal Cancer Genetics (NSCCG) CRC cases (N=300) were selected from the main NSCCG study to be aged <55 at diagnosis and to have at least one first-degree relative affected with CRC. The main NSCCG study recruited any individual with CRC from Oncology clinics throughout the United Kingdom .\n\n    Whole-genome sequencing case data were obtained using the Complete Genomics platform  from 198 CRC cases previously selected for early age of presentation and family history from the CORGI and NSCCG studies.\n\n    VICTOR/QUASAR2 samples comprised 1,560 cases from the VICTOR and QUASAR2 clinical trials of stage II/III CRC treated with curative intent . VICTOR was a post-primary therapy randomised controlled trial of rofecoxib and QUASAR2, a randomised trial of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil+-bevacizumab. The mean age of patients derived from these trials was 61 years (range 44-70).\n\n    These samples comprised the following non-overlapping collections, all comprising white individuals from the United Kingdom.\n\n    CORGI controls were 1,666 spouses/partners of CORGI cases and reported no personal or family history of colorectal tumours.\n\n    1958 Birth Cohort sequencing set controls  (N=300) had undergone whole-exome sequencing.\n\n    Population controls (N=3,812) were obtained from the population-based, publicly-available 1958 Birth Cohort and National Blood Service  sample sets.\n\n    GLACIER controls without cancer (N=943) were derived from the GLACIER study of lobular breast cancer predisposition and were cancer-free spouses, partners or friends (E. Sawyer, I. Tomlinson, R.Roylance, unpubl.).\n\n    Although not used for primary statistical comparisons, additional population-based control data were derived from the Exome variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project).\n\n    These comprised the following collections, all comprising white individuals from the United Kingdom\n\n    386 cases with primary carcinoma of the endometrium and without a family history of CRC were derived from the National Study of Endometrial Cancer Genetics (NSECG) that recruited white UK cases with endometrial cancer under the age of 70 years old .\n\n    WGS data for POLE, POLD1 and other variants within regions of linkage  were validated by bi-directional Sanger sequencing using standard methods (details available from authors) and variants identified both automatically and manually in the Mutation Surveyor (Soft Genetics) program. For screening the Validation Phase samples, we designed KASPar  allele-specific SNV primers for POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N (Supplementary Figure 6), and included two known variant samples in each run in order to facilitate genotype clustering (details available from authors). All potential L424V and S478N variants detected were subsequently checked by bi-directional Sanger sequencing. For screening the full exonuclease domains of POLE (codons 269-471) and POLD1 (codons 304-517), bi-directional Sanger sequencing was used (details available from authors).\n\n    mRNA was extracted from pelleted untransformed lymphocytes from one patient from SM1645 and two patients from SM 2702 using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. RNA was treated with DNaseI (Fermentas) and converted into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was tested in triplicate using the KASPar genotyping assays described above. Heterozygous gDNA samples were run alongside these samples together with cloned alleles in various mixtures to determine whether the mRNA expression of the two alleles was balanced.\n\n    Microsatellites mapping close to POLE (D12S1723, D12S1628, D12S357, D12S1638) or POLD1 (D19S867, D19S904, D19S907) were analysed in the Gene Marker (Soft Genetics) program and used to assess whether the L424V or S478N alleles were derived from a common ancestor (PCR conditions available from authors). LOH was assessed using the same set of microsatellites. LOH was scored if the intensity of any allele was reduced by >=50% relative to the other allele after taking account of the relative allelic intensities in paired constitutional DNA. In the case of discordance between microsatellites, precedence was given to the one closest to POLE or POLD1. For a small sub-set of POLD1-mutant tumours, LOH analysis was performed genome-wide using the Illumina Goldengate HumanLinkage system (Panel V). Briefly, ~1mug of tumour DNA and paired constitutional DNA were amplified as per the manufacturer's instructions and hybridised separately to Sentrix BeadArrays overnight. Each chip was then washed and stained, and scanned immediately using an Illumina BeadArray reader. GenomeStudio software was used to identify regions with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and/or copy number changes. It should be noted that some tumours in the set analysed were very small and contamination by normal cells may have obscured LOH in some cases. Similarly, it was not possible to screen the large POLE and POLD1 genes for \"second hits\" other than LOH owing to limiting tumour material.\n\n    Using the Ion Torrent cancer hotspot panel, we screened CRC-associated mutations for somatic changes in tumours from POLE L242V and POLD1 S478N carriers using direct sequencing. Owing to limited quantities of DNA from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumours available from our patients, we focussed on relatively common somatic mutations for which there was excellent pre-existing evidence of pathogenicity. Specifically, based on the existing literature and databases (http:// http://www.sanger.ac.uk), we regarded the following as pathogenic: APC (reference sequence NM_000038) - protein-truncating mutations between codons 167 and 1580; CTNNB1 (NM_001904) - missense mutations at codons 32, 33, 34, 37, 41 or 45; KRAS (NM_004985) - missense mutations at codons 12, 13, 61 or 146; BRAF (NM_004333) - V600E; PIK3CA (NM_006218) missense mutations at codons 345, 420, 542, 545, 546, 1025 or 1047; and FBXW7 (NM_033632) - protein-truncating mutations and missense mutations at codons 465, 479, 505 or 582. TP53 was not analysed because of the uncertain pathogenicity of some missense variants. Mutations were called using Ion Reporter (Invitrogen) and bam files were additionally inspected manually in order to remove likely artefacts and to detect any mutations - especially insertions and deletions in APC - that were not called by the Ion Reporter software. KRAS and BRAF mutations were additionally screened in an extended sample set using Sanger sequencing.\n\n    One tumour a from POLE L424V carrier (family SM2702) and three tumours from POLD1 S478N carriers (two from a member of SM1645 and one from a member of SM1412) were screened for exonic variants in a custom panel of 150 cancer-related genes using the Ion Torrent Ampliseq method (details available on request). After excluding the above known CRC driver genes and known polymorphisms, the somatic mutation spectrum was determined. All but two in-del mutations were substitutions.\n\n    Strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Standard genetic methods were used for strain construction 38. The pol3-C462N mutant strain (equivalent to human POLD1 S478N) was constructed by amplifying pol3 segments with primer combinations 1075 & 1077; 1076 and 1078 (see Supplementary Table 6). The products were purified, annealed and amplified using primers 1075 & 1076. The product was digested with BamHI and AscI and inserted into pFA6a-kanMX6 . The pol3-C462S (equivalent to human POLD1 wild type) strain was constructed in the same way using initial primer combinations 1075 & 1079; 1080 & 1076. As a control, a pol3+ (wild-type) strain was also constructed using the same procedure, using primer combinations 1075 & 1076 to amplify the wt sequence. Plasmids were integrated into the pol3 locus after linearization with CspCI and selecting for G418-resistance. Constructs were verified by sequencing. Mutation rates of the ade6-485 allele in different strain backgrounds were determined by fluctuation analysis as previously described . Eleven cultures were used for each experiment and plates were scored after 7 days. Mutation rates were calculated using the MSS-Maximum likelihood estimator .\n\n    Human mutations in both POLE and POLD1 were visualised in PyMOL (http://pymol.org) on the catalytic subunit of the yeast DNA polymerase delta [PDB ID: 3IAY]), with the ssDNA component of the T4 polymerase complex [PDBID: 1NOY], modelled into the exonuclease active site.\n\n    Other methods are provided in the Supplementary Material.",
        "Results": "    Following standard quality assurance procedures, whole-genome sequencing reads were mapped and called using the established local pipeline based on the STAMPY  and PLATYPUS programs (further details in Methods). We initially excluded two individuals who were found, despite previous testing, to have pathogenic heterozygous germline mutations in genes known to cause high-penetrance predisposition to colorectal tumours (Supplementary Table 1). One of these individuals had attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) owing to a splice site germline mutation in the APC gene (c.423 -2 A>G) and the other had Lynch syndrome caused by an MSH6 mutation (R911X).\n\n    In the absence of information regarding the underlying genetic architecture of the multiple adenoma phenotype, including the mode of inheritance in our families, we treated analysis of the remaining 13 WGS families as the Discovery Phase of our project. We then used a pragmatic approach to prioritise genes for further investigation in a larger Validation Phase of individuals with a similar phenotype. Based on the assumption that at least some individuals would carry mutations with direct, strong effects on protein function, we filtered the data so as to examine only protein-coding and splice site sequence. We filtered variants further using the algorithm shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and then searched for genes that harboured probably pathogenic variants across 4 or more families. However, no genes matched these criteria.\n\n    We therefore switched focus to single families. We initially examined the pedigree (SM2702, Figure 1) from which 3 individuals had been sequenced. We used pre-existing linkage data from 5 SM2702 individuals with >=5 early-onset colorectal adenomas  to restrict our search to 8 shared regions of the genome. There were 6 non-silent coding variants present in 4 different chromosomal regions that were shared by the 3 sequenced members of SM2702 (Supplementary Table 2). Further genotyping determined that the additional affected members of SM2702 (Figure 1) only shared one of these variants, POLE L424V (NM_006231:c.C1270G). POLE encodes the catalytic and proof-reading sub-unit of polymerase epsilon. The L424V amino acid is highly conserved (Supplementary Figure 2a) and the L>V change has predicted severe functional consequences for protein function (SIFT score=0.01, Polyphen2=0.993, Phylop=1.000, cons46=607, LOD=390 and MutationTaster=0.987).\n\n    We genotyped the POLE L424V variant in a set of Validation Phase samples. These comprised 3,805 white UK CRC patients enriched for family history of colorectal tumours, multiple adenomas and early-onset disease (see Methods). For comparison, we genotyped 6,721 white UK controls, of whom about two-thirds were population-based and one-third, selected for absent personal history of colorectal tumours. We found 12 additional unrelated cases and no controls who were L424V heterozygotes (P=2.46x10-6, Fisher's exact test, one-tailed). In addition, L424V was not present in 10,755 controls sequenced as part of the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), despite >50X median read depth at this site in the genome. We confirmed that L424V mRNA is expressed, without any evidence of allele-specific instability (details not shown).\n\n    The pedigrees of the 12 Validation Phase cases with POLE L424V are shown in Supplementary Figure 3. They are compatible with a dominantly-inherited trait. All pedigrees except one contained at least one individual with multiple or very large adenomas, multiple CRCs, or early-onset CRC. Microsatellite marker analysis provided no evidence of a recent common ancestor in these families (data not shown). All the L424V mutation carriers were found in our highly-selected groups of patients from the CORGI, multiple adenoma and NSCCG studies (see Methods) rather than in our CRC clinical trial patients (VICTOR and QUASAR2). This suggests that the relatively severe phenotypes of our L424V carriers do not simply reflect ascertainment criteria and also shows that these mutations are likely to be a rare cause of CRC in the general population. Genotyping of additional members of these 12 families showed that all L424V carriers developed colorectal tumour(s) and that no tumour-free blood relatives of cases carried L424V. One non-carrier, from a kindred whose other affected members developed tens of adenomas or multiple carcinomas, had developed a single tiny (~0.5mm diameter) colorectal polyp by 33 years of age, a phenotype compatible with a sporadic occurrence or an additional \"complex\" genetic predisposition in the family. Based on a relatively stringent definition of affection status - >=5 colorectal adenomas, >=1 large (>2cm diameter) adenoma, >=2 CRCs, or CRC at <=40 years of age - and on the reasonable assumption that all L424V alleles within each family were identical by descent, the probability of each affected non-proband sharing L424V in the 12 Validation Phase families was 1.22x10-4 after ascertainment correction.\n\n    Overall, the phenotypes of our L424V pedigrees were consistent with dominantly-inherited, high-penetrance predisposition to colorectal adenoma and carcinoma, with a variable tendency to develop multiple and large tumours. Therapeutic or prophylactic colectomy had occurred in several cases, thus attenuating the phenotype, and it is also likely that some tumours were under-reported, especially in early generations. However, even allowing for these factors, tumour multiplicity appeared to vary among individuals (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure 3). Moreover, adenomas did not, in general appear to progress rapidly to carcinoma in all individuals. The histological features of the L424V carriers' colorectal tumours were unremarkable, mostly comprising conventional adenomas and carcinomas without specific morphology or obvious site predilection in the large bowel. No conclusive evidence of a predisposition to extra-colonic tumours or non-tumour phenotypes was found in the L424V-mutant families (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure 3).\n\n    We examined 39 tumours from 11 POLE L424V carriers for somatic mutations. \"Second hits\" by LOH involving the germline wildtype allele were found in some tumours, including adenomas (Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast to Lynch syndrome, all tumours were microsatellite-stable (MS-stable), and the two carcinomas analysed had chromosomal instability. Most tumours were screened for KRAS and BRAF driver mutations, and a sub-set of tumours was screened for somatic mutations of established pathogenicity in APC, CTNNB1, PIK3CA and FBXW7 (Table 1, Supplementary Table 3). Mutations were found in all genes apart from CTNNB1, suggesting that the tumours at least partly followed the classical pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis. Mutations were all base substitutions. For APC, this was a notable difference from sporadic tumours in which ~60% of mutations are frameshifts . Moreover, certain sites not commonly mutated in sporadic colorectal tumours seemed to be mutation hotspots, for example codons 1114 and 1338 of APC and codon 146 of KRAS. Unlike in MUTYH-associated polyposis, where somatic driver mutations are almost all G:C>T:A changes, our patients' tumours showed no evidence of a predominant type of substitution in the 6 genes analysed, although at this stage, we could not exclude more subtle biases in this regard (see below).\n\n    We then considered variants shared by the two affected individuals sequenced in our other large family, SM1645. Using the same strategy as used for SM2702 - searching for shared functionally important variants and filtering using linkage analysis (Supplementary Table 4) - we identified two SM1645 cases who shared a heterozygous POLD1 mutation (S478N; NM_002691:c.G1433A). We also found the same variant in another proband (SM1412) who had undergone whole-genome sequencing in the WGS500. This variant was stably expressed in mRNA (details not shown) and was predicted to have a severe effect on protein function (SIFT score=0.01, Polyphen2=0.992), Phylop=0.987, cons46 (607, LOD=390) and MutationTaster=1.000). Moreover, the equivalent of POLD1 478 is POLE 428, very close to the site of the L424V mutation (Supplementary Figure 5).\n\n    We typed S478N in all available members of SM1645 and SM1412 (Figure 1b,c). All S478N carriers developed colorectal tumour(s) and all affected individuals (see above for criteria) carried S478N (P=0.008 after ascertainment correction). Affected members of SM1645 and SM1412 shared alleles at microsatellites D19S867 and D19S904, consistent with a common ancestor. No tumour-free blood relatives of cases carried the mutation. We noted that a formally unaffected non-carrier from SM1645, whose other members had multiple polyps (Figure 1b), had developed one, very small (<1mm diameter) colorectal adenoma by 43 years of age. We then genotyped the POLD1 S478N variant in the Validation Phase and found one additional carrier, a case diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma at age 28 whose father also had colorectal cancer at 44 years of age. No control carried POLD1 S478N, and the variant was also absent from the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project database.\n\n    The colorectal phenotypes of POLD1 S478N mutation carriers were generally similar to those of the POLE L424V mutants (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 3). However, 7 patients with POLD1 mutations had developed endometrial carcinoma, some at relatively young ages, and one had developed two primary brain tumours. No cases of either tumour type were present in the 13 families with POLE mutations. As a result of this finding, we screened 386 early-onset endometrial cancer cases without a reported family history of CRC for POLD1 S478N, but did not find any further mutation carriers.\n\n    We examined 23 tumours from POLD1 S478N carriers for LOH and for the somatic mutations that had been tested in the POLE-mutant tumours (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5). In most respects, the POLD1-mutant tumours resembled POLE-mutant tumours: \"second hits\" occurred at POLD1 by LOH involving the germline wildtype allele (Supplementary Figure 4), tumours were all MS-stable, carcinomas had chromosomal instability, C>T substitution mutations were most common, and the APC mutation spectrum was atypical compared with sporadic CRCs. However, there were also some possible differences: KRAS mutations tended to target codons 13 and 61 in the POLD1 mutants, as compared with codons 12 and 146 in POLE mutants, and some POLD1 tumours had BRAF mutations.\n\n    Human POLE is the catalytic subunit of the polymerase epsilon (Polepsilon) enzyme complex . Polepsilon is responsible for synthesis of the leading strand during DNA replication. In addition to DNA-binding and polymerase domains, Polepsilon has proof-reading capacity through the POLE exonuclease domain. This capacity is essential for the maintenance of replication fidelity and may act not only on newly misincorporated bases, but also on mismatches produced by non-proof reading polymerases such as Polalpha. L424 is conserved in the exonuclease domain of class B DNA polymerases (Supplementary Figure 2a) and a Blast search against the Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org) revealed that L424 maps directly to the active site of the exonuclease domain (L479 in yeast DNA polymerase [PDB ID: 3IAY]) . The importance of leucine 424 for proof-reading has been shown by mutation of the equivalent residue (L479S) in S. cerevisiae Poldelta/Pol3. This results in a mutator phenotype similar to that of the pol3-01 mutation, which has less than 0.5% wild-type exonuclease activity .\n\n    POLD1 encodes the catalytic and proof-reading sub-unit of Poldelta, the equivalent lagging strand polymerase to Polepsilon , and Poldelta may also participate in the mismatch and base excision repair pathways . POLD1 serine 478 is highly evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes including S. cerevisiae, although in S. pombe, the homologous amino acid is the structurally very similar cysteine (Supplementary Figure 2b). S478N lies close to other mutations that have a mutator phenotype in S. cerevisiae Pol3 , but mutation of this specific residue has not been reported. We therefore constructed the equivalent mutation in fission yeast and determined its effect on reversion of the ade6-485 allele, which is a C to G transversion that reverts by base substitution . The Pol3-C462N strain (equivalent to human POLD1 S478N) had a mutation rate 12-fold higher than a wild-type strain that was constructed using the same strategy (Table 3, Supplementary Table 6). We also examined a Pol3-C462S strain, equivalent to the human wild-type, and this mutation did not have a significant effect on the ade6 reversion rate.\n\n    POLE and POLD1 are related B family polymerases that have greatest homology (23% identity, 37% similarity) over the exonuclease domain (residues 223-517 of POLE and 245-571 of POLD1). Mapping these two mutations onto the structure of yeast DNA polymerase reveals that they pack together at the interface between two helices that form the base of the exonuclease active site. Modelling the ssDNA component of T4 DNA polymerase/exonuclease complex (1NOY) reveals that POLE L424 is only ~5A from the ssDNA, and mutations of POLE 424 or POLD1 478 will distort the packing of the helices which will be propagated through to the active site, affecting nuclease activity (Figure 2).\n\n    We wondered whether additional germline POLE and POLD1 exonuclease domain variants might predispose to colorectal tumours. We screened these regions (codons 268-471of POLE, codons 304-517 of POLD1) for germline variants in 469 cases with multiple colorectal adenomas and/or familial CRC (sample sets (i) and (iv) in Methods). We found three heterozygous POLD1 variants, each in a single case, that were absent from public control databases and from the non-cancer cases in the WGS500: P327L (c.C981G), S370R (c.C1110G) and G426S (c.G1276A). Structural studies showed that both S370R and G426S were unlikely to be involved in direct DNA binding and were predicted to have only moderate functional effects. By contrast, for P327L, which occurred in a 70 year-old with 10 colorectal adenomas, there was good evidence of functional consequences. The residue is fully evolutionarily conserved and lies on the DNA interface of the POLD1 exonuclease domain. Moreover, POLD1 327 is analogous to POLE 286, an amino acid that lies at the DNA-binding interface and is somatically mutated in sporadic CRCs (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 7).\n\n    There is currently little evidence of pathogenic somatic POLD1 mutations in sporadic CRCs (Supplementary Table 7), but there have been some reports of somatic POLE mutations in sporadic CRCs . Of particular interest is the recent TCGA sequencing of 224 CRC exomes . The authors highlighted POLE as being an important somatic change, but did not demonstrate a significant excess of mutations over background. Moreover, the importance of individual mutations had not yet been assessed and we therefore examined the TCGA POLE data in the light of our own findings above (Table 4, Supplementary Table 7). Fifteen TCGA CRCs had one or more POLE mutations at locations throughout the gene. Six of these cancers were hypermutated and/or MS-unstable owing to MLH1 methylation. A further two CRCs were MS-stable without hypermutation, and one of these had an exonuclease domain mutation. Strikingly, all of the remaining 7 POLE-mutant cancers were hypermutated and MS-stable or -low, and all of these had a mutation in the POLE exonuclease domain (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test; Supplementary Table 7). In some cancers, the exonuclease mutation was accompanied by a second nonsense (sample 17) or missense mutation elsewhere in the protein (Table 4). Structural analysis showed that the exonuclease domain mutations cluster around the DNA-binding site (Figure 2), including one mutation, P436R (P327L in POLD1), that lies in a disordered loop which becomes ordered on DNA binding (sample #15, Supplementary Table 7). All of these mutations will have a direct effect on either DNA binding and/or activity. The 2 exceptions are S370R and G426S that lie on the periphery of the domain, and mutations at these sites must act indirectly, if they are pathogenic.\n\n    Exonuclease domain-mutant (EDM) CRCs in the TCGA data set tended to have nonsense mutations in the APC gene, including some of the same hotspots that we observed in the patients with germline POLE or POLD1 mutations (Table 4, Supplementary Table 7). For example the APC R1114X mutation was found in 6 of 224 TCGA CRCs, 3 of which had POLE exonuclease domain mutations (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Genome-wide analysis showed that the set of 7 POLE EDM CRCs from the TCGA data had an increased tendency to acquire all types of base substitution compared with cancers that had POLE mutations outside the exonuclease domain and with all the other TCGA cancers. Indeed, non-EDM POLE-mutant cancers were MS-unstable and showed no difference in mutation spectrum or frequency from MS-unstable cancers without POLE mutations (Supplementary Table 8).The EDM-associated mutator phenotype did not, however, affect all substitutions equally. Hence, whilst C:G>T:A changes remained the most common type of mutation in EDM tumours, with an ~30-fold excess over other cancers, there was a particularly large (~100-fold) relative excess of G:C>T:A changes (Supplementary Table 8). An analysis of individual EDM cancers (details not shown) demonstrated that they all showed this mutation spectrum, further suggesting that each of these exonuclease domain changes was functionally deleterious. However, within the EDM group, two CRCs had acquired strikingly large numbers of mutations (over 6,000 each), these being the tumour with the mutation in the loop that became ordered on DNA binding and the tumour that had both an exonuclease domain mutation and a truncating mutation in POLE. We therefore speculate that these cancers may have had particularly deficient proof-reading.\n\n    A very recent study by Seshagiri et al  analysed 74 CRC exomes. Although a direct comparison between large-scale sequencing studies using non-identical platforms and analysis pipelines must be performed with caution, we found that the data of Seshagiri et al provide support for our conclusions from the TCGA data. Although Seshagiri et al did not highlight POLE in their manuscript, their data set included two hypermutated MS-stable cancers, both of which were EDM (P286R in both cases) and had an genome-wide mutation spectrum similar to that of the EDM TCGA cancers (details not shown).\n\n    We examined four tumours from our POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N carriers using an extended Ion Torrent panel based on 150 cancer gene exomes (see Methods). These tumours all showed mutation spectra similar to the POLE EDM cancers (Supplementary Table 8).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We have shown that the germline POLE variant L424V predisposes to multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. The allele shows dominant inheritance, apparently with high penetrance, and tumours occur predominantly or exclusively in the large bowel. Some individuals have a predominantly multiple adenoma phenotype, similar to MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) that results from defective base excision repair. In other patients, the phenotype is one of large adenomas or early-onset carcinoma, thus resembling Lynch syndrome that results from defective DNA mismatch repair. This phenotypic variation is found in both MAP  and Lynch syndrome , and is consistent with the action of genetic modifiers. However, it may have other causes (for example, random mutation, different environments, reduction in risk owing to therapeutic surgery or other tumour prophylaxis, under-reporting of adenomas especially in older family members, or premature death). The evidence strongly suggests that the mechanism of tumorigenesis is decreased fidelity of replication-associated polymerase proof-reading, leading to an increased mutation rate by base substitution.\n\n    We have also shown that POLD1 S478N predisposes to colorectal tumours, endometrial cancer and, perhaps, to brain tumours. The colorectal phenotype cannot be distinguished from that of POLE L424V mutants in the current data set. The apparently different tumour spectrum between POLE 424V and POLD1 S478N carriers is unexplained, but similar differences are found in Lynch syndrome, in which carriers of MSH6 mutations, for example, seem relatively prone to endometrial cancer . One possible explanation is that a mutator phenotype is not the only tumour-promoting consequence of POLE and POLD1 - and indeed, mismatch repair gene - mutation.\n\n    It is highly plausible, based on theoretical considerations and the TCGA data in sporadic CRCs, that a variety of germline POLE or POLD1 variants in the exonuclease domain can influence CRC risk. A strong candidate from our own analysis is POLD1 P327L. The effects of these mutations might vary depending on the degree to which they impair proof reading. Other pathogenic mutations might occur in the non-proof-reading domains of POLE or POLD1 or in genes that encode the other components of Polepsilon and Poldelta (POLE2, POLE3, POLE4, POLD2, POLD3 and POLD4). Such mutations might act a little differently from those in the proof-reading domain, for example if they caused a tendency for the polymerase to incorporate mispaired bases into the growing strand. Of note, we have previously shown that common variation at the POLD3 locus is associated with CRC risk in the general population .\n\n    Mice that carry double Pole mutations (D272A;E274A) close to the exonuclease active site impair proof reading and cause a mutator phenotype in both the heterozygous and homozygous states . The proof-reading mutations cause a tendency to base substitutions, but not to MSI. Pole homozygote mutants are specifically predisposed to developing intestinal adenomas and carcinomas. Mice with germline Pold1 D400A mutations (equivalent to human D380A) had a similar mutator phenotype in both the heterozygous and homozygous states, and homozygous mutant animals had a tendency to develop a variety of cancers, although, intriguingly, the tumours spectrum differed from that of the Pole mutants, with most tumours being of cutaneous, rather than intestinal, origin . There was also evidence of different, but overlapping mutation spectra in the Pole- and Pold1-mutant animals.\n\n    The question remains as to whether POLE and POLD1 mutations act as classical tumour suppressors, with \"second hits\", as haploinsufficient alleles, or through some hybrid mechanism, such as loss of a specific protein function. We cannot resolve this issue yet from our own data or the TCGA findings, but we note the following: (i) \"second hits\" do occur in some of our patients' tumours, including early lesions, at frequencies greater than the background expected from other studies , but many POLE- or POLD1 EDM tumours do not have identified \"second hits\" (Supplementary Tables 3, 5 and 7); (ii) the L424V and S478N alleles produce stable mutant mRNA, and there is no evidence from our data that protein-truncating or null POLE or POLD1 mutations predispose to tumours; and (iii) bi-allelic Pole or Pold1 mutations that cause complete loss of enzyme function are probably cell-lethal in null mice. One intriguing mechanism to consider is that mutations are only pathogenic when they couple functional polymerase activity to non-functional proof-reading in the same molecule.\n\n    When added to the DNA mismatch repair defects that underlie Lynch syndrome and the base excision repair defects that cause MAP, the mutations in POLE and POLD1 emphasise the critical role of replication errors and coupled repair of base pair-level mutations in predisposition to colorectal and endometrial cancer. This is in contrast to cancers of the breast and ovary, in which double strand break repair is more important in predisposition. POLE L424V and POLD1 S478N mutations can be easily tested and should be considered in any individual with an unexplained personal or family history of multiple or large colorectal adenomas, and/or multiple or early-onset colorectal (or endometrial) carcinoma. Whilst further data are required, it may be prudent in the short term to manage mutation carriers in a fashion intermediate between Lynch syndrome and MAP, with regular and frequent colonoscopic polypectomy and consideration of prophylactic surgery.",
