        "Title": "    Dominant Cone Rod Dystrophy, Previously Assigned to a Missense Variant in RIMS1, Is Fully Explained by Co-Inheritance of a Dominant Allele of PROM1",
        "Abstract": "    Autosomal dominant cone rod dystrophy 7 (CORD7) was initially linked to the gene RIMS1 and reported in a 4-generation British family in 1998. The purpose of this study was to investigate the legitimacy of this association, and to correctly characterize the genetic cause of this condition.\n\n    The allele frequency of RIMS1 c.2459G>A, p.Arg820His, was investigated in the Genomes Aggregation Dataset (gnomAD) datasets and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for 4 members of the CORD7 family with filtering of rare pathogenic variants in a virtual gene panel comprising all genes known to be associated with inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD). Cytogenetic analysis was performed to rule out interchromosomal translocation.\n\n    RIMS1 p.Arg820His has a maximal carrier frequency of >1:5000 in Europeans. A previously well-characterized PROM1 variant: c.1118C>T, p.Arg373Cys, was detected in 9 affected members of the CORD7 family who underwent WGS or direct sequencing. One affected family member is now known to have macular dystrophy in the absence of RIMS1 p.Arg820His. Clinical analysis of affected family members and 27 individuals with retinopathy associated with the same - PROM1 - variant showed consistent phenotypes.\n\n    The case for pathogenicity of RIMS1 p.Arg820His is not strong based on its presence on 10 alleles in the gnomAD dataset and absence from additional CORD affected individuals. The finding of a known pathogenic variant in PROM1 correlates well with the phenotypic characteristics of the affected individuals, and is likely to account for the condition. Clear evidence of association between RIMS1 and a retinal dystrophy is yet to be described.",
        "Introduction": "    Over 270 genes have so far been associated with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) (RetNet: https://sph.uth.edu/retnet) with many of these associations established prior to the widespread application of massively parallel sequencing and availability of large-scale genomic datasets. These two resources have driven discovery in the field of IRD over the past decade. In order to fully refute false attributions of pathogenicity to particular genetic variants, it is important to identify the correct pathogenic variant in the original cases.\n\n    Clinical and genetic data for an autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (adCRD, CORD7) affecting 8 individuals of a 4-generation white British family (Fig. 1) were published in 1998. All affected members experienced reduction in visual acuity and dyschromatopsia between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Most individuals showed progressive deterioration in central vision over time; other symptoms included peripheral visual field constriction, difficulties seeing in bright light, and some nyctalopia in one patient. There was phenotypic variability among affected members, but all affected individuals presented with retinal changes. These included mild retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) disturbance, extensive retinal atrophy and pigmentation, attenuated retinal vessels, and bull's eye maculopathy. Fundus autofluorescence imaging in affected members showed reduced autofluorescence in the central macula, surrounded by a ring of hyperautofluorescence. Electrodiagnostic tests revealed an abnormal pattern electroretinogram (PERG) consistent with macular dysfunction, and abnormal cone and rod responses in the full field electroretinogram (ffERG) in affected individuals (although only marginally abnormal in 3 mildly affected individuals). In most affected cases, the extent of reduction in cone ERG amplitudes was greater than that seen in rod ERGs. Progressive deterioration of ffERG was seen in one individual who underwent recordings 4 years apart. The electro-oculogram (EOG) showed a normal light rise.\n\n    Molecular genetic studies in the family established linkage to 6q14 and Sanger sequencing of RIMS1, a positional candidate gene, revealed a missense variant in exon 15 (c.2459G>A, p.Arg820His) which was present in 6 affected, and absent in 3 unaffected, family members. RIMS1 is expressed in the retina, the missense change occurred in a highly conserved region of the protein and was absent in 115 ethnically matched controls. This was cited as evidence that this variant was causative. However, with the exception of one simplex case of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) found to carry heterozygous p.Arg820His RIMS1 variant, there are no other reports of cases with retinal dystrophy associated with this variant in RIMS1. Furthermore, no pathogenic RIMS1 variants have been seen in the next generation sequencing of a large cohort of patients with inherited retinal dystrophies performed at our institution and in the Genomics England \"100,000 Genomes\" dataset. This led us to reinvestigate the family using modern molecular genetic techniques.",
        "Methods": "    The allele frequency of GRCh37 (hg19) chr6:72,960,710G>A, NM_014989.7: RIMS1 c.2459G>A, p.Arg820His was investigated in the Genomes Aggregation Database (gnomAD) datasets. One member of the CORD7 family was recruited for whole genome sequencing (WGS) as part of the UK 100K genomes project (100KGP).\n\n    Rare (MAF <0.001), coding variants in a virtual gene panel (http://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk) were interrogated for candidate pathogenic variants associated with disease in the family as part of the clinical diagnostic pipeline.\n\n    Cytogenetic analysis was also performed in one affected individual to investigate the possibility of interchromosomal translocation at the North Thames Genomic Laboratory Hub, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK, using standard protocols.",
        "Results": "    Ten carriers of RIMS1 p.Arg820His were found in the gnomAD version 2.1 comprising 108,049 individuals and 9 carriers in the gnomAD version 3.1.1 genome dataset (34,003 individuals), with a maximal allele frequency in Europeans of 0.0001323. This carrier frequency of >1 in 5000 is considered too high for a fully penetrant dominant vision loss variant. In addition, no unrelated carriers exist in the Moorfields Eye Hospital genetic eye disease cohort of molecularly tested individuals.\n\n    Whole-genome sequencing revealed that one affected member was heterozygous for a well-characterized dominant macular dystrophy/CORD allele, GRCh37 (hg19) Chr4:16,014,922G>A NM_006017.3: PROM1 c.1118C>T p.Arg373Cys, located on chromosome 4p. Subsequent family screening confirmed that all available affected members harboured this heterozygous PROM1 variant (see Fig. 1).\n\n    One family member, now known to have macular dystrophy, was previously reported not to harbor the RIMS1 p.Arg820His variant, but was unavailable for PROM1 testing (see Fig. 1, IV:9).\n\n    Given the previous segregation of the RIMS1 p.Arg820His variant with disease in CORD7 family members and significant logarithm of the odds (LOD) score, we sought to investigate the possibility of co-segregation of a region on 6q and 4p through an interchromosomal translocation. This was excluded by interrogation of the MANTA call data from the 100KGP bioinformatics pipeline and direct interrogation of the chimeric and supplementary read alignment data and split read data. In addition, cytogenetic analysis did not show evidence of a translocation.\n\n    We surveyed the Moorfields Eye Hospital molecularly confirmed patient database and identified 27 carriers of the same PROM1 variant with a molecular diagnostic report confirming this to be the pathogenic variant responsible for the retinal dystrophy. Review of clinical data of age-matched PROM1-retinopathy cases and the CORD7 affected family members showed striking similarities and a phenotype entirely consistent with PROM1-retinopathy in the CORD7 family (Fig. 2). The phenotype was also consistent with cases with this variant reported in the literature from References and.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The case for causality of the RIMS1 variant (p.Arg820His) has never been strong. No similarly affected unrelated individuals exist in our own cohort or in the literature. In addition, no other compelling evidence for pathogenic variants in RIMS1 have been identified to date. The only other report in the literature of the p.Arg820His variant was seen in a simplex patient with RP and a discordant phenotype.\n\n    The gnomAD dataset revealed that the allele frequency for the RIMS1 p.Arg820His variant, although rare, was too common to be considered a pathogenic variant responsible for a severe vision loss disease with an onset of the first to the fifth decades (CORD7 family). Taken together, this suggests that this variant is not causative of retinal disease.\n\n    PROM1 encodes a pentaspan transmembrane domain glycoprotein that is expressed at the base of rod and cone outer segments and is involved in disc morphogenesis, photopigment sorting, and also regulation of autophagy in RPE cells. Heterozygous missense disease-causing variants in this gene cause dominant retinopathy, exhibiting a variable phenotype and variable expressivity. One such variant, PROM1 p.Arg373Cys, has been previously reported in many cases across the literature, on different haplotypic backgrounds and is known to cause a wide spectrum of disease, including bull's eye maculopathy, macular dystrophy, and cone-rod dystrophy.\n\n    PROM1 p.Arg373Cys is absent from the gnomAD dataset. In contrast to the RIMS1 variant, the PROM1 variant is highly enriched in patients with macular dystrophy and CORD and submitted 16 times to ClinVar (15 pathogenic and 1 likely pathogenic, accessed March 2021). There are 27 carriers of the PROM1 variant within the Moorfields patient database, and the phenotype of the CORD7 affected individuals is in keeping with the variable macular/CORD disease seen in other PROM1-retinopathy cases. We therefore suggest that the retinal dystrophy observed in the CORD7 family is entirely accounted for by the pathogenic variant identified in PROM1.\n\n    Given the robust 2-point LOD score for the 6q14 locus (3.61), we hypothesized that a translocation between chr4 and chr6 could have led to the co-inheritance of the 2 variants, but we could find no evidence of this. Reviewing the works of Kelsell et al. and Johnson et al. in the discovery papers, chr6 was considered as the first candidate for linkage with the subsequent identification of RIMS1 (retinal expressed) as a candidate gene found to harbor a rare protein altering variant. This may be a \"perfect storm\" of coincidence and is likely therefore that this represents an alpha-error (a significant LOD score of 3.0 means there is a 1 in 1000 possibility of the trait not being linked to the locus) leading to inclusion of the gene on gene screening panels worldwide. We report the findings of macular dystrophy in one family member thought previously to be unaffected in the absence of the RIMS1 variant, providing the first evidence of non-segregation of RIMS1 with disease in the family.\n\n    It remains possible that variants of RIMS1 are associated with a dominant disease given the probability of loss-of-function intolerance (pLI) of the gene is 0.99 (0-1 scale) in the gnomAD dataset suggesting that haploinsufficiency is not tolerated, and that murine knockout exhibits a complex neurological phenotype. However, no proven cases of inherited disease consequent upon loss of function variants exist to date, to our knowledge, and no cases of confirmed RIMS1 disease are known. In the original publication, affected members of the study also showed enhanced cognition and this may be consequent on the p.Arg820His variant in RIMS1 and that co-inheritance of these two phenotypes is coincidental in the family.\n\n    In conclusion, our findings suggest that the entity, previously known as CORD7, corresponds in fact to PROM1-retinopathy, and is consequent upon the missense pathogenic variant p.Arg373Cys. The carrier frequency of the originally reported RIMS1 variant is higher than expected for a rare autosomal dominant disease and no other convincing cases exist in the literature. Thus, despite previous reports in the literature, there is no strong evidence to date to suggest that perturbation of RIMS1 has a pathogenic effect on the retina in humans.",

        "Title": "    Germline Variants in Patients Affected by Both Uveal and Cutaneous Melanoma",
        "Abstract": "    Uveal melanoma (UM) and nonacral cutaneous melanoma (CM) are distinct entities with varied genetic landscapes despite both arising from melanocytes. There are, however, similarities in that they most frequently affect people of European ancestry, and high penetrance germline variants in BAP1, POT1 and CDKN2A have been shown to predispose to both UM and CM. This study aims to further explore germline variants in patients affected by both UM and CM, shedding light on the underlying genetic mechanism causing these diseases. Using exome sequencing we analysed germline DNA samples from a cohort of 83 Australian patients diagnosed with both UM and CM. Eight (10%) patients were identified that carried pathogenic mutations in known melanoma predisposition genes POT1, MITF, OCA2, SLC45A2 and TYR. Three (4%) patients carried pathogenic variants in genes previously linked with other cancer syndromes (ATR, BRIP1 and MSH6) and another three cases carried monoallelic pathogenic variants in recessive cancer genes (xeroderma pigmentosum and Fanconi anaemia), indicating that reduced penetrance of phenotype in these individuals may contribute to the development of both UM and CM. These findings highlight the need for further studies characterising the role of these genes in melanoma susceptibility.\n\n    Germline variants predisposing uveal and cutaneous melanoma are identified using exome sequencing. Created with BioRender.com.",
        "Introduction": "    This study explored the genetic variants in individuals affected by both uveal and cutaneous melanoma.\n\n    It confirmed that both subtypes are part of the POT1 tumour predisposition syndrome spectrum.\n\n    Variants in established cutaneous melanoma genes were observed, suggesting they could also predispose to uveal melanoma.\n\n    Some patients carried variants in genes previously linked to other cancers, potentially expanding the disease spectra pathogenic variants in these genes predispose to.\n\n    Uveal melanoma (UM) originates from melanocytes in the uveal tract of the eye and differs from cutaneous melanoma (CM) in anatomical location, molecular drivers and clinical characteristics. CM arise from the melanocytes in the layer of basal cells at the deepest part of the epidermis of the skin and when occurring in nonglabrous skin are frequently driven by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. While immunotherapy has radically changed the outcome of advanced-stage CM, its success has been more limited in UM (Nathan, Hassel, et al. ). This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the considerably lower tumour mutation burden in UM (Newell et al. ; Rizvi et al. ), but differences in the tumour microenvironment might also contribute. CM often exhibit hotspot mutations in NRAS or BRAF, which constitutively activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In contrast, UM frequently harbours mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, which activate the G-protein signalling pathway. These differences underscore the distinct molecular pathways driving the development of UM and CM.\n\n    Despite these differences, there are also some similarities, particularly in factors influencing predisposition. Epidemiological studies have shown that UM and (nonacral) CM most frequently affect people of European ancestry. In CM, this association is caused by fair skin, offering less protection against mutagenic UV radiation (Del Bino, Sok, and Bernerd ), supported by genome-wide association studies of CM, which have identified numerous susceptibility loci near pigmentation genes (Landi et al. ). Similarly, smaller association studies have identified four loci associated with UM (Ferguson et al. ; Mobuchon et al. ; Thomsen et al. ), with three overlapping CM susceptibility regions, including the loci at IRF4 and HERC2/OCA2 linked with pigmentation and the TERT/CLPTM1L locus associated with telomere regulation (Derrien et al. ). This suggests an overlap in the molecular mechanisms underlying CM and UM tumorigenesis, which is further supported by shared rare high penetrance variants predisposing to both tumour types in families. Protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in BAP1 dramatically increase the risk for both UM and CM (Abdel-Rahman et al. ), as part of the BAP1 tumour predisposition syndrome (Walpole et al. ) and variants in POT1 and CDKN2A predispose to CM (Robles-Espinoza et al. ), while case reports have suggested that POT1 and CDKN2A are risk genes for UM (Hearle et al. ; Kannengiesser et al. ; Nathan et al. ), although with limited penetrance (Abdel-Rahman et al. ).\n\n    Given these shared aetiologies, we hypothesised that other yet to be identified germline variants predispose to both UM and CM. To explore this, we recruited 83 patients attending a single Australian ocular oncology referral centre diagnosed with both UM and CM and performed genome or exome sequencing.\n\n    This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute (HREC/14/QPAH/495). Blood or saliva samples were collected with informed written consent. Blood DNA was extracted using standard salting-out methods, and saliva DNA was extracted using Oragene DNA kits (OG-500; DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genome and exome (using SureSelect V7 postcapture kits) sequencing was conducted by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea) on the Illumina platform. The resulting sequence reads were aligned to the HumanG1Kv37 assembly using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM) (Li and Durbin ) and duplicate reads were identified by Picard v1.141 (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). To enhance the alignments, reads were realigned against common insertions and deletions and base qualities were calibrated using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (McKenna et al. ). Small substitutions were detected with bcftools (Li and Durbin ), while indels were detected using Pindel (Ye et al. ), and annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) (McLaren et al. ) including Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) and Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen2) predictions (Adzhubei, Jordan, and Sunyaev ; Ng and Henikoff ) and variant allele frequencies (VAFs) from the Genome Aggregate Database (gnomAD) (Karczewski et al. ), and variants were subsequently annotated with Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) (Kircher et al. ), Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL) (Ioannidis et al. ) and MetaRNN (Li et al. ) predictions using dbNSFP v4.8 (Liu et al. ), with CI-SpliceAI predictions (Strauch et al. ), and with ClinVar data (downloaded 2 May 2024). High-quality variants were identified by requiring at least three variant reads and phred-scaled likelihood for wildtype > 70. We removed variants that were located in segmentally duplicated regions (Bailey et al. ), showed strand bias (p < 1 x 10-4), tail distance bias (p < 1 x 10-4), clustered near the end of the reads (< 10%), or if the variant reads had substantially lower average mapping quality than the wild-type reads (> 30). Nonsynonymous MC1R variants were categorised into R alleles, strongly associated with red hair, and r alleles weakly associated with red hair, as described elsewhere (Robles-Espinoza et al. ; Valverde et al. ).\n\n    Of the 83 patients, 42 (51%) were male. The median age at diagnosis of the first CM was 64.9 years (range 22.4-89.1) and for UM was 67.7 years (range 27.3-90.1); (Table 1; Table S1). One patient with a particularly notable history of bilateral UM (56 and 73 years) and three CMs had no coding region mutation that could be linked with a heightened melanoma risk.\n\n    Next, we investigated variants in established melanoma predisposition genes. Two patients carried variants in POT1 (c.1851_1852del p.(D617Efs*9), c.670G>A p.(D224N)). The p.(D224N) variant was classified in ClinVar as variant of uncertain significance (VUS), but notably it has previously been observed in familial melanoma and patients with multiple primary melanomas (Shi et al. ). The p.(D617Efs*9) variant had conflicting classifications in ClinVar as submitters had classified it as VUS and likely pathogenic. Both variants have been described in several other cancer patients, including those with glioma, colorectal and lung cancer (reviewed in Nathan et al. ), and we therefore consider them likely to result in a loss of POT1, which contributes to the melanoma risk. Six patients carried pathogenic variants in genes known to be associated with CM, including MITF (c.952G>A p.(E318K)), OCA2 (c.1327G>A p.(V443I)), SLC45A2 (c.606G>C p.(W202C), c.834C>G p.(T278*)) and TYR (c.626C>T p.(P209L), c.1118C>A p.(T373K)) (Bertolotto et al. ; Nathan et al. ; Yokoyama et al. ) (Table 2, Table S2). Another 17 variants, classified as conflicting or VUS in ClinVar, were observed in genes associated with CM: ATM, BAP1, MITF, OCA2, POT1, SLC45A2 and TERT (Table S2). These genes are mostly involved in pigmentation; therefore, variants could affect the level of protection against UV radiation. A gene strongly associated with pigmentation is MC1R. Patients with a history of CM and UM had on average 0.63 MC1R R alleles, almost identical to a cohort of CM patients (0.64), and more frequent than in a UM cohort (0.48) (Newell et al. ). The observation that R alleles are more common in CM than UM (Fisher's exact, p = 0.03) is consistent with R alleles (associated with red hair, pale skin and poor tanning ability) not being associated with UM risk but strongly associated with the development of CM (Landi et al. ).\n\n    Four patients carried rare (gnomAD VAF <= 5 x 10-4) missense variants in WRN (c.229G>C p.(D77H), c.2131C>T p.(R711W), c.2747A>C p.(H916P), c.3434T>C p.(I1145T)), a gene associated with Werner syndrome and acral melanoma (Goto et al. ; Newell et al. ). The majority of in silico predictions for p.(D77H) and p.(I1145T) were benign, 3/5 were pathogenic for p.(R711W), and 4/5 were pathogenic for p.(H916P), consistent with that the p.(H916P) variant affects a highly conserved region within the functionally crucial zinc-binding subdomain (Kitano ).\n\n    Next, we investigated genes with common somatic alterations in melanoma. Three patients carried rare missense variants in GNAQ (c.93G>C p.(R31S)) or its paralogue GNA11 (c.323C>G p.(A108G), c.434A>T p.(Y145F)), two genes typically associated with driving the development of UM via mutations at hotspots p.R183 and p.Q209 (Robertson et al. ; Van Raamsdonk et al. ). Most in silico predictions were benign for these variants (Table S2) except that GNA11 p.(Y145F) was predicted pathogenic by 3/5 tools, which suggests it possibly alters the protein function and contributes to the melanoma risk.\n\n    Three patients carried four variants in SPRED1, which encodes a tumour suppressor regulating the MAPK pathway and is often disrupted through somatic mutations in mucosal melanoma (Ablain et al. ). One individual carried c.875A>G p.(Y292C) and c.887G>A p.(C296Y) variants on the same chromosome, in line with gnomAD data in which these two variants always co-occur (n = 18/2,82,666 alleles). These two variants were classified as 'Conflicting Classifications' in ClinVar, all in silico methods predicted the p.C296Y variant to be benign, while the p.Y292C variant was predicted to be pathogenic by 4/5 tools, which suggests the haplotype might affect the function of SPRED1.\n\n    We next looked at genes associated with other cancers (Table S3) and focused on rare (gnomAD VAF <= 5 x 10-4) pathogenic variants. Six patients carried at least one pathogenic variant in cancer-related genes. This included two patients carrying PTVs in the DNA repair genes ATR or BRIP1. PTVs in ATR have been associated with oropharyngeal cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer (Tanaka et al. ); the carrier in our cohort had bilateral breast cancer (62 and 68 years) in addition to UM and CM. PTVs in BRIP1 have been associated with ovarian cancer (Rafnar et al. ); the carrier in our cohort had no additional primary cancer diagnoses (49 years). Two patients carried the likely pathogenic variant c.3226C>T p.(R1076C) in MSH6, which has been reported to predispose to Lynch syndrome. Pathogenic variants in MSH6 have been associated with cancers other than colorectal carcinomas, including endometrial (Hendriks et al. ) and nonmelanoma skin cancers (Barrow et al. ); however, melanomas have yet to be confirmed in the tumour predisposition spectrum (Liu et al. ). One carrier of the p.(R1076C) variant had developed lymphoma (76 years), while the other had not developed any additional primary cancers (49 years). Other pathogenic variants were present in FANCE, XPA and ERCC5, associated with Fanconi anaemia, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group A and XP group G, respectively. Patients with Fanconi anaemia can have skin pigmentation and ophthalmic anomalies, as well as increased risk of cancers, including haematological malignancies and skin cancers (Mehta and Ebens ). Aside from UM and CM the carrier in our cohort had not developed any further malignancies by their seventh decade. XP is a recessive disorder leading to > 10,000 times greater risk of skin cancers, > 2000 times greater risk of melanoma (Bradford et al. ) and patients frequently experience ocular anomalies due to UV radiation damage (Kraemer, Lee, and Scotto ). While XP is a recessive disorder caused by having pathogenic variants in both copies of the gene, it is plausible that carrying a single pathogenic variant is associated with a milder phenotype such as an increased risk of melanoma. There is a precedent for this, with variants causing the recessive oculocutaneous albinism syndromes increasing CM risk in carriers of one pathogenic allele in melanoma families (Goldstein et al. ; Nathan et al. ).\n\n    One patient carried pathogenic variants in FBXW7 (c.1393C>T p.(R465C)) and KRAS (c.437C>T p.(A146V)), which have frequently been observed as somatic mutations in haematological malignancies (COSMIC IDs: COSV55891008 and COSV55498939). This patient was diagnosed with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 20 years prior to sequencing, which means these variants may have arisen somatically.\n\n    In conclusion, eight (10%) UM/CM patients carried a pathogenic mutation in high or medium-penetrance melanoma predisposition genes and three (4%) cases carried variants known to predispose to other cancers. Another three cases carried monoallelic variants in cancer genes associated with recessive disorders (XP and Fanconi anaemia), indicating that reduced penetrance of phenotype in these individuals may increase their risk of both UM and CM. While limited by the cohort size, this investigation highlights the need for additional studies to examine the role of this group of genes in melanoma predisposition.",

        "Title": "    Molecular diagnostic challenges for non-retinal developmental eye disorders in the United Kingdom",
        "Abstract": "    Overall, approximately one-quarter of patients with genetic eye diseases will receive a molecular diagnosis. Patients with developmental eye disorders face a number of diagnostic challenges including phenotypic heterogeneity with significant asymmetry, coexisting ocular and systemic disease, limited understanding of human eye development and the associated genetic repertoire, and lack of access to next generation sequencing as regarded not to impact on patient outcomes/management with cost implications. Herein, we report our real world experience from a pediatric ocular genetics service over a 12 month period with 72 consecutive patients from 62 families, and that from a cohort of 322 patients undergoing whole genome sequencing (WGS) through the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project; encompassing microphthalmia, anophthalmia, ocular coloboma (MAC), anterior segment dysgenesis anomalies (ASDA), primary congenital glaucoma, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus, and albinism. Overall molecular diagnostic rates reached 24.9% for those recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project (73/293 families were solved), but up to 33.9% in the clinic setting (20/59 families). WGS was able to improve genetic diagnosis for MAC patients (15.7%), but not for ASDA (15.0%) and congenital cataracts (44.7%). Increased sample sizes and accurate human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms are required to improve diagnostic accuracy. The significant mixed complex ocular phenotypes distort these rates and lead to missed variants if the correct gene panel is not applied. Increased molecular diagnoses will help to explain the genotype-phenotype relationships of these developmental eye disorders. In turn, this will lead to improved integrated care pathways, understanding of disease, and future therapeutic development.",
        "Introduction": "    Childhood visual impairment has a significant emotional, social and economic impact on the individual, their family, and society as a whole. An estimated 1.4 million children are blind worldwide (Gilbert,), and in the United Kingdom, 1 in 2500 children under the age of 1 year are diagnosed as severely sight impaired with an estimated one-third having a genetic basis (Rahi and Cable,). The spectrum of developmental eye disorders is vast, and includes microphthalmia, anophthalmia and ocular coloboma (collectively grouped as MAC), anterior segment dysgenesis anomalies (ASDA), congenital cataracts, primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and vitreoretinal dysplasia, optic nerve disorders, infantile nystagmus, and albinism (ocular and syndromic). Environmental factors, such as maternal alcohol intake or in utero infections, may cause some of these conditions (Busby, Dolk, & Armstrong,; Chassaing et al.,; Givens, Lee, Jones, & Ilstrup,), therefore a detailed prenatal history should be obtained. If an unremarkable pregnancy is reported a genetic basis should be considered.\n\n    MAC contributes up to 15% of childhood blindness and severe visual impairment worldwide (Hornby et al.,), with a cumulative incidence of 11.9 per 100,000 children (<16 years of age) in the United Kingdom (Shah et al.,). A prospective incidence study found that 2% of cases were due to environmental causes, and despite the assumption that the rest were genetic, only 6% of patients received a molecular diagnosis (Shah et al.,). MAC patients display significant phenotypic heterogeneity, forming part of a clinical spectrum and mixed phenotypes can often be seen in individuals, for example right microphthalmia with chorioretinal coloboma and left anophthalmia. Other ocular abnormalities, such as ASDA and cataract, can also be found in MAC patients causing a more complex presentation, with 60% having systemic associations (Richardson, Sowden, Gerth-Kahlert, Moore, & Moosajee,). Over 90 genes linked to MAC have been identified with all forms of inheritance (de novo sporadic, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive), demonstrating genetic heterogeneity (Harding & Moosajee,). In severe bilateral cases of microphthalmia and anophthalmia, a genetic cause can be found in up to 80% (Plaisancie, Calvas, & Chassaing,), with heterozygous loss of function variants involving SOX2 and OTX2, and recessive biallelic changes in STRA6 being the most common (Williamson & FitzPatrick,). However, this represents a small subset of patients with a prevalence of 2-3 per 100,000. For the majority, where asymmetry exists, particularly isolated unilateral cases, the diagnostic rates fall below 10%. Germline mosaicism, nonpenetrance and variable expressivity may be contributing factors (Chassaing et al.,; Faivre et al.,; Morrison et al.,).\n\n    The involvement of multiple ocular structures in patients with developmental eye disorders is due to the genes (a significant number being transcription factors) involved in early eye development having a spatiotemporal role in various ocular tissues, thus having a pleiotropic effect if defective. Current genetic testing practice in the United Kingdom for genetically heterogeneous eye conditions utilizes targeted gene panels (e.g., the Oculome; http://www.labs.gosh.nhs.uk/media/764794/oculome_v8.pdf) which encompass known disease-causing genes that cause both nonsyndromic and syndromic forms of disease. There are exceptions, for example, for children born with aniridia, an array-CGH is commonly used to detect a deletion involving the WT1 and PAX6 genes, if negative then Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation (WAGR) syndrome, can be ruled out and single gene PCR-based sequencing of PAX6 is undertaken to identify pathogenic variants causing isolated aniridia. It is important to consider that although targeted gene panels, such as the Oculome \"Anterior Segment Dysgenesis\" panel encompasses related conditions such as ASDA, corneal dystrophies and glaucoma related genes, if a patient also had cataract or coloboma, then the relevant panel may not be selected and the molecular cause missed. Hence accurate phenotypic descriptions using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms must be given so the clinical scientists can consider the differential genes that may be involved and apply multiple gene panels if necessary. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) remains a research-based test in the United Kingdom but is transitioning to clinical accreditation, however, similar principles will apply to selecting the correct panel of genes to be screened based on phenotype.\n\n    In contrast, inherited retinal disorders (IRDs), although considered phenotypically heterogenous, commonly have a symmetrical appearance with an onset after birth through to late adulthood which can be monitored closely with state-of-the-art retinal imaging. Over 250 disease-causing genes have been identified, mainly over the past two decades, and this had led to the first approved retinal gene therapy, voretigene neparovec, for autosomal recessive biallelic RPE65-retinopathy, with a multitude of gene/mutation-based clinical trials underway (Maguire et al.,; Miraldi Utz, Coussa, Antaki, & Traboulsi,; Russell et al.,). Genetic diagnostic rates in IRDs vary according to the population being tested, but range between 50 and 70% (Audo et al.,; Bernardis et al.,; Consugar et al.,; Ellingford et al.,; Jiman et al.,; Tayebi et al.,). The progress seen in the IRD field is likely due to the consistent scientific investment made internationally. A PubMed search on 16th May 2020 of papers relating to IRDs with search terms \"retinal dystrophy\" came to 12,953, whereas those for \"developmental eye disorders\" was 7,689; \"anterior segment dysgenesis\" 2,402; \"microphthalmia\" 4,837; \"anophthalmia\" 1,612; coloboma 5,152; and \"congenital cataract\" 5,793.\n\n    In this study, we report our real-world clinical experience of genetic testing of pediatric patients with developmental eye disorders, excluding IRDs, vitreoretinopathies and optic nerve disorders (including hereditary optic neuropathies). We compare our rates of diagnosis to published studies, using current clinically accredited targeted gene panels and research-based whole genome sequencing (WGS) tests, for patients that presented to the ocular genetics service at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (MEH), which oversees the care of the largest number of genetic eye disease patients of any one site in the United Kingdom.",
        "Methods": "    This study had relevant local and national research ethics committee approvals (MEH and the Northwest London Research Ethics Committee), and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients and relatives gave written informed consent for genetic testing through either the Genetic Study of Inherited Eye Disease (REC reference 12/LO/0141) or Genomics England 100,000 Genomes project (REC reference 14/EE/1112).\n\n    Only families with nonsyndromic and syndromic microphthalmia, anophthalmia, ocular coloboma (MAC), anterior segment dysgenesis anomalies (ASDA) including primary congenital glaucoma, corneal dystrophies, and aniridia, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus and albinism were included in this analysis. Consecutive patients presenting to the pediatric ocular genetics service at MEH between 1st October 2017 and 30th September 2018 were investigated. In addition, the cohort of patients with corresponding diagnoses recruited into the UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project (Turnbull et al.,) from 2015 to 2018 at MEH were also scrutinized.\n\n    Molecular testing was performed in the clinical and research setting, using targeted gene panel testing (Oculome; http://www.labs.gosh.nhs.uk/media/764794/oculome_v8.pdf) through the Rare & Inherited Disease Genomic Laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) as part of the UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project, for which results were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team (including molecular biologists, clinical geneticists, as well as the ophthalmology specialist managing the family), to confirm variant pathogenicity, prevalence in publicly available genome databases, the clinical phenotype and mode of inheritance, before the molecular diagnosis was established. The datasets (variants) generated for this study were submitted to ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) through the Rare & Inherited Disease Genomic Laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK).",
        "Results": "    A retrospective observational study identified 72 consecutive patients from 62 families with developmental eye disorders, who attended the pediatric ocular genetics service at MEH over a 12-month period. The families were divided into 15 MAC (24.2%), 11 ASDA (17.7%, including one aniridia, three corneal dystrophies and two glaucoma [congenital and juvenile-onset]), 10 congenital cataracts (16.1%), 13 infantile nystagmus (21.0%), nine albinism (14.5%) and four complex strabismus patients (6.5%, including two congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles, one Duane syndrome, and one with query blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome) (Figure 1a). The mean +- SD age of children was 4.9 +- 4.2 years (range 1 month-15 years) with 41.7% (n = 30) being female. The ethnicity of patients was divided into 18 White British (25%), 11 White other (15.3%), five Asian Pakistani (6.9%), three Asian Bangladeshi (4.2%), three Asian Indian (4.2%), six Asian other (8.3%), two Black African (2.8%), one Black Caribbean (1.4%), two Black other (2.8%), two mixed White and Black African (2.8%), 11 other ethnicities (15.3%), and eight were not stated (11.1%). All patient demographics including clinical and genetic details are listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n    In total, 69 patients from 59 families (95.2%) proceeded with genetic testing following informed consent, two patients declined, and it was not possible to obtain a sample from one patient. Of the 59 families who consented, 13 had a targeted gene panel (22.0%), 45 had WGS through the 100,000 Genomes Project (76.3%) and one family had single gene test for PAX6. Most families opted for WGS due to the superiority of the test and its coverage despite it being on a research basis. Those that underwent a targeted gene panel did so as they either did not meet the 100,000 Genomes Project study eligibility criteria, did not want to partake in a research study, or were concerned about the length of time to get results for family planning purposes.\n\n    Overall, 29 patients from 20 families (42.0% of tested patients; 33.9% of tested families) received a molecular diagnosis (Table 1). For the disease subgroups, the following molecular diagnostic rates were achieved (based on number of families undergoing genetic testing); 21.4% MAC (3/14), 60% ASDA (6/10), 44.4% congenital cataracts (4/9), 15.4% infantile nystagmus (2/13), 55.6% albinism (5/9) and nil for the complex strabismus disorders (0/4). If the ASDA group is subdivided; 60% ASDA (3/5), 66.7% corneal dystrophies (2/3) and 50% glaucoma (1/2). Of the solved families, 5/20 had targeted gene panel testing (25%) and 14/20 had WGS (70%), and one had single gene testing (5%). Of the 36 families that received a no primary finding result, seven were from panel test and 29 from WGS, suggesting that overall, those that had a panel test had a 46.2% (6/13) diagnostic rate and for those with WGS was 35.6% (16/45), although this is not a valid comparison due to differing indications and sample size.\n\n    Pathogenic variants were found in 19 distinct genes. The genes identified for MAC were KMT2D, MAB2IL2, ALDH1A3; ASDA were KERA, PAX6, MYOC, TGFBI, and SLC4A11; congenital cataract were CRYBB2, EPHA2, HSF4 and BCOR; infantile nystagmus were CACNA1A and FRMD7; and albinism were OCA2, GPR143, HPS6 and SLC38A8 (Table 1).\n\n    As the aforementioned consecutive cohort of patients had a mixed range of genetic testing, we looked at all developmental eye disorder patients with the same disease criteria who had been recruited into the 100,000 Genomes Project between 2015 and 2018 and received WGS as a gold standard. A total of 322 families were recruited, divided into 75 MAC (23.3%), 49 ASDA (15.2%, including three aniridia, two corneal dystrophies, and 42 primary congenital glaucoma), 43 congenital cataracts (13.4%), 25 infantile nystagmus (7.8%), 130 albinism (40.4%) (Figure 1b).\n\n    Two hundred and ninety-three families have received their results, with 29 still pending. Of this 73 families (24.9%) received a molecular diagnosis but 220 (75.1%) had no primary findings (Table 2). For the disease subgroups the following molecular diagnostic rates were achieved; 15.7% MAC (11/70), 13.0% ASDA (6/46, but 12.8% for primary congenital glaucoma [5/39]), 44.7% congenital cataracts (17/38), 28.0% infantile nystagmus (7/25), and 28.1% albinism (32/114) (Figure 1c).\n\n    Pathogenic variants were found in 38 distinct genes. Those identified for MAC were PRSS56 (two families), ALDH1A3, CREBBP, GJA8, KERA, MAB21L2, MFRP, PAX6, PTPN11, and TFAP2A; ASDA were CYP1B1 (four families), FOXC1 and PAX6; congenital cataract were CRYBB2 (three families), CRYGD (two families), BCOR, CRYBB1, CRYBB3, CHMP4B, EPHA2, GJA8, HSF4, MAF, MIP, NHS, PITX3, and TDRD7; infantile nystagmus were FRMD7 (four families), OCA2, SLC38A8, CACNA1A; and albinism were TYR (12 families), GPR143 (eight families), OCA2 (seven families), SLC38A8 (three families), HPS6, and SLC24A5 (Table 2). WGS seeks to screen both coding and noncoding regions of the gene, but only 8 out of 93 (8.6%) variants were found to be noncoding (all were splice-site mutations); these were found in one cataract patient (HSF4), two nystagmus patients (both FRMD7), and five albinism patients (OCA2 [two patients], GPR143, SLC38A8, and TYR). Noncoding variants were only found in splice regions due to the limitations of the UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project diagnostic pipeline. As with clinically accredited diagnostic targeted gene panels (e.g., the Oculome), the focus was on the detection of class 4 and 5 variants. So while WGS has the capacity to detect all noncoding variation, only those with a canonical splicing effect or those previously identified and/or functionally proven variants will be regarded as class 4 or 5. For unsolved cases, the discovery of novel noncoding variants is undertaken by further data mining in the research setting.",
        "Conclusion": "    Understanding the etiology of developmental eye disorders remains challenging given their diverse phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity. Diagnostic rates remain variable and relatively lower than the progress made with IRDs. NGS technologies allow variants to be screened in parallel and at relatively low cost. Expanding WGS from the research setting to an accredited clinical service will allow for more accurate diagnosis and improved management of patients. Ensuring precise human phenotype ontology is used to document each clinical feature (not just the primary diagnosis) will enable clinical scientists to best apply the relevant diagnostic gene panel. Being able to gain a molecular diagnosis will further our understanding of the natural history of gene/variant-specific cohorts, reveal potential therapeutic targets and establish outcome measures for prospective future treatments.",
        "Discussion": "    The spectrum of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, and copresentation of developmental eye disorders is a major challenge in obtaining a molecular diagnosis. A mixed testing approach in the clinic using targeted gene panels, single gene and WGS yielded a higher overall molecular diagnostic rate of 33.9% (20 out of 59 families) compared to WGS alone. Arguably, only 24.9% received a result from the 100,000 Genomes Project (73 out of 293 families), but this involved a larger sample size and was in-line with other studies. The development of a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel assay for ocular conditions known as the Oculome panel test (http://www.labs.gosh.nhs.uk/media/764794/oculome_v8.pdf) screened 277 pediatric patients across several panels (including MAC, ASDA, cataract, retinal and albinism) with 68 individuals (24.5%) receiving a definitive diagnosis (Patel et al.,). For disease subgroups, there are significant differences between the published outcomes and what we determined. Having small sample sizes can impact on the accuracy of these genetic diagnostic rates, as demonstrated with the ASDA subgroup; for the Oculome panel test 24.8% (28 of 113 cases) received a molecular diagnosis, but from our clinic this reached 60% (6/10) cases solved, however the larger WGS cohort of 46 patients found only 13.0% (six cases) were solved, demonstrating the variability in outcomes. Conversely, in the congenital cataract group undergoing the Oculome panel test, eight of nine cases (88.9%) received a molecular diagnosis. We had a similar number of patients from our clinics but only solved four out of nine families (44.4%), and with WGS 44.7% (17/38) were solved.\n\n    For MAC conditions, the Oculome panel test was able to solve 8.2% of cases but through our clinics and the 100,000 Genomes Project (using WGS), our patients had at least a twofold increase with 21.4% (3/14) and 15.7% (11/70) diagnostic rates, respectively. This confirms that WGS has the capacity to increase diagnostic rates. The most prevalent gene was PRSS56 (OMIM #613858), which causes autosomal recessive microphthalmia, isolated 6 (OMIM #613517), found in two unrelated families (16899 and 25356). All other MAC families had their own individual disease-causing gene, which can make genotype-phenotype correlations hard to determine as many more cases need to be identified to strengthen associations and prognosis. As only 11 out of 70 cases were solved, this suggests that many deep intronic variants may be as yet undetected due to the diagnostic pipeline limitations. This low solve rate also implies that more variants and novel genes remain undiscovered, and/or possible alternate non-Mendelian disease aetiologies, for example epigenetic or complex genetic causes. In a recent paper using the wildtype zebrafish as a model of optic fissure morphogenesis, ocular tissue from the site of the unfused, fusing and post-fusion optic fissure was taken for comparative global transcriptomic profiling against dorsal retina at the same timepoint (Richardson et al.,). Overall, 322 differentially expressed genes were found to be involved in optic fissure morphogenesis, these can be further interrogated through knockdown/out studies for resultant MAC phenotypes, comparative analysis in other animal models looking for conserved genes, and in larger patient cohorts such as those recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project (Caulfield et al.,) and the NIHR Bioresource (NBR-RD,).\n\n    The use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has been manipulated to generate models of human eye development, and could be used to identify more candidate genes by revealing underlying molecular mechanisms (Hung, Khan, Lo, Hewitt, & Wong,; Llonch, Carido, & Ader,). Optic vesicle-like structures derived from a microphthalmia patient with a VSX2 null variant (p.Arg200Gln) showed upregulation of WNT pathway components and misexpression of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) markers at the expense of the neural retina (NR) lineage, which was rescued by pharmacological inhibition of WNT signaling (Capowski et al.,). This supports an important role for VSX2 in WNT signaling and maintenance of the NR through WNT pathway suppression. One potential problem of in vitro modeling is the lack of surrounding embryological tissue and external stimuli that may provide cues for in vivo development, this is particularly important given the involvement of multiple ocular structures in patients. Utilization of data from both cell-based systems and animal models will continue to provide a more complete and accurate representation.\n\n    The given primary diagnosis can influence the choice of gene panel and subsequent diagnostic rates. For example, in this study family 36 with congenital cataracts was found to harbor a heterozygous frameshift deletion (c.856del, p.[Ser286Alafs*92]) in BCOR (OMIM #300485), and this causes X-linked dominant microphthalmia, syndromic 2 (OMIM #300166). The female patient presented with bilateral congenital cataracts, unilateral left microphthalmia and persistent primary teeth, and thus could fall into both MAC and cataract cohorts, but was counted under congenital cataract. Similarly, family 17 had unilateral left microphthalmia with cornea plana, anterior segment dysgenesis, left exotropia and high hypermetropia, and was identified to have a homozygous missense variant (c.809C>T, p.[Ser270Leu]) in the KERA gene (OMIM #603288). KERA is known to cause autosomal recessive corneal plana 2 (OMIM #217300) and this variant is rare in healthy population databases, although not previously reported to cause disease. The unaffected father was confirmed as a heterozygous carrier, and the unaffected mother did not undergo genetic testing. KERA is not found in the MAC targeted gene panel despite several case reports suggesting its association (Huang et al.,; Kumari et al.,; Lehmann et al.,). This variant was identified from WGS, which has more flexibility to screen novel genes or variants. The drawback of targeted gene panels is that they are predesigned to cover given regions of the genome, and if updates are required, a new panel must be designed which incurs costs for time and validation. In contrast, WGS covers the entire genome, over 3 billion nucleotides and 20,000 genes, and can identify previously noncovered variants such as CNVs, structural variations, intergenic and deep intronic variants (Lionel et al.,; Van Cauwenbergh et al.,; Vaz-Drago, Custodio, & Carmo-Fonseca,). This is important for developmental eye disorders, such as aniridia where ~15% of all PAX6 variants are located in intronic regions, with the majority at the intron-exon border (Lima Cunha, Arno, Corton, & Moosajee,), although only 8.6% were noncoding variants from the WGS group in this study.\n\n    A notable finding for patients with query albinism and infantile nystagmus, was that a number of genes were found in both subgroups, including OCA2 and SLC38A8. This highlights the diagnostic challenges of young children with nystagmus as their presenting complaint. There is significant phenotypic variability in albinism patients, which can make it hard to delineate from infantile nystagmus. Visual evoked potentials are excellent at detecting intracranial misrouting, but this can be inconclusive in young infants. Hence, for some patients their diagnosis will be revised based on their molecular result, for example one nystagmus family (25824) was found to have biallelic variants in OCA2 (OMIM #611409) causing autosomal recessive oculocutaneous albinism type II (OMIM #203200). Hence further clinical phenotyping can be required to confirm the correct clinical diagnosis. Four unrelated families (56, 26350, 58, and 26364) were identified with biallelic SLC38A8 (OMIM #615585) variants through WGS (as this gene is not present on targeted gene panels for nystagmus or albinism). It causes autosomal recessive foveal hypoplasia 2, with or without optic nerve misrouting and/or anterior segment dysgenesis (OMIM #609218), and thus its features can pose clinical diagnostic challenges. This reinforces the need to undertake genetic testing in order to reach a definitive diagnosis that can guide the ongoing care and management of the patient. As more genes are identified, it is likely that we will begin to see more extensive spectrums of disease rather than distinct disease entities. Classifications of disease using eponymous names must also be superseded by a gene-based system where we can build our knowledge of genotype-phenotype relationships.\n\n    Patient access to genetic testing has been a barrier to accurate, timely diagnoses and appropriate management. In countries with insurance-based systems, agencies are reluctant to fund genetic testing unless there is clear evidence the results will accurately determine the clinical status of the patient and directly influence management (Capasso,). In the United Kingdom, the 100,000 Genomes Project was established to provide an infrastructure that allows NHS patients with rare disease to access WGS through a genomic medicine service with centralized funding (Patch & Middleton,; Turnbull et al.,). This transition is underway, with designated laboratories undertaking ophthalmic genetic testing and oversight from Genomic Hubs permitting equity of genomics services (Royal College of Ophthalmologists,). The National Genomic Test Directory for rare and inherited diseases has been formed detailing which test is available for each clinical indication, with the Genomics England Panel app listing the genes included in each panel, reviewed by experts to ensure there is evidence for its inclusion (Genomics England Panel App,). Such advances will accelerate time to diagnosis, improve diagnostic rates, permit precision management and cost saving on prolonged, multidisciplinary team assessments and investigations (Gillespie et al.,; Musleh et al.,). For patients and families with developmental eye disorders, an accurate molecular diagnosis earlier in the patient pathway potentially provides several benefits by addressing uncertainty, improving decision-making and elucidation of any systemic manifestations, a number of which are can be potentially life threatening. Research into developmental eye disorders will also greatly benefit from larger solved patient datasets.",

        "Title": "    Carrier testing for partners of MUTYH variant carriers: UK Cancer Genetics Group recommendations",
        "Abstract": "",
        "Introduction": "    MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by biallelic constitutional pathogenic variants in the MUTYH gene. MAP is associated with colonic polyposis (typically adenomas, but less commonly hyperplastic, serrated or mixed) and increased cancer (colorectal, duodenal and others) risk. Variable expressivity has been noted; polyp burden has often been reported in the order of 100s and rarely greater than a thousand, but colorectal cancer has also been reported in affected individuals in the absence of many, or any, preceding polyps. MAP-associated penetrance is incomplete, but the risk of colorectal cancer in the absence of intervention is high. Although age at diagnosis of cancer is typically younger than sporadic cancers, at 47, phenotypic expression is usually adult in onset. Recommended surveillance includes biannual colonoscopy from 18 to 20, and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy from 35.\n\n    The frequency of MAP is estimated to be at least 1 in 40 000, but the condition is likely underrecognised, given recessive inheritance pattern and variable phenotype. It is estimated that approximately 1%-2% of individuals of White European ancestry are heterozygous carriers of a pathogenic variant in MUTYH. It is estimated that two pathogenic founder variants, c.536A>G (p.Y179C) and c.1187G>A (p.G396D), account for greater than 80% of pathogenic variants in this gene, with approximately 70% of affected individuals carrying at least one of these variants. Several other recurrent variants have been identified in different groups (table 1).\n\n    In the UK, MUTYH testing is currently offered as part of a panel of genes for investigation of individuals with a personal and/or family history of polyposis or early-onset colorectal cancer. While the intention of testing of MUTYH is to identify individuals with MAP, testing frequently identifies heterozygous carriers of MUTYH variants, which, in isolation, would not account for the patient phenotype, as heterozygous carriers of this recessive trait do not have a significantly increased cancer risk. Identification of a single MUTYH variant in an individual with a convincing MAP phenotype suggests another unidentified contributing risk allele. Outside NHS testing criteria, MUTYH is frequently included in commercial pan-cancer predisposition panels available in the private sector. Identification of a heterozygous MUTYH variant in an individual without a clinically relevant phenotype may represent an incidental finding. Such variants may also be ascertained through other routes, such as whole genome sequencing or tumour-based testing, depending on technology/filtering applied, research-based testing or direct-to-consumer testing, although some companies/groups now recommend reporting only biallelic status.\n\n    The NHS England Genomic testing directory outlines indications for carrier testing in partners of individuals who carry recessive traits, to enable accurate and informed reproductive decision-making. Presently, criteria are reasonably broad, suggesting that such testing can be considered where the result would influence reproductive decision-making, if the carrier frequency of pathogenic variants in the associated gene is at least one in 70 (or if consanguinity is a consideration). While the carrier frequency of the common founder MUTYH variants in White Europeans is higher than this threshold, the frequency of these and other variants in MUTYH in non-European populations is not well established.\n\n    Although MAP is a high-risk heritable genetic disorder with a reported carrier frequency (at least in some populations) in excess of 1 in 70, the phenotype is adult in onset; and variants in this gene are much more likely to be ascertained incidentally compared with other recessive traits associated with highly penetrant disorders.\n\n    Previous work has demonstrated that testing of partners of patients with MAP is cost-effective. However, ascertainment of heterozygous carriers of MUTYH variants is increasing, given associated growth in genetic testing using pan-cancer predisposition panels in patients with and without a MUTYH-related phenotype. Because of the relatively high carrier frequency of MUTYH variants in the general population, incidental detection of carrier status is not rare and represents a commonly encountered clinical challenge for genetics services, without a precedent in clinical guidelines to inform decision-making. Cascade testing is associated with significant workload, particularly in countries with large family sizes. In England, Wales and Scotland, the average size of an extended three-generation family totals 19 individuals, and in Northern Ireland and Ireland, 64. The potential workload is associated with testing of relatives and partners of heterozygous carriers, in the absence of proven cost-effectiveness needs due consideration. There are no specific guidelines related to testing of partners of carriers of recessive traits associated with later onset cancer risk. Considering this, we aimed to establish current practice (and variability thereof) in MUTYH cascade and partner/spousal carrier testing in the UK and Ireland, and to suggest MUTYH-specific modifications to existing criteria for testing for recessive traits.\n\n    To establish current practice, we surveyed lead genetic counsellors, cancer genetic consultant leads and clinical scientists in each regional genetics service in the four devolved nations in the UK, and in the Republic of Ireland, and clinicians in the specialist familial clinic in St Mark's Polyposis Registry. Data collection was considered complete once at least one response (Microsoft form) was received from every relevant regional service (n=32). Variability was noted in practice of offering spousal testing and extent of testing (common variants or full gene sequencing) (figure 1).\n\n    In order to standardise practice, we discussed indications for, and extent of partner testing at a virtual meeting involving clinical and scientific leads from each genomic laboratory hub, in August 2023, facilitated by the UK Cancer Genetics Group. At this meeting, we agreed that clinical services were becoming increasingly inundated with requests to facilitate carrier testing for partners of heterozygous carriers of MUTYH variants ascertained via non-standard testing as well as extended cascade testing in families where the presence of MUTYH in the family was ascertained as an incidental finding, rather than in individuals with a matching polyposis phenotype.\n\n    Mindful of current pressures on NHS genomic laboratories and clinical genetics services, we agreed that:\n\n    Carrier testing for MUTYH should be prioritised for partners of patients with MAP (ie, biallelic carriers).\n\n    Testing should not be limited to recurrent variants (ie, full gene sequencing should be undertaken).\n\n    Testing should be offered irrespective of the ethnicity of the partner, given that the carrier frequency in populations outside of white Europeans is not well established.\n\n    Full MUTYH gene testing may be offered directly to children of patients with MAP in the event that their other parent is not available for carrier testing.\n\n    We agreed that carrier testing should not routinely be offered to partners of heterozygotes in the absence of consanguinity or a personal or family history of polyposis or colorectal cancer, particularly if reproductive decision-making will not be influenced (eg, in older individuals).\n\n    We believe that bespoke criteria for partner testing of MUTYH are required compared with other recessive traits and hope that these recommendations provide guidance to address the current inconsistencies in clinical practice.\n\n    @mcveighterri, @kevinjmonahan, @MirandaDurkie, @Helen_Hanson1\n\n    Contributors: All authors conceived and contributed to writing of the commentary.\n\n    Funding: HH is supported by the NIHR Exeter Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR203320).

        "Title": "    Prospective Study of the Phenotypic and Mutational Spectrum of Ocular Albinism and Oculocutaneous Albinism",
        "Abstract": "    Albinism encompasses a group of hereditary disorders characterized by reduced or absent ocular pigment and variable skin and/or hair involvement, with syndromic forms such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Autosomal recessive oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is phenotypically and genetically heterogenous (associated with seven genes). X-linked ocular albinism (OA) is associated with only one gene, GPR143. We report the clinical and genetic outcomes of 44 patients, from 40 unrelated families of diverse ethnicities, with query albinism presenting to the ocular genetics service at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between November 2017 and October 2019. Thirty-six were children (<= 16 years) with a median age of 31 months (range 2-186), and eight adults with a median age of 33 years (range 17-39); 52.3% (n = 23) were male. Genetic testing using whole genome sequencing (WGS, n = 9) or a targeted gene panel (n = 31) gave an overall diagnostic rate of 42.5% (44.4% (4/9) with WGS and 41.9% (13/31) with panel testing). Seventeen families had confirmed mutations in TYR (n = 9), OCA2, (n = 4), HPS1 (n = 1), HPS3 (n = 1), HPS6 (n = 1), and GPR143 (n = 1). Molecular diagnosis of albinism remains challenging due to factors such as missing heritability. Differential diagnoses must include SLC38A8-associated foveal hypoplasia and syndromic forms of albinism.",
        "Introduction": "    Albinism encompasses a group of rare genetic disorders, frequently but not always associated with impaired melanosome maturation, melanin pigment synthesis, and distribution in melanocytes. Melanocytes are neural crest cells, which can be categorized into cutaneous (hair and skin) or extracutaneous (eye and cochlea). In mammalian eyes, the posterior epithelial surface of the ciliary body (pars plana), sphincter, and dilator muscles of the iris and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are derived from the neuroectoderm. The mesenchyme forms the connective tissue and blood vessels of the iris and ciliary body stroma. The choroid and uveal melanocytes as well as the hair and skin melanocytes are neural crest derived. During embryonic development the RPE is the first pigmented tissue to be observed due to early expression of melanogenic genes. Melanin exists in two forms: eumelanin (black or dark brown) and pheomelanin (red or yellow). Melanin production is initiated by the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA by interacting with tyrosinase. The biosynthetic pathways for the two pigments diverge downstream of L-DOPA, determined by the signaling activity of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a member of a subgroup of class A G-protein-coupled receptors, responsible for natural pigment variations in humans. Eumelanogenesis involves two melanogenic enzymes, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), while pheomelanogenesis is cysteine dependent. Melanin is deposited within melanosomes. Variations in melanosome composition and structure determine the degree of pigmentation of the eyes, hair, and skin. In the eye, normal melanin metabolism is important in retinal pigment histogenesis, retinal ganglion cell metabolism, the organization and trajectory/projection of retinal-fugal fibers. Impaired melanin biosynthesis, therefore, disrupts the delicate embryological processes of retinal differentiation and optic chiasm decussation, culminating in nystagmus and reduced visual acuity at birth. Ophthalmic manifestations of absent or reduced melanin pigment also include iris hypopigmentation with a transillumination defect, foveal hypoplasia, hypopigmented fundus, and the hallmark finding of chiasmal misrouting (increased number of axons crossing the optic chiasm to innervate the contralateral cortex) on flash and pattern visual evoked potential (VEP).\n\n    Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting all pigmented tissues in the eyes, hair, and skin to varying degrees. The estimated prevalence of OCA is 1 in 20,000 individuals. Due to founder effects such as in America, Africa, India, and Japan, the global incidence and distribution of OCA is highly variable between populations. OCA comprises eight clinical subtypes, OCA1-8, with mutations in seven different genes encoding either enzymes or membrane transporter proteins that are involved in melanin synthesis and accumulation of tyrosine. OCA1, caused by mutations in tyrosinase (TYR), can be further categorized into OCA type IA (OMIM #203100), characterized by complete lack of tyrosinase activity due to production of an inactive enzyme (\"tyrosinase negative\", complete OCA), and OCA type IB (OMIM #606952), characterized by reduced activity of tyrosinase (\"tyrosinase positive\", partial OCA). OCA1 is the most common subtype in the white Caucasian population with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 40,000, accounting for approximately 50% of cases worldwide. OCA2 (OMIM #203200) caused by mutations in the OCA gene, formerly known as the \"P\" gene, is the most common form of albinism worldwide; the estimated prevalence is 1 in 10,000 in the African American population, 1 in 30,000 in Caucasians, and closer to 1 in 3,900 in southern parts of Africa. OCA3 (OMIM #203290) has an incidence rate of 1 in 8500 amongst patients of African ethnicity and is less severe compared to the other OCA subtypes. It is caused by mutations in tyrosine-related protein 1 (TYRP1), which encodes an enzyme involved in the downstream biosynthesis of eumelanin from tyrosine. Mutation in TYRP1 is associated with the early degradation of tyrosinase and late maturation of melanosomes. OCA4 (OMIM #606574) is caused by mutations in SLC45A2, a membrane-associated transporter protein (MATP) gene, and though generally uncommon (estimated prevalence 1 in 100,000), it is more prevalent in the Japanese population, accounting for 24% of the OCA cases. OCA5 (OMIM #615312) was mapped to a locus on 4q24, but the specific gene underlying the pathogenesis remains to be determined. OCA6 (OMIM #113750) results from mutations in a protein transporter gene SLC24A5 also involved in melanin synthesis. OCA7 (OMIM #615179) is associated with mutations in the LRMDA or c10orf11 gene, which encodes the leucine-rich melanocyte differentiation-associated protein. OCA8 (OMIM #619165) is caused by mutation in the dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) gene, which catalyzes dopachrome to produce dihydroxycarboxylic acid in the eumelanin synthesis pathway. OCA5-8 are ultra-rare.\n\n    Ocular albinism (OA, OMIM #300500) is inherited as an X-linked disorder primarily affecting the eyes with relatively normal hair and skin pigmentation. The estimated prevalence is 1 in 60,000 males. OA is caused by mutations in the G-protein coupled receptor 143 (GPR143) gene, also known as OA1, expressed in melanocytes. GPR143 traffics to the membrane of melanosomes and regulates transcription of melanosome genes as well as melanosome size by disrupting the delivery of melanin-related protein (MRP) to mature melanosomes. Impaired GPR143 signaling causes alterations in the melanosome morphology, resulting in the formation of enlarged melanosomes (\"macromelanosomes\"), disruption in melanosome motility, and overall reduction in melanosome numbers in the melanocytes and RPE. GPR143 is located on chromosome Xp22. Female carriers of GPR143 mutations exhibit mosaicism due to different degrees of lyonization or random X chromosome inactivation, with the most characteristic finding being bright radial reflex (tapetal reflex) giving rise to a 'mud-splatter' appearance on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging.\n\n    Syndromic OCA includes Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (defective platelet adhesion causing easy bruising and severe bleeding), Chediak-Higashi syndrome (immune deficiency with increased risk of infection, easy bruising, and bleeding due to thrombocytopaenia), and Griscelli syndrome. These are autosomal recessive conditions caused by one or more genes associated with lysosomal protein trafficking. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (OMIM #214500) is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the gene LYST. Three types of Griscelli syndrome (GS) have been reported. GS1 (OMIM #214450) is caused by homozygous mutation in the gene MYO5A, resulting in hypomelanosis, primary neurological impairment without immunological impairment, and haemophagocytic syndrome. GS2 (OMIM #607624) is caused by mutation in RAB27A and is associated with immune impairment. GS3 (OMIM #609227) can be caused by mutation in MLPH or MYO5A; it is characterized by hypomelanosis without neurological or immune impairment.\n\n    Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of impaired lysosomal related organelles (LROs) synthesis, with an estimated global incidence of one to nine per 1,000,000 individuals (available online: ; accessed on 28 December 2020). The prevalence of each subtype may vary between populations owing to founder effects. HPS comprises a group of 11 multisystem disorders, HPS1-11, characterized by OCA and a combination of bleeding diathesis (secondary to impaired platelet aggregation), immunodeficiency (neutropaenia), pulmonary fibrosis, and/or inflammatory bowel disease. The causative genes for HPS1-11: HPS1 (HPS1), HPS2 (AP3B1), HPS3 (HPS3), HPS4 (HPS4), HPS5 (HPS5), HPS6 (HPS6), HPS7 (DTNBP1 or BLOC1S8), HPS8 (BLOC1S3), HPS9 (BLOC1S6), HPS10 (AP3D1), and the recently reported HPS11 (BLOC1S5). Though generally rare, it is important to exclude syndromic OCA as certain systemic associations may present later in life and carry significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n    Although OA and OCA are distinct genetic entities, OCA is phenotypically heterogenous and may overlap with OA. Distinguishing between the two based on clinical phenotype alone may be challenging. It is important to note that subtle hypopigmentation, especially in individuals with lightly-complected ancestry, may not be reliably appreciated and coded. Furthermore, considerable phenotypic overlap between albinism and other conditions such as foveal hypoplasia 2 (FVH2, OMIM #609218, also known as foveal hypoplasia 2, optic nerve decussation defects, and anterior segment dysgenesis (FHONDA) syndrome) caused by SLC38A8 mutations may also confound the diagnosis. Therefore, molecular confirmation should be sought and correlated with clinical findings before establishing a definitive diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to describe the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of a cohort of 44 consecutive patients presenting to the ocular genetics service with suspected albinism.",
        "Methods": "    This was a prospective cohort study of consecutive nystagmus patients with suspected albinism presenting to the ocular genetic service at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (MEH), London, United Kingdom, between November 2017 and October 2019. Patients who satisfied one of the following inclusion criteria were recruited; (i) positive family history of albinism with or without molecular confirmation of the affected family member(s), (ii) nystagmus with hypopigmentation of the fundus, hair and/or skin, (iii) nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia and/or intracranial chiasmal misrouting.\n\n    Data collected included medical history, family history, pedigree, hair and skin color, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and the presence of nystagmus, iris transillumination defect on slit lamp biomicroscopy as well as foveal reflex and fundus hypopigmentation on fundoscopy. VA assessment for all preverbal children up to 36 months of age was performed using Cardiff cards, for all other patients, BCVA was recorded in LogMAR (and converted to this if given in Snellen for statistical analysis). Visual acuity of 1/60 or counting fingers, hand movements, light perception, and no perception of light was recorded as 1.98, 2.28, 2.6, and 3.0, respectively. Anterior segment imaging of the iris was performed using the Haag-Streit slit lamp camera (Haag-Streit Holdings AG, Koniz, Switzerland). Ultra-widefield (UWF) pseudocolor and autofluorescence (AF) fundus imaging were acquired using the Optos  California (Optos plc, Dunfermline, UK) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) was performed using the OCT SPECTRALIS  (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Chiasmal misrouting was confirmed either with multichannel flash VEP alone (for younger paediatric patients) or a combination of both flash and pattern VEP were performed at the Department of Electrophysiology, MEH.\n\n    DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood with informed consent was used for genetic testing. Genetic testing was performed in the clinical and research setting, using the albinism and nystagmus targeted gene panel (Oculome; available online: ; accessed on 28 December 2020) consisting of 30 genes (AP3B1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S6, C10ORF11, CACNA1A, CACNA1F, CASK, DTNBP1, FRMD7, GPR143, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, LYST, MANBA, MITF, MLPH, MYO5A, OCA2, PAX6, RAB27A, SACS, SETX, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TULP1, TYR, TYRP1) through the Rare & Inherited Disease Genomic Laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) as part of the UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project, where the results were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team to confirm variant pathogenicity, prevalence in publicly available genome databases, the clinical phenotype and mode of inheritance, before the molecular diagnosis was established. Genomic DNA was processed using an Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq X Ten high-throughput sequencing platform, generating minimum coverage of 15 X for >97% of the callable autosomal genome. Readings were aligned to either build GRCh37 or GRCH38 of the human genome using an Isaac aligner (Illumina Inc.). Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels (insertions or deletions) were identified using Platypus soft-ware (version 0.8.1; and annotated using Cellbase software (available online: ; accessed on 28 December 2020). Variant filtering was performed using minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.001 in publicly available and in-house data sets, predicted protein effect, and familial segregation. Surviving variants were prioritized using the Retinal disorders version 2.120 (available online: ; accessed on 28 December 2020) and the Albinism or congenital nystagmus version 1.10 (available online: ; accessed on 28 December 2020) virtual gene panels. Patients seen between November 2017 to September 2018 were recruited into the 100,000 Genomes Project. Upon completion of recruitment to the 100,000 Genomes Project in 2018, all subsequent sequencing was performed using the targeted gene panel (Oculome). Affected siblings within the same family were all sequenced. Genetic samples of parents and/or additional family members were obtained where available.\n\n    In silico tools (PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) were used to predict pathogenicity of the identified missense variants (Table 1). A missense variant was deemed pathogenic when predicted to be \"probably damaging\" by PolyPhen-2 and \"deleterious\" by SIFT. Frameshift, splice site, and nonsense mutations were all predicted to be deleterious as a result of nonsense mediated decay (NMD) or protein truncation.\n\n    This study had relevant local and national research ethics committee approvals (MEH and the Northwest London Research Ethics Committee) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients and relatives gave written informed consent for participation in this study through either the Genetic Study of Inherited Eye Disease (REC reference 12/LO/0141) or Genomics England 100,000 Genomes project (REC reference 14/EE/1112).",
        "Results": "    This prospective study identified 44 probands from 40 families, of which 47.7% (n = 21) were female and 52.3% (n = 23) were male. The study cohort comprised 36 children (<= 16 years) with a median age of 31 months (range 2-186), and eight adults with a median age of 33 years (range 17-39). This cohort consisted of families with diverse ethnic origins, 11 (27.5%) White British, 8 (20.0%) South Asian, 5 (12.5%) mixed White and Black African, 5 (12.5%) White other, 4 (10.0%) African, 4 (10.0%) Black African, 2 (5.0%) Middle Eastern, and 1 (2.5%) mixed White and South Asian. One African family and 3 South Asian families were consanguineous (9%, n = 4/44). A positive family history was absent in 81.8% of probands (n = 36/44) with the inheritance pattern being unclear.\n\n    In the paediatric cohort, BCVA ranged from fixing and following to 1.2 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (LogMAR) with a median of 0.8 LogMAR. In the adult group, the range was 0.3 to 1.0 LogMAR with a median of 0.6 LogMAR. Correlation between the change in BCVA at baseline and most recent follow up visit demonstrated subtle change in BCVA over time (Figure 1A). The change in BCVA of each paediatric patient at baseline and most recent vision as a function of age is illustrated in Figure 1B. The average BCVA at baseline decreases from 0.6 to 0.48 logMAR for patients between 3-20 years of age.\n\n    Of the cohort, 89.2% (n = 33/37, 2 were inconclusive, 2 had no chiasmal misrouting; 7 declined electrophysiology testing) had intracranial chiasmal misrouting, 86.4% (n = 38/44) had nystagmus, 75.0% (n = 33/44) had foveal hypoplasia, 72.7% (n = 32/44) had fundus hypopigmentation, 50.0% (n = 22/44) had iris transillumination defect, 38.6% (n = 17/44) had hair and skin (cutaneous) involvement, and 1 patient reported history of easy bruising (2.3%, n = 1/44) (Figure 2). The demographics and phenotypes are summarized in Table S1.\n\n    Initial recruitment comprised 44 families, of which 12 underwent WGS and 32 families had targeted gene panel testing. WGS identified biallelic variants in SLC38A8 in three unrelated families causing FVH2, all had foveal hypoplasia and intracranial chiasmal misrouting. Panel testing confirmed a FRMD7 hemizygous mutation causing X-linked congenital nystagmus in one family with suspected albinism, where the VEP was inconclusive. All four families were excluded from subsequent analysis of albinism cases, but further clinical and genetic details are included under Section 3.3.5. Non-Albinism Cases.\n\n    The overall diagnostic yield for albinism was 42.5%; 44.4% (4/9) with WGS, and 41.9% (13/31) with panel testing. Seventeen families had confirmed mutations (Table 1, Figure 3), of which 13 had OCA. OCA1 was the most common type with 69.2% (9/13) of families harboring TYR variants, followed by OCA2 in 30.8% (4/13). Three families were diagnosed with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome with pathogenic variants in either HPS1 (6.0%; 1/17), HPS3 (6.0%; 1/17) or HPS6 (6.0%; 1/17). Only one family (6.0%; 1/17) had X-linked OA with a GPR143 missense variant. Amongst the unsolved cases, a single pathogenic TYR variant was identified in one White British family (26649) with OCA1A and a single pathogenic TYRP1 variant causing OCA3 in one Afro-Caribbean family (26948). Unsolved cases from the targeted panel testing will undergo WGS, and for those unsolved following WGS, further data mining will be undertaken to discover novel genes or noncoding variants.\n\n    Of the nine families with molecularly confirmed TYR variants (Table 1), 4 had complete OCA1A and 5 had partial OCA1B (Table S1). The mean BCVA (in LogMAR) in the OCA1A group was 0.64 (range 0.2-1.0), compared to 0.6 (range 0.2-1.0) in the OCA1B group, with no significant difference between the groups. All patients exhibited clinical features of nystagmus, iris transillumination defect (TID), hypopigmented fundus, and foveal hypoplasia (Figure 4). Chiasmal misrouting was confirmed in all patients who underwent VEP testing (n = 3, 6 declined testing) (Figure 5).\n\n    Of the TYR variants identified in this cohort, 11 were missense, 2 were splice-site and 1 was nonsense. The most commonly observed OCA1A variant in patients with OCA, c.1118C>A p.(Thr373Lys), was identified in the proband of a White British family (13332) with BCVA of 1.0 LogMAR and the full complement of albinism features. The same variant was also identified in an unsolved White British family (26649). This variant was reported to occur in approximately 30% of Northern European cases. The proband of a consanguineous Pakistani family (26903) had BCVA of 1.0 LogMAR and all ocular features of albinism were present without obvious cutaneous involvement. She was homozygous for a loss-of-function TYR variant causing premature translational stop signal (c.832C>T, p.Arg278*). Several studies reported higher incidence of this causal TYR variant amongst South Asians (Indian, East Indian/West Bengal, Pakistani) due to consanguinity. A recurring pair of hypomorphic alleles c.575C>A, p.(Ser192Tyr) and c.1205G>A, p.(Arg402Gln) was seen across 3 unrelated White British families with OCA1B, occurring in trans with 3 different pathogenic missense variants. In this OCA1B subgroup, the mean BCVA (in LogMAR) was 0.74 (range 0.6-1.0), all probands had iris TID, foveal hypoplasia and fundus hypopigmentation, nystagmus was subtle in one patient, clearly present in the other two. All 3 probands were of fair complexion that is similar to their unaffected relatives. In a French study of 268 patients with OCA1, the p.(Arg402Gln) variant in trans was identified in 69 patients (25.7%) with variable but generally mild forms of albinism.\n\n    Four families (two mixed White and Black African, one Middle Eastern, one Black African) had OCA2 mutations, 50% had oculocutaneous involvement. The mean BCVA (in LogMAR) was 0.5 (range 0.2-1.2). All families had nystagmus and chiasmal misrouting. Other clinical findings of iris TID, foveal hypoplasia, and fundus hypopigmentation were more variable within this subgroup compared to OCA1. Seven pathogenic OCA2 variants were identified: 4 missense, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 frameshift deletion, 1 non-coding (splice). The same missense variant c.1327G>A, p.(Val443Ile) was seen in 2 unrelated families occurring with a different pathogenic variant (1 deletion, 1 missense). Variant p.Val443Ile is the most common in northern European populations, but is rare in other populations (<1% in the Scandinavian population). It is associated with residual function of the P protein (encoded by OCA2) and development of cutaneous pigment with time in affected individuals. Despite impaired or diminished eumelanin synthesis, this progressive increase in pigmentation and the propensity to tan is due to the relative preservation of pheomelanin. In this study, all probands harboring this variant did not have obvious cutaneous involvement but displayed fundus hypopigmentation with a mean BCVA (in LogMAR) of 0.3 (range 0.2-0.4). Family 27321 with missense variant c.2228C>T, p.(Pro743Leu) and splice donor variant c.1182+1G>A displayed a more severe phenotype with 1.2 LogMAR vision and the full complement of albinism features.\n\n    Four patients from three unrelated families were identified with HPS. The mean BCVA (in LogMAR) of this group was 0.6 (range 0.3-0.8). Foveal hypoplasia, iris TID, and chiasmal misrouting were present in 100% (n = 3), nystagmus and fundus hypopigmentation in 66.7% (n = 2). The lack of clinically apparent nystagmus was associated with relatively better visual prognosis in the paediatric cohort. This finding was consistent in our cohort where probands from family 25588 without nystagmus recorded vision (in LogMAR) of 0.3 versus 0.6 and 0.8, respectively in families 26677 and 26847 with nystagmus. Significant systemic findings included spontaneous bruising in the proband of family 26677 with homozygous mutations in HPS1 c.972dup, p.(Met325Hisfs*128). All patients were referred to haematology for further investigation and management.\n\n    The proband of Ghanaian family 25806 is a 13-year-old boy with a family history of maternal great uncles having yellow hair and fair skin. The patient had dark skin, black hair and reduced vision 0.7 and 0.6 LogMAR in the right and left eye, respectively. Examination was significant for nystagmus, although he had previously undergone the Anderson-Kestenbaum procedure in Ghana. He was found to have foveal hypoplasia and VEP confirmed chiasmal misrouting. WGS identified a pathogenic hemizygous mutation in GPR143: c.11C>G, p.(Pro4Arg) confirming the diagnosis of ocular albinism (OA1).\n\n    All probands with SLC38A8-associated foveal hypoplasia had evidence of nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia, and intracranial misrouting. Family 23089 proband had bilateral posterior embryotoxon, no signs of anterior segment dysgenesis were seen in the other two families (26237 and 26320). Families 23089 and 26320 were consanguineous, carrying homozygous nonsense mutations in SLC38A8: c.264C>G, p.Tyr88*. Family 26237 had compound heterozygous SLC38A8 mutations, c.435G>A, p.Trp145*, and c.632+1G>A. Further clinical details of these families were published.\n\n    The proband of White British family 27561 with a hemizgous FRMD7 variant was a 3-year-old male with unilateral (left) grade 1b foveal hypoplasia (using the Leicester Grading System) on OCT. He had blonde hair and fair skin, with 0.4 LogMAR vision bilaterally, fine horizontal nystagmus, and hypopigmented fundi. Repeated VEPs consistently showed equivocal findings on the right and contralateral predominance on the left. The equivocal VEP findings were partially attributed to maturational factors, but albinism could not be excluded. Targeted gene panel confirmed a novel pathogenic missense variant in FRMD7 c.790T>G, p.(Cys264Gly). Pathogenic FRMD7 mutations are fully penetrant in males. FRMD7 regulates brain development and neuronal growth by promoting neurite elongation and is expressed in the developing neural retina. In patients with FRMD7 variants, OCT imaging has shown abnormal afferent system development with foveal hypoplasia.",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, we describe the phenotype and genotype of a series of patients with albinism. Albinism, in particular OCA, is phenotypically and genetically heterogenous and mild phenotypes may be easily missed. We highlighted the importance of careful phenotyping to yield a higher molecular diagnostic outcome for definitive diagnosis. Establishing the genetic cause as early as possible has the potential to inform management, allow the definition of specific care pathways, improve the understanding of developmental eye diseases, and aid future therapeutic development. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of albinism cases remain genetically undetermined and further research is required to understand the genetic aetiology. As more variants and genes become associated with albinism, the diagnostic yield of genetic testing in these patients is likely to improve.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    This prospective observational study of 44 consecutive patients, from 40 families, presenting with query albinism reported an overall diagnostic yield of 42.5% through WGS or targeted gene panel testing. We defined diagnostic yield as the percentage of individuals with a characteristic clinical phenotype receiving a molecular diagnosis (>=2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in a gene linked with OCA or >=1 definite or likely pathogenic variant in GPR143 for OA). Copy number variations (CNV) may partially account for the lower rate of diagnosis in this study. The clinical exome (Oculome) does not search for CNVs nor have they yet been analyzed by the Genomics England analysis pipeline. Molecular diagnostic rates for albinism are highly variable, ranging from 56-91% in the literature. Lasseaux et al. (2018) reported a diagnostic yield of 72% from a large French study of 990 probands with albinism. More recently, Lenassi et al. solved 29 out of 32 (91%) preschool children with suspected albinism using a targeted panel of 18 (n = 30) or 26 (n = 1) or 40 (n = 1) genes with confirmed mutations in TYR (n = 18), OCA2 (n = 7), TYRP1 (n = 2), HPS5 (n = 1), and GPR143 (n = 1). The authors did not specify the reason for selecting different gene-specific panels and the patient demographic details (aside from age) were not presented. The probands who underwent expanded gene panel testing harbored OCA2 and TYR variants. The OCA2 variant c.1327G>A, p.(Val443Ile) and three TYR variants c.1118C>A, p.(Thr373Lys), c.575C>A, p.(Ser192Tyr), and c.1205G>A, p.(Arg402Gln) were also identified in our cohort through targeted gene panel testing. Comparison of the gene panels in the Lennasi study versus that employed in this study revealed some differences, e.g., they excluded CACNA1A, CASK, HPS1 (suboptimal coverage), MANBA, MITF, MLPH, MYO5A, RAB27A, SACS, SETX, and TULP1, whereas our panel did not include ACO2, ATOH7, HMX1, RTN4IP1, SIX6, and SLC4A11. However, none of these genes were identified in the Lenassi cohort, which suggests that stringency in clinical inclusion criteria is likely the major factor for increased likelihood of a positive finding.\n\n    In our study, the majority of the probands were referred with nystagmus as a predominant clinical feature with equivocal findings of foveal hypoplasia and cutaneous involvement; 75% had foveal hypoplasia, 73% had fundus hypopigmentation, and 39% had skin/hair involvement. Ethnic/genetic diversity of the study cohort and possible under-ascertainment of cutaneous hypopigmentation may account for smaller percentage of skin/hair involvement reported in this study. Thirty-seven patients underwent VEP testing (seven declined) and chiasmal misrouting was confirmed in 33 patients (89%). Six out of the seven patients who declined VEP testing, had confirmed mutations in the TYR gene and one remained unsolved. This highlighted the importance of detailed phenotyping in delineating patients with albinism versus infantile nystagmus. Our diverse patient ethnicity may have also contributed to the difference due to rare/unknown ethnic-specific variants. Of the unsolved cases in this cohort, 45.0% (n = 18/40) underwent targeted panel testing, these patients will be offered WGS to identify potential novel genes/variants or non-coding mutations that remain to be determined.\n\n    Of interest, a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) to determine the polygenic risk score for glaucoma susceptibility and progression identified a significant signal for TYR. Although the original design of this study did not include glaucoma in the data collection, retrospective review of the clinical findings did not identify glaucoma in this cohort.\n\n    Several genetic eye disorders falling under infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) can masquerade as albinism with considerable phenotypic overlap such as dominant PAX6-related oculopathy (OMIM # 136520), SLC38A8-related FVH2 (OMIM #609218), and forms of congenital nystagmus caused by FRMD7 (OMIM #310700) or GPR143 (OMIM #300814). Diagnosing albinism based on clinical findings alone is inadequate, particularly in infants and young children, where investigations such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess foveal hypoplasia and VEPs for chiasmal misrouting may be challenging due to fixation loss and compliance. Candidate genes for INS should be grouped together for testing this cohort of patients, which may not yet be included in conventional albinism gene panels for comprehensive screening of patients.\n\n    In this study, OCA was the most common disease entity with TYR being the most common gene identified. Approximately 480 mutations were identified throughout the TYR gene; up to 77% were missense mutations (67% OCA1A and 33% OCA1B), 15% deletions, and 3% insertions. In this cohort, 80% of the OCA1 variants were missense mutations. In cases of missing heritability where only a single pathogenic TYR variant was identified, studies subsequently identified two hypomorphic alleles, c.575C>A, p.(Ser192Tyr) and c.1205G>A, p.(Arg402Gln) in combination, forming a tri-allelic genotype. Human melanocytes with the p.(Arg402Gln) variant retain tyrosinase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is associated with moderate thermoinstability resulting in approximately a 75% reduction of enzymatic activity at 37  C. The p.(Ser192Tyr) variant was shown to have 60% of wild type activity. Together, the p.(Ser192Tyr) and p.(Arg402Gln) alleles result in the reduction of tyrosinase activity from retention in the ER and the released tyrosinase only having 60% of wild type activity, lowering the tyrosinase activity to a pathogenic level. We identified compound heterozygous tri-alleleic genotype in three unrelated families with partial OCA, where the p.(Ser192Tyr) and p.(Arg402Gln) alleles were seen in trans with a rare pathogenic TYR variant (different variant in each family). Various studies reported compound heterozygous tri-alleleic genotype in TYR involving both rare (AF <5%) and common (AF 28-36%) functionally damaging variants, which are likely to be on trans alleles. The hypomorphic TYR coding variants p.(Ser192Tyr) and p.(Arg402Gln) are part of a pathogenic haplotype GYGQ, thought to explain up to 15% of individuals with albinism. These variants, when in cis with each other result in a mild phenotype both when in trans with a pathogenic TYR mutation, and when homozygous. Less pronounced iris translucency was observed in these patients. Albinism should because of this, be considered as a diagnosis in children with subnormal visual acuity and/or otherwise unexplained nystagmus.\n\n    Two families with likely OCA, remained unsolved through targeted gene panel testing due to the identification of just one pathogenic variant. Family 26649 with OCA1A had a missense variant in TYR c.1118C>A, p.(Thr373Lys), the White British male proband had 0.54 LogMAR vision and all OCA1A features. Cell culture studies of this variant demonstrated protein misfolding/degradation and retention of mutant tyrosinase in the endoplasmic reticulum accounting for the phenotype. Family 26948 were non-consanguineous White African, with two affected siblings with possible OCA3 harboring a heterozygous deletion in TYRP1 c.1103del; p.(Lys368Serfs*17). The siblings had blonde hair and fair complexion with good BCVA 0.1 LogMAR, and no nystagmus. Aside from chiasmal misrouting, there were no ophthalmic features of albinism. OCA3 is common in the African population and known to have a less severe phenotype compared to the other OCA subtypes. Therefore, the identified pathogenic variant (AF 0.004973 in African or African Americans in gnomAD), and a possible hypomorphic allele that has not yet been identified may explain the mild phenotype. The patients with missing heritability, would benefit from WGS to identify a second pathogenic variant in the promoter or other regulatory regions, or possible mutations in undiscovered OCA genes. Deeper analysis may uncover synergistic interactions between known genes, dominant mutations not recognized due to pigmentation or ethnic background, hypomorphic mutations in known OCA genes and unrecognized splicing mutations or large deletions.\n\n    Three families were found to have homozygous mutations in the HPS gene, only one reported a history of spontaneous bruising. Syndromic forms of albinism are of clinical concern as affected individuals, particularly young children, can be overlooked. Genetic testing for albinism should include genes that cause syndromic forms, as these have considerable health implications. Three families (7% of the cohort) had molecular confirmation of HPS. Our findings of syndromic forms of albinism were consistent with previously reported rates of three to five percent. Platelet granules and endothelial storage granules (Weibel-Palade bodies) are members of lysosome-related organelles whose formation is regulated by HPS protein-associated complexes such as biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC-1, -2, and -3).\n\n    Genotype-phenotype correlations exist in HPS, where individuals with deficiencies in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex (BLOC), e.g., BLOC-2 deficiency (caused by HPS3, HPS5, or HPS6) display milder symptoms (such as minimal iris transillumination, fundus hypopigmentation, cutaneous involvement, and visual acuity as good as 0.4 LogMAR) than those with BLOC-3 deficiency (caused by HPS1 or HPS4). Importantly, in patients harboring HPS1 and HPS4 mutations, pulmonary fibrosis is highly penetrant and a leading cause of premature death in adulthood, typically around the fourth or fifth decades of life, secondary to respiratory failure. Current evidence indicates that 100% of patients with HPS1 develop pulmonary fibrosis. We identified one patient (family 26677) with homozygous HPS1 variants but at four years of age, only displayed oculocutaneous features of albinism. There were no clear phenotypic severity markers between any of the HPS families, except that the proband of family 26847 with HPS3 variants reported easy bruising, which is likely linked to their older age. Hence, early identification of syndromic OCA and coordinating the appropriate multidisciplinary care team, including paediatricians, respiratory specialists, immunologists, and haematologists, is critical to minimize morbidity and mortality of patients.\n\n    The correlation of BCVA at presentation and most recent visit was analyzed and did not show significant change overtime. Accurate documentation of functional vision is often challenging in young children. In this study, more accurate visual assessment could be achieved in children of age three years and above. No clear difference in mean BCVA (in LogMAR) was observed between the OCA1A (0.64), OCA1B (0.60), OCA2 (0.50), and HPS (0.60) subgroups. Refractive errors are common in albinism with myopia, hypermetropia and high levels of with-the rule astigmatism being reported. To what extent the reduced visual acuity reflects the underlying pathology, nystagmus, foveal cone density, and whether these are genetically determined and how these factors influence/arrest normal emmetropisation in albinism remains debatable.\n\n    Although this study had a relatively large sample size for a rare disease cohort, increased numbers of molecularly diagnosed patients will permit more accurate genotype-phenotype analyses. Further limitations of this study include the use of two different sequencing approaches, where targeted gene panels restrict the choice of genes/regions screened and non-coding interrogation.",

        "Title": "    Whole genome sequencing in paediatric channelopathy and cardiomyopathy",
        "Abstract": "    Precision medicine in paediatric cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy has a rapid advancement over the past years. Compared to conventional gene panel and exome-based testing, whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers additional coverage at the promoter, intronic regions and the mitochondrial genome. However, the data on use of WGS to evaluate the genetic cause of these cardiovascular conditions in children and adolescents are limited.\n\n    In a tertiary paediatric cardiology center, we recruited all patients diagnosed with cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy between the ages of 0 and 18 years old, who had negative genetic findings with prior gene panel or exome-based testing. After genetic counselling, blood samples were collected from the subjects and both their parents for WGS analysis.\n\n    A total of 31 patients (11 cardiac channelopathy and 20 cardiomyopathy) were recruited. Four intronic splice-site variants were identified in three cardiomyopathy patients, which were not identified in previous whole exome sequencing. These included a pathogenic variant in TAFAZZIN:c.284+5G>A (Barth syndrome), a variant of unknown significance (VUS) in MYBPC3:c.1224-80G>A and 2 compound heterozygous LP variants in LZTR1 (LZTR1:c.1943-256C>T and LZTR1:c1261-3C>G) in a patient with clinical features of RASopathy. There was an additional diagnostic yield of 1.94% using WGS for identification of intronic variants, on top of conventional gene testing.\n\n    WGS plays a role in identifying additional intronic splice-site variants in paediatric patients with isolated cardiomyopathy. With the demonstrated low extra yield of WGS albeit its ability to provide potential clinically important information, WGS should be considered in selected paediatric cases of cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy in a cost-effective manner.",
        "Introduction": "    Precision medicine has revolutionized the field of cardiology, leading to significant changes in practice. It plays a pivotal role in guiding prognostic and therapeutic decision-making, as well as in preventing sudden cardiac death (SCD) in asymptomatic family members. These conditions encompress cardiomyopathies and cardiac channelopathies. Panel sequencing and exome-based genetic testing have been widely utilized to identify the molecular aetiology of these cardiovascular conditions in recent years. However, these approaches have limitations in their coverage, particularly in non-coding regions, deep intronic regions and the mitochondrial genome. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), on the other hand, offers a more comprehensive coverage of these regions. The use of WGS to evaluate the genetic cause of cardiovascular conditions in children and adolescents is limited. Bagnall et al. conducted WGS on 58 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and identified five patients with pathogenic variants in the non-coding genome, which were missed by gene panel or whole exome sequencing (WES). This underscores the significant potential of WGS in identifying the underlying genetic causes in these diseases.\n\n    As the sole tertiary paediatric cardiology center in Hong Kong, all cases of advanced inherited cardiovascular conditions are referred to and managed in our center. Our experience in the management using precision medicine has been reported, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), SCN5A mutation and cardiomyopathy. This study aims to share our initial experience in utilizing WGS to unravel the molecular etiology in a 15-year cohort of paediatric cardiomyopathy and cardiac channelopathy.",
        "Methods": "    Patients diagnosed with cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy between the ages of 0 and 18 years old, meeting the diagnostic criteria of the two conditions,\n\n    Patients who did not receive a positive genetic diagnosis from their prior genetic investigations relating to the phenotype. Patients with VUS in genes with no definite or moderate evidence were also included.\n\n    All patients with a diagnosis of cardiac channelopathy and primary cardiomyopathy over the past 15 years (January 2007-December 2021) have undergone either target gene panel testing using Sanger sequencing/multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA)/next generation sequencing or WES in Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong as previously reported. The service was subsequently relocated to Hong Kong Children's Hospital. A comprehensive database was maintained to track all patients who underwent genetic testing at our center. The following patients in the database were recruited: AND\n\n    If the patients were found to have variants of uncertain significance (VUS), a thorough review of the gene information was conducted. The gene-disease validity was assessed based on expert recommendation by ClinGen (https://www.clinicalgenome.org/). If the VUS genes were found to have a definitive or moderate evidence as genotype explanation for the concerned phenotype (i.e., VUS with clinical relevance), those patients were excluded from recruitment for WGS. Individuals with cardiomyopathy secondary to chemotherapy, myocarditis, or environmental toxin exposure or nutrient deficiency were excluded.\n\n    Eligible patients meeting the recruitment criteria were contacted and invited to participate in the study. Interviews were conducted with the patients and/or their parents, and pre-test genetic counselling was provided. Upon obtaining informed consent, blood samples were collected from the subjects and their parents. The following data were collected: demographic information, diagnosis, clinical history, pedigree and initial genotype information.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using Flexigene DNA Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) and 550 ng of extracted DNA was fragmented to a peak size of around 300 bp for library preparation using KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Roche, Switzerland). The fragmented DNAs underwent end-repair, A-tailing at the 3'end, adaptors ligation at the terminal ends with xGen  Dual Index UMI Adapters system (Integrated DNA Technologies, US). The adapter ligated library with size range 300-750 bp were selected by dual SPRI methods. The PCR-free libraries were denatured and diluted to optimal concentration for Pair-End 151 bp sequencing in Illumina NovaSeq 6,000 platform (Illumina, US).\n\n    Using Illumina software bcl2fastq, sequencing reads were assigned into individual samples with sample. An average of 92%-93% of the bases achieved a quality score of Q30, indicating a base call accuracy of 99.9%. Fastq file were processed using DRAGEN Germline (v3.9.5) pipeline of BaseSpace (Illumina, USA) to map and align to hg19/GRCh37 human reference genome. The resulting BAM files were then input into the Illumina Dragen Joint Genotyping Pipeline to generate a joint call VCF for the detection of single nucleotide variant (SNV), insertion-deletion (indel), copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs).\n\n    Variant call format (VCF) output was annotated and filtered using Geneyx Analysis platform (Geneyx Genomex Ltd., Israel, http://www.geneyx.com) according to the phenotypic association, allele frequencies in control population, deleteriousness by in silico prediction, segregation, and functional consequence. The main disease databases used include ClinVar, OMIM and publications, and the reference population databases were gnomAD, ESP, dbSNP and 1000G databases. The CNV and SV VCF outputs were annotated using AnnoSV1, incorporating the relevant Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for each case. The prioritization of candidate genes involved a gene panel specific to cardiomyopathy (n = 29) curated by the American College of Medical Genetics and Association of Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP), as well as expanded cardiovascular disease gene panel (n = 217) adopted from the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS), GeneDx, and Blueprint Genetics, which included primary cardiomyopathy and cardiac channelopathy genes (Supplementary Table S2). Open-genome examination was performed if no significant finding could be identified from the prioritized gene panels.\n\n    Variants were scored according to the ACMG/AMP pathogenicity guidelines. The evidence of pathogenicity and benign impact was also influenced by the SVI General Recommendations for Using ACMG/AMP Criteria (https://clinicalgenome.org/working-groups/sequence-variant-interpretation/) as suggested by the ClinGen team. Additionally, ClinGen created a cardiomyopathy variant curation expert panel with a modified ACMG/AMP guideline framework for MYH7. If the mutation fell upon the MYH7 gene, the ClinGen curated variation classification was used. Similarly, a RASopathy variant curation expert panel with a modified framework for nine RASopathy genes was employed. As more variant expert panels had been released with modified ACMG/AMP guidelines for cardiomyopathy and cardiac channelopathy, the most updated version was used for analysis. In addition, Association for Clinical Genomic Science (ACGS) best practice guidelines was adopted for variant classification in some cases.\n\n    SNVs and small indels were further validated using Sanger sequencing following standard protocol. For variants predicted to affect splicing, blood RNA sequencing was performed as previously described to provide functional evidence. The genetic test results were discussed by the multi-disciplinary team comprising cardiologists, clinical geneticists, genome analysts, and bioinformaticians. Post-test counselling was provided by geneticists or genetic counsellors. Variants that were not listed in GnomAD v.2.1.1 were referred to as \"novel\" throughout the manuscript.\n\n    Descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS and Excel. Continuous data were expressed as mean and standard deviation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    There was a total of 88 and 67 patients with diagnosis of channelopathy and cardiomyopathy respectively, who underwent genetic testing since 2007 in our cohort. Among them, 15 cardiac channelopathy and 36 cardiomyopathy patients underwent whole exome sequencing as their first genetic testing. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 52 (59.1%) channelopathy patients and 32 (47.8%) cardiomyopathy patients. VUS in relevant/established disease genes were identified in 14 (15.9%) channelopathy patients and 9 (13.4%) cardiomyopathy patients.\n\n    Among the remaining patients, 3 channelopathy and 6 cardiomyopathy patients had VUS with no gene-disease association, while 19 channelopathy patients and 20 cardiomyopathy patients had no variants identified in initial genetic testing. Figure 1 showed the detailed flow chart of our study recruitment.\n\n    A total of 48 patients (22 channelopathy and 26 cardiomyopathy) were eligible for recruitment into the study. However, 17 patients could not be recruited due to refusal or failure to be reached. Ultimately, 31 patients were recruited, and among them, 8 patients had VUS of low clinical relevance.\n\n    Among the 31 recruited subjects, 19 were male (61.3%). Their ages ranged from 9 months to 29 years old, with an average age of 14.36 +- 7.16 years. All patients were of Chinese ethnicity. Before enrolment, 22 patients had undergone WES testing. Table 1 presents the phenotype of the subjects and the genetic findings identified by WGS analysis. In total, 7 new clinical relevant variants could be identified in 6 patients. Four variants (in 3 patients) were intronic splice error variants, while 3 variants were identified in exome region. The use of WGS in our cohort resulted in an additional yield of 3.87% (1.94% for intronic variants) in the identification of clinically relevant genetic variants, in additional to conventional gene testing. The details of these 6 patients are described below:\n\n    A full-term male infant with a birth weight of 2.4 kg was born. The antenatal morphology scan revealed cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion. He had a strong family history of intrauterine and early infant death among male family members (Figure 2). At 2 weeks of age, he developed cardiogenic shock. Echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of DCM with global left ventricular dysfunction. Additionally, he experienced neonatal ketotic hypoglycemia, evolving generalized hypotonia and gross motor delay. Initial metabolic investigations, including urine methylglutaric acid, were unremarkable. Genetic testing using WES only identified a variant in the SCN5A gene (SCN5A: c.874G>A, p.Gly292Ser) but the variant frequency in the East Asian population (8/19536, f = 0.0004095, GnomAD) was too high to be considered significant for reporting. There were no other supporting in-silico or functional data to indicate its pathogenicity. No other variants of interest could be identified. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to refractory heart failure at 9 months of age, and neutropenia was also observed.\n\n    Through WGS, a hemizygous +5 splice variant in the intronic region of chromosome X-153641594-G-A was identified in the TAFAZZIN gene (NM_000116.5):c.284+5G>A, inherited from the patient's mother. This variant was absent in the GnomAD normal population dataset. In-silico splice-site prediction tools predicts abnormal splicing (SpiceAI score was 0.81), suggestive of a cryptic splice variant (delta score >=0.8). Using RNA-sequencing, the aberrant splicing event in the TAFAZZIN gene was detected as significant splicing outlier in the DROP pipeline, with a FDR = 0.016047. Integrated Genome View (IGV) displayed two aberrant splicing events occur in proband, resulting in a 106 bp and another 87 bp intron retention (Figure 3). An immature stop codon is created at the start of intron 3, predicted to form truncating and non-functional protein products. Repeated metabolic work-up including urine organic acid showed hyperexcretion of 3-methylglutaric acid and 3-methylglutaconic acid. Further cardiolipin analysis demonstrated elevated monolysocardiolipin/cardiolipin (MLCL/CL) ratio on dried bloodspot and lymphocytes which confirmed the diagnosis biochemically. According to ACMG and ACGS guidelines, the variant is classified as pathogenic (PVS1, PP4_strong and PM2_supporting).\n\n    The boy presented at his age of 12 years with exercise intolerance and echocardiography revealed DCM with severely depressed biventricular function. No secondary causes for his condition could be identified. Consequently, heart transplantation was deemed necessary for decompensated heart failure. The family history was unremarkable and previous genetic testing using WES yielded negative results.\n\n    Through WGS, an intronic variant in the MYBPC3 gene (NM_000256.3:c.1224-80G>A) was identified. This specific intronic region was not adequately covered in good depth in previous WES analysis. The variant was inherited from his father and was rare in population (allele frequency = 0.0000637). Using SpliceAI, the variant received a high score, indicating its potential to cause aberrant splicing. Notably, this cryptic splice-altering variant in MYBPC3 has also been observed in two HCM patients in which an exonization of the last 78 bp of intron 13 in the mutated transcript, was demonstrated by minigene splicing report assay. This exonization results in an insertion of 26 amino acids. A case with the same variant was also reported in ClinVar, where it was classified as a likely pathogenic (LP) variant, albeit without accompanying phenotype information. MYBPC3 is a gene with a definitive evidence of HCM but with a limited evidence of DCM association. Although the gene mutation has been reported to cause DCM, there is still a lack of robust evidence in this gene-disease association. Complexities exist in genotype-phenotype relationships, in relating MYBPC3 variant change in causing dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient might suffer from burnt-out HCM but it could not be proven. As biallelic variants in MYBPC3 are associated with severe early onset disease, a second hit in this gene was reanalyzed again with no additional findings. The variant was classified as VUS based on the ACMG guidelines (PVS1_moderate, PM2_supporting). His father's cardiovascular investigation was normal with no other clinically affected paternal family members.\n\n    The patient presented with antenatal ventricular hypertrophy, with subsequent established postnatal diagnosis of HCM, secundum atrial septal defect and left coronary artery fistula to right ventricle. There was symmetrical hypertrophy of his myocardium, which was compatible with HCM changes related to RASopathy. In addition, he also had Abernethy malformation type 1b, with congenital absence of portal vein. Clinical examination revealed facial features consistent with Noonan syndrome (Figure 4), along with developmental delay. Prior genetic testing utilizing trio WES was negative. There was no significant family history.\n\n    WGS identified 2 compound heterozygous putative splice-site variants in leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 (LZTR1) gene. LZTR1 encodes the BTB-kelch superfamily proteins which control various fundamental cellular processes, with a strong association with RASopathy. LZTR1(NM_006767.4):c.1943-256C>T was paternally inherited which was rare in GnomAD dataset (allele frequency = 0.00006159). SpliceAI predicted an effect in splicing, specifically a donor gain of 0.24. Functional analysis confirmed the presence of additional RT-PCR products of 583 bp, including a 117-bp alternate exon retained from within intron 16. The resulting cryptic exon contained a premature stop codon, predicting a truncated protein [p.(Tyr741Hisfs*89)]. Previous literature and ClinVar reported several cases of Noonan syndrome associated with this variant, identified in multiple unrelated affected individuals. Therefore, the variant is classified as pathogenic (PVS1, PM2_supporting, PM3). Another variant in LZTR1, (NM_006767.4):c1261-3C>G, was maternally inherited. SpliceAI predicted an effect in splicing (acceptor loss 0.36; acceptor gain 0.62). The variant was rare in GnomAD control population (allele frequency = 0.000008029). RNA sequencing demonstrated that the variant led to aberrant splicing. The variant was detected in trans with a pathogenic variant. The variant was therefore classified as LP (PVS1, PM2_supporting, PM3). Clinical assessment of his parents and younger sister was negative.\n\n    Two LP variants and one VUS were identified in one LVNC patient and 2 CPVT patients. The LVNC patient was suspected to have mitochondrial disease with a homoplasmic VUS variant [NC_012920.1 (MT-TK):m.8338A>G] identified. However, subsequent metabolic investigations yielded unremarkable results, and the clinical course did not align with a mitochondrial disorder. Through WGS, a LP MYH7 (NM_000257.4):c.1118C>A (p.Ala373Glu) variant was identified, which was associated with LVNC.\n\n    The probands of two families with CPVT were also recruited with previous negative RYR2 panel testing. Both probands presented with exertional syncope and positive treadmill test, and one of them had a strong family history of aborted cardiac arrest (Figure 5). Quadruple WGS was performed for the family and a heterozygous RYR2 variant (NM_001035.3:c.6679G>A; p.Val2227lle) was identified in all clinically affected family members. The variant was located in mutation hotspots therefore PM1_strong rule can be applied. Singleton WGS was performed for another proband and a heterozygous RYR2 variant (NM_001035.3:c.1858T>G; p.Cys620Gly) was identified as VUS.\n\n    Among the 22 patients who were tested using WES (6 channelopathy and 16 cardiomyopathy), 4 new clinical relevant variants could be identified in 3 cardiomyopathy patients. The use of WGS in this subset of cohort resulted in an additional yield of 13.6%.",
        "Conclusion": "    The genetic investigation using WGS in our cohort of paediatric cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy had a small additional yield on top of conventional genetic testing. Several novel intronic spice-error variants were identified. WGS can be considered in selected paediatric cases of cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy, especially in gene-elusive proband with a strong phenotype and positive family history. Currently, the widespread use of this advanced genomic technology in cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy is limited, with a cost-effectiveness consideration.",
        "Discussion": "    Cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy are significant causes for SCD and morbidity in children and adolescents. Through cascade genetic screening of family members, early assessment and intervention can be facilitated. Genetic discoveries also lead to new therapies that target specific disease mechanisms, enabling genotype guided management. This study aimed to demonstrate the use of WGS in a 15-year cohort of paediatric cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy, on top of conventional gene testing. With the expanding use of WGS, this pioneer study serves to share the initial experience of employing this advanced genomic testing in these specific groups. It is worth noting that our study is the first related study on Asian population, and several novel variants are reported. Specifically, four new variants located in intronic regions of genes could be identified in 3 patients.\n\n    WGS enables comprehensive scrutiny of single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions, within both coding and regulatory regions of the genome. It offers additional coverage at the promoter, intronic regions and the mitochondria genome. Moreover, WGS enables the detection of structural variants which are not possible to identify using panel sequencing or WES.\n\n    In recent years, there have been an increase in the identification of disease-causative variants located in deep intronic and mitochondrial regions, some of which can create novel pseudo-exons. Identifying and understanding intronic and splice-site variants in paediatric channelopathy and cardiomyopathy are significant because they expand our knowledge of the genetic basis of these conditions. As rare novel variants continue to be identified, RNA sequencing has been developed as a tool to confirm the functional impact of these variants, providing supporting evidence for their pathogenicity. In our cohort, RNA sequencing was used successfully to confirm the functional impact of the TAFAZZIN variant in patient 1, and the 2 LZTR1 variants in patient 3.\n\n    WGS allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the genetic landscape of these disorders, enabling better diagnosis, risk assessment, and potential targeted therapeutic interventions. As novel genes continue to be discovered through WGS, it has transitioned from being a scientific advancement to a clinical diagnostic tool in identifying molecular explanation of cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy. The presence of such variants in affected individuals can also inform genetic counselling, provide insights into disease mechanisms and prognosis, and offer potential treatment options. In our study, the pathogenic intronic variants in the 2 patients identified through WGS enable our patient's families to utilize the variant information for future preconception counselling.\n\n    Albeit the discovery of these novel variants, the extra yield using WGS to detect these intronic and splice-site variants was only 1.94%. The low yield was probably due to current limitation of knowledge in these non-exonic variants for cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy, hindering their reporting in the laboratory.\n\n    Compared to WES and gene-panel testing, WGS is associated with higher costs, longer turn-around times, and a greater chance of identifying VUS. Additional functional studies, such as RNA sequencing, may also be required to assist determination of pathogenicity of detected variants in these regions, thus adding to overall testing cost. Inevitably, it hinders the use of this advanced genetic methodology currently, especially in resource-scarce settings.\n\n    Targeted gene panel testing, on the other hand, balances reasonably comprehensive coverage and are often highly optimized for complete and uniform capture of region of interest. It remains as the first line diagnostic testing for proband in most of cardiovascular units. In fact, WES covers all the coding regions and theoretically splicing variant changes in canonical regions near the ends of exon-coding regions can be discovered as well.\n\n    Despite variants in these canonical regions should be able to be identified by WES, the limitation of data information in these regions may hinder reporting of these variants. In our study, the variant changes TAFAZZIN:c.284+5G>A and LZTR1:c1261-3C>G are also located in these areas of interest, which were not reported in pervious WES analysis. Investigations were launched and we could identify the variant change in the initial WES raw data. However, owing to a narrower candidate gene prioritization and more stringent quality control filtering, these variants were not picked up for further analysis in previous WES reporting. As TAFAZZIN gene was not included in the core genes for primary cardiomyopathy, the gene prioritization was put at a lower position and the variant change had probably been filtered out. For LZTR1 gene, the variant change was not reported as the pathogenicity could not be determined with its nature of autosomal recessive inheritance, and without another pathogenic variant detected in-trans in prior WES testing, these LZTR1 variants might not be reported as well. Therefore, WGS is shown to be superior in the detection of these variants in this region.\n\n    This also sheds a light on the alternative approach of re-analysis of sequencing data to look for novel discoveries, before fishing the genotype using WGS. The phenotype determination can also help in the sequencing analysis, especially in pediatric cases in which specific metabolic diseases or autosomal recessive conditions may worth a second inspection or further investigations.\n\n    Despite the skewed cost-effectiveness in employing WGS in these patients, the importance of genotype-guided management and subsequent cascade family screening may worth the cost. Clinical pictures and family history can definitely help in prioritizing our patient to undergo this advanced genetic testing. For example, patient 1, who exhibited a severe antenatal-onset DCM phenotype with multiple affected male family members, was a good candidate for WGS testing. This made the pre-test probability higher in finding a genetic explanation for the proband. The identification of Barth syndrome in this patient demonstrated the value of WGS. The patient's family benefited from cascade family screening of other maternal siblings, leading to subsequent pre-conception counselling for female carriers. Additionally, WGS could have also guided the possible use of therapies such as elamipretide and gene therapy for refractory heart failure, although our patient died before receiving a genetic diagnosis.\n\n    The balance between cost-effectiveness and clinical utility of WGS will likely shift as the WGS cost decreases and turn-around times improve of in the future. Particularly, with the increasing understanding of intronic, splicing and mitochondrial variants in cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy, it helps clinicians to escape from the potential VUS purgatory. Time is required to gather specific gene-disease and functional data for variants in these mysterious non-coding regions for pathogenicity determination. Until we gain more experience in handling WGS data for cardiac patients, careful patient selection is crucial before subjecting individuals with cardiomyopathy and channelopathy to WGS testing.\n\n    Considering the widespread use of WGS, it is extremely important for the interpretation of a cardiac genetic test to be provided by a team of providers with expertise in genetics and cardiology [Class IIA recommendation]. A multidisciplinary approach, comprising cardiologists, clinical geneticist, genetic counsellors, genome analysts and bioinformaticians, in an expert centre should therefore be adopted. A scientific statement from the American Heart Association has stressed the importance of the establishment of specialized clinical cardiovascular genetic programs. Expertise should be encouraged to be built up in a dedicated centre, especially the classification and interpretation of these genetic information can change over time as new information becomes available based on familial segregation studies and functional validation of genetic variants, resulting in significant differences in up to 18% of genetic results.\n\n    Despite applying WGS to investigate the molecular basis of clinically irrefutable phenotypes, it still remained gene elusive in some cases of paediatric channelopathy and cardiomyopathy in our cohort. In cardiac channelopathy, out of 77 cases with completion of genetic work-up using WGS, 9 of the cases (11.7%) still remained gene elusive without P/LP variants or clinical relevant VUS. Similarly, in cardiomyopathy, out of 61 cases with completion of genetic work-up using WGS, 16 of the cases (26.2%) still remained gene elusive without P/LP variants or clinical relevant VUS. This suggests that these conditions may not be solely explained by monogenic causes. Given the significant genetic and phenotype heterogeneity, as well as variable penetrance, a polygenic basis of these conditions is now being investigated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These studies aim to investigate the role of common variants (with a frequency of >1% in the general population) as protective or predisposing roles by incorporating polygenic risk scores. Such common variants are routinely screened out by exome or genome based genetic testing. Therefore, in addition to an approach to look for monogenic explanation by escalating searching for disease-causative variants, we should remain open-minded and consider alternative model to better explain the pathogenesis of cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy at molecular level.\n\n    The study included patients with varying initial genetic testing approaches, ranging from target genetic panel study (sanger sequencing/MLPA/next generation sequencing) to WES. The genes analyzed were selected based on the contemporary genomic knowledge of cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy at the time of genetic testing. There were expected discrepancies in the gene coverage for the panel tests employed our recruited patients, in their old testing. Due to the high cost in old era of genetic testing, either channelopathy or cardiomyopathy gene panels were employed. Initially, we considered repeating another gene panel testing or WES before recruitment into WGS testing. However, given that the diagnostic power of WGS has been proven to be superior to that of gene panel testing, we decided there was no need to validate its diagnostic power by duplicating the gene panel testing prior to recruitment. As for WGS, we used at least 30x depth for detailed analysis. We adjusted our hypothesis to test WGS's ability to identify intronic and spice-site variants in our special cohort. No matter what methodology of testing was employed in prior testing, intronic variants should not be picked up by conventional gene panel testing.\n\n    Although direct comparison of WES and WGS cannot be performed under this methodology, if the identified variants are outside the exome, it is logical to assume the inability for WES to detect these variants. In fact, all our intronic and splice-site variants were discovered in subjects with WES performed previously, this further supports our hypothesis that WGS can uncover those variants which were not detected by WES. Furthermore, we illustrate the role of WGS over WES in uncovering intronic variants in cardiomyopathy, but not cardiac channelopathy cases. Cardiomyopathy used to have lower genetic yield in exome-based testing when compared with channelopathy. Therefore, it is expected that more novel variants outside the coding regions will be discovered with this advanced technology in cardiomyopathy cases.\n\n    With regard to the gene coverage used in our WGS analysis, our gene panel list included all genes with definitive and moderate evidence in ClinGen for cardiac channelopathy and cardiomyopathy. Therefore, all the relevant and robust genes were included in the WGS analysis. For genes with disputed or limited evidence, only genes associated with the phenotypes with sufficient evidence were considered. In paediatrics, genes with recessive inheritance are increasingly recognized and discovered. Most of these genes were prioritized already for our analysis, except for those genes established as plausible genes after our study period, like BAG5, CAP2, FLII, KLHL24, LDB3, LEMD2, LMOD2, MYZAP. As open genome examination was employed in our WGS analysis, ample time was spent to ensure all relevant and updated genes were examined, followed by rectification of evidence necessary to establish the pathogenicity.\n\n    Patients with VUS genes of definitive or moderate evidence were not recruited for this WGS study because these relevant genes are likely attributed to the phenotype, although the evidence was not yet sufficient to upgrade those variants to likely pathogenic ones for clinical actions. Therefore, the yield of further advanced genetic test is expected to be low, and values of using WGS in this subgroup may require further studies to address.\n\n    Under current methodology, there were still 4 channelopathy and 5 cardiomyopathy patients recruited for WGS without repeating WES. Therefore, 3 variants in exome region in patient 4-6 were included in our report, which should be able to be picked up by contemporary gene panel testing or WES. Those MYH7 and RYR2 variants were not identified in prior gene testing because sanger sequencing/multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were employed to test certain hotspots in the gene. Therefore, this illustrates the importance of considering repeating testing in patients with a high probability of a specific inherited cardiac disease and a molecular screening performed in a pre-NGS era or with an incomplete NGS panel.\n\n    Our tertiary paediatric cardiology centre has been at the forefront of genetic testing for cardiac channelopathy cases in our region since 2007. All cases of channelopathy patients should have undergone initial genetic testing, but a few of patients might die before genetic testing can be offered. Therefore, our genetic database should represent almost all cases of paediatric channelopathy in Hong Kong. In terms of paediatric cardiomyopathy, routine genetic testing has only been implemented in the past 5 years. All our active cases were recruited to complete the genetic work-up using WES 2 years before this WGS recruitment. Therefore, our cohort may not include older or deceased cardiomyopathy patients who were not tested during the pre-genetic testing era. Finally, the recruitment process faced challenges as well, as a considerable number of patients either refused participation or could not be reached. Despite these difficulties, we were able to recruit 31 patients for WGS analysis.",

        "Title": "    Integrated Analysis of Metabolomic Profiling and Exome Data Supplements Sequence Variant Interpretation, Classification, and Diagnosis",
        "Abstract": "    A primary barrier to improving exome sequencing diagnostic rates is the interpretation of variants of uncertain clinical significance. We aimed to determine the contribution of integrated untargeted metabolomics in the analysis of exome sequencing data by retrospective analysis of patients evaluated by both whole exome sequencing and untargeted metabolomics within the same clinical laboratory.\n\n    Exome sequencing and untargeted metabolomic data were collected and analyzed for 170 patients. Pathogenic variants, likely pathogenic variants, and variants of uncertain significance in genes associated with a biochemical phenotype were extracted. Metabolomic data were evaluated to determine if these variants resulted in biochemical abnormalities which could be used to support their interpretation using current ACMG guidelines.\n\n    Metabolomic data contributed to the interpretation variants in 74 individuals (43.5%) over 73 different genes. The data allowed for the re-classification of 9 variants as likely benign, 15 variants as likely pathogenic, and 3 variants as pathogenic. Metabolomic data confirmed a clinical diagnosis in 21 cases, for a diagnostic rate of 12.3% in this population.\n\n    Untargeted metabolomics can serve as a useful adjunct to exome sequencing by providing valuable functional data that may not otherwise be clinically available, resulting in improved variant classification.",
        "Introduction": "    The utilization of exome sequencing has substantially increased our capacity to identify disease-causing variants across a variety of clinical indications; however, exome sequencing has a variable diagnostic rate, and many patients remain without a clear diagnosis for a variety of reasons. Methods of supporting a definitive diagnosis remain a cardinal challenge for clinical exome sequencing, and a significant limitation is observed at the level of variant interpretation and classification. Though the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) and Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) have attempted to streamline and standardize this process through the publication and dissemination of official guidelines and various recommendations, there is ample evidence that inter-laboratory variation continues to exist. Many of these discrepancies may be due to the lack of compelling and validated \"functional\" evidence as outlined in the ACMG framework. While in some cases such evidence can be easily obtained through complementary targeted biochemical testing or model organism studies, this is not always feasible or easily accomplished in a time-sensitive manner.\n\n    One approach to address this limitation would be to integrate untargeted metabolomic profiling with genomic analysis. Metabolomic profiling refers to the systematic identification and quantification of all substrates, intermediates, and metabolites in a given organism or biological sample at a point in time. In this way, a single test is able to assay multiple biochemical pathways at once and may lead to clear evidence of perturbations due solely to abnormalities in the variant in question. We have previously described the use of untargeted metabolomics in the screening and diagnosis of a variety of inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) and the identification of novel disease biomarkers. We have also demonstrated that untargeted metabolomics may be useful in the diagnosis of individuals at either end of a phenotypic spectrum, as in the case of several individuals with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency and in patients with GABA-transaminase deficiency. Here, metabolomic data were not only able to suggest a clinical diagnosis but also informed the choice of targeted molecular testing for additional confirmation. Untargeted metabolomics may, therefore, serve as a convenient and informative piece of strong functional data, and we have thus sought to use this combined approach in the analysis of a cohort of patient samples at our clinical laboratory.",
        "Methods": "    Clinical whole exome sequencing and global untargeted clinical metabolomic testing were ordered through a physician's office or institution through standard procedures. Samples were sent to the Baylor Genetics Laboratory (Houston TX - www.baylorgenetics.org) for processing and analysis. We surveyed our internal databases to identify cases where both metabolomic profiling and whole exome sequencing were requested for the same patient between May 2012 and August 2017. These studies were approved with a waiver of consent by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board.\n\n    Metabolomic profiling (Global MAPS ) was performed by Baylor Genetics (Houston, TX) (www.baylorgenetics.com), in collaboration with Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) (www.metabolon.com), as described previously using two different platform configurations in plasma, urine and/or CSF. On the first platform configuration, samples were subjected to four chromatographic analyses: GC-MS, LC-MS/MS in positive mode (LCMS Pos), LC-MS/MS in negative mode (LCMS Neg), and LC-MS/MS Polar method (LCMS Pol). On the second platform, samples were subjected to the same mass spectrometry methods with the following chromatographic methods: LCMS Neg, LCMS Pol, and LCMS positive ion method focusing on lipophilic compounds (LCMS Pos Lipid) and LCMS positive ion method focusing on polar compounds (LCMS Pos Polar). The chemical structures of known metabolites were identified by matching the ions' chromatographic retention index, nominal mass, and mass spectral fragmentation signatures with reference library entries created from authentic standard metabolites under the identical analytical procedure as the experimental samples. Raw spectral intensity values were normalized to the anchor samples, log transformed, and compared to a normal reference population to generate z-scores. Results were considered abnormally low if the z-score for a compound was equal or less than two standard deviations below the mean (i.e. <=2.00) or abnormally high if the z-score was equal or greater than two standard deviations above the mean (i.e. >=2.00) of the control reference population.\n\n    Whole exome sequencing data were acquired using previously described protocols developed by the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine and adapted for clinical testing. Classification criteria for likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants were based on the current ACMG-AMP guidelines, and a case was classified as molecularly diagnosed if pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in Mendelian disease genes that overlapped with described phenotypes of the patient in the appropriate inheritance pattern (i.e. biallelic for recessive disorders, etc.). Variant data were submitted to ClinVar, submission SUB7249674.\n\n    Integrated analysis of exome and metabolomic data was performed for each patient by extracting all pathogenic variants, likely pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance in genes associated with known inborn errors of metabolism (Supplementary Tables S1 - S5). Untargeted metabolomic data were treated as functional evidence based on the ACMG and AMP guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants (PS3/BS3). Metabolomic data were determined to confirm or upgrade a variant in the homozygous state or if the variant was in trans with another VUS, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant for an autosomal recessive disorder if there were characteristic analyte or metabolic pathway abnormalities. Metabolomic data supported the downgrade of a variant in the homozygous or hemizygous state if there were no abnormalities consistent with the IEM associated with that variant. The contribution of a variant was designated as ruled out in cases where there was no clear evidence of metabolic disturbances for a single VUS in the heterozygous state or in the case of compound heterozygous variants, and in these cases, no change in variant classification was made. Finally, metabolomic data were considered non-contributory or uninformative to variant interpretation if results were non-specific, contradictory to a clear molecular or clinical diagnosis, if a subject had no variants in a known IEM, or if the assay was unable to detect the biochemical signature of the IEM in question.",
        "Results": "    Our cohort consisted of 170 patients referred to our diagnostic laboratory for exome sequencing and contemporaneous untargeted metabolomics between May 2012 and August 2017 (Supplementary Table S1). Patients were, on average, 7.61 years of age at the time of testing, with approximately equal sex-distribution (56% male: 44% female). The majority of patients were referred for a primarily neurologic indication (91%). Of the 170 cases, 65 underwent trio whole exome sequencing (proband with both biological parents) while the remaining 105 underwent proband exome sequencing (with or without a parental control).\n\n    Out of 170 patients, 74 (74/170 = 43.5%) were found to have at least one variant in an IEM gene amenable to assessment by our metabolomics platform (Figure 1). These 74 individuals carried 145 variants in 73 different IEM genes, and metabolomic data contributed to the interpretation of 131 of these variants (131/145 = 90.3%) (Supplementary Table S2).\n\n    For 87 (87/145 = 60.0%) single, heterozygous variants in autosomal recessive conditions, metabolomic data were able to rule out any contribution in terms of being a biochemically symptomatic carrier or possessing a second disease causing allele not detected due to the constraints of WES.\n\n    Metabolomic data were able to contribute functional evidence to the interpretation of 42 (42/145 = 29%) identified variants, resulting in changes to their classification. Characteristic metabolomic profiles upgraded 18 variants (3 from LP to P and 15 from VUS to LP), while also downgrading 9 variants from VUS to LB. In addition, profiles also revealed confirmatory perturbations for 17 (17/145 = 11.7%) pathogenic variants and therefore resulted in no classification changes. These assertions were based on identifying biochemical signatures in (a) autosomal recessive disorders with corresponding homozygous or compound heterozygous variants, (b) autosomal dominant disorders with corresponding heterozygous variants, and (c) X-linked disorders with corresponding hemizygous or heterozygous variants.\n\n    The variant reclassification due to metabolomic data resulted in confirmed diagnoses in 21 individuals based on clear biochemical evidence of an IEM and the identification of homozygous and/or compound heterozygous variants in autosomal recessive conditions, hemizygous variants in an X-linked condition or single, heterozygous variants in autosomal dominant conditions. This approach resulted in an overall diagnostic rate of 12.3% (21/170 = 12.3% [Table 1]).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    With the increasing clinical use of exome sequencing and the implementation of clinical whole genome sequencing, there continues to be a need for tools capable of aiding in the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and complex genetic backgrounds. While improvements in bioinformatics and functional assays have helped to alleviate some of this burden, there can still be significant limitations. Often these analyses result in imprecise and sometimes conflicting conclusions or require significant time in order to design and conduct an appropriate assay that may not have established clinical validity (i.e. research only testing). Of the 73 unique genes assayed by our metabolomic platform, for example, only 21 (21/73 = 28%) had readily available functional or confirmatory biochemical testing available in the United States (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/).\n\n    Our results indicate that untargeted metabolomics can serve as a rapid and comprehensive way to screen variants of uncertain clinical significance. The test has the advantage of being able to detect aberrations in hundreds of molecules indicative of many different metabolic pathways not easily assayed through standard biochemical assays. In this study, when assessed in conjunction with exome sequencing, untargeted metabolomic data were found to contribute to variant interpretation in 43.5% of cases (Figure 1). For most of these variants, metabolomic profiling helped to rule out any likely clinical contribution, while in 22 cases, the data allowed for classification upgrade or confirmation of pathogenicity and diagnosis. Though our study population appears biased towards patients with neurologic disorders, this is consistent with previously reported pediatric referral indications to our clinical laboratory. Similarly, the majority of untargeted metabolomic samples were obtained from plasma, likely due to the ease with which this may be obtained, particularly in a pediatric population. Our results also highlight how useful metabolomic data can be in instances where an individual is found to carry only a single pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in an IEM, either ruling out disease or supporting the need to look further for a second pathogenic variant. Caution should be taken, however, in the interpretation of variants associated with diseases in which patients may only intermittently manifest with metabolic abnormalities. It is well recognized, for example, that individuals with intermittent forms of maple syrup urine disease may exhibit normal biochemical markers outside of acute decompensations. For example, in the present study for Patient 145 with biallelic variants in ALDOB consistent with hereditary fructose intolerance, metabolomic analysis showed only mildly elevated fructose, though it is possible that the patient had been treated at the time of sampling making it difficult to detect more characteristic abnormalities. This case highlights one important facet of metabolomic and other biochemical analyte analyses that should always be considered - the analysis reflects a patient's biochemical features at a single point in time, reflecting diet, supplements, and medications at the time the sample is taken.\n\n    Our study, however, has some limitations. While our current metabolomic platform is able to detect the characteristic metabolic signatures of >100 inborn errors of metabolism, there are many disorders not currently reliably detectable by this method. These include mitochondrial respiratory complex deficiencies, glycogen storage disorders, most lysosomal storage disorders, and rare enzyme defects not previously assayed in our laboratory that require additional study and validation. Additionally, while untargeted metabolomic data in combination with whole exome/genome data may suggest or point to a specific diagnosis, in some cases, these findings may need to be confirmed via traditional assays, such as enzyme activity or assessment of additional body fluids, until associations are more clearly understood.\n\n    Our study also, however, highlights deficiencies in the way functional studies are treated in the current ACMG/AMP guidelines. At present, functional data may only be categorized as \"PS3\" or \"BS3\", that is strongly supportive of either a variant's pathogenicity or benign nature. Amended categorizations based on differing levels of support would be useful given the variable degrees of enzyme defects and the effects of treatment regimens or dietary interventions on biochemical phenotypes. Patient 1 (Table 1), for example, displayed minor abnormalities only modestly consistent with their molecular diagnoses which may or may not be due to hypomorphic alleles or a specific treatment intervention. This stands in stark contrast to Patient 92 where metabolomics identified the diagnostic signature of a peroxisomal disorder quite clearly. As the use of metabolomics continues to grow, there will be a need for additional ways of categorizing such data in a clear, standardized manner in the context of clinical outcomes.",

        "Title": "    Enhanced Learning and Memory in Patients with CRB1 Retinopathy",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations in the CRB1 gene are associated with a diverse spectrum of retinopathies with phenotypic variability causing severe visual impairment. The CRB1 gene has a role in retinal development and is expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but its role in cognition has not been described before. This study compares cognitive function in CRB1 retinopathy individuals with subjects with other retinopathies and the normal population. Methods: Neuropsychological tests of cognitive function were used to test individuals with CRB1 and non-CRB1 retinopathies and compare results with a standardised normative dataset. Results: CRB1 retinopathy subjects significantly outperformed those with non-CRB1 retinopathy in list learning tasks of immediate (p = 0.001) and delayed memory (p = 0.007), tests of semantic verbal fluency (p = 0.017), verbal IQ digit span subtest (p = 0.037), and estimation test of higher execution function (p = 0.020) but not in the remaining tests of cognitive function (p > 0.05). CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored significantly higher than the normal population in all areas of memory testing (p < 0.05) and overall verbal IQ tests (p = 0.0012). Non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored significantly higher than the normal population in story recall, verbal fluency, and overall verbal IQ tests (p = 0.0016). Conclusions: Subjects with CRB1 retinopathy may have enhanced cognitive function in areas of memory and learning. Further work is required to understand the role of CRB1 in cognition.",
        "Introduction": "    Biallelic pathogenic variants in the crumbs cell polarity complex component 1 gene (CRB1, OMIM 604210) are associated with a diverse spectrum of retinopathies with phenotypic variability. The phenotypes reported are Leber congenital amaurosis (OMIM #613935, LCA8), early onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD), autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (OMIM #600105, RP12), cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), and macular dystrophy (MD). Distinctive features of CRB1 retinopathies are nummular pigmentation, fine yellow punctate deposits, preserved para-arteriolar retinal pigment epithelium (PPRPE), and coarse and thickened retina. The CRB1 gene encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein, which is localised to the sub-apical region of the Muller cells and photoreceptors. In the retina, it is known that CRB1 has a role in retinal development and maintaining retinal integrity, a key component of the zonula adherens junctions at the external limiting membrane (ELM) and contributing to vascular integrity and apicobasal polarity. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revealed thicker retinas with abnormal retinal lamination. This is attributed to an enriched retinal progenitor population with higher cell proliferation with inhibited cell fate progression, resulting in cell detachment during retinal development.\n\n    CRB1 exhibits distinct expression patterns outside the eye. In murine embryos, it is expressed at the ventral area of the neural tube. In adult mouse brains, it is expressed in the cerebellum, hippocampal dentate gyrus, olfactory bulbs, rostral migratory stream, and the subventricular area lining the telencephalic ventricles. Notably, these are the brain areas where neurogenesis occurs. Furthermore, CRB1 is expressed in other brain areas, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (, accessed on 8 August 2019). The hippocampus is known to be critical for memory and learning, and CRB1 expression peaks in this region during embryogenesis and early foetal development (, accessed on 8 August 2019).\n\n    Genetic contribution to human cognition has been established. Within the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the high expression of the SSRT4, PNMT, LRTM2, and DRD3 genes is critical for memory formation and learning. Disruption of MDK, a gene highly expressed in the basal layer of the cerebral cortex with a critical role in neurogenesis and hippocampal development, is associated with memory impairment. Pathogenic variants in BBS1, CWC27, and SCAPER cause a retinal dystrophy with cognitive impairment. However, our understanding of genetic variations that augment cognitive capacities remains limited. Using an established paradigm to study cognitive function, one study reported a family with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy and enhanced cognitive ability, who harboured a heterozygous missense variant (c.2459G > A, p.Arg820His) in RIMS1, a gene known to be expressed in the ventricular zone, thalami, and hippocampus areas of the brain. However, they subsequently reported co-inheritance of a heterozygous missense variant (c.1118C > T, p.Arg373Cys) in PROM1, which is a gene known to be putative in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. It is not known which gene/variant, or if both, may be associated with their augmented cognition. Two kindreds (A and B) with cone-rod dystrophy who harboured the PROM1 c.1117C > T p.Arg373Cys variant underwent cognitive function testing using the same established paradigm; three out of four affected family members from kindred A displayed average-to-superior verbal memory recall. However, in kindred B, verbal learning was delayed in one affected individual and average in the other. Genes such as PAX6 are expressed in the eye and brain, but individuals with haploinsufficiency (resulting in aniridia) do not demonstrate enhanced intellectual ability or verbal memory compared with normal controls. Moreover, RasGRF1-deficient mice showed impaired learning abilities and memory performance with retinal degeneration, suggesting an association between retinopathy and memory defects. This study aims to determine whether individuals with CRB1 retinopathy have enhanced cognitive function in areas of learning and memory, when compared to those with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) associated with variants in other genes with a comparable degree and onset of visual loss, as well as unaffected individuals from the normal population.",
        "Methods": "    A prospective neuropsychological study from patients with IRDs was performed. Subjects reviewed at a single tertiary referral centre (Moorfields Eye Hospital) with molecularly confirmed CRB1-related retinopathy were consecutively recruited, and subjects with molecularly confirmed non-CRB1 retinopathy and similar level of visual impairment were recruited in parallel. Ethical approval was provided by the Joint Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queens Square, and the study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    Subjects with a history of other co-morbidities which may impair cognitive function including but not limited to stroke; neurodegenerative disease, e.g., parkinsonism and Alzheimer's; traumatic brain injury/traumatic amnesia; psychiatric disorders, e.g., schizophrenia and depression; or patients with variants in syndromic retinal genes known to negatively affect cognitive function [e.g., Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS1)] were excluded.\n\n    To account for visual impairment, cognitive function was assessed using standardised neuropsychological tests that did not involve visual processing and required only verbal interaction. The testing protocol was the same as that used for previous collaborative investigations and is detailed in the Supplementary Material (see Supplemental Material Table S1). All testing was carried out by a Clinical Neuropsychologist (PT, MM, and HC).\n\n    A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare mean test scores of CRB1 retinopathy subjects with non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects. Mean test scores for both groups were also compared to published normative mean scores (for a standardisation sample (n = 1580) of normally sighted individuals without ocular disease, aged 16-75 years who had undergone neurophysiological testing using the same procedure, see), as per previous collaborative investigations. Sum of scaled normative data scores SPSS (Version 25) was used to analyse these data.",
        "Results": "    A total of 63 subjects were recruited, 21 with CRB1 retinopathy and 42 with vision loss due to other inherited ocular conditions. All 63 subjects had a diagnosis of IRDs or congenital visual loss confirmed by clinical examination, visual acuity tests, fundus imaging, and molecular confirmation of pathogenic variants in CRB1, KCNV2, BEST1, PAX6, and RDH12 in accredited clinical laboratories. Four sib-ships and four kindreds were recruited: one sib-ship with CRB1 and one with RDH12 retinopathy, two sib-ships and three kindreds with PAX6, and one kindred with PROM1. As cognitive function is correlated in first-degree relatives, a mean of the scores for each sib-ship and kindred was used in this analysis. The mean age at testing for CRB1 and non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects was 36 (SD +- 11.2) and 38 (SD +- 13.1) years, respectively. The mean age of onset of vision loss was 4.1 (SD +- 4.1) and 6.7 (SD +- 4.7) years, respectively. The mean visual acuity at the time of testing was 1.84 (SD +- 0.7) logMAR for CRB1 retinopathy individuals and 1.4 (SD +- 0.6) logMAR for non-CRB1 retinopathy individuals. Details of the demographic characteristics of this cohort are reported in Supplementary Table S2.\n\n    Common clinical features of CRB1 retinopathy, as shown in Figure 1A, included widespread nummular pigmentation, peripheral pigment migration, dense hypo-autofluorescence depicted on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, a coarse, thickened retina with retinal disorganisation, thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and loss of the ellipsoid zone seen on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging. Figure 1C depicts the clinical features of a non-CRB1 patient with an RDH12 gene mutation, showing bone spicules, macular atrophy, dense hypo-autofluorescence, and retinal thinning, including thinning of the ONL and loss of the ellipsoid zone on SD-OCT.\n\n    No significant differences were observed between the two groups of retinopathy subjects in the story recall immediate (p = 0.111) and delayed (p = 0.057) memory tests [Figure 2A] or in the verbal fluency phonemic subtest (p = 0.363) [Figure 2B]. CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored significantly higher than non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects in the list learning tasks of immediate (p = 0.001) and delayed memory (p = 0.007) [Figure 2C], in the verbal fluency semantic subtest (p = 0.017) [Figure 2B], and in the Hayling test of mental processing speed (p = 0.068) [Figure 2D]. Additionally, CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored higher in the cognitive estimation test of higher executive function (p = 0.020) [Figure 3C] and in the verbal IQ digit span subtest compared to the non-CRB1 group (p = 0.037) [Figure 3A]. No significant differences were found in overall verbal IQ (p = 0.142) [Figure 3B] or in the verbal IQ vocabulary (p = 0.436) and similarities (p = 0.208) subtests [Figure 3A].\n\n    CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored significantly higher than the normal population in both story recall (p = 0.0001) memory tests [Figure 2A], in immediate (p = 0.0001) and delayed (p = 0.0004) list learning tests [Figure 2C], both verbal fluency tests (p = 0.0001) [Figure 3B], in the digit span (p = 0.0003) verbal IQ subtest which assesses immediate short term memory recall, verbal IQ similarities subtest (p = 0.002), and overall verbal IQ tests (p = 0.001) [Figure 3A,B]. There were no significant differences in the Hayling test of mental processing speed (p = 0.349) [Figure 2D], in the vocabulary verbal IQ subtest (p = 0.648) [Figure 3A], and in cognitive estimation tests of higher executive function (p = 0.403) [Figure 3C].\n\n    Non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored significantly higher than the normal population in story recall (p = 0.0001) [Figure 2A]. No significant differences were seen in the list learning immediate (p = 0.6603) and delayed (p = 0.800) memory tests [Figure 2C] and in the verbal IQ digit span (p = 0.060) and vocabulary (p = 0.366) subtests [Figure 3A]. Additionally, non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored significantly higher than the normal population in both verbal fluency tests (p = 0.0001) [Figure 3B], in the similarities verbal IQ subtest (p = 0.001) [Figure 3A], and in the overall verbal IQ tests (p = 0.001) [Figure 3B].

        "Conclusion": "    Understanding the molecular processes involved in memory is a challenging and growing field. Any Mendelian disorder, such as CRB1 retinopathy, in which cognition appears enhanced suggests a biological pathway of importance in this process that is yet to be discovered. This study provides insights into the role of CRB1 in the eye and brain, and further studies are required to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to enhanced cognition.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    This is the first study to report elements of enhanced cognitive function in areas of learning and memory in subjects with biallelic CRB1 retinopathy. CRB1 patients outperformed non-CRB1 patients in tests of immediate and delayed memory, higher executive cognitive function, and some aspects of verbal fluency which facilitates stored memory retrieval. They also scored significantly higher than the normal population in all memory and verbal fluency tests, in overall verbal IQ tests, including the digit span subtest which assesses short term memory. Non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects scored significantly higher than the normal population in verbal fluency tasks and in some, but not all, memory tests, and they scored significantly lower in tests of higher executive cognitive function and mental processing speed.\n\n    Individuals with sight impairments are considered to have enhanced working memory capacity, memory processing, and verbal ability. This raises questions about whether there is a causal relationship between variants in CRB1 and enhanced memory and learning abilities in CRB1 retinopathy subjects, or if these improvements are the consequence of early-onset blindness, a known factor that triggers compensatory neuroplasticity and the reorganisation of neural circuits. Careful control for the effects of blindness in different groups was undertaken, by comparing the CRB1 retinopathy group to a group of subjects with a similar age of onset of visual impairment and similar degree of sight impairment. The mean age of onset of vision loss was 4.1 (SD +- 4.1) in CRB1 patients and 6.7 (SD +- 4.7) years in non-CRB1 retinopathy, and the mean visual acuity was 1.84 (SD +- 0.7) logMAR and 1.4 (SD +- 0.6) logMAR, respectively. Additionally, careful control for the known effects of increased age on cognitive function was undertaken by having groups with similar mean ages 36 (SD +- 11.2) years for CRB1 patients and 38 (SD +- 13.1) years for non-CRB1 retinopathy patients). The findings of this study suggest that biallelic CRB1 pathogenic variants could further enhance cognitive function in subjects with visual impairment.\n\n    Previous evidence suggests an association between genetic mutations in eye-brain-expressed genes and the enhancement of some areas of cognitive function in humans. A kindred of eight individuals with variants in PROM1 c.1117C > T p.Arg373Cys and RIMS1 c.2459G > A, p.Arg820His and seven unaffected individuals underwent cognitive testing. Affected individuals were found to have above average scores in verbal IQ tests that involved nonvisual processing. However, their scores in memory and executive function tests were variable, with some scores below average. The enhancement of some cognitive domains was attributed to genetic mutation rather than impaired visual function. A kindred of four with the same PROM1 c.1117C > T p.Arg373Cys variant displayed superior memory recall. However, one individual was found to have delayed learning. Wang et al. observed the enhancement of recognition memory in the murine forebrain following the overexpression of type-1 adenylyl cyclase (ADCY1), a gene known to be crucial in hippocampus memory formation by increasing cyclic AMP, which positively regulates synaptic plasticity. They postulated that a shift in the balance between negative and positive regulators whose activities counteract one another, e.g., protein phosphatases versus protein kinases, could occur following transgenic overexpression, may induce further synaptic plasticity, and that the enhancement of protein kinase (MAPK) signalling can increase memory recognition. However, they also suggested that such an enhancement of one area of memory had the potential to impair the function of another.\n\n    Earlier studies have shown that mutations in the CA1 hippocampal region-expressed genes have detrimental effects on hippocampus-dependent memory tasks: in CNB1 gene knockout mice, working memory and synaptic plasticity were impaired, suggesting that rather than enhancing performance, the mutation induces the inhibition of crucial components of memory regulation. Moreover, deletion of the ryanodine receptor type 3 (RyR3) gene in mice has been shown to impair some forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial learning. RyR3 deletion negatively affects long-term potentiation and depotentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region and dentate gyrus, leading to deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and reduced performance in spatial memory tasks. No memory impairment was observed in our CRB1 retinopathy subjects; in fact, all areas of memory not reliant on vision were enhanced compared to the normal population.\n\n    Molecular changes in brain-expressed genes have been found to positively influence memory and other areas of cognition. Deletion of 5-HT1B (a gene thought to modify cognitive behaviour) in mice resulted in enhanced spatial memory performance and facilitated learning abilities. The NR2B (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, a synaptic coincidence detector critical for learning and memory formation, acts as a \"molecular switch\" in the memory process. Tang et al. demonstrated that NR2B transgene overexpression in the cortex and hippocampus of adult mice resulted in superior performance in several hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks and they outperformed age-matched controls into old age. Enhanced cognition is also associated with variants in further brain-expressed genes cb1-b, TLCN, and CREB.\n\n    CRB1 is expressed in the hippocampus, an area of the brain critical for learning and memory. However, the association of CRB1 with memory and learning is yet to be explained. Biallelic CRB1 mutation causes isolated retinal dystrophy without brain dysfunction. The overexpression of CRBE2 (a member of the crumbs cell polarity complex, expressed in retinal pigment epithelium and the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum of adult mouse brains, and an essential regulator for neuronal differentiation during neurogenesis) is induced in the cortex of the CRB1rd8 mutant mouse brain, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism for CRB1 dysfunction. CRB1 is integral to tight junctions and apical-basal polarity and the lack of it results in increased cell proliferation in the retina and cells in a proliferative phase. If this was also seen in the hippocampus, maybe there is an increased number of cells and loss of lamination that may allow for increased neuronal growth/synaptic plasticity. This expression occurs in foetal stages, so increased cell proliferation in that area may enhance memory capacity. However, further studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.\n\n    There is evidence that early-onset blindness can result in training-induced neuroplastic changes in humans and animals, whereby if one cortical area is deprived of adequate sensory input during early development, the reorganisation of the non-deprived senses occurs by means of cross-modal synaptic plasticity. Loss of function mutations in the cone-rod homeobox-containing gene (CRX) in knockout mice demonstrated sensory compensation and striking adaptions to their environment by utilising non-visual information 5 days after visual loss. Moreover, decades of research in humans suggested that congenital blindness results in superior memory and learning abilities resulting from environmentally induced compensatory alterations within the occipital cortex. fMRI studies have demonstrated that sensory reorganisation and recruitment of other sensory modalities occurs in the congenitally blind brain, with increased activation and neuroplastic changes occurring within the occipital cortex. Whether these striking adaptions and enhancement of memory and learning in the blind brain is entirely environmentally dependent or whether variants in genes also expressed in the brain can increase the potential for synaptic plasticity is yet to be established.\n\n    Investigation of whether there is a correlation between the severity of CRB1 retinopathy and memory enhancement could lead to valuable insights, particularly considering the established link between compensatory cross-modal neuroplasticity in blind individuals and the extent of their visual impairment. Furthermore, assessing the cognitive abilities of CRB1 knockout mice or other associated disease models could offer a different perspective on its function in the brain and whether its absence induces synaptic neuroplasticity.\n\n    There are some limitations to our study: the raw normative dataset was not available to the investigators, therefore it was only feasible to perform statistical analysis using mean values, instead of median values, for each group of subjects. It was not possible to control for the known effects of gender, educational level, and socio-economic status on cognitive function as this would have significantly reduced the sample size. A further control group of CRB1 carriers was not available. It is noteworthy that whilst both retinopathy groups had similar visual acuity levels at time of testing, 68% of CRB1 retinopathy subjects had unrecordable or severely restricted visual fields, which would have further affected overall levels of visual impairment for this group, whereas only a proportion (28%) of the non-CRB1 retinopathy subjects had field loss. This could have influenced test performance, given that the enhancement of memory performance appears to be more profound in individuals who have no useful measurable vision. A total of 80% of CRB1 retinopathy subjects had achieved a minimum of A-level education compared with 55% of subjects in the non-CRB1 retinopathy group. This could imply that the CRB1 group was biased in relation to educational attainment, particularly as educational level and cognitive function positively correlate. However, it may also suggest that patients with CRB1 retinopathy have superior learning abilities, which concurs with their significantly higher scores in the list learning and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Finally, PAX6 mutation patients were included as part of the non-CRB1 group, PAX6 mutations play a fundamental role in brain development, and there is evidence that PAX6 mutations correlate with anatomical and functional changes.",

        "Abstract": "    Familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP) is a rare form of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty that is caused by an activating mutation of the LHCGR gene. Herein, we report a case of FMPP with a mutation of the LHCGR gene in a Korean boy with familial history of precocious puberty through 3 generations. A 16-month-old boy presented with signs of precocious puberty, including pubic hair, acne, and increased growth velocity. The patient's grandfather and father had a history of precocious puberty and profound short stature. On physical examination, the patient had prepubertal testes with pubic hair development appropriate for Tanner stage II. The stretched penile length was 7 cm (>2 standard deviation score), and observed bone age was that of a 4-year-old boy. Laboratory findings showed high serum testosterone (5.74 ng/mL [appropriate for Tanner IV-V]; normal range, <0.05 ng/mL) with suppressed luteinizing hormone (<0.07 mIU/mL) and normal serum level of follicular stimulating hormone (0.56 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.38-1.11 mIU/mL). Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic variant of LHCGR (c.1730 C>T (p.Thr577Ileu)), confirming FMPP. Bicalutamide and anastrozole were administered, and pubertal progression was sufficiently suppressed without any specific side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first case of genetically confirmed FMPP in Korea.",
        "Introduction": "    Familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP) is a rare disorder characterized by early onset gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty. This report presents an extremely rare case of FMPP with an activating mutation of the LHCGR gene in a Korean boy who presented with precocious pubertal development at 16 months of age and a positive familial history of precocious puberty.\n\n    Familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP; OMIM #176410) is a very rare cause of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty and is exclusively expressed in males. FMPP is caused by activating mutations of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) gene that are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This results in excessive testosterone production by the Leydig cells despite low luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. This activating mutation in LHCGR affects only males because activation of the LH receptor alone is sufficient to stimulate steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. In females, co-activation of the FSH receptor is definitely required to stimulate granulosa cells to synthesize aromatase, which converts androgens produced by the thecal cells to estradiol, but the precise underlying mechanism remains elusive.\n\n    In affected males, early signs of precocious puberty usually appear at 2-4 years of age. Rapid growth and bone age advancement result from the conversion of androgens to estrogens by the enzyme aromatase. Without treatment, rapidly progressive precocious puberty and accelerated skeletal maturation result in compromised final adult height. Diagnosis of FMPP is confirmed by identifying an activating mutation in the LHCGR gene. The goals of treatment are to suppress pubertal progression by reducing the effects of testosterone and to increase final adult height by inhibiting the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen.\n\n    In this report, we describe a boy with a familial history of precocious puberty confirmed by a mutation of the LHCGR gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of genetically confirmed FMPP in a Korean boy. Written informed consent for publication of this report was obtained from the patient's parents.",

        "Discussion": "    In this report, we describe an extremely rare case of FMPP with a mutation of the LHCGR gene in a Korean boy who presented with precocious puberty at 16 months of age and a family history of precocious puberty through 3 generations. To our knowledge, this is the first case of genetically confirmed FMPP in Korea.\n\n    LHCGR is a member of a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular domain containing several leucine-rich repeats. The gene comprises 11 exons, spanning approximately 80 kb, mapped on chromosome 2p16.3. The gain-of-function mutation of LHCGR causes FMPP with autosomal dominant inheritance, whereas the loss-of-function mutation results in Leydig cell hypoplasia with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism of males or 46, XY disorder of sex development. The mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (OMIM *152790).\n\n    FMPP is one of the rarest causes of peripheral precocious puberty, exclusively affecting males. It was first described in 1981 by Schedewie et al. in 2 brothers with rapid virilization, increased bone age, and advanced spermatogenesis. Variable clinical features of precocious puberty and advanced bone age were observed in subsequent reports. The characteristics and pathogenic variants of patients with FMPP in recent case reports are summarized in Table 2. The onset age of symptoms ranged from 6 months to 6.6 years, and only 2 patients were younger than the patient in the present case. Among the 7 unrelated patients who underwent parental genotyping, mutations were inherited from 3 affected fathers and 3 asymptomatic carrier mothers, and 1 patient had a de novo mutation (Table 2).\n\n    The mutation spectrum of the LHCGR gene causing FMPP is heterogeneous; however, activating mutations that were identified in boys with FMPP, including that in our case, are primarily located in exon 11, which encodes transmembrane helices. An activating mutation either disrupts the inactive state or stabilizes the active-state conformation of the LHCGR protein, resulting in persistently elevated LHCGR signal transduction in testicular Leydig cells, with excessive testosterone production.\n\n    The therapeutic goals of FMPP are to suppress pubertal progression and to delay epiphyseal fusion to increase final adult height. Virilization can be abated by reducing the peripheral effects of testosterone on the androgen receptor or inhibiting testosterone synthesis. Epiphyseal fusion can be delayed by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to estrogen or by blocking the action of estrogens at the epiphyses. Longacting GnRH agonists were the primary treatment before the discovery of the molecular mechanism of FMPP; such agonists were ineffective as they could not suppress the action of elevated testosterone. After the pathophysiology was better understood, antiandrogen drugs, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, cyproterone, and ketoconazole, were used. These medications decreased testosterone secretion, growth velocity, and skeletal maturation but showed limited efficacy in improving final height. In addition, ketoconazole showed serious side effects, including hepatotoxicity and adrenal suppression. A therapeutic regimen that combines spironolactone (a weak antiandrogen) and testolactone (an aromatase inhibitor) with deslorelin (a long-acting GnRH analog) at the onset of central precocious puberty has been shown to normalize the growth rate and bone maturation and to improve predicted height in boys with FMPP. Most recent studies have demonstrated that the combination of bicalutamide (an antiandrogen) and anastrozole (a third-generation aromatase inhibitor) has shown better height outcomes than previous reports. This combination treatment showed better potential for the preservation of final adult height than treatment with either agent alone. Our patient also received this combination treatment and showed an impressive clinical response in pubertal progression, growth velocity, and skeletal maturation without any side effects.\n\n    Treatment regimens have evolved over the years, but there is no consensus regarding optimal treatment. Testosterone is not a good indicator for treatment efficacy, and clinical and auxological parameters are more important. Long-term follow-up that focuses on the auxological parameters rather than biochemical profiles is required. In our patient, treatment efficacy was monitored by physical examination and bone age progression. Bicalutamide and anastrozole may interfere with normal sex steroid profiles. However, information on the longterm effects on testicular function, lipid profiles, and bone mineral accrual of this therapeutic combination is limited, and further research is required.\n\n    In conclusion, we described a case of FMPP in a Korean boy that was confirmed by identifying an LHCGR gene mutation. FMPP appears to be exceptionally rare or underrecognized in the Korean population. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of peripheral precocious puberty, particularly when the family history of precocious puberty is limited to male family members.\n\n    Conflicts of interest\n\n    No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\n\n    Funding\n\n    This study received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n    Author contribution\n\n    Conceptualization: HWY; Data curation: JH; Formal analysis: JH; Methodology: JH, YC; Project administration: JH, YC; Visualization: JH, YC; Writing - original draft: JH; Writing - review & editing: MKJ, HWY, EGY, MKJ",

        "Title": "    Frequency of CDH1 Germline Mutations in Non-Gastric Cancers",
        "Abstract": "    Diffuse gastric cancer is the hallmark of the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome related with the E-cadherin germline mutations. Other cancers (non-gastric) are described in association with the CDH1 gene germline alterations. In this study, we aimed to assess the overall frequency of CDH1 mutations in non-gastric tumors reported in literature so far.\n\n    Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is a complex inherited syndrome caused by CDH1 germline mutations. DGC is the hallmark cancer of this genetic predisposition, but several other cancers are associated with these CDH1 mutations. In this review, we revised all studies reporting CDH1 mutations in non-GC patients. The selected studies included: (a) families aggregating with GC and other cancers, both, and (b) families presenting only non-gastric tumors association. Among non-gastric tumors, our results show that CDH1 mutations are most frequently identified in breast cancer. The frequency of missense mutations is higher in the non-GC group, as the age at diagnosis in this group. Moreover, the predominant CDH1 mutation affects the extracellular domain. Our data suggest that CDH1 genetic testing should be considered also in other cancers, especially breast tumors.",
        "Introduction": "    Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome that is associated with an increased risk of two major cancer types: diffuse gastric cancer (GC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC). In particular germline alterations of the E-cadherin gene, CDH1, occur in about 40% of all HDGC cases screened, with an estimated lifetime risk of diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) of 70% in men and 56% in women, and a cumulative incidence of LBC in women of around 42%. The need for correct management for this inherited cancer predisposition created the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) in 1999. Since then, international multidisciplinary groups have been establishing and updating the clinical criteria for early disease diagnosis and for the detection of patients who should be eligible for germline CDH1 genetic screening. The more recent revised guidelines establish HDGC as any family with one of the following clinical criteria: (1) families with two or more certain cases of GC at any age, one with documented DGC; (2) personal history of DGC before the age of 40 years; (3) personal or family history of DGC and LBC, with one diagnosis before 50 years of age. Although DGC is the index tumor type in HDGC, other malignant cancers, and congenital malformations, have been reported in families affected by this syndrome. For that reason, LBC, oral facial clefts, colorectal carcinomas (CRC), and other cancers, have been suggested as suitable for CDH1 screening and early detection of HDGC. However, except for LBC, their inclusion in HDGC clinical definition is not yet supported due lack of robust data.\n\n    With this in mind, we have reviewed the literature for all CDH1 germline mutations in the non-DGC spectrum, as well LBC, and other epithelial cancers.",
        "Methods": "    We reviewed all CDH1 germline mutations reported in MEDLINE (, accessed on 12 March 2021) in individuals with diagnosed GC or other cancers, from 1998 to 2020, including original reports and literature reviews in English. The following terms were used for the literature search: E-cadherin; CDH1 gene; germline mutation; genetic screening; HDGC; IGCLC; familial GC; diffuse histotype; lobular histotype; BC; Maori kindred and prophylactic gastrectomy. This analysis was limited to studies involving subjects with HDGC, early-onset GC, and unselected GC patients screened for CDH1 germline mutations, LBC, CRC, prostate cancer (PC), ovarian cancer (OC), abdominal carcinosis (Ca), thyroid cancer (ThC), tongue cancer (ToC), in which at least one likely pathogenic, VUS or pathogenic CDH1 variant was identified. Mutation types were classified as missense, splice site, deletion, insertion, and nonsense alterations.\n\n    We considered two groups: (a) families aggregating with GC and non-GC both, and (b) families associating with other tumors.",
        "Results": "    Table 1 resumes CDH1 germline mutations identified in the non-GC population. Other details on the frequency of CDH1 mutations in HDGC syndrome were previously described in our recent study. Twenty-three families presented non-GC in their history, but only other tumor types. Instead, fifteen families aggregated with GC and other tumors, both. The mean age at diagnosis for individual CDH1 mutant carriers with GC was 40.6 years (range 21-79), and for other cancers 50.6 years (range 23-63).\n\n    We identified 54 CDH1 germline mutations in non-gastric tumors. The most frequent tumor associated with CDH1 germline mutations was BC (33/54, 61.1%), following prostate cancer (PC) (9/54, 16.7%), CRC (7/54, 12.9%), abdominal carcinosis (Ca) (2/54, 3.7%), ovarian cancer (OC) (1/54, 1.8%), thyroid cancer (ThC) (1/54, 1.8%), and tongue cancer (ToC) (1/54, 1.8%) (Figure 1). Regarding BC, interestingly we observed that in non-GC families, BC with CDH1 mutations occurs with a frequency of 42.6% (23/54), and in mixed families 18.5% (10/54). Thus, let us suppose that BC with CDH1 mutation aggregates more frequently with an independent pathway.\n\n    Considering the 54 CDH1 germline mutations identified in non-GC, we verified that the frequency type of mutations were as follows: missense 48.2% (26/54), splice site 18.5% (10/54), deletion 11.1% (6/54), insertion 11.1% (6/54), and nonsense 11.1% (6/54), respectively. With regard to the localization of the mutations identified in non-GC cancers, we verified that the majority of CDH1 mutations affected the extracellular domain (31/54, 57.4%), followed by precursor (13/54, 24.1%), signal (6/54, 11.1%), cytoplasmic (3/54, 5.6%), and transmembrane (1/54, 1.8%) domains (Figure 2).\n\n    Considering the ClinVar classification, and the submitted mutations, we identified only the S270A mutation classified as \"VUS\". Most of the collected mutations were not submitted at the ClinVar platform.",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, in comparison with our previous study, our results suggest that about 7% of the overall CDH1 mutations are present in non-gastric tumors. The majority of mutations are identified in BC, and the age at diagnosis is higher in other cancers, in comparison to GC group. It is plausible that non-GC cancers are a late manifestation of the HDGC syndrome. Mutations affect predominantly the cytoplasmatic domain of CDH1 gene, a vulnerable place that exerts a pivotal role in the cell-cell adhesion and polarization. CDH1 missense mutations are more frequent in non-gastric tumors (48.2%), and other factors could play a synergistic role with missense mutations in the development of non-GCs. At this moment, the value of CDH1 testing in non-GC cancers other than BC may not be high, given the paucity of evidence. A prospective study may be of more value in changing clinical practice.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    After lung and colorectal cancer, GC remains the third cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with about 1.2 million cases and almost one million deaths worldwide, and still is the leading cause of cancer and cancer death in selected low-income areas. The substantial variations over geographic areas and declines in incidence and mortality over the last few decades indicate that most GCs have an environmental origin, Helicobacter pylori infection being by far its main cause. However, there is a well identified and quantified family clustering of GC, with relative risks around two for a family history of GC in first degree relatives, after accounting for recognized environmental factors, with generally stronger associations at a younger age. Therefore, understanding and quantifying the key components of familial and genetic factors on the different pathologic types of GC remains of key interest for understanding pathogenesis and defining early diagnosis and, hence, management. Furthermore, it might contribute to increase quality of life and the patient's involvement in clinical decision-making.\n\n    The CDH1 gene (OMIM No. 192090) is located on chromosome 16q22.1 and encodes for the E-cadherin protein. This macro-molecule is a trans- membrane glycoprotein expressed on epithelial tissue and is responsible for calcium-dependent, cell-to-cell adhesion. E-cadherin protein is critical for establishing and maintaining polarized and differentiated epithelia through intercellular adhesion complexes. The human E-cadherin function is to suppress cell invasion; in fact, its deregulation is correlated with the infiltrative and metastatic ability of the tumor, with the consequent loss of cell adhesion and concomitant increase in cell motility. In human samples, somatic CDH1 alterations are associated with poor survival and worse prognosis in gastric cancer patients.\n\n    In 1998, Guilford et al. identified a large family from New Zealand with multiple cases of DGC that were carriers of a causative germline mutation in the E-cadherin gene. Thereafter, several publications emerged, confirming the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance associated with germline mutations of the CDH1 gene. To date, more than 500 germline mutations have been identified in DGC families. The most common types of mutations are missense (23%), nonsense (22%), deletions (22%) or insertions (10%), and splice site (21%).\n\n    In this study, firstly, we reviewed the frequency of CDH1 germline mutations in non-gastric tumors, and we identified 54 alterations. The major findings of this study were the following: (a) CDH1 germline mutations excluding GC are found predominantly BC (60% of all non-GC cancers); (b) the mean age at diagnosis was higher in the non-GC cancer (50.6 year), compared to GC (40.6 year); (c) the majority of mutations were localized in the cytoplasmic domain (Figure 2).\n\n    Recent studies demonstrated that LBC might be the first manifestation of the HDGC syndrome, even in the absence of DGC cases in the family. It was supposed that families with LBCs carrying CDH1 germline mutations cluster as independent inherited syndrome. The concept of hereditary lobular breast cancer (HLBC) is very recent, because some authors identified pathogenic CDH1 mutations in women with LBC, and without GC family history. To date, we do not know if asymptomatic individuals in these families will develop gastric cancer later, the cumulative risk of developing GC in these women or their relatives with CDH1 mutations is unknown; it is possible that in this contest the penetrance risk for GC is lower or absent.\n\n    In cases of the classic HDGC syndrome, individuals carrying pathogenic mutation in CDH1 have about a 70% risk of developing DGC and women have an additional LBC risk of approximately 40%, by the age of 80 years. Although some authors stated that the CDH1 variant carriers lifetime risk of developing invasive BC is similar to that of BRCA mutation carriers, the real risk of developing LBC in absence of a clear HDGC predisposition remains undetermined.\n\n    BC, as well as other non-GCs associated with CDH1 mutations, could be a non-early manifestation of the complex HDGC syndrome. We observed, in fact, that the main age at diagnosis of BC, as well of other non-GCs, is higher. The pathway of CDH1 deregulation during breast and gastric carcinogenesis is different and this could explain also the different clinical manifestations. In BC, the presence of a CDH1 mutation can alter the E-cadherin function, causing a decreased cell-cell adhesion and an increased cell proliferation, so-called lobular hyperplasia. Subsequently, a second-hit CDH1 inactivation causes the loss of E-cadherin expression and, after, alters organization of the lobule. During this event, deregulated cells emerge and accumulate in the lobules creating a lobular intraepithelial neoplasia pattern. Finally, cancer cells disrupt the basement membrane and invade surrounding breast tissue, a tumor stage that is classified as invasive lobular carcinoma. In CDH1 gastric carcinogenesis, the early-stage of HDGC is characterized by multiple foci of invasive (T1a) signet-ring cell (diffuse) carcinoma in the superficial gastric mucosa, with no nodal metastases. In situ signet-ring cell carcinoma and pagetoid spread of signet ring cells are recognized precursors (Tis) to T1a signet ring cell carcinoma. Gastric carcinogenesis associated with CDH1 germline mutations seems more \"aggressive\" than LB tumorigenesis, in which missense mutations predominate. It is possible that the penetrance of cancer risk from pathogenic missense CDH1 variants is lower than that from truncating mutations, and maybe other factors (hormonal?) play a progressive synergic role with CDH1 missense mutations in BC development (as in other cancers).\n\n    The accumulation of mutations in the cytoplasmic domain is an interesting point. The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin has a crucial role in its function, because it supports the assembly of a complex of cytosolic proteins, including catenins, which provide anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton to form stable cell-cell contact. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain represents a vulnerable point due to its intrinsic nature and the presence of mutations affecting this point confers a dangerous alteration of the E-cadherin protein function.\n\n    (a) We have to consider that CDH1 gene in BC, as well in CRC, play a minor role; BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair proteins (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) exert a major impact in their carcinogenesis. The possibility to find a CDH1 mutation, in accord with our data, is very low in the non-GC group. At this moment, it is not clear if the identification of CDH1 mutation in the non-GC group is \"casual\" or associated with a possible minor pathway in non-GC tumorigenesis. We suppose that in BC the identification of CDH1 mutation is not a casual or an \"incidental finding\", some data demonstrated that there is mutual exclusion of CDH1 and BRCA germline mutations in the pathway of hereditary BC.\n\n    (b) Another limitation of this study is the missing information about ClinVar classification. Unfortunately, not all mutations were submitted at the ClinVar platform, and this work should be completed to better clarify the potential pathogenic role of CDH1 mutations reported in the current study.\n\n    (c) The motivation to perform CDH1 genetic screening in such populations, without apparent indications, is unknown. Unfortunately, the authors did not clarify this point. This missing information represents another limitation of this study.",

        "Title": "    A systematic review of inherited retinal dystrophies in Pakistan: updates from 1999 to April 2023",
        "Abstract": "    Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a group of rare genetic conditions affecting retina of the eye that range in prevalence from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 4000 people globally. This review is based on a retrospective analysis of research articles reporting IRDs associated genetic findings in Pakistani families between 1999 and April 2023.\n\n    Articles were retrieved through survey of online sources, notably, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Following a stringent selection criterion, a total of 126 research articles and conference abstracts were considered. All reported variants were cross-checked and validated for their correct genomic nomenclature using different online resources/databases, and their pathogenicity scores were explained as per ACMG guidelines.\n\n    A total of 277 unique sequence variants in 87 distinct genes, previously known to cause IRDs, were uncovered. In around 70% cases, parents of the index patient were consanguineously married, and approximately 88.81% of the detected variants were found in a homozygous state. Overall, more than 95% of the IRDs cases were recessively inherited. Missense variants were predominant (41.88%), followed by Indels/frameshift (26.35%), nonsense (19.13%), splice site (12.27%) and synonymous change (0.36%). Non-syndromic IRDs were significantly higher than syndromic IRDs (77.32% vs. 22.68%). Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) was the most frequently observed IRD followed by Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). Altogether, mutations in PDE6A gene was the leading cause of IRDs in Pakistani families followed by mutations in TULP1 gene.\n\n    In summary, Pakistani families are notable in expressing recessively inherited monogenic disorders including IRDs likely due to the highest prevalence of consanguinity in the country that leads to expression of rare pathogenic variants in homozygous state.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12886-024-03319-7.",
        "Introduction": "    Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of clinically and genetically diverse eye disorders ranging in prevalence from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 4000 people globally. IRDs are broadly divided into two categories (i) non-syndromic, and (ii) syndromic types depending upon absence or presence of extra-ocular manifestations, respectively. Major clinical symptoms of non-syndromic IRDs include, but not limited to, night blindness or nyctalopia, color vision deficiency, photophobia, nystagmus, reduced visual acuity, day vision loss as well as central or peripheral vision loss. Syndromic IRDs, on the other hand, are known for systemic findings such as obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, deafness, speech, and intellectual disability together with ocular symptoms. Globally, mutations in over 300 distinct genes have thus far been associated with all forms of IRDs. IRDs follow all modes of Mendelian inheritance such as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked, mitochondrial as well as digenic and oligogenic patterns. Accordingly, IRDs are classified into various subtypes depending upon disease onset, mode of inheritance, rate of disease progression, clinical presentation, part of retina affected (rods, cones, retinal pigment epithelium, inner retina and choroid), and/or involvement of extra ocular phenotypes. Non-syndromic and syndromic IRDs are briefly explained in the following sections.\n\n    Cone and cone-rod dystrophies (CD/CRD) are a rare form of retinal dystrophies with a worldwide prevalence rate of 1:40,000. CD/CRD are progressive disorders of cone and rod photoreceptor cells in retina presenting clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Major clinical symptoms of CD include reduced day vision, color vision deficiency, reduced visual acuity, and photophobia. Similarly, CRD is characterized by cone dysfunction at first resulting in progressive loss of day vision. This is followed by rods dysfunction eventually leading to night blindness (nyctalopia). However, symptoms such as photophobia, color vision deficiency, and legal blindness overlap between CD and CRD. The electroretinogram (ERG) shows both cone and rod dysfunction and is non-recordable in advanced case. CD/CRD may transmit as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked entity with mutations in as many as 32 distinct genes identified so far. Gill and colleagues have reported that 62.2% cases of recessively inherited CD/CRD are linked to mutations in ABCA4 gene. Similarly, of the dominantly inherited CD/CRD, 34.6% cases are attributed to mutations in GUCY2D gene. Lastly, of the X-linked inherited CD/CRD, 73.0% cases are due to mutations in RPGR gene.\n\n    As the name indicate, congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a form of non-progressive inherited retinal dystrophy that appears at birth, however identified in childhood. Visual symptoms include night blindness, nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. ERG findings show normal cone response; however, reduced or abolished rod response is detected on ERG in CSNB. Similarly, fundoscopy mostly remains unremarkable. CSNB is divided into four distinct types namely, Schubert-Borstein type, Riggs type, Oguchi disease, and fundus albipunctatus. Though patients with Schubert-Borstein or Riggs type both have normal fundi, the two types can be distinguished from each other with the help of full-field electroretinography (ff-ERG). Oguchi disease and fundus albipunctatus shows fundus abnormalities. For instance, Oguchi disease is characterized by a gray-white metallic sheen that disappears after dark adaptation, a feature called the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon. Fundus albipunctatus is characterized by small white dots scattered across the posterior pole sparing the fovea. In scotopic settings, Riggs type has flat a-wave in dim flash and reduced a- and b-wave with a strong single flash. In contrast, the Schubert-Bornschein type has normal a-wave and severely reduced b-wave, classically described as an electronegative waveform. In photopic settings, Riggs type has a normal photopic response, the Schubert-Bornschein type has abnormal photopic findings. To our knowledge, at least 18 genes are known to cause CSNB, including 13 genes for AR-CSNB, 3 genes for AD-CSNB, and 2 genes for XL-CSNB.\n\n    Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare, and one of the most clinically severe form of IRDs with a worldwide prevalence of 1:80,000. LCA is, typically, associated with early onset vision loss, nystagmus, and amaurotic pupils. Clinical pattern includes pigmentory retinopathy, reduced or absent ERG response, poor central vision or complete blindness at birth. LCA predominately follows autosomal recessive inheritance pattern except for CRX, IMPDH1, and OTX2 genes that results in autosomal dominant LCA. LCA account for approximately 5% of the total IRDs cases, and ~ 20% of childhood blindness. So far, pathogenic variants in 38 genes are known to cause LCA. Some of the frequently mutated genes in LCA include AIPL1, CEP290, CRB1 and GUCY2D.\n\n    Macular degeneration (MD) is a heterogeneous group of progressive eye disorders that are clinically characterized by bilateral symmetrical macular abnormalities and macular flecks. Visual complaints include, reduced visual acuity, central vision loss, photophobia, slow dark adaptation, and nystagmus. Stargardt disease 1 (STGD1) disease is the most common form of macular dystrophy with a prevalence rate of 1 in 8000-10000. STGD1 follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance with ABCA4 as the leading cause of the disease that accounts for 95% STGD1 cases. Of the total 18 genes known to cause MD, 14 genes are responsible for AD-MD while the remaining 4 genes results in AR-MD [RetNet:Retinal Information Network (uth.edu), accessed on March 6, 2023].\n\n    Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), with a worldwide incidence rate of 1:3000 to 1:4000, appears as the most highly frequent type of IRDs. Though symptoms and onset of RP is largely variable, it usually starts with night blindness during first or second decade of life due to the degeneration of rod photoreceptor cells. This is followed by visual field constriction (tunnel vision) and degeneration of cone photoreceptors, finally leading to complete blindness by late third or early fourth decade of life. Auxiliary symptoms may include photophobia, nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. Around 70%-80% of RP cases are non-syndromic (isolated) while the remaining 20-30% cases are associated with non-ocular manifestations, and thus classified as syndromic RP. RP may be inherited as an autosomal dominant (15-25%), autosomal recessive (5-20%), X-linked (5-15%), or a di-genic entity with associated mutations reported in over 132 different genes [RetNet:Retinal Information Network (uth.edu)]. Mutations in RPGR gene is the leading cause of X-linked RP.\n\n    Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare ciliopathy with multisystem involvement. Hallmark features of BBS include obesity, macro or micro-cephaly, night blindness, cone-rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), hypodontia, dental crowding, hepatic fibrosis, hypogonadism, hypogenitalism, tricuspid regurgitation, dilated cardiomyopathy, renal anomalies, polydactyly, brachydactyly, syndactyly, delayed development, mental retardation, ataxia, speech disability speech delay, and diabetes mellitus. However, expression of these symptoms may vary from one person to the other. Since the mutated genes in BBS have functional relevance in ciliary biogenesis and trafficking, the condition is regarded as ciliopathy. As per literature survey, and RetNet:Retinal Information Network (uth.edu), mutations in 28 distinct genes/loci are so far associated with BBS phenotypes, all following an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and in some cases oligogenic. Interestingly, ~ 50% of the total BBS cases are attributed to pathological sequence variations in three genes, namely, BBS1, BBS2, and BBS10.\n\n    Usher syndrome (USH) is a rare form syndromic IRDs, presenting deafness in conjunction with blindness, that affect people with a worldwide prevalence of 4-17 in 100000. Chief ocular complaints are night blindness, progressive vision loss, nystagmus whereas non-ocular symptoms include hearing difficulty or sensorineural hearing loss of variable degree. USH is sub-divided into different types, for example, USH1, USH2 and USH3, based upon clinical presentation of the disease. USH2 is the predominant type among all sub-types. USH is passed in an autosomal recessive pattern, and di-genic with mutation in 10 genes thus far known to cause the disease. While mutations in USH2A gene account for roughly 80% of USH2 cases, MYO7A gene mutations are responsible for over 50% of USH1 cases.\n\n    Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an infrequent genetic ciliopathy characterized by the involvement of multiple systems and organs, including the brain, kidneys, liver, and eyes. The clinical presentation of JBTS typically involve mild to moderate mental retardation, macrocephaly, retinal dystrophy, nystagmus, coloboma, visual impairment, hepatic and renal anomalies, and skeletal deformities with characteristic \"molar tooth sign\" on MRI. Given its rarity as a genetic ciliopathy, JBTS has a global occurrence rate of 1 in 80,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births. JBTS is predominantly inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. However, there have been reports of X-linked JBTS due to mutations in the OFD1 gene. Pathogenic sequence variations in at least 40 genes have been reported to cause JBTS so far. Mutations in AIH1 and CEP290 genes collectively account for approximately 38% of genetically diagnosed JBTS patients.\n\n    Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS) is a rare syndromic form of IRDs that is estimated to affect 1 in 1,000,000 individuals worldwide. The disease is characterized by retinopathy that may progress as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), or sector RP. Patients typically present with photophobia, nystagmus, and hyperopia, which may manifest in the first few years of life or later in childhood. Additionally, patients with SLS experience nephronophthisis, a condition that is marked by cystic kidney disease (medullary cystic kidney disease), reduced concentrating ability, and chronic tubule-interstitial nephritis. Over time, the disease typically progresses to end-stage renal disease. SLS is inherited as an autosomal recessive Mendelian disorder. To date, mutations in 10 genes are associated with SLS including NPHP1, NPHP2, NPHP3 , NPHP4, NPHP5/IQCB1, NPHP6/CEP290, NPHP10/SDCCAG8, NPHP13/WRD19, NPHP15/CEP164, and TRAF3IP1.",
        "Methods": "    This review was carried out between November-2022 and April-2023 by following PRISMA guidelines as mentioned in Supplementary Table S1. Briefly, the inclusion criteria for considering genetic studies comprised families of Pakistani descent, exhibiting both syndromic and non-syndromic inherited retinal disorders, and articles published during the period spanning from 1999 to April-2023. A thorough literature survey was performed for this purpose using PubMed (NCBI), Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Different key words such as inherited retinal degenerations/dystrophies, IRDs, retinitis pigmentosa (syndromic/non-syndromic), Stargardt disease, cone- and/or cone-rod dystrophy, macular degeneration, congenital stationary night blindness, leber congenital amaurosis, achromatopsia, color blindness, mutations, Pakistan, etc. were used for retrieving relevant literature. All articles that appeared during our search were further shortlisted and papers that did not fall under the purview of this review were excluded. This included articles presenting findings related to non-retinal phenotypes like cataract, age related macular dystrophy, microphthalmia, anophthalmia, aniridia, anterior segment dysgenesis, and sporadic cases. Data pertaining to genetic and clinical aspects of the families were extracted from all papers and recorded (and tabulated) in Microsoft (MS) excel sheet. This followed manual curation of the data using different options of the MS excel tool. Genomic nomenclature of all variants reported in this study were validated using VariantValidator [https://variantvalidator.org]. Additional features of the variants such as impact of the variations on cDNA and protein level, gene symbols, protein and transcript ID, genomic coordinates of the variation, inheritance pattern, and allele frequencies were determined using major genomic data bases (Ensemble, UCSC, HGNC, OMIM, gnomAD). All identified variants were queried in different online databases such as ClinVar, HGMD and Varsome to check their clinical significance. ACMG verdicts about the variants were retrieved from Varsome database. Retinal information network (RetNet) was used to calculate number of genes associated with each IRDs type. All missense variants were evaluated for their predicted pathogenicity using different in-silico tools, namely, CADD, DANN, LRT, Mutation Assessor, Mutation Taster, Mutpred, PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, and SIFT.\n\n    All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article [and its supplementary information files].\n\n    Not applicable.\n\n    Not applicable.",
        "Results": "    This review paper focused on a total of 126 published research articles, including 1 case series, 34 case reports, and 91 cohort papers, all documenting IRDs in families of Pakistani descent between 1999 and April-2023. Excluding a retrospective case series study (n = 1), major diagnostic methods utilized in the remaining 125 articles included linkage analysis and/or homozygosity mapping coupled with targeted Sanger sequencing (n = 62), targeted Sanger sequencing (n = 24), and next-generation sequencing (panel-based sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing) (n = 39) (Fig. 1, Table S3).\n\n    All articles were thoroughly checked to infer different features such as ethnic affiliation of the patients, parental consanguinity, zygosity of the identified alleles, mutation types /molecular impact of the alleles, inheritance pattern, and disease type. Collectively, highest number of IRDs cases were reported from Punjab province (32.21%), followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (13.73%), Sindh (1.12%), Baluchistan (0.84%), and Kashmir (< 1%), while a subset (1.12%) of studies documented IRDs in Pakistani families living abroad (UK/Canada). In the remaining 50.70% cases, no ethnic affiliation could be inferred from the published reports. Analysis of the retrieved articles for presence/absence of parental consanguinity revealed that parents were consanguineously married in 70.03% of the cases, 2.24% non-consanguineously married while no information about parental consanguinity were available in 27.73% cases. Interestingly, 95.50% IRDs cases were found to follow autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance pattern followed by autosomal dominant (AD) (1.70%), X-Linked (1.10%) pattern (Table 1). In the remaining 1.70% cases, information about inheritance pattern was not known. The authors, however, reported homozygous pathogenic variants in genes which can cause both AD and AR inheritance pattern (as per OMIM database).\n\n    As per available literature and genotype information, higher cases of non-syndromic (77.32%) IRDs were reported compared to syndromic IRDs (22.68%) (Table 1). Syndromic IRDs included Alstrom syndrome (AS) (~ 1%), BBS (8%), Cohen syndrome (COH) (~ 1%), JBTS (2%), MKS (1%), Retinal dystrophy with microvillus inclusion disease (RDMVID) (< 1%), SLSN (1%), USH (8%), Zellweger syndrome (ZS) (< 1%). Non-syndromic IRDs included RP (41%), LCA (14%), CSNB (6%), CRD (4%), RD (3%), Achromatopsia (2%), STGD (2%), Fundus Albipunctatus (FA) (1%), Hypotrichosis juvenile macular dystrophy HJMD (1%), FA/CSNB (~ 1%), LCA/EORD (~ 1%), MD (~ 1%), Retinitis punctata albescens (RPA) (~ 1%), Early onset retinal dystrophy (EORD) (< 1%), Choroideremia (CHM) (< 1%), Retinoschisis (RS) (< 1%) (Fig. 2).\n\n    Various characteristics of the identified genomic variants are shown in Table 1. A total of 277 disease-causing alleles across 87 known IRDs-associated genes were documented in the literature under the scope of this study as mentioned in supplementary Table S2. Topmost mutated genes included PDE6A (5.32%), TULP1 (4.76%), RP1 (4.48%), RPE65 (4.48%), CDH23 (3.36%), CRB1 (3.36%), GUCY2D (3.36%), LCA5 (3.08%), RPGRIP1 (3.08%), USH2A (3.08%), AIPL1 (2.80%), RDH5 (2.80%) PDE6B (2.80%) (Fig. 3). On the contrary, least frequently mutated genes, categorized as \"Others\", were ARL13B, ARL3, ASRGL1, BEST1, CC2D2A, CHM, DRAM2, IFT43, IMPG2, MKKS, MKS1, NPHP4, NR2E3, NYX, PDE6H, PEX6, PRCD, PRPF3, RBP3, RPGR, RS1, SLC6A6, SNRNP200, STX3 and TCTN2 (each reported only once in Pakistani families so far) (Fig. 3). Of the total 277 disease-causing alleles found in Pakistani IRDs patients, 88.81% alleles were found in a homozygous state, 2.17% in heterozygous state, and 1.08% in hemizygous state; however, zygosity of the remaining 7.94% alleles was not described in the published reports (Table 1). Based on their predicted impact on protein, alleles were classified as missense, indels/frameshift, nonsense, splicing, and synonymous with their respective frequencies of 41.88%, 26.35%, 19.13%, 12.27%, and 0.36% (Table 1). Of the total 277 alleles, 61.37% (170 alleles) were defined as single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Of the 170 SNVs, 109 or 64.12% were transitions (Purine to Purine = 45, Pyramidine to Pyramidine = 64) and 61 or 35.88% were transversions (Purine to Pyramidine = 37, Pyramidine to Purine = 24) (Table 1). A C > T was the most frequent (44.04%) transition followed by G > A (31.19%), T > C (14.68%), and A > G (10.09%). Similarly, G > T (27.87%) was the mostly frequent transversion followed by G > C (19.67%), C > A (16.39%), T > G (14.75%), A > T (9.84%), C > G (4.92%), T > A (3.28%) and A > C (3.28%) (Table 1). Using ACMG guidelines, all reported alleles were re-evaluated for their clinical significance. Collectively, 'pathogenic/likely pathogenic' variants were found to be 71.48% followed by 'variants of uncertain significance (VUS)' (19.49%), and 'benign/likely benign' (2.89%). No ACMG verdict about the 6.14% alleles was available on the Varsome database (Supplementary Table S2).\n\n    Furthermore, all missense variants (n = 116) were re-evaluated as per ACMG guidelines/standards, ClinVar database, and using in-silico tools (Table 2). ACMG predicted 63 missense alleles as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, 45 as VUS, and 8 as benign/likely benign (Table 2). Similarly, ClinVar database showed 49 missense variants as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, 16 as VUS, 9 as conflicting, and 6 as benign/likely benign. Thirty-six missense alleles were; however, not reported in the ClinVar database. Findings of our in-silico study are shown in Table 2.\n\n    In summary, eight alleles were eligible to be classified as benign/likely benign consistently by the ACMG standards, ClinVar classification system, and by majority of the online in-silico predictors. These eight benign/likely benign missense alleles are further detailed in Table 3, and include SEMA4A (p.Arg713Gln), USH2A (p.Ser2445Phe), RPGRIP1 (p.Ala547Ser), RP1 (p.Thr373Ile), ZNF513 (p.Cys339Arg), ALMS1 (p.Lys1748Glu), RAX2 (p.Gly125Glu), and EYS (p.Thr2777Ser).",
        "Conclusion": "    This study provides a comprehensive overview of IRDs in Pakistani families over a period of 25 years (1999-2023). Our analysis reaffirms the fact that majority of the prevalent IRDs cases in Pakistan are recessively inherited, and that they mostly appeared due to the bi-allelic inheritance of rare pathogenic mutations from both parents. Undoubtedly, RP was the most frequently occurring IRD in Pakistan followed by LCA. Overall, PDE6A gene mutations was the leading cause of IRDs in Pakistani families followed by mutations in TULP1 gene. Altogether, marked genetic and allelic and heterogeneity was observed in the Pakistani IRDs families. In summary, Pakistani families are notable in expressing both common and rare Mendelian disorders such as Cohen syndrome, intestinal-retinal syndrome, and taurine transporter deficiency possibly due to the traditional practice of endogamy in the society.\n\n    Since the data presented in this study were all retrieved from published reports, and further validated/curated using online databases, we foresee certain limitations in our study. For example, we do not claim causality of variants (if any) presented in this report as it does not fall under the purview of our study. Despite our own efforts, we do see the possibility of overlooking certain relevant literature on the subject. Incomplete information, inconsistencies or in some cases errors seen in the retrieved data may have skewed our own analysis. It is pertinent to mention here that all calculations about genomic variants were based on the total number of alleles (n = 277) reported in the 126 research articles. We were unfortunately unable to assess objectively the total number of families and/or patients affected by these 277 alleles due to the inadequate information provided in the literature. Nevertheless, published reports emerged mostly from two provinces of Pakistan i.e. Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Therefore, we recommend taking care while extrapolating our findings to other ethnic Pakistani populations like Sindh, Baluchistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.",
        "Discussion": "    This study provides an overview of the existing clinical and genetic aspects of IRDs in Pakistani families based on published reports. Majority of the IRDs families in the published reports belonged to two major ethnic Pakistani populations i.e. Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Other ethnic Pakistani populations such as Sindh, Baluchistan and Gilgit-Baltistan were only marginally represented in the available medical literature. Consistent with the traditional practice of endogamy in the country, over 70% IRDs cases in this study were found among children whose parents were consanguineously married. Consequently, recessively inherited IRDs were disproportionately high (> 95%) in the current report as opposed to dominant cases. Our findings reiterate the fact that consanguinity-driven homozygosity mapping can greatly leverage identification of novel disease genes in recessively inherited Mendelian disorders in endogamous populations as previously shown. For example, at least 12 IRDs-associated genes have been first identified/reported in Pakistani families.\n\n    Of the total retrieved variants detected in IRDs families of Pakistani origin, ~ 80% were considered as 'rare' since they were reported only once from the Pakistani population. The remainder ~ 20% variants were observed at least twice in Pakistani families, hence they were considered as 'recurrent' alleles. Of the recurrent alleles, a frameshift mutation in LCA5 gene (NM_001122779.3:c.1151delC;p.Pro384GlnfsTer18) was independently reported seven times, and thus considered to be the topmost commonly reported allele in Pakistan.\n\n    While ethnic affiliations of index cases carrying c.1151delC allele were not provided in five out of seven studies, c.1151delC allele was independently reported in two unrelated families from KPK and Punjab provinces. The second most recurrent allele was a missense substitution (c.1138A > G:p.Thr380Ala) in the TULP1 (NM_003322.6) gene which was reported by five independent studies. Of them, two families belonged to ethnically matched KPK population, and thus possibly related. However, one family carrying c.1138A > G allele belonged to Punjab province. No data on the ethnic affiliation was available in the remaining two reports. In addition to the likelihood that these alleles constitute hotspot mutations, frequent occurrence of these recurrent alleles in multiple and ethnically matched Pakistani families might indicate a founder effect in the society.\n\n    Our findings, of RP as the most leading IRD type in Pakistani families (41%), align with several previous studies suggesting RP as the most frequently reported form of IRDs in world populations. Also, we have found that RP is the most genetically heterogeneous disorder among IRDs in Pakistani population as mutations in 37 different RP-associated genes were identified. Nonetheless, Pakistani families somehow present unique genetic architecture of IRDs. For example, unlike ABCA4 and/or USH2A gene mutations which are considered as a major etiology of the IRDs cases worldwide, we have found that PDE6A gene mutations are the leading cause of IRDs in Pakistani families. While disease-causing mutations in SNRNP200 gene are known to cause adRP, SNRNP200 gene mutation correlated with arRP in a Pakistani IRD family. Lastly, detection of rare forms of IRDs notably STX3-associated intestinal-retinal syndrome, VPS13B-associated Cohen syndrome, and SLC6A6-associated taurine transporter (TauT) deficiency disorders in Pakistani families not only points towards the distinctive genetic nature of this population but it also highlights its potential in medical research.\n\n    Our CADD score analysis of all missense variants that are described in this report revealed two alleles with lowest CADD-PHRED scores. These included RP1 (c.2005G > A; p.Ala669Thr), and RAX2 (c.374G > A; p.Gly125Glu) with a CADD-PHRED scores of 1.173 and 1.497, respectively. Though our in-silico findings about these alleles are not final, we recommend further researcher to further investigate these two missense variants in order to fully characterize their impact on protein structure and/or function.",

        "Introduction": "    Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), also known as Fahr's disease, is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extensive and symmetric calcifications in the brain. PFBC has a wide range of clinical manifestations, including Parkinsonism, dysarthria, dystonia, seizures, headache, cognitive impairment, and psychosis (Balck et al., ). PFBC is considered an autosomal dominant genetic disease, and four pathogenic genes, namely:SLC20A2 (OMIM: 158378) (Wang et al., ), PDGFB (OMIM: 190040) (Keller et al., ), PDGFRB (OMIM: 173410) (Nicolas et al., ), and XPR1 (OMIM: 605237) (Legati et al., ):have been identified since 2012. Approximately 36%-42% of patients with autosomal dominant PFBC (AD-PFBC) remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime (Nicolas et al., ; Tadic et al., ; Xu et al., ). Recently, biallelic homozygous mutations in the MYORG (OMIM:618255) (Yao et al., ) or JAM2 (OMIM: 606870) (Schottlaender et al., ) genes have been identified as novel genetic causes of autosomal recessive PFBC.\n\n    The association between MYORG and PFBC was first reported in Chinese families in 2018 (Yao et al., ), and has since been confirmed in recessive PFBC cases in various ethnicities (Chelban et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Kume et al., ; Malaquias et al., ; Ramos et al., ; Sadok et al., ; Tekin et al., ; Yao et al., ). MYORG mutations account for a large proportion of recessive PFBC cases. Compared with patients who possessed any of the four AD-PFBC gene types, individuals with the MYORG gene exhibited a higher prevalence of intracranial calcification lesions, which were more severe and extensive, primarily affecting the pons and cerebellum (Bauer et al., ). However, the clinical and radiological features of MYORG-PFBC have not been well understood.\n\n    We obtained detailed clinical, radiological, and genetic data from a patient with a novel MYORG variant of PFBC. Further mutational analysis of MYORG was performed on her family members.",
        "Methods": "    This study involving human participants received approval from the Ethics Committee of Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China. The patient and her family provided written informed consent to participate in this study.\n\n    Total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient and her family members was extracted using the Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Tiangen Biochemical Technology, Beijing, China). Nanodrop 2000 was used to qualitatively examine DNA. The genomic DNA was fragmented, end-repaired, adapter linked, purified, and amplified. The entire human exonic genome was captured using a target sequence capture probe (MyGenostics, GenCap, China). The captured DNA was enriched, eluted, amplified, and subjected to high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq X10 sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, California, United States). The raw data were subjected to preliminary processing, including image recognition and sample differentiation. The filtered sequences were aligned to the NCBI database human genome reference sequence (GRCh37/hg19) using Burrows:Wheeler Aligner software (Li & Durbin, ), and related information on single nucleotide variation and indel mutations were obtained by analysis using the Genome Analysis Toolkit software(https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/). All single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels were annotated using the ANNOVAR (Yang & Wang, ). Mutation sites with a frequency less than 0.05 were screened for in human genetic databases, including the Thousand Genomes Project, Exome Variant Server, and Exome Aggregation Consortium. Missense mutations were predicted by Scale Invariant Feature Transform (http://sift.jcvi.org/), Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), MutationTaster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/), and Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (http://mendel.stanford.edu/SidowLab/downloads/gerp/index.html). The changes in splice sites were analyzed using SPIDEX (http://www.deepgenomics.com/spidex). Sanger sequencing was used to verify the candidate mutation sites obtained after analysis and screening. The Human Splicing Finder software was used to verify the function of abnormal gene mutations, and the pathogenicity of gene variants was analyzed according to the guidelines of the United States Society for Medical Genetics and Genomics (Richards et al., ).",
        "Results": "    The index patient (Figure 1a, II-1) was a 22-year-old Chinese woman who presented to our department with a 3-year history of paroxysmal limb stiffness and dysarthria. Her symptoms occurred two to four times a week and lasted only a few seconds from 3 years ago. However, over the 6 months before the presentation, they had become more frequent and occurred almost daily for a few seconds, with irregular onset. She was previously in good health and had no family history of neurological disease. Her parents were healthy and not consanguineous (Figure 1a, I-1, I-2). Her younger brother was aged 13 years and healthy (Figure 1a, II-2). She denied experiencing dysphagia, cognitive impairment, syncope episodes, palpitations, constipation, gait disorder, trunk imbalance, or irregular tremors.\n\n    On admission, the initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 130/93 mmHg; pulse, 86 beats/min; respiration, 20 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.3 C. The general physical examination results were normal. Neurological examination revealed normal cognition, attention, memory, affect, cranial nerve function, gait, posture, balance, coordination, motor function and sensory function interstitially. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed symmetric calcifications in the paraventricular, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum (Figure 2a-c). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed symmetric calcifications in the basal ganglia, dorsolateral nucleus of the thalamus, and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (Figure 2d-f). The routine blood, urine, and stool tests showed normal results. Blood test results for alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, parathyroid hormone, total vitamin D, serum calcium, serum phosphate, thyroid hormones, albumin, blood glucose, uric acid, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and glycosylated hemoglobin were normal. Blood lipid test showed values within normal limits, except for triglycerides, which were 5.78 mmol/L. Autoimmune tests, including antinuclear antibodies, SSA/SSB antibodies, and rheumatoid factor tests, showed negative results. Infectious test results for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, syphilis antibodies, and hepatitis B and C antibodies were negative. Bone density, 24-hour electroencephalogram, and bilateral femur radiography showed normal findings. No obvious abnormality in the heart, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, ureters, or bladder was observed by ultrasound. The Mini-mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were 30/30, respectively.\n\n    A diagnosis of PFBC was considered plausible after excluding secondary causes of brain calcification. Therefore, the patient's blood samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing after obtaining informed consent. A novel homozygous frameshift variant (c.743delG: p.G248Afs*32) were identified in exon 2 of the MYORG gene (NM_020702.5), and validated using Sanger sequencing (Figure 1d). This mutation was absent from multiple population and disease databases, including the Human Gene Mutation Database, Clinvar, and The Genome Aggregation Database. According to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics, the variant was categorized as a \"pathogenic variant\" based on its classification as PVS1, PM2, or PM3_Supporting(hom). Combined with the clinical manifestations, related imaging, and genetic studies, the patient was diagnosed with PFBC caused by MYORG mutation. Sanger sequencing was performed for the family members of the patients (Figures 1b,c,e). The patient's father (Figure 1c), mother (Figure 1b), and younger brother (Figure 1e) were carriers of heterozygous mutations. Notably, all the aforementioned family members were asymptomatic. Unfortunately, brain CT or MRI was not performed for the patient's parents and younger brother; hence, it was unknown whether they had intracranial symmetric calcifications.\n\n    The patient was treated with oxcarbazepine to reduce neuronal excitability. Following treatment, the patient's symptoms improved remarkably, and the frequency of symptoms significantly decreased. However, 2 years later, the patient was re-examined by brain CT, and the results showed that the range of intracranial calcification had increased.\n\n    We searched through PubMed until April 1, 2023 for relevant studies and scanned the reference lists in the identified articles. We reviewed all reported cases of PFBC with biallelic MYORG mutations and summarized all the mutation sites in Table 1 (Arkadir et al., ; Chelban et al., ; Chen, Lin, et al., ; Chen, Cen, et al., ; Chen et al., ; Fei et al., ; Ferreira & de Oliveira, ; Forouhideh et al., ; Gao et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Kume et al., ; Li et al., ; Liu et al., ; Malaquias et al., ; Peng et al., ; Ramos et al., ; Sadok et al., ; Saranza et al., ; Taglia et al., ; Tekin et al., ; Tsai et al., ; Yang et al., ; Yao et al., ; Zeng et al., ). Data for 62 families have been reported, 51% of the patients were men and 49% were women. The ethnic groups included those from China, Japan, Israel, Italy, France, Turkey, Portugal, and Brazil. The median age of symptom onset was 46 years, and the affected age group ranged from 7.5 and 87 years. The diagnosis of MYORG-PFBC was for individuals aged between 12 and 87 years (average, 47 years).",
        "Conclusion": "    We report a novel pathogenic homozygous mutation (c.743delG: p.G248Afs*32) of the MYORG gene. We highlighted that screening for MYORG mutations in patients with primary brain calcification is important, especially younger patients without a family history. Moreover, MYORG monoallelic carriers may have brain calcifications, which may affect their health. Therefore, long-term follow-up and genetic counseling are recommended for these individuals.",
        "Discussion": "    Brain calcification is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium deposits in the brain tissue. It can be caused by various factors, including genetic disorders, tumors, vascular diseases, infections, metabolic disorders, and exposure to certain medications or toxins (Guedes et al., ). One genetic disorder associated with brain calcification is PFBC, a rare neurogenerative disorder that can be hereditary or sporadic. The onset of PFBC is often insidious, and its manifestations can differ widely among individuals. Recent research has focused on identifying the genetic mutations responsible for PFBC (Balck et al., ), which can help shed light on the underlying mechanisms of the disease and explain how different gene mutations might lead to similar neuroimaging findings but variable clinical outcomes.\n\n    PFBC is diagnosed based on clinical presentation, neuroimaging studies, and genetic testing. The diagnostic criteria include bilateral calcification in the basal ganglia and other brain regions, neurological or psychiatric symptoms, positive family history with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, or recessive mutations in known PFBC-associated genes (Mufaddel & Al-Hassani, ). The differential diagnosis of PFBC includes other disorders that can cause brain calcification, such as hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, tuberous sclerosis, aneurysm, oligodendroglioma, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis (Table S1). A comprehensive clinical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, is necessary for an accurate diagnosis. Genetic testing can also be useful in confirming PFBC and excluding other conditions.\n\n    Of the four genes associated with AD-PFBC, SLC20A2 mutations are the most common, accounting for over 50% of cases. PDGFB and PDGFRB mutations account for approximately 10%-40% and 5%-10% of cases, respectively (Balck et al., ; Donzuso et al., ). Mutations in PDGFB and PDGFRB can lead to abnormal blood vessel development and disrupt the blood-brain barrier integrity (Xu et al., ). XPR1 mutations have also been identified in a few PFBC cases. Mutations in SLC20A2 and XPR1 can disrupt phosphate transport, leading to calcium deposition in the brain (Xu et al., ). Missense mutations were the most frequent and unique alterations in SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XPR1 (Balck et al., ).\n\n    Autosomal recessive mutations that have been reported include MYORG and, more recently, JAM2. MYORG mutations are an infrequent cause of PFBC; however, with the widespread use of genetic testing, MYORG mutation account for 10%-20% of PBFC cases (Balck et al., ; Yao et al., ). The gene MYORG, also known as KIAA1161 or NET37, is located on chromosome 9p13.3, and encodes a 714-amino-acid(aa) protein. The MYORG protein is expressed in the skeletal muscles, colon, small intestine, liver, and brain. It plays a role in cell movement and organization. The MYORG protein is an alpha-galactosidase and has a conserved domain architecture consisting of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (aa 1-58), single transmembrane fragment (aa 59-79), glycoside hydrolase family 31 domain (GH31) (aa 311-714), and domain of unknown function (aa 80-310) (Meek et al., ; Yao et al., ). The GH31 domain is a common glycosidase domain responsible for the decomposition of complex sugars. The unknown functional domain is a less well-understood domain present in various proteins, and is believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions.\n\n    Balck et al. reported that the age of onset and diagnosis of MYORG-PFBC are similar to those of SLC20A2, XPR1, and PDGFRB mutations, and significantly higher than those of PDGFB and JAM2 mutations (Balck et al., ). Most of the 64 reported mutation sites in MYORG located in the GH31 domain, followed by the unknown functional domain, transmembrane fragment, and short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Thirty-six mutation sites were found only in compound heterozygous mutations, 23 only in homozygous mutations, and five mutation sites, including c.225G>A, c.348_349insCTGGCCTTCCGC, c.1333C>T, c.1831C>T, and c.1967T>C, were found in both homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations. The most frequent mutation sites were c.348_349insCTGGCCTTCCGC, followed by c.1967T>C, c.1333C>T, c.687G>T, and c.782_783GC>TT, which were found in 10 families (Chinese and Frenchman; Chen, Cen, et al., ; Chen et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Li et al., ; Yang et al., ; Yao et al., ), five families (Chinese and Frenchman; Chelban et al., ; Chen, Cen et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Liu et al., ), three families (Chinese; Grangeon et al., ; Peng et al., ; Yang et al., ), three families (Chinese and Frenchman; Chen, Cen, et al., ; Chen et al., ; Li et al., ), and three families (Chinese; Chen, Cen, et al., ; Yao et al., ; Zeng et al., ), respectively. We opined that these mutation sites may be \"hot spots\" for Chinese and Frenchmen. Missense mutation was the most frequent type of unique alteration, followed by frameshift, nonsense, in-frame indels, and duplication. To the best of our knowledge, this report describes a newly discovered homozygous frameshift mutation, c.743delG in the MYORG gene. The mutation c.743delG (p.G248Afs*32) has not been previously reported and may have been pathogenic in this case. Our patient with this mutation had a relatively young age of onset.\n\n    Bilateral symmetric calcifications in the basal ganglia (approximately 100%) and other brain regions are characteristics of PFBC. CT and MRI are commonly used imaging techniques for diagnosing of PFBC. Calcification can also affect the cerebellum, thalamus, subcortical white matter, cerebral cortex, and brain stem. Compared with patients with AD-PFBC, abnormal calcium deposits in the brains of patients with MYORG-PFBC are more severe, widespread, and always contain three to four brain calcification regions (Balck et al., ; Grangeon et al., ). However, the severity of calcification in patients with MYORG-PFBC can vary among patients and does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the clinical symptoms. Unlike AD-PFBC, there appears to be no apparent association between the number of affected brain regions and the age of onset or diagnosis of patients with MYORG-PFBC. In reported cases of MYORG-PFBC, both biallelic and some monoallelic carriers exhibit calcifications, with biallelic carriers experiencing more severe calcification (Taglia et al., ). Among monoallelic carriers, we found that 10 mutation sites, including c.103A>G, c.191G>A, c.348_349insCTGGCCTTCCGC, c.679C>G, c.782_783 GC>TT, c.893G>C, c.1333C>T, c.1511G>C, c.1530delG, and c.1967T>C, are associated with significant brain calcifications (Chen, Cen, et al., ; Ramos et al., ). Interestingly, most of the monoallelic carriers with mutations in the above mutation sites have calcifications in the brain stem, except for those with c.103A>G and c.679C>G mutations. Additionally, three out of five monoallelic carriers with 1060_1062del GAC mutation revealed punctuated calcification limited to the basal ganglia, and their family members with biallelic MYORG mutations also had calcification in the brain stems (Arkadir et al., ). Therefore, we speculated that the presence of calcification among monoallelic MYORG carriers is not only related to a dose-effect (Chen, Cen, et al., ) but also to the mutation site. Pontine calcifications are highly specific to MYORG-PFBC and are relatively rare in patients with AD-PFBC. Among the reported cases of PFBC with biallelic MYORG mutations, 45 cases showed brainstem calcification (Arkadir et al., ; Chelban et al., ; Chen, Cen, et al., ; Chen et al., ; Ferreira & de Oliveira.,; Forouhideh et al., ; Gao et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Kume et al., ; Liu et al., ; Ramos et al., ; Saranza et al., ; Taglia et al., ;Tsai et al., ; Zeng et al., ) and 24 cases showed pontine calcification (Arkadir et al., ; Chelban et al., ; Ferreira & de Oliveira, ; Gao et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Kume et al., ; Ramos et al., ; Taglia et al., ; Tsai et al., ; Zeng et al., ). However, the brainstem tropism of lesions associated with MYORG mutations remains unknown.\n\n    Along with genetic heterogeneity, PFBC can present with a wide range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, which can vary in severity and age of onset. Common manifestations include dysarthria, movement disorders (such as tremors, rigidity, dystonia, and ataxia), cognitive impairment (such as memory loss, confusion, and dementia), and mood disturbances (such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis). Other possible symptoms include headaches and seizures. Compared with AD-PFBC, patients with MYORG-PFBC have approximately 100% clinical penetrance (Chen, Cen, et al., ). Similar to previous studies (Grangeon et al., ; Taglia et al., ; Zeng et al., ), we observed that dysarthria is a prominent feature and the most common manifestation in patients with MYORG-PFBC, as well as other motor signs, including ataxia, dystonia, dyskinesia, Parkinsonism, and akinetic hypertonic syndrome. Ischemic stroke was also reported in five cases, and none of them had risk factors for stroke (Gao et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Li et al., ; Yang et al., ). Central neuropathic pain was also observed in a 43-year-old Chinese woman (Peng et al., ). Regarding nonmotor signs, cognitive deficits were the most common manifestation, followed by depression, headache, and psychosis. In patients with AD-PFBC, Parkinsonism, bradykinesia, cognitive deficits, and headache are the most common symptoms, while dysarthria is uncommon (Batla et al., ). In this study, the patient also had paroxysmal dysarthria as one of the chief complaints, similar to the results of the above studies. To date, 57% of all reported MYORG-PFBC cases are homozygous, and 43% are compound heterozygous. The clinical symptoms of most MYORG biallelic carriers vary, whereas most monoallelic carriers are clinically asymptomatic. In addition, we found that children and young adults always have mild symptoms, and the severity of these symptoms may increase with age.\n\n    The mechanisms by which MYORG mutations cause brain calcification are not well understood. Histopathological examinations have demonstrated that brain calcification is mainly associated with small blood vessels, glial cells, and neurons (Xu et al., ). MYORG is specifically expressed in astrocytes, mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (Meek et al., ; Yao et al., ; Zarb et al., ). Astrocytes are functionally associated with endothelial cells and pericytes of the blood-brain barrier, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and the extracellular matrix. They participate in the common formation of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which is related to four autosomal dominant genes and is involved in the pathogenesis of PFBC (Betsholtz & Keller, ; Xu et al., ). Dysfunction of the NVU impairs the normal substance exchange between the blood and cerebral cortex, leading to a high amount of blood Pi leaking into the brain, which in turn causes calcification (Xu et al., ). Although recent studies have demonstrated the functions of MYORG in animals, its pathophysiology in the human brain remains unclear. Meek et al. (Meek et al., ) used X-ray crystallography to obtain the structure of MYORG and suggested that these mutations may cause MYORG dysfunction, resulting in the disruption of the folding or maturation of one or more protein products of genes linked to PFBC, including SLC20A2, PDGFB, PDGFRB, and XPR1. The novel frameshift mutation identified in our patient was located in the unknown function domain. To date, 24 mutations in this domain have been reported (Chelban et al., ; Chen, Lin, et al., ; Chen, Cen, et al., ; Chen et al., ; Ferreira & de Oliveira, ; Gao et al., ; Grangeon et al., ; Kume et al., ; Li et al., ; Malaquias et al., ; Sadok et al., ; Taglia et al., ; Tekin et al., ; Yang et al., ; Yao et al., ; Zeng et al., ), suggesting that this region plays an important role in MYORG, leading to PFBC. Therefore, more studies are recommended to investigate the correlations between mutation sites, pathogenicity-implicated imaging findings, and clinical phenotypes. Notably, induced pluripotent stem cell lines have been generated from patients with PBFC (Yada et al., ) and may be a powerful tool to reveal the pathogenesis of PBFC and explore potential therapeutic candidates.\n\n    Currently, no specific prevention or treatment for PFBC exists, and existing treatment regimens are primarily used to control the disease symptoms. These may include medications to manage seizures, movement disorders, and cognitive impairment, as well as therapies to support and improve the quality of life. However, no effective therapy has been developed to control the progression of brain calcification. Therefore, ongoing research is focused on developing new therapies that target the underlying mechanisms of the disease to control the progression of brain calcification. For example, recent studies have explored the potential use of agents to inhibit nonsense mutation (Peters et al., ) or stabilize mutant proteins and facilitate their proper folding (Meek et al., ). Other promising research avenues include reducing Pi intake, restoring normal Pi transport in the brain, and inhibiting cerebral cell ossification.",

        "Title": "    Dominant RP in the Middle While Recessive in Both the N- and C-Terminals Due to RP1 Truncations: Confirmation, Refinement, and Questions",
        "Abstract": "    RP1 truncation variants, including frameshift, nonsense, and splicing, are a common cause of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). RP1 is a unique gene where truncations cause either autosomal dominant RP (adRP) or autosomal recessive RP (arRP) depending on the location of the variants. This study aims to clarify the boundaries between adRP and arRP caused by RP1 truncation variants based on a systemic analysis of 165 RP1 variants from our in-house exome-sequencing data of 7,092 individuals as well as a thorough review of 185 RP1 variants from published literature. In our cohort, potential pathogenic variants were detected in 16 families, including 11 new and five previously described families. Of the 16, seven families with adRP had heterozygous truncations in the middle portion, while nine families with either arRP (eight) or macular degeneration had biallelic variants in the N- and C-terminals, involving 10 known and seven novel variants. In the literature, 147 truncations in RP1 were reported to be responsible for either arRP (85) or adRP (58) or both (four). An overall evaluation of RP1 causative variants suggested three separate regions, i.e., the N-terminal from c.1 (p.1) to c.1837 (p.613), the middle portion from c.1981 (p.661) to c.2749 (p.917), and the C-terminal from c.2816 (p.939) to c.6471 (p.2157), where truncations in the middle portion were associated with adRP, while those in the N- and C-terminals were responsible for arRP. Heterozygous truncations alone in the N- and C- terminals were unlikely pathogenic. However, conflict reports with reverse situation were present for 13 variants, suggesting a complicated pathogenicity awaiting to be further elucidated. In addition, pathogenicity for homozygous truncations around c.5797 and thereafter might also need to be further clarified, so as for missense variants and for truncations located in the two gaps. Our data not only confirmed and refined the boundaries between dominant and recessive RP1 truncations but also revealed unsolved questions valuable for further investigation. These findings remind us that great care is needed in interpreting the results of RP1 variants in clinical gene testing as well as similar features may also be present in some other genes.",
        "Introduction": "    RP1 (OMIM 603937), mapped to chromosome 8q11.2-12.1, is an axonemal microtubule-associated gene with four exons, where the protein-coding region is in the last three. It encodes a 2,156-amino acid protein that is specifically expressed in photoreceptor connecting cilia, participating in protein transport between the inner and outer segments of the photoreceptors via two domains: the doublecortin (DCX) domain and the bifocal (BIF) domain.\n\n    Variants in RP1 were initially identified to be responsible for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) and later for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) (OMIM 180100). RP1 is listed as the top seventh of the most frequently implicated genes in inherited retinal disease based on a large cohort. To date, a large number of potential pathogenic variants in RP1 have been reported, demonstrating a unique correlation between mutation location and pattern of inheritance. Usually, heterozygous truncation variants in the middle portion contributed to adRP, while biallelic truncation variants in the N- and C- terminals were associated with arRP. The boundaries between dominant and recessive variants have been suggested in previous studies but conflict reports were also present. It is expected to confirm and refine the boundaries as well as the genotype-phenotype correlation of RP1 variants based on a large dataset, especially at the era of widespread application of clinical genetic testing.\n\n    In this study, RP1 variants were selected and analyzed based on our in-house exome-sequencing data from 7,092 individuals with different forms of eye conditions. RP1 variants in published literature were systematically reviewed. These data further confirmed and refined the boundaries of RP1 truncation variants, in which adRP associated with heterozygous variants in the middle portion, while arRP associated with biallelic variants in the N- and C- terminals. Besides, conflict reports in a reverse situation may call attention and be studied further. In clinical gene testing, pathogenicity of individual truncation variants in RP1 might be complicated and should be explained with great care, especially for novel variants as well as those variants with conflict consequence.",
        "Methods": "    Individuals with various forms of eye conditions were collected by our team based on our ongoing program on genetic study of inherited eye diseases. Prior to their participation, written informed consent adhering to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from participants or their guardians. Clinical data and peripheral venous blood samples were collected from these individuals and their available family members. Genomic DNA was extracted from the leukocytes of peripheral blood based on procedures as described in our previously study. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center.\n\n    Exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA samples from the 7,092 individuals, including whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 5,307 and targeting exome sequencing (TES) on 1,785. The procedures used to perform WES and TES were described in detail in our previous studies.\n\n    RP1 variants were collected from exome-sequencing data of 7,092 individuals with various forms of eye conditions, including 1,019 with RP, 1,217 with glaucoma, 1,299 with high myopia, 492 normal controls, and 3,065 with other eye conditions. RP1 variants were initially filtered following the procedures described in our previous studies. The candidate variants in RP1 were then annotated as the following steps: (1) the allelic frequency of each variant was annotated according to the gnomAD database1; (2) missense variants were predicted using five in silico online tools, including REVEL2, CADD3, SIFT4, PolyPhen25, and PROVEAN6; (3) the splicing effect of variants in the intronic region as well as synonymous variants were predicted using the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP7); (4) genotype-phenotype correlation was used to identify potential pathogenic variants. Sanger sequencing was used to validate potential pathogenic variants and segregation analysis in available family members was carried out to further validate the pathogenicity. The primers used herein were designed using the Primer3 online tool8.\n\n    The \"RP1\" was used as the keyword to search PubMed9, Google Scholar10, and The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD11) on September 1, 2020. The RP1 variants were collected from these resources and annotated as noted in the above section. The phenotypes associated with these RP1 variants are summarized.\n\n    All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS software version 25.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). The difference of proportion of macular abnormalities between the two groups of patients with adRP and arRP was analyzed using the Chi-square test. The difference of the frequency of truncation variants between in-house exome sequencing data and gnomAD database was tested via the Chi-square test. A Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine the phenotypic differences between the two groups of patients because the data were not distributed normally. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    Totally, 165 variants were detected based on our exome sequencing data, including 143 missense variants, 20 truncation variants (10 nonsense, nine frameshift, and one splicing change variants), and two inframe variants. Potential pathogenic variants were detected in 16 families, including 11 new families and five previously described families. Of the 16 families, seven families with adRP had heterozygous truncation variants in the middle portion, while eight families with arRP and one family with macular degeneration (MD) had biallelic variants in the N- and C-terminals, involving 17 variants (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Of the 17 variants, seven were novel, i.e., c.256C > A (p.Pro86Thr), c.1987A > T (p.Lys663*), c.2062G > T (p.Gly688*), c.2399_2400del (p.Lys800Serfs*6), c.2700dup (p.Pro901Thrfs*2), c.5017del (p.Tyr1673Metfs*37), and c.6341_6343del (p.Ser2114del). These variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and co-segregated with the disease in families with available family members (Supplementary Figure S1). Biallelic missense variants were detected in five probands, in which one was with adRP, while the other four were with other conditions (Supplementary Table S2).\n\n    In addition, 12 single heterozygous truncation variants were identified in 44 individuals from our cohort. Of the 12 variants, 11 located at the N- and C- terminals were identified in 43 unrelated individuals and were considered non-pathogenic. Of the 43 individuals, seven were affected with RP and the remaining 36 with various conditions other than RP (Supplementary Table S3). Five different truncations involved in the seven patients with RP were unlikely pathogenic based on the following evidence: (1) the c.257dup (p.Arg87Serfs*48) was detected in three patients with RP and four individuals with unrelated conditions; (2) the c.1826C > G (p.Ser609*) was detected in one patient with RP who had biallelic pathogenic variants in EYS; (3) the c.4690del (p.Val1564*) was detected in a patient with X-linked RP and a patient with other condition; (4) the c.5017del (p.Tyr1673Metfs*37) was detected in one patient with isolated RP and four patients with other conditions; and (5) the c.5797C > T (p.Arg1933*) was detected in one patient with RP and 19 unrelated individuals with other conditions. These heterozygous variants were not enriched in patients with RP, and their frequency in our cohort is comparable with that in the East Asian population in gnomAD database (P = 0.94), suggesting that these 11 variants were unlikely pathogenic for retinal degeneration in heterozygous status. Apart from the 11, the remaining heterozygous c.2391_2392del (p.Asp799*) variant was located in the middle portion of RP1 and was detected in a college student with late-onset high myopia without any sign of RP. The p.Asp799* is a known variant associated with cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) in homozygous status in a previous study. Besides, none of the heterozygous missense variants predicted to be damaging were associated with adRP in our cohort.\n\n    A total of 185 RP1 variants have been reported in the literature, including 147 truncation variants (51 nonsense, 95 frameshift, and one splicing) (Supplementary Table S4) and 38 missense variants (Supplementary Table S5). Of the 147 truncation variants, 85 were reported to cause recessive diseases, 58 were reported to lead to dominant diseases, and four were identified in patients with both dominant and recessive diseases. Of the 38 missense variants, 22 were reported to be recessive, 15 were reported to be dominant, and one was reported to be both dominant and recessive (Supplementary Table S5). The diseases associated with the 185 variants of RP1 included RP, CRD, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), MD, and unclassified inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) (Supplementary Tables S4, S5).\n\n    In our cohort, the six RP1 heterozygous truncation variants associated with adRP in seven families were located in the region from c.1987 (p.663) to c.2700 (p.901), which was immediately downstream of the BIF domain (Table 1 and Figure 1). For the nine families with biallelic variants, five had homozygous truncation variants located in the C-terminal region, including c.4690del (p.Val1564*) in three families, c.5017del (p.Tyr1673Metfs*37) in one, and c.5797C > T (p.Arg1933*) in one; one had compound heterozygous truncations, c.257dup (p.Arg87Serfs*48) and c.4804C > T (p.Gln1602*); two had compound heterozygous variants, one truncation and one missense; the remaining one had compound heterozygous variants, one inframe and one missense (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). In addition, 11 likely benign single heterozygous truncation variants were located at N- and C- terminals (Supplementary Table S3).\n\n    From the literature, 58 heterozygous truncation variants of RP1 were reported to be associated with dominant diseases. Of the 58, 55 from 152 families were located in a region from c.1981 (p.661) to c.2749 (p.917) (Figure 1). Of the 85 biallelic variants from the literature, 79 from 117 families were located in the N- and C-terminal regions, namely, c.1 (p.1)-c.1837 (p.613) and c.2816 (p.939)-c.6471 (p.2157) (Figure 1). Combining our in-house data and the data from the literature, three regions in RP1 were suggested, N-terminal from c.1 (p.1) to c.1837 (p.613), middle portion from c.1981 (p.661) to c.2749 (p.917), and C-terminal from c.2816 (p.939) to c. 6471 (p.2157) (Figure 1). A common feature could be identified as follows: truncations in the middle portion are associated with adRP, while those in the N- and C- terminals are responsible for arRP, which was supported by most truncation variants (91.9%, 147/160).\n\n    However, conflict results were reported for at least 13 truncation variants in RP1 (; Supplementary Table S6). Of the 13 variants, seven located in the middle portion were reported to be responsible for arRP rather than adRP, while six located in the N- and C-terminals caused adRP rather than arRP. Surprisingly, four of the 13 were involved in both adRP and arRP (Supplementary Table S6). In addition, the c.2391_2392del (p.Asp799*) located in the middle portion was reported to cause arCRD in homozygous status, which was supported by our study where a heterozygous carrier did not have any sign of RP. These raise questions on how to explain the common feature vs. the rare conflict results.\n\n    For the 38 missense variants from the literature, 22 variants involved in recessive retinal degeneration, and all of them were located at the N- and C-terminals (Supplementary Figure S2). The c.606C > A (p.Asp202Glu) variant was the most common and was detected in 17 families in homozygous status, including 13 families with arMD, three families with arRP, and one family with arCRD. This variant was absent from the gnomAD database. In contrast, 15 missense variants were reported to cause adRP and distributed scattered across the whole coding region of RP1, but segregation information was not described for 13 of the 15 variants. The remaining one, c.1118C > T (p.Thr373Ile), with a frequency of 3434/282692 in gnomAD database, was reported in patients with either dominant or recessive retinal degeneration, which is apparently a non-pathogenic variant. No heterozygous missense variant predicted to be damaging was identified to be responsible for adRP in our cohort.\n\n    From our in-house data, a total of 21 individuals from 16 families were detected with potential pathogenic truncation variants in RP1. Clinical data were available in 17 of the 21 individuals. These individuals complained of a variety of initial clinical manifestation, including night blindness, decreased visual acuity, or narrowing of visual field. The age at onset of these individuals ranged from childhood to 52 years old. The age at examination ranged from 9 to 57 years with visual acuity varying from no light perception to 0.5 (Snellen equivalent). Sixteen of the 17 individuals with potential pathogenic variants showed typical RP fundus changes including waxy pale optic disc, attenuated vessels, and periphery degeneration with bone spicule pigmentation with or without obvious macula involvement (Figure 2). Electroretinogram recordings of four patients showed severely decreased to distinguished responses for both of the rods and cones at the ages of 10, 34, 37, and 53 years old, respectively. The remaining one of the 17, a 53 year-old patient with a homozygous c.5797C > T (p.Arg1933*) had macular degeneration rather than RP (Figure 2C). Combined with our in-house data and the data obtained from the literature review (Figure 3), patients with arRP due to biallelic RP1 variants had a significantly earlier age at onset (Figure 3B, Z = -6.66, P = 2.76*10-11), worse visual acuity (Figure 3C, Z = -3.75, P = 1.75*10-4), and seemingly more likely to have degeneration involving both of the macular and mid-peripheral retina (Figures 2, 3D, P = 0.061) (compared to adRP due to heterozygous RP1 variants, in which mid-peripheral retina was mainly affected).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, results from a systemic analysis of RP1 variants from our in-house data as well as those from published literature demonstrate some common features of pathogenic variants in this gene, including: (1) about 80% of pathogenic variants are truncation variants; (2) truncation variants in the middle portion (c.1981 to c.2749) are associated with adRP, while those in the N-terminal (c.1 to c.1837) and C-terminal (c.2816 to c.6471) are responsible for arRP, supported by 91.9% of truncations; and (3) heterozygous truncation variants alone in the N- and C- terminals are unlikely pathogenic. Several questions remain to be clarified in future studies regarding the pathogenicity of the following RP1 variants: (1) truncation variants located in the two gaps between the N-terminal and middle portion as well as between the middle portion and C-terminal; (2) homozygous truncation variants around the c.5797 and thereafter; (3) missense variants, especially those with adRP; (4) the mechanism for the common features of RP1 truncation variants; and (5) the possible reasons for 8.1% of truncation variants with phenotypes contrary to the common feature. Awareness of these common features and unsolved questions is important in this era of widespread application of clinical gene testing.\n\n    The pathogenicity of truncation variants of RP1 has been previously reported to be related to the location of the gene. first defined four classes of truncation variants in RP1: Class I, from p.1 to p.263, does not cause RP; Class II, from p.500 to p.1053, causes adRP; Class III, from p.263 to p.500 and from p.1053 to p.1751, causes arRP; Class IV, from p.1816 to p.2156, does not cause RP. However, variants in the non-pathogenic Class I and Class IV regions have subsequently been identified in patients with arRP. In addition, some variants in the Class II region, associated with adRP, have been reported to cause arRP in homozygous or compound heterozygous status. Therefore, several studies reported that the RP1 variants at N-terminal and C-terminal regions were associated with arRP and those at the middle region resulted in adRP, and suggested that the boundary of the region associated with adRP was located between p.677 and p.917. In our cohort, the c.257dup (p.Arg87Serfs*48) variant, located in the Class I region, was identified in two siblings from one family with typical RP changes in trans with the c.4804C > T (p.Gln1602*) (Figures 2A,B). Furthermore, the boundaries of these three regions were refined based on a systemic analysis of our in-house exome-sequencing data and the literature review, namely, the arRP region, from c.1 (p.1) to c.1837 (p.613) in the N-terminal and from c.2816 (p.939) to c.6471 (p.2157) in the C-terminal, and the adRP region, from c.1981 (p.661) to c.2749 (p.917) in the middle portion. The difference of the middle portion for adRP between this study and the previous studies is the extension of this region between p.677 and p.917 to p.661-p.917. The c.1981G > T (p.Glu661*) variant is defined as the upstream boundary of the middle portion because it has been identified in three independent families with adRP and cosegregated with adRP in one family. Although the boundaries among different regions have been well outlined based on our data and data from at least 291 families, there are still two gaps in between without enough information. As for the 13 truncation variants contrary to the common feature, some might be problematic while the others may represent a variable expression of phenotypes. For example, four truncation variants were initially reported to cause dominant retinal degeneration and then were reported to cause recessive diseases in trans with the other allele in subsequent studies. Clinically variable expression from hardly identifiable to typical phenotypes have been observed in RP patients from the same family with the same mutation in other gene like RHO, and such phenomenon could not be excluded for RP1 variants. In addition, age-dependent expression of the diseases might also be considered. In these cases, wide-field examination of fundus such as scanning laser ophthalmoscope and electroretinogram may be of help in identifying mild or early signs of RP, especially in those carriers of individuals with variants associated with both dominant and recessive retinal degeneration. Co-segregation of those variants as well as well-defined phenotypes in family members may provide additional information in clarifying these conflict results. Moreover, a few variants with conflict result may represent a unique point-dependent rather than region-dependent pathogenicity of dominant or recessive nature. For example, the c.2391_2392del (p.Asp799*), located in the middle portion and supposed to be causative for adRP, has been reported to cause arCRD with firm evidence in previous study and is identified in an adult without any sign of RP in heterozygous status in our cohort.\n\n    Besides, the c.5797C > T (p.Arg1933*) variant located at the C-terminal has been reported to be non-pathogenic either in heterozygous or in homozygous status. However, it can cause recessive diseases in trans with another truncation variant of RP1 located upstream. It has been suggested that the effect of the c.5797C > T (p.Arg1933*) variant might be between monogenic and complex diseases. In our cohort, this variant in homozygosis was identified in a 53 year-old singleton case with macular degeneration (Figure 2C). No pathogenic variants in other genes were detected in this patient based on the whole exome sequencing. Unfortunately, further clinical examination of the patients is unavailable except for fundus photographs. This raises questions on whether the c.5797C > T variant as well as other truncations downstream are pathogenic or not in homozygous status.\n\n    So far, it is unclear for the molecular mechanism about dominant in the middle while recessive in the N- and C- terminals for RP1 truncation variants. Mutations in several other genes such as GUCY2D, RHO, CRX, etc., are also associated with both dominant and recessive retinal degeneration, but the situation is a little different for them. For truncations in CRX and RHO, loss-of-function mutations are responsible for autosomal recessive diseases while dominant-negative mutations lead to autosomal dominant diseases. As for GUCY2D, most variants are associated with autosomal recessive LCA but the heterozygous substitution of the arginine at p.838 could cause autosomal dominant CRD. The arginine at p.838 is the most sensitive position of GUCY2D protein. The mutants at arginine 838 shift the Ca2+-sensitivity in the guanylate cyclase-activating proteins mediated activation. This shift can be overactive and in some reported cases the activity level does not return to the basal level. The abnormal higher activity from the heterozygous 838 mutations leads to CRD, while the loss of partial or total function is tolerable in heterozygous status but is causative and leads LCA in biallelic status. For RP1 truncation variants, some studies have excluded haploinsufficiency and gain-of-function as the causative mechanism of RP1 variants. The variants involving the BIF domain, which is crucial for the photoreceptor, will lead to haploinsufficiency of RP1 either by triggering nonsense-mediated decay or by producing a loss-of-function protein. Therefore, heterozygous variants located within or upstream of the BIF domain will not cause diseases. For the variants associated with adRP, the truncated production will preserve the BIF domain and may cause disease via a dominant-negative effect. However, the variants at the C-terminal recessive region, which can also produce a protein with the BIF domain, would not cause diseases in heterozygous status. It has been assumed that an unrecognized domain is present downstream of the BIF domain. The unknown domain may be important for the interaction of RP1 with other proteins by cooperating with the BIF domain. It implies that the heterozygous variants will be non-pathogenic either loss of both the BIF domain and the unrecognized domain or preserve with both domains, while the heterozygous variants will cause retinal degeneration with preserved BIF domain but loss of the unrecognized domain. Functional studies are expected to disclose the exact mechanism of the unique feature associated with RP1 variants.\n\n    Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed that patients with biallelic variants showed more severe phenotypes than those with heterozygous variants, including an earlier age at onset, worse visual acuity, and fundus changes especially in the macular region. The limitation of this study is not knowing the exact age at onset because of the nature of a retrospective study and lack of supporting evidence from functional studies.\n\n    In conclusion, in this study, a pooled analysis of our exome-sequencing data and the literature review confirmed and refined the common features and the boundaries between dominant and recessive truncation variants in RP1. It also raises unsolved problems that are worth investigating in the future. The unique features and questions identified in RP1 may not only be valuable for its clinical application and further studies but also reminds us of the possibility of such features and questions in other genes that are awaited to be identified.",

        "Title": "    How I curate: applying American Society of Hematology-Clinical Genome Resource Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel rules for RUNX1 variant curation for germline predisposition to myeloid malignancies",
        "Abstract": "    The broad use of next-generation sequencing and microarray platforms in research and clinical laboratories has led to an increasing appreciation of the role of germline mutations in genes involved in hematopoiesis and lineage differentiation that contribute to myeloid neoplasms. Despite implementation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology 2015 guidelines for sequence variant interpretation, the number of variants deposited in ClinVar, a genomic repository of genotype and phenotype data, and classified as having uncertain significance or being discordantly classified among clinical laboratories remains elevated and contributes to indeterminate or inconsistent patient care. In 2018, the American Society of Hematology and the Clinical Genome Resource co-sponsored the Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel to develop rules for classifying gene variants associated with germline predisposition to myeloid neoplasia. Herein, we demonstrate application of our rules developed for the RUNX1 gene to variants in six examples to show how we would classify them within the proposed framework.",
        "Introduction": "    Germline mutations in genes involved in hematopoiesis and lineage differentiation predispose patients to myeloid neoplasia with or without thrombocytopenia. The broad adoption of next-generation sequencing and microarrays in the clinical laboratory has expanded our knowledge of germline contribution to myeloid neoplasia. Drazer et al. reported that in six of 24 patients with myeloid neoplasia, presumed somatic variants in DDX41, GATA2 and TP53 were of germline origin. Similarly, Churpek et al. showed that 29% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) kindreds with a positive family history carried a variant in one of 12 genes associated with germline predisposition to hematopoietic malignancies, including FANCA, GATA2, RUNX1, and SBDS. To date, more than 65 genes have been associated with a predisposition to hematologic malignancies. Recognizing the contribution of germline variation toward myeloid neoplasia, the 'WHO classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues' incorporated the classification of myeloid neoplasia with germline predisposition in their 2016 revised edition.\n\n    In parallel, clinical laboratories are increasingly offering broad next-generation sequencing-based tests for patients with myeloid neoplasia for somatic testing, and will readily detect germline variants, if present in a patient. While there is increased clinical awareness of the potential for these germline variants to contribute to a patient's disease, there are often insufficient data in the literature to definitively classify whether a detected variant is contributing to the patient's phenotype. For example, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which germline mutations in RUNX1 result in thrombocytopenia, platelet functional and/or ultrastructural defects, and/or susceptibility to hematologic malignancies commonly including MDS, AML, and other malignancies (Table 1). ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) is a database repository of clinically actionable genomic variants that currently lists 325 germline RUNX1 variants deposited by clinical laboratories. More than half of these variants are currently reported as being of uncertain significance.\n\n    Worldwide, most clinical laboratories follow the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines for sequence variant interpretation. In this framework, germline variants are classified using a five-tier system: benign (BEN), likely benign (LBEN), variant of uncertain significance (VUS), likely pathogenic (LPATH) and pathogenic (PATH). During sequence variant interpretation, laboratories systematically review the supporting criteria of a genomic variant, such as: minor allele frequencies (MAF), computational predictions, functional experiments and segregation with disease in order to determine the five-tier classification.\n\n    Although the ACMG/AMP guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for sequence variant interpretation, the high rate of VUS and curation discrepancies continue to be an impediment to accurate clinical annotation and interpretation of genomic variants. To encourage genomic and phenotypic data sharing, and engage experts in consensus-driven variant interpretation, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) convened Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEP) to develop gene- and disease-specific modifications of the original guidelines and provide expert-reviewed variant classification for depositing into ClinVar (Online Supplementary Figure S1). In 2018, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) sponsored a ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel (MM-VCEP), composed of 34 international members, who started working on gene- and disease-specific rules for RUNX1 as the first of several genes conferring predisposition to myeloid malignancies (Online Supplementary Figure S1A). After designing, modifying and testing the preliminary RUNX1 rules on 52 pilot variants, which improved classification in 33% VUS or variants with conflicting interpretations (CONF), MM-VCEP-specified ACMG/AMP rules were approved by the ClinGen oversight committee and efforts to curate variants to ClinVar using the Variant Curation Interface have commenced (Online Supplementary Figure S1B). This pilot effort resulted in one variant being upgraded to PATH, two variants being upgraded to LPATH, and three variants being downgraded to LBEN. ClinGen's website contains the MM-VCEP variant classification recommendations and any subsequent modifications to these codes over time (https://www.clinicalgenome.org/affiliation/10034/).\n\n    Herein, we demonstrate the application of RUNX1-specific rules (Table 2) to classify nine representative RUNX1 variants in six examples (Table 3) while reviewing phenotypic criteria for FPD/AML and summarizing molecular and functional roles of RUNX1.\n\n    A 50-year old female with new pancytopenia was referred to a hematology service. A bone marrow biopsy showed hypocellularity with severe trilineage dysplasia and 12% blasts, diagnostic of MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB-2). Further investigation showed pathogenic variants in RUNX1 (NM_001754:c.610C>T, (p.Arg204Ter)), BCOR and ASXL1 with a normal karyotype. The medical history was positive for thrombocytopenia (baseline 70-120x109/L) and a propensity to excessive bleeding after tooth extractions. The family history was positive for two sons with persistent thrombocytopenia (baseline 50-100x109/L) not otherwise explained and a granddaughter with thrombocytopenia and MDS with monosomy 7 (Figure 1). During the initial assessment, an increase in lactate dehydrogenase and the peripheral blast count were noted. A second marrow biopsy confirmed transformation into AML with 40% blasts. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy without achieving remission and clofarabine bridging for unrelated stem cell transplantation. During conditioning, the patient developed sepsis with Gram-negative bacteria and died shortly afterwards. Since she had a remarkable personal and family history pointing towards a germline predisposition syndrome, a skin biopsy was performed at the time of the diagnosis of MDS, and DNA testing from cultured skin fibroblasts later confirmed the germline, nonsense RUNX1 variant. Her two sons and granddaughter also tested positive for the RUNX1 variant (Figure 1).\n\n    Similar to this case, most patients with FPD/AML will have a characteristic phenotype (Table 1) including mild to moderate thrombocytopenia with normal platelet size, platelet alpha or dense granule secretion defects and impaired platelet aggregation, particularly in response to collagen and epinephrine as well as a predisposition to hematologic malignancies. Although there is variability in disease onset in FPD/AML, development of a hematologic malignancy is common with a lifetime risk of ~44%: AML and MDS are common, other malignancies occur less frequently (Table 1). FPD/AML has a high but incomplete penetrance, with several affected individuals reported to have normal platelet counts or function. The nonsense mutation in this patient (p.Arg204Ter) is predicted to lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the RUNX1 mRNA transcript. RUNX1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 and is translated into three major isoforms, designated RUNX1A, RUNX1B, and RUNX1C, by using two different promoters and alternative splicing. All transcripts are expressed during hematopoietic differentiation and/or maintenance of normal bone marrow function. For variant annotation, the MM-VCEP utilizes the longest isoform, RUNX1C (NM_001754), as the default transcript, which includes all key domains such as the 128 amino acid (AA) long RUNT homology domain for DNA binding (RHD, AA 77-204), transactivation domain (TAD), inhibitory domain (ID) and the transcriptional repressor binding motif (VWRPY) and is most often used by clinical laboratories for RUNX1 variant curation (Figure 2A). Germline variants have been reported throughout the gene in ClinVar with the majority currently classified as VUS (Figure 2B). The RUNX1 protein heterodimerizes through its RHD with CBFbeta to form a master hematopoietic transcription factor (Figure 2C), which is essential for proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, especially in the case of megakaryocytic differentiation. Somatic mutations commonly occur in RUNX1 (Figure 2D). According to RUNX1-specific criteria (Table 2), the MM-VCEP applied the following codes (Table 3): PVS1 (nonsense variant predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated decay), PM2 (absence in all population databases), PS4_supporting (one proband meeting at least one of the RUNX1 phenotype criteria), PP1 (co-segregation with disease in the family, three meioses) and arrived at a consensus classification of PATH.\n\n    Missense mutations in RUNX1 commonly occur in the RHD in somatic and germline contexts. Of 325 RUNX1 ClinVar variants 122 (37.5%) are missense, and currently in ClinVar, none in the RHD has been classified as BEN or LBEN (Figure 2C). When a novel missense variant is identified which has not been established as PATH or LPATH, it can be difficult to know whether the given change will affect protein function and explain the patient's phenotype. For example, two RUNX1 missense variants in the RHD (NM_001754:c.314A>C, p.(His105Pro); and NM_001754:c.315C>A, p.(His105Gln)) were considered during the pilot variant analysis. The former was initially classified as a VUS in ClinVar (Figure 2B), but subsequently revised to LPATH upon MM-VCEP review (Figures 2B, 3A and 4). The conclusion of the LPATH assertion is based on the codes applied for this variant: PM2, PP3, PS4_supporting, PM1_supporting, and PM5_supporting (Table 3). Since the variant is completely absent from population databases, the MAF code PM2 is applied. For in-silico evaluation of missense variants, the MM-VCEP recommends using REVEL, a meta-predictor that combines 13 individual tools with high sensitivity and specificity, which has demonstrated the highest performance compared with individual tools or other ensemble methods. The computational prediction code PP3 is applicable to the p.His105Pro variant due to a high REVEL score of 0.953 (MM-VCEP defined >0.75 as the cutoff). The ClinVar submitter (SCV000807773.1) provided us with the patient's clinical data from their laboratory and the proband met at least one of the RUNX1 phenotype criteria (Table 1) which qualified for PS4_supporting. This example emphasizes the critical value of sharing internal laboratory data. There is only one meiosis in this family which is lower than the three required for the segregation code PP1. The MM-VCEP defined 13 residues in the RHD as the mutational hotspots for the PM1 code. In addition, variants in other parts of the RHD (AA 105-204) can have a reduced strength-level resulting in application of PM1_supporting. The last code PM5_supporting is applied on the p.(His105Pro) variant, because a different missense change p.(His105Gln) at the same residue has been classified as LPATH by the MM-VCEP (Table 3).\n\n    The codes PM2, PP3, PM1_supporting are also applicable to the p.(His105Gln) variant for the same reasons described. Furthermore, a strong pathogenic code PS3 is applied which contributes a significant weight to the final assertion. Transactivation assays of the p.(His105Gln) variant demonstrate altered transactivation (<20% of wildtype) and secondary assays also indicate altered DNA binding and functional consequences in a mouse model manifested by disturbed myeloid differentiation and induction of a blast crisis or accelerated phase-like phenotype in mice. These variants highlight the importance of evaluating similar variants and the critical benefit of functional studies showing that variants whose clinical significance were initially uncertain can be subsequently clarified to provide more definitive clinical classification and minimize reporting of VUS. Moreover, these variants demonstrate the value of leveraging the information on one variant to help classify another and data sharing between laboratories (Table 3).\n\n    RUNX1 NM_001754:c.253C>A, p.(His85Asn) is a missense mutation located within the RHD, but not within the mutational hotspot region (AA 105-204), with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity in ClinVar (Figure 2B, C). Specifically, this variant had three submissions in ClinVar with two being PATH (submitted in 2002) and one being a VUS (submitted in 2018). The two 2002 submissions are from OMIM, which cited evidence from individual literature sources without a systematic curation process. Osato et al. reported an adult patient with AML carrying this variant. However, the germline nature of the variant was not definitively determined. This variant has also been reported in an infant diagnosed with transient myeloproliferative disorder and Down syndrome whose phenotype does not meet any of the RUNX1 phenotype criteria. After analysis and curation by the MM-VCEP using the RUNX1-specific classification rules, this variant was re-classified as LBEN, meeting codes BS1 and BS3, despite meeting PP3 (Table 3). According to the penetrance, prevalence and genetic and allelic heterogeneity of RUNX1, MM-VCEP refined the RUNX1 specific MAF threshold for application of BS1 to 0.00015 (0.015%). The highest MAF of the p.His85Asn variant is 0.00043 (8 out of 18,768 alleles) from the East Asian subpopulation in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) which is higher than the RUNX1-specific BS1 cutoff. Experimental studies have shown that this missense change displays normal transactivation activities (80-114% of wildtype) and does not affect DNA binding, heterodimerization with CBFbeta or subcellular localization of the RUNX1 protein. Therefore, the strong benign functional evidence code, BS3, is applied. Although this variant disrupts KMT2A binding, which impairs proper H3K4 histone methylation, this is not a qualified functional assay based on the MM-VCEP RUNX1-specific PS3/BS3 rule. Moreover, another well-established BEN variant p.(Leu56Ser) also impairs KMT2A binding. Likely due to the location of the p.(His85Asn) variant within the RHD (Figure 2B), the REVEL score (0.852) of this variant is higher than the MM-VCEP defined 0.75 cutoff, which results in the variant meeting a conflicting PP3 code. However, combining the BS1, BS3 and PP3 codes, a final assertion of LBEN is made based on a Bayesian classification framework. Given that His85 is located away from binding interfaces in the three-dimensional structure (Figure 3B), it seems reasonable that variants at this position are LBEN.\n\n    This example highlights the value of functional studies in the context of the MM-VCEP variant curation and shows that substantive corrections of variant annotation may occur upon application of ClinGen MM-VCEP rules. Implicit in this process is the expectation that as knowledge about FPD/AML improves with more functional or family data becoming available, the MM-VCEP rules are subject to revision so that annotation of clinical variants will become more accurate (Figure 4). ClinVar variant classifications such as VUS or those with conflicting interpretations may thus evolve to more diagnostic certainty.\n\n    RUNX1 variants affecting canonical splice positions +-1 or 2 at intron-exon boundaries are expected to disrupt splicing, leading to protein dysfunction (see Online Supplementary Table S3 of reference by Luo and Feurstein). All of the three canonical splicing site variants in the pilot set were classified as PATH or LPATH. More challenging, however, is the consideration of synonymous/intronic/non-coding variants which may result in cryptic splice site activation, and/or enhancement or repression of adjacent canonical splice sites. For example, the intronic NM_001754:c.508+3delA variant has been reported in a single family with disease segregation (8 meioses, PP1_strong). Several family members were diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, aspirin-like platelet aggregation defects, and dense granule abnormalities. This variant is absent from population databases (PM2) and both splicing predictors (MaxEntScan and Splice -SiteFinder) predict a significant decrease in the score of the canonical splice site (PP3). Moreover, experimental reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies (PS3), using RNA derived from two affected family members, were performed and indicate the creation of a novel cryptic splice site 23 nucleotides upstream of the normal splice site resulting in a frameshift p.(Arg162fs*177), and the transcript is predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated decay. Combining all of these codes, a final assertion of PATH is given by the MM-VCEP (Table 3).\n\n    BP7 is a benign code specifically designed to evaluate synonymous/intronic/non-coding variants in the ACMG/AMP framework. BP7 can be applied if computational evidence suggests no impact on splicing, and the nucleotide is not conserved. The ClinVar variant with conflicting interpretations in ClinVar, NM_001754:c.444C>T, p.(Thr148=), has been classified as LBEN by the MM-VCEP using BP7 and the benign in silico prediction code, BP4 (Table 3). This nucleotide change is predicted to have no impact on splicing and it is also not conserved (phyloPscore: -4.3832, below the MM-VCEP-specified threshold of <0.1). Clinical data from seven individuals with this variant were acquired from the original ClinVar submitter (SCV000761123.1) and revealed that none of the probands met any of the RUNX1 phenotypic criteria. Currently, only two RUNX1 variants have been reported to display an abnormal splicing effect as demonstrated by RNA assays. The potential effects of other splicing variants rely solely on in silico predictions. Although there is robust effort in consideration of algorithms to predict the effects of splicing variants, these algorithms require further evaluation. Indeed, we know of only limited experimental data within the RUNX1 gene specifically to test these tools. Accordingly, the synonymous variant, NM_001754:c.1257G>A, p.(Val419=) is predicted to create alternative splice acceptor sites, but is not expected to abolish any existing consensus sites, as it is too far away from either end of the exon. Due to this in silico prediction result, none of the PP3/BP4 and BP7 codes can be assigned, and the classification of this variant remains a VUS. Further resolution of the significance of this variant could be obtained through parental testing, and/or RNA-sequencing data.\n\n    Not infrequently, patients with FPD/AML have been reported to have copy number variants resulting in intragenic deletions of RUNX1. As part of our pilot cohort, we evaluated several probands with copy number variants which at a minimum include RUNX1 exon 2 deletion; data from two cases are shown (Figure 5). The analysis of copy number variants by using next-generation sequencing and/or single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays is particularly challenging because the breakpoints are often not captured in the sequenced regions or the microarray resolution defines only a range for the chromosomal location of the breakpoint, respectively, and thus the nucleotide level breakpoint may remain unknown. It can, therefore, be difficult to know the effect of partial gene/exon deletions, such as if the deletion is in- or out-of-frame, the latter of which may also lead to the introduction of a premature stop codon. Nevertheless, partial or whole gene deletion of RUNX1 is expected to result in haploinsufficiency of the RUNX1 protein. Although MM-VCEP rules did not include recommendations for the formal classification of copy number variants, several points should be noted. First, evaluation of the reference Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home) shows that copy number variants affecting RUNX1 do not appear to be frequent. Second, annotation of the specific breakpoints of these intragenic deletions may not always be possible, given that whole genome sequencing is not typically performed. Since contiguous exon deletion is a common pathogenic disease mechanism, it is imperative that laboratories performing germline testing for RUNX1 use concurrent microarray testing, develop appropriate next-generation sequencing bioinformatics pipelines, or use alternate molecular techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, to screen for and exclude copy loss, as sequencing for single nucleotide variants and indels alone is insufficient for comprehensive germline evaluation. For the two cases herein (Figure 5), although we do not know the specific breakpoints for each, the common deletion of at least exon 2 allows us to apply the following codes: PVS1_moderate, PM2, PS4 (4 probands: 3 with chronic thrombocytopenia and 1 with AML), PP1_strong (7 meioses) to arrive at a PATH classification (Table 3).\n\n    A 14-year old male with a non-contributory family history presented with malaise, poor appetite, night sweats, and intermittent fever of about 1-month duration, thrombocytopenia (27x109/L), and subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed AML (PS4_supporting). After whole genome and exome sequencing on paired tumor and germline samples, along with RNA-sequencing (directed for recurrent fusion identification), his leukemia sample was shown to be RUNX1-mutated (NM_001754:c.1118C>A, (p.Ser373Ter)), hypodiploid with Y chromosome loss, without chromosomal fusions, and loss of heterozygosity, but had additional mutations including an intragenic heterozygous deletion of one copy of exon 7 of PALB2 (Table 4).\n\n    Similar to Example 1, this RUNX1 (p.Ser373Ter) variant is a nonsense mutation; however, it is not predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated decay, but rather is expected to generate a truncated protein without part of the TAD, ID and the VWRPY motif (Figure 2A). From a computational and predictive perspective, a PVS1_strong code is assigned following the PVS1 decision tree for null or truncating variants in RUNX1. The variant is absent from the gnomAD and other population databases (with confirmed >20x sequencing coverage at this position in gnomAD). Given the variant's absence from population databases and adequate sequencing coverage of the region, a PM2 code is assigned. Although no additional evidence for the other categories (functional, segregation, de novo and allelic data) are available, this variant can be classified as LPATH (PVS1_strong, PM2, PS4_supporting). It is of interest to note that the somatic alterations reported in the diagnostic leukemia sample included partial tandem duplication of KMT2A and a single nucleotide variation in PHF6. Alterations in these two genes have been reported as cooperating events seen in leukemias from patients with germline RUNX1 mutations.\n\n    Importantly, if consideration is given to the mutations found in the leukemic cells in isolation, one cannot determine the germline or somatic origin of the variants reported. This is the case for most of the 'tumor-only' analyses being performed in many clinical laboratories. Without paired analysis of true germline tissue (e.g. cultured skin fibroblasts), such studies cannot definitively identify germline variants. In this case, the KMT2A partial tandem duplication and single nucleotide variation in PHF6 and RUNX1 could be tumor-drivers in the AML. However, given the sequencing data, including the variant allele frequency, both the RUNX1 mutation and the PALB2 exon 7 intragenic deletion could be germline variants. A detected variant allele frequency approaching 50% or 100% in the tumor may indicate potential germline origin with either an intact wildtype allele or loss of heterozygosity, respectively. However, a high variant allele frequency cannot reliably serve as a proxy for testing of a true germline source. Therefore, if there is concern that a variant could be constitutional, testing of true germline material is critical.",

        "Conclusion": "    RUNX1 germline mutations associated with FPD/AML are key events in myeloid neoplasms, thrombocytopenia and leukemogenesis and represent a model of a germline gene disorder with pathogenic variants predisposing to myeloid and (to a lesser extent) lymphoid malignancies. Providing an accurate clinical and pathologic variant interpretation for genomic variants detected in routine laboratory testing will remain critical for the provision of appropriate clinical care, including genetic counseling for the index patient and their at-risk relatives and donor-selection, in some cases benefiting from stem cell transplantation.\n\n    The ClinGen MM-VCEP variant interpretation process requires a detailed understanding of the biological and functional properties of RUNX1 and disease phenotype. Here, we demonstrate the process for sequence variant interpretation of six variant examples. By introducing and thus standardizing genomic variant interpretation, we hope to improve patients' care, identify VUS that may benefit from directed research and encourage sharing of internal laboratory data to resolve uncertainty. In doing so, the MM-VCEP rules may ensure optimal insurance coverage for appropriate genomic testing and screening of family members, and ensure appropriate reimbursement for clinical laboratories. Overall, the ASH/ClinGen collaboration resulting in the first set of modified criteria for germline RUNX1 variants should improve clinical care and recommendations for FPD/AML patients.\n\n    Check the online version for the most updated information on this article, online supplements, and information on authorship & disclosures: www.haematologica.org/content/105/4/870",
        "Discussion": "    Kindreds with FPD/AML were first reported by Luddy et al. in 1978 and phenotypically well-described as having a bleeding diathesis and myeloid neoplasia by Dowton et al. in 1985. Subsequent linkage analysis identified RUNX1 as the candidate gene at chromosome 21q22, and mutations were detected in FPD/AML families in 1999. Since these initial early reports, routine clinical testing for RUNX1 gene mutations is now commonplace for the evaluation of somatic and germline disease in patients with myeloid neoplasms and thrombocytopenia.\n\n    In general, RUNX1 variants include single nucleotide variations and indels, such as missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants, and copy number variations such as whole-gene and intragenic deletions. RUNX1 is also frequently mutated somatically in AML and often the partner of various translocations resulting in gene fusions, such as t(8;21)(q22;q22) RUNX1-RUNX1T1. To date, fusions of RUNX1 have not been reported in the germline context, and most germline RUNX1 variants are unique, although some have been rarely seen in unrelated families. Given the limited data on rare variants, the clinical annotation of new variants remains challenging. The MM-VCEP was convened by ASH/ClinGen (Online Supplementary Figure S1) to develop rules for curating gene variant causing predisposition to myeloid neoplasia (Table 2). In this review, we describe the classification of six variant examples (Table 3) using the gene- and disease-specific rule modifications of the original ACMG/AMP 2015 framework. Several points should be made.\n\n    First, it is critical to ensure that genomic testing intended to assess a germline predisposition is performed on a definitive germline sample because malignant hematologic diseases involve the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and somatic variants in these diseases can confound variant interpretation if an inappropriate sample is used. Here, in keeping with our MM-VCEP rules, cultured skin fibroblasts (gold standard, albeit invasive, costly, and time-consuming), cultured bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells or DNA from hair roots are appropriate sources. Alternatively, confirmation of the germline nature of a variant can be achieved by demonstrating its presence in two or more related individuals. The possibility of sample contamination by malignant cells is significant and consequently, peripheral blood, bone marrow, saliva, buccal swabs, DNA from paraffin blocks and even fingernails, which can contain monocytes, are inappropriate samples for germline testing. In some institutions, laboratories may accept T cells, enriched via flow cytometry sorting or column-based magnetic cell separation, as a germline sample for testing. It is important to recognize that some somatic alterations may occur early in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with multilineage potential to differentiate into T cells, as recent single-cell studies have confirmed. Thus, if T cells are used, the possibility that a detected variant may be somatic should still be considered. Once a variant is confirmed to be germline in a proband, however, additional testing for the known variant in related family members can be performed on any tissue source.\n\n    Second, we should keep an open mind about disease-causing alleles and the type of variants that may be seen and thus, we advocate for a broad testing approach. For example, in some laboratories, non-coding variants are automatically filtered as part of bioinformatic pipelines and may thus be omitted from subsequent review and interpretation. Recently, however, synonymous variants in the GATA2 gene, another gene predisposing to myeloid malignancy, were reported in addition to the known pathogenic deep intronic variants of an enhancer region of GATA2. In ANKRD26, variants of the 5' untranslated region cause disease. Furthermore, copy number alterations may not be assessed in somatic tumor testing panels. As diagnosticians, it is important to think broadly when analyzing genomic information for germline pathogenic variants. Given that these are rare diseases, we should not inadvertently exclude disease mechanisms and/or specific classes of mutations. For example, in case 4, some variants may remain as VUS until additional functional or familial segregation data become available for reclassification.\n\n    Third, definitive annotation of variants by one institution will likely remain challenging. However, consistent application of MM-VCEP rules with ClinVar data deposition and thus inter-laboratory correspondence can significantly improve the accuracy and consistency of variant curation. In this regard, examples 2, 3, and 5 show how leveraging shared genomic and phenotypic data can be helpful to clarify VUS. We therefore advocate that clinical variant data be deposited into ClinVar. Specifically, laboratories offering germline testing should modify their test requisition forms to indicate that de-identified phenotype and variant data will be deposited into ClinVar as part of ongoing quality assurance and improvement efforts (https://www.clini-calgenome.org/share-your-data/laboratories/). Additional details of the ClinVar deposition process are included in Online Supplementary Figure S1.\n\n    Fourth, RUNX1 variant curation will improve as more is understood about the disease and gene through functional and family studies. Currently, variant annotation remains a challenging task, because of limited data for determining the functional effect of a given variant change, despite methods of engineering variants for functional assessment. Early studies in Speck's laboratory on RUNX1 showed the significance of key residues in the RHD of RUNX1 by performing alanine scanning mutagenesis. However, these early approaches are limited in that not every combination of nucleotide change was explored. By contrast, recent high-throughput functional genomic methods, known as deep mutational scanning, utilize large-scale approaches to mutate every nucleotide of a gene, permitting one to test the functional consequence of all single nucleotide variations. This has, for example, been recently demonstrated for BRCA1. Additionally, systematic mutagenesis of PTEN has provided a wealth of functional data to inform the classification of PTEN variants, in conjunction with published rules developed by the PTEN-VCEP. In the future, focused functional assays targeting specific VUS and deep mutational scanning of genes should contribute to variant curation to resolve VUS.\n\n    Fifth, while functional testing of every given genomic variant is possible, it can be costly and difficult to do for every clinically significant gene. In this regard, family studies can aid in the classification of VUS. By systematically evaluating disease segregation in family members with paired genotyping for a known variant, accurate classification of a given variant can be achieved. For example, a recent study showed that this family-based method for variant classification can resolve a VUS classification more frequently than other traditional approaches can. For rare diseases, such as FPD/AML, detailed pedigree and segregation analyses can be incredibly informative, and clinicians should be encouraged to test family members when possible, seeking help from local genetic counselors and/or geneticists as needed. Hematologists and oncologists need to consistently take a detailed family and genetic history.",

        "Title": "    Identification of novel SNPs associated with coronary artery disease and birth weight using a pleiotropic cFDR method",
        "Abstract": "    Objectives: Clinical and epidemiological findings indicate an association between coronary artery disease (CAD) and low birth weight (BW). However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to identify novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CAD, BW, and their shared pleiotropic loci, and to detect the potential causal relationship between CAD and BW.\n\n    Methods: We first applied a genetic pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method to two independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics of CAD and BW to estimate the pleiotropic enrichment between them. Then, bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to clarify the causal association between these two traits.\n\n    Results: By incorporating related traits into a conditional analysis framework, we observed the significant pleiotropic enrichment between CAD and BW. By applying the cFDR level of 0.05, 109 variants were detected for CAD, 203 for BW, and 26 pleiotropic variants for both traits. We identified 11 CAD- and/or BW-associated SNPs that showed more than three of the metabolic quantitative trait loci (metaQTL), protein QTL (pQTL), methylation QTL (meQTL), or expression QTL (eQTL) effects. The pleiotropic SNP rs10774625, located at ATXN2, showed metaQTL, pQTL, meQTL, and eQTL effects simultaneously. Using the bi-directional MR approach, we found a negative association from BW to CAD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59 to 0.80, p = 1.57x 10-6).\n\n    Conclusion: We identified several pleiotropic loci between CAD and BW by leveraging GWAS results of related phenotypes and identified a potential causal relationship from BW to CAD. Our findings provide novel insights into the shared biological mechanisms and overlapping genetic heritability between CAD and BW.",
        "Introduction": "    Coronary artery disease (CAD) is characterized by the narrowing or obstruction of the coronary arteries, which can lead to chest pain, arrhythmia, heart failure, and even permanent heart damage. In 2017, over 485 million people suffered from CAD, resulting in 17.8 million deaths, making this disease the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.\n\n    Numerous studies have shown that early life experiences, including low birth weight (BW), may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the World Health Organization has classified low BW as a risk factor for CAD later in life. However, the prevalence of CAD does not decrease with higher BW accompanied by improved living conditions. In addition, many randomized controlled trials designed to improve BW revealed different results, leaving the relationship between BW and CAD unclear.\n\n    CAD and BW are highly influenced by multiple genetic factors with heritability estimates over 30-60% and 30-50%, respectively. With the development of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), more than 230 CAD-associated and 80 BW-associated loci have been detected. These loci describe only a small part of the genetic contribution, leaving a large proportion of \"missing heritability\" unexplained. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene or variant affects multiple phenotypes. Among the human genome, more than 17% of genes and 5% of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) show pleiotropic effects. Considering the potential causal relationship, large genetic determination, pleiotropic effect, and missing heritability between CAD and BW, it is necessary to illuminate biological mechanisms and uncover novel associated genetic variants for both traits.\n\n    By leveraging the pleiotropic effect in related traits, a conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method was developed without additional subjects recruitment. This approach is cost-effective and could improve the identification of novel genetic loci underlying missing heritability, thereby elucidating genetic mechanisms associated with multiple phenotypes. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization (MR) is an approach to investigate the potential causality between exposure and outcome using genetic instrumental variables. As genetic variants are randomly distributed among the population and are generally independent of confounders, such analysis may reduce confounding bias and eliminate potential reversed causal relationship.\n\n    In this study, we applied cFDR and bi-directional MR analyses to two large and independent GWAS datasets aiming to 1) identify additional novel loci and the genetic pleiotropy of CAD and BW, and 2) estimate the causality between CAD and BW. Therefore, we can improve SNP detection, and clarify the shared mechanic relationship and overlapping genetic heritability between these two traits better.",
        "Methods": "    The first CAD GWAS was obtained from the Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus The Coronary Artery Disease Genetics (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) Consortium. This meta-analysis of 48 multiple ancestry studies involved more than 8.6 million SNPs from 60,801 cases and 123,504 controls. The first BW dataset conducted by the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium consisted of 45 multiple ancestry studies including 321,223 subjects. As the control trait, the ASD dataset, collected by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, contained 15,954 participants with European ancestry (7,387 ASD cases and 8,567 controls). For validation, two other CAD and BW datasets were used. The validation CAD dataset, comprising 10,801 cases and 137,914 controls, was collected by the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium. The validation BW dataset, including 153,781 subjects, was collected by the EGG Consortium. All datasets contained the summary statistics of each locus and the conducted genomic control.\n\n    First, two GWAS datasets were combined and 8,285,296 common SNPs with summary statistics remained for both CAD and BW phenotypes. Then, we performed LD-based pruning (r2 <= 0.2) using HapMap III genotypes as a reference, and the SNP of the pair with longer allele frequency was retained. After merging and pruning, 141,779 variants were prepared for further analysis.\n\n    We constructed stratified Q-Q plots to estimate the pleiotropic enrichment in two related phenotypes using the \"ggplot2\" R package. In this study, -log10(p) which means the nominal p-value and -log10(q) which means the empirical quantile were plotted on the Y- and X-axes, respectively, at different significance levels (p <= 1, p <= 0.1, p <= 0.01, p <= 0.001, and p <= 0.0001). Under the null hypothesis, plots would fall on the line Y=X, and the enrichment of pleiotropic loci could be evaluated by the degree of leftward deviation from the null line. Additionally, we constructed fold-enrichment plots as a supplement for the Q-Q plots. Fold-enrichment and -log10(p) were plotted on the Y- and X-axes, respectively, at different significance levels (p <= 1, p <= 0.1, p <= 0.01, and p <= 0.001) for CAD and BW. Pleiotropy could be visually observed via an upward deflection from the baseline (for the group including all SNPs (p = 1)).\n\n    The cFDR method was used to estimate the possibility that a random SNP was not associated with the primary trait, given that its strength for the conditional traits was below the threshold. This was an extension of the original FDR framework, applied for the cross-trait analysis. Specifically, we computed cFDR for each SNP, selecting CAD as the primary phenotype given its association with BW (CAD BW) and vice versa (BW CAD). To detect the pleiotropic loci for both traits, we calculated the ccFDR value, the maximum of the two cFDR values. The ccFDR value indicated that the possibility that a given SNP was false positively related to two traits (CAD and BW) simultaneously. The thresholds for cFDR and ccFDR were set at 0.05. Detailed steps of this approach have been described by Andreassen et al..\n\n    To determine the relationship between BW and CAD, we performed a bi-directional MR analysis using the \"TwoSampleMR\" R package. First, SNPs that were genome-wide significant (p <= 5x10-8) in the exposure GWAS dataset were selected as genetic variants. To ensure that the instruments for exposure were independent, we performed LD-based clumping (r2 > 0.001) and only retained the SNP with a lower p-value. Then, we extracted summary-level statistics for each selected SNP from the outcome trait and removed the SNPs related to the outcome phenotype (p <= 5x10-8). The summary associations of candidate genetic variants were harmonized as described previously. Finally, MR was conducted using IVW, simple median, weighted median, weighted mode, maximum likelihood, and MR-Egger approaches. BW and CAD were used as exposure and outcome measures, respectively, to identify the causal direction. The datasets used in the MR analysis were the same as that in the original cFDR analysis (The first CAD and BW datasets). To investigate whether any SNP had an outlying and/or pleiotropic influence, we also performed a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis.\n\n    Online tools HaploReg (http://compbio.mit.edu/HaploReg) and RegulomeDB (http://www.regulomedb.org/) were applied to map each of the identified significant SNPs to nearby genes, corresponding DNA features, and regulatory elements. Next, we detected whether they possessed metaQTL, pQTL, meQTL, or eQTL effects. To obtain the metaQTL and pQTL hits, we applied the web-based software SNiPA (http://www.snipa.org/), meQTL and eQTL information were collected from Bonder's study and HaploReg, respectively.\n\n    We used the GOEAST software to detect statistically overrepresented GO terms within the selected gene sets. Meanwhile, using the STRING database, we conducted protein-protein interaction analyses to investigate the interaction and functional relationships of the identified CAD- and/or BW-related genes.",
        "Results": "    We found leftward separations between each line (including the null line) in the stratified quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots, which indicated the pleiotropy of CAD conditional on BW (Figure 1A), as well as BW conditional on CAD (Figure 1B). As shown in fold-enrichment plots (Figure 1C, 1D), distinct upward shifts from the baseline demonstrated a strong pleiotropic enrichment between BW and CAD. We observed the most notable pleiotropy with an enrichment fold greater than 40 in BW conditional on CAD.\n\n    Furthermore, the stratified Q-Q plots for CAD conditional on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Supplementary Figure 1A), and BW conditional on ASD (Supplementary Figure 1C) all showed no enrichment and vice versa (Supplementary Figure 1B, 1D), which can be the negative controls.\n\n    Conditional on BW, we identified 109 significant SNPs (cFDR <= 0.05) associated with CAD variation, which were located on 20 different chromosomes (1-17, 19, 21-22), annotated to 98 genes (Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 2A). We validated 22 SNPs that were statistically significant in the former CAD GWAS datasets. Additionally, six SNPs associated with cardiovascular function were also validated in our research. Excluding 26 SNPs that showed high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 > 0.6) with the previous CAD-related loci, the remaining 55 SNPs were potentially novel to CAD (Supplementary Table 2). Using validation datasets, we found 111 significant SNPs for CAD, 73 of which (65.8%) were also significant in the original cFDR research (Supplementary Table 3).\n\n    We detected 16 SNPs associated with various metabolites (Supplementary Table 7), such as kynurenine, C18:1 sphingomyelin, and cholesterol, which affected the pathogenesis of CAD. Seven SNPs were associated with different proteins, and 27 SNPs showed significant metabolic quantitative trait locus (metaQTL) effects in the human serum. Notably, three novel SNPs, rs11244035, rs3811417, and rs624249, showed more than three metaQTL, protein QTL (pQTL), methylation QTL (meQTL), or expression QTL (eQTL) effects simultaneously (Table 1).\n\n    Conditional on CAD, we identified 203 significant SNPs (cFDR <= 0.05) associated with BW variation, which were located on 22 chromosomes (1-22), annotated to 179 genes (Supplementary Table 4 and Figure 2B). We validated 27 SNPs that were statistically significant in the former BW GWAS datasets, although 19 of the remaining 176 SNPs showed high LD (r2 > 0.6) with the previous BW-related loci (Supplementary Table 5). Using validation datasets, we found 229 significant SNPs for BW, 182 of which (79.5%) were also significant in the original cFDR research (Supplementary Table 6).\n\n    We detected 26 SNPs associated with various metabolites (Supplementary Table 7), five were associated with different proteins, and 31 showed significant meQTL effects in the human serum. In particular, four novel SNPs, rs143384, rs4875812, rs6700896, and rs8108865, showed more than three metaQTL, pQTL, meQTL, or eQTL effects simultaneously (Table 1).\n\n    We calculated the ccFDR value and constructed the conjunction Manhattan plot to explore the pleiotropic loci between CAD and BW. (Figure 2C). Precisely 26 potentially pleiotropic loci that reached a significance threshold at ccFDR <= 0.05 were mapped to 13 chromosomes and annotated to 26 different genes. We validated three SNPs that were statistically significant in the original GWAS and CAD-related study, nine loci were also found to be related to other phenotypes (Supplementary Table 8). Using validation datasets, we found 17 pleiotropic SNPs for both traits, 12 of which (70.5%) were also pleiotropic loci in the original ccFDR research (Supplementary Table 9). We then detected 18 pleiotropic SNPs that showed more than one of the metaQTL, pQTL, meQTL, or eQTL effects. Particularly, rs10774625 showed all QTL effects simultaneously (Table 2).\n\n    After instrument selection, LD clumping, variant extraction, and harmonization, 52 BW-CAD SNP pairs were selected when choosing BW as exposure (Supplementary Table 10). The MR-Egger regression test result (intercept: -0.0025, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.015 to 0.014, p = 0.973) suggested that there was no genetic confounding due to horizontal pleiotropy. The null-pleiotropy result was also confirmed using scatter plots and funnel plots (Supplementary Figures 2, 3). There was no apparent heterogeneity in our chosen SNPs, as evidenced by Cochran's Q test (Supplementary Table 11). We found a negative association of BW to CAD from the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimates (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.80, p = 1.57x 10-6), which was consistent with all other MR methods (Table 3 and Figure 3). MR leave-one-out sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was no influence of outlying and/or pleiotropic (Supplementary Figure 4). However, in the opposite direction, we found no causal relationship from CAD to BW (Supplementary Table 12).\n\n    We discovered significant enrichment of biological processes including \"regulation of phospholipid metabolic process\" (p = 1.10x10-4) and \"negative regulation of lipid transport\" (p = 2.40x10-4) for genes associated with CAD by conducting functional enrichment analysis. Moreover, genes associated with BW were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms like \"tube morphogenesis\" (p = 1.20x10-4) and \"regulation of multicellular organismal process\" (p = 3.10x10-4). Interestingly, the results for pleiotropic variants showed a cluster of biological processes in insulin and kinase categories, which might contribute to body growth and the progression of CAD (Table 4).\n\n    According to the protein-protein interaction network for CAD (Supplementary Figure 5A), proteins such as FURIN, FLT1, PLG, LDLR, and APOE were closely connected, and have been demonstrated to affect cardiovascular function. Similarly, in the BW network (Supplementary Figure 5B), proteins including ADRB1, ADCY5, ESR1, EPAS1, and CDKAL1 were closely connected and have been demonstrated to affect BW.",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, by applying the cFDR and bi-directional MR analyses to two strongly associated traits, we detected significant pleiotropic SNPs of potential functions for CAD and/or BW and estimated the causal relationship from BW to CAD. These findings provide a better understanding of the shared genetic mechanisms between CAD and BW, which might suggest a novel research direction for early disease prevention and subsequent treatment.",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we incorporated summary statistics from two independent GWAS datasets and discovered 109 and 203 SNPs associated with CAD and BW, respectively. By performing the ccFDR method, we further detected 26 pleiotropic loci associated with both phenotypes. Following a bi-directional MR analysis and functional annotation, we confirmed the causal relationship from BW to CAD and speculated the underlying shared genetic mechanisms between these two traits.\n\n    Notably, we identified 11 CAD- and/or BW-associated SNPs that showed more than three of the metaQTL, pQTL, meQTL, or eQTL effects. These functional loci might have a great effect on the pathogenesis of CAD and/or BW. For example, rs11172113 is located in the intron of LRP1, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, which regulates extracellular proteolytic activities. LRP1 plays a pivotal role in mediating inflammation and efferocytosis, and mouse studies have shown that LRP1 knockout leads to diminished vessel integrity and high-density lipoprotein secretion. Another study proved that LRP1 regulates food intake and energy homeostasis by acting as a co-activator of PPARgamma. Moreover, the lipidomic analysis demonstrated that the metabolite C18:1 sphingomyelin, which is associated with rs11172113, was enhanced in CAD patients compared to that in the control group. Another longitudinal prospective study revealed that the alteration of sphingomyelin metabolism is associated with BW percentiles, suggesting a potentially crucial role for this SNP in both traits.\n\n    Furthermore, we identified one pleiotropic locus, rs10774625, showing metaQTL, pQTL, eQTL, and meQTL effects simultaneously. rs10774625 is located in the intron of ATXN2. One population-based GWAS demonstrated that the ATXN2-SH3 region contributes to changes in the retinal venular caliber, an endophenotype of the microcirculation related to clinical cardiovascular diseases. Animal experiments supported the role of ATXN2 in translational regulation as well as embryonic development. Another ATXN2 knockdown experiment demonstrated that mice lacking ATXN2 develop dysfunction in energy metabolism and weight regulation. It has been reported that rs10774625 is associated with the kynurenine metabolite pathway (KP). Evidence indicates that the activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, the inducible enzyme in KP, is closely limited by endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and dendritic cells, all of which play vital roles in cardiac pathophysiology. Epidemiologically, it was shown that the concentration of kynurenine is associated with body weight indexes in a European cohort of more than 1000 people. An immunohistochemistry study also detected that the kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio limits the expression of inflammatory markers in the adipose tissue, which is correlated with body weight. In addition, beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is associated with rs10774625, which reduces the capacity for energy conversion and restricts intrauterine growth, resulting in low BW, and is also implicated in the pathogenesis of CAD. These facts indicated that rs10774625 (representing gene ATXN2) might be essential in linking the pathogenesis between CAD and BW.\n\n    According to the functional enrichment results, we could also hypothesize the possible shared pathogenesis mechanisms between CAD and BW. GO terms including \"regulation of phospholipid metabolic process\", \"regulation of multicellular organismal process\", and \"insulin receptor binding,\" have important impacts on metabolic abnormalities, such as impaired fasting glucose, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which could contribute to the increased risk for both traits.\n\n    Our study has some strengths. First, we improved the identification of potential CAD- and BW-associated SNPs and detected several pleiotropic loci in both traits. Following MR analysis, we assessed the causal effect between these two related traits. Second, we took into account ASD, which is unlikely to be correlated with CAD and BW, for a \"control trait\" enrichment analysis, which provided a baseline to examine pleiotropic enrichment and statistically validate the novel findings in our study. Third, evidence from metaQTL, pQTL, eQTL, and meQTL effects suggested a possible explanation for the etiology of CAD and/or BW and improved the interpretability of the results.\n\n    Additionally, our study includes some limitations. First, we were unable to link the genetic findings to clinical measures due to the lack of raw datasets for individual clinical outcomes. However, our study aimed to identify potential novel SNPs and explore the overlapping biological mechanisms between CAD and BW. We hope that our findings can be validated via functional experiments or fine-mapping studies. Second, although we confirmed the causal relationship from BW to CAD, the causalities of metabolomics, proteomics, and methylation between these two traits are unclear. Nevertheless, this problem could be solved by a follow-up multivariable MR study.",

        "Title": "    Clinical Spectrum and Molecular Characteristics of Inherited Ocular Diseases in a Cohort of Pediatric Patients With Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS), the most prevalent form of nystagmus in children, often indicates underlying ocular and neurological conditions. Genetic assessment plays a crucial role in clinical management, genetic counseling, and access to emerging gene-based therapies. This study aims to characterize the clinical and genetic landscape of inherited ocular diseases (IODs) in children with INS.\n\n    We retrospectively analyzed clinical and genetic data from 205 unrelated pediatric patients with INS enrolled in an IRB-approved nystagmus registry (2010-2024). All underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) with targeted gene panels to detect pathogenic variants.\n\n    The cohort comprised 117 males and 88 females (mean [SD] age, 8.85 [10.37] years). The most common INS-associated IODs included albinism (32%), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) (14%), and achromatopsia (14%). Genetic testing achieved a definitive diagnosis in 85 of 205 patients, yielding a molecular diagnostic rate of 41.5%. A total of 83 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were identified across 30 genes. The seven most frequently disease-causing genes:TYR, CNGB3, RPGR, GPR143, ABCA4, OCA2 and FRMD7:accounted for 65% of the genetically solved cases. Additionally, eight genes associated with LCA (AIPL1, CABP4, GUCY2D, IMPDH1, NMNAT1, RDH12, PRPH2, and RPGRIP1) contributed to 15% of these cases.\n\n    This study underscores the utility of NGS in diagnosing INS-associated IODs, providing essential insights for targeted interventions and identifying patients as candidates potentially eligible for ongoing gene-based therapy clinical trials.",
        "Introduction": "    Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is a unique ocular motor disorder characterized by involuntary, rhythmic oscillation of the eyes, typically manifesting within the first six months of life. It is closely associated with congenital or early-onset defects in the visual sensory system. INS is the most common form of nystagmus in infancy and childhood, with an incidence of approximately 1.7 per 1000 live births, and often serves as an indicator of underlying ocular, neurological, or systemic conditions. Although INS may occur as an isolated, idiopathic, or inherited disorder, it is often associated with other ocular disorders such as albinism, aniridia, achromatopsia, congenital retinal dystrophies, early-onset retinal degeneration, Joubert syndrome, Bardet Biedl syndrome, congenital cataracts, optic nerve hypoplasia, corneal dystrophies, and many others. Neurological syndromes and neurologic diseases, including brain tumors, spinocerebellar ataxia, glioma, and structural brain malformations, are also known associations.\n\n    Regardless of its etiology, INS invariably arises from a disturbance in ocular motor calibration during a developmental \"sensitive period\" occurring between one and five months of age, leading to a runaway high gain instability of the smooth pursuit system. Differentiating INS from other neurologically nonsignificant and significant forms of nystagmus often requires detailed eye movement recordings to characterize waveform patterns. A comprehensive evaluation, including advanced ophthalmological, neurological, and imaging modalities:such as optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, electroretinograms and visual evoked potentials, and brain magnetic resonance imaging:is often used. Despite the availability of these diagnostic tools, their utility in pediatric patients may be limited because of poor cooperation or the severity of the nystagmus.\n\n    Evaluating INS in infants and children presents significant challenges, given its association with both idiopathic disorders and early-onset defects in the visual sensory system. Approximately 90% of INS cases are associated with visual sensory disorders, either anatomical or functional, many of which are inherited ocular disorders (IODs). These disorders exhibit significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity, often leading to severe visual impairment in childhood. The diverse genetic landscape of these disorders complicates their identification, as over 150 genes have been implicated in IODs among children with INS, leading to considerable phenotypic overlap. These genes encompass a wide array of mutations and are implicated in disorders with distinct inheritance patterns, including autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant, X-linked, and mitochondrial mode. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have improved diagnostic capabilities in these patients. However, comprehensive genetic analyses of IODs in children with INS remain limited.\n\n    Recent technological advancements in genotyping and sequencing have significantly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms of IODs frequently observed in INS, offering potential refinements in diagnostic algorithms. Phenotype-driven NGS panels have shown high diagnostic accuracy, resolving 35% to 80% of cases in small cohorts of INS patients. Despite the progress, genetic data for the broader pediatric population with INS remains limited. Establishing a genetic diagnosis for INS patients is crucial for providing genetic counseling and assessing the risk of recurrence in family members of affected patients, and it is increasingly important for eligibility in emerging gene-based therapies.\n\n    This study aimed to evaluate the genetic spectrum of INS-associated IODs in a cohort of 205 pediatric patients. Through a cross-sectional analysis, we examined the gene distribution, diagnostic yield, and the underlying molecular etiology. Gaining insights into the genetic landscape of IODs in children with INS will enable the early diagnosis and a crucial window for effective intervention and facilitate patients access to emerging gene-based therapies and ongoing clinical trials.",
        "Methods": "    This prospective study included data from 4232 patients diagnosed with nystagmus at Akron Children's Vision Center between January 1, 2010, and March 31, 2024. All data were obtained from a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, institutional review board-approved database at Akron Children's Hospital. This secure digital database includes comprehensive clinical, demographic, and familial information, such as family pedigree, age at symptom onset, systemic findings, and geographic origin. Eligible patients had a clinical diagnosis of infantile nystagmus and had consented to or previously completed genetic testing.\n\n    Genetic analysis used targeted NGS panels or whole exome sequencing. Testing was conducted by accredited commercial laboratories (Blueprint Genetics, Invitae, GeneDx, and Prevention Genetics), using disease-specific NGS and virtual panels for nystagmus and inherited retinal diseases. A custom bioinformatic pipeline processed sequencing data, aligning reads to the NCBI RefSeq transcripts and GRCh37/hg19 reference genome using the Burrow-Wheeler Aligner algorithm. Post-alignment steps included duplicate read removal, local realignment around indels, base quality score recalibration, and variant calling using the Genome Analysis Toolkit. Variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic were further evaluated.\n\n    Variants were classified following American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology guideline. Patients were categorized into three groups: (1) Probable Molecular Diagnosis: those with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants consistent with phenotype and inheritance patterns, requiring one likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant for autosomal dominant and two pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for autosomal recessive conditions; (2) Possible Molecular Diagnosis: those with two heterozygous variants without segregation analysis or one pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in a recessive gene matching the clinical phenotype; (3) Unsolved: those with no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, or only variants of uncertain significance (VUS).\n\n    Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics included numbers, percentages, mean +- standard deviation or median +- interquartile range, as appropriate. Paired continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals.",
        "Results": "    The study included data from 4232 patients with INS enrolled in the nystagmus registry at Akron Children's Vision Center between 2010-2024, with a focus on 205 unrelated pediatric patients who underwent genetic testing. This cohort included 117 males (57%) and 88 females (43%), adjusting to a nearly equal sex ratio (49.3% males, 50.7% females) when excluding X-linked cases. Ages at genetic testing ranged from 0.3 to 40 years, with a mean of 8.54 +- 7.91 years. Clinical examination revealed varied degrees of visual acuity reduction (Table).\n\n    Among those with a confirmed genetic diagnosis (or molecular diagnosis) (n = 85), 96% displayed associated clinical findings, with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 and type 2 (25%), achromatopsia (14%), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA, 14%), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (7%), as the most frequent phenotypes (Fig. 1).\n\n    A total of 205 patients who underwent genetic testing at the time of this study were analyzed. Across 175 unrelated patients (85.4%) with detected variants, a total of 406 variants in phenotype-related genes were identified, including 136 pathogenic variants, 59 likely pathogenic variants, 18 risk alleles, and 193 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) (Supplementary Table S1). The detected variants spanned a broad range of types, including 306 missense (75%), 36 frameshift (9%), 28 splice-site (7%), 17 stop-gain (4%), seven large deletions (2%), and six in-frame indels or copy number losses (1.5%) (Fig. 2, insert).\n\n    A probable molecular diagnosis was established in 85 patients, yielding a diagnostic rate of 41.5% (95% CI, 36.2%-46.7%), whereas 25.3% (n = 52) had only one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a recessive gene, indicating possible carrier status. Unsolved cases included 18.5% (n = 38) with VUS. Family history was reported in 56.5% of probable, 36.5% of possible, and 26.3% of VUS cases (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S1).\n\n    Our analysis identified 83 distinct causative variants across 30 genes in genetically solved cases. Single-nucleotide variants were the most frequent variant type, representing 93% of cases. Of the pathogenic alleles identified, 60% involved single-nucleotide substitutions leading to missense mutations. Protein truncating variants accounted for 33% of pathogenic alleles, encompassing nonsense (7%), frameshift (20%), and canonical splice site variants (6%). In contrast, small insertions/deletions (in/dels) and larger structural variants were identified in approximately 7% of mutated alleles (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S1)\n\n    The most frequently mutated genes included TYR (n = 17 [20%]) and OCA2 (n = 4 [4.7%]) for oculocutaneous albinism, CNGB3 (n = 8 [9.4%]) for achromatopsia, GPR143 (n = 6 [7%]) for X-linked ocular albinism, RPGR (n = 6 [7%]) for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, ABCA4 (n = 5 [5.9%]) for Stargardt disease, and FRMD7 (n = 3 [3.5%]) for idiopathic INS. Eight LCA-associated genes (AIPL1, CABP4, GUCY2D, IMPDH1, NMNAT1, RDH12, PRPH2 and RPGRIP1) accounted for 15% of genetically diagnosed cases, with other genes having lower prevalence (Fig. 3B).\n\n    TYR (Tyrosinase, MIM no. 606933) was the most prevalent causative gene, identified in 17 cases. In TYR, 19 distinct pathogenic alleles were detected, with missense variants comprising 72.2% of disease-causing alleles, followed by protein truncating variants (22.2%) and splice site variants (5.6%). Among the frequent variants, c.1205G>A, p.(Arg402Gln), and c.575C>A, p.(Ser192Tyr) was predominant in patients with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), manifesting as hypomorphic albinism when co-occurring with other pathogenic TYR variants. Other notable variants included c.230G>A, p.(Arg77Gln) and c.1118C>A, p.(Thr373Lys) (Fig. 4A).\n\n    Pathogenic variants in CNGB3 (cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit beta 3, MIM no. 605080) were the second most frequent in the cohort, primarily associated with achromatopsia. In 12 patients, pathogenic variants were identified in three causative genes of achromatopsia, CNGA3 in two patients, CNGB3 in eight patients and ATF6 in two patients. As shown in Figure 4B, 62.5% (n = 5) of CNGB3 variants was homozygous for the c.1148delC variant, a well-known frameshift mutation, whereas compound heterozygous states were observed in three patients with combinations of other splice site and frameshift variants.\n\n    Mutations in RPGR (Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator, MIM no. 312610), associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, were the third most prevalent. Among the six patients, four were males with hemizygous variants including one nonsense mutation, one novel deletion, and a frameshift variant. Interestingly, two female carriers exhibited milder retinal phenotypes, despite carrying pathogenic RPGR variants (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Table S1).\n\n    Ten distinct heterozygous variants in ABCA4 (ATP-binding cassette transport 4, MIM no. 601691) were identified across five unrelated patients. Missense mutations constituted 80% of the ABCA4 pathogenic alleles, whereas nonsense mutation, such as (c.4234C>T, p.Gln1412*), was identified in only one case (Fig. 5B). Being a recessive condition, the combination of heterozygous pathogenic variants in ABCA4 influences the phenotype severity. No other disease variants that might explain nystagmus in these ABCA4 patients were present, and they did not have clinical features suspicious for the clinical diagnosis (e.g., relative hypopigmentation, the absence of clear central atrophy, etc.).\n\n    Hemizygous pathogenic variants in GPR143 (G-protein coupled receptor 143, MIM no. 300808), predominantly associated with ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), were identified in six patients. Variants included splice site, frameshift, and missense mutations, alongside a deletion affecting exons 1-8 in two related patients (Fig. 5C).\n\n    The pathogenic variants in FRMD7 (FERM domain-containing 7, MIM no. 300628) were identified in three unrelated patients. All FRMD7 variants were classified as likely pathogenic, comprising a hemizygous missense variant c.875T>C, p.(Leu292Pro), a heterozygous missense c.812 G>T, p.(Cys271Phe) and a hemizygous in-frame deletion variant c.31_33delGAT: p.(Asp11del), located in exon 1 of the FRMD7 gene (NM_194277.2) (Fig. 5D).\n\n    Among patients with a probable molecular diagnosis, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in autosomal genes (76.25%) and X-linked (23.75). The autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance was the predominant pattern among our patients with INS, constituting 58.75% (47/85) of genetically solved cases, with 46.25% (n  = 37) in compound heterozygous states and 12.5% (n = 10) homozygous. Autosomal dominant variants comprised 17.5% of solved cases and X-linked inheritance was found in 23.75% of cases (Fig. 6A).\n\n    The most frequently implicated disease-causing genes within the AR category were TYR (n = 17) and CNGB3 (n = 8), together accounting for nearly half of all AR cases. Following these, ABCA4 (n  =  5), OCA2 (n  =  4), and RDH12 (n  =  3) were also notable contributors (Fig. 6B). Autosomal dominant forms represented 17.5% of genetically solved cases, with mutations identified in genes such as ARID1B (n = 1), COL2A1 (n  =  4), COL11A1 (n  =  1), GUCY2D (n  =  1), IMPDH1 (n = 2), MFN2 (n = 1), MFRP (n = 1), PAX6 (n = 2), PRPH2 (n  =  1), and VCAN (n = 1) (Fig. 6C).\n\n    Furthermore, 23.75% of the solved cases exhibited hemizygosity for variants in genes linked to recessive X-linked phenotypes. Notably, the most recurrently implicated genes in this category were GRP143 (n  =  6), RPGR (n  =  6), FRMD7 (n = 3), OPN1LW (n = 2), CHM (n = 1), NYX (n  =  1), and RP2 (n  =  1) (Fig. 6D).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study aimed to delineate the molecular genetic spectrum of INS in a large pediatric cohort. From an initial pool of 4323 patients, comprehensive genetic analyses were performed on 205 individuals with INS or INS with associated conditions, using panel-based NGS to identify molecular diagnoses. This represents the largest genetically characterized INS cohort reported from a single vision center. Previous studies using NGS panels with 31 to 336 genes reported diagnostic yields ranging from 35% to 60%, depending on cohort size and gene panel composition. Diagnostic yields in these studies varied, with rates of 58.3% (28 of 48 patients), 60% (nine of 15 patients), 43.2% (35 of 81 patients) and 35% (13 of 37 patients). In our cohort, we achieved a definitive molecular diagnosis in 41.5% of patients and a possible molecular diagnosis in 24.6%, resulting in a combined diagnostic yield of 66.5% (Fig. 2). Although our yield is consistent with previously reported rates, it is somewhat lower than those with higher rates, which may reflect differences in gene panels, clinical phenotypes, or the presence of intronic and regulatory variants not captured by NGS.\n\n    Our study revealed a low rate of copy number variation (CNV) detection, with only 1% (six of 203) of cases showing CNVs. This low yield may reflect the limitations of NGS in detecting structural variants. Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and long-read sequencing technologies have improved the detection of such variants, suggesting that WGS could enhance diagnostic rates, especially in cases with negative NGS results.\n\n    Given the prevalence of nystagmus across various ocular and systemic diseases, accurate interpretation of genetic variants is critical for providing a precise diagnosis, optimizing clinical management, guiding family planning, and potentially enabling access to emerging gene-based therapies. In this study, we identified 77 previously unreported (likely) pathogenic variants, constituting 44.5% of the total (Supplementary Table S1). We also detected 138 variants of VUS, underscoring the challenge of reclassifying these variants with limited data. Family testing and functional studies may help clarify the clinical significance of these VUS.\n\n    Despite the diagnostic success, 58% of patients had either negative or inconclusive genetic findings. Negative results may stem from non-genetic clinical phenotypes or limitations of the gene panel used. In such cases, WGS or long read NGS may offer further insights, particularly for detecting variants in intronic or regulatory regions. In cases with inconclusive results, especially those involving clinically relevant VUS with strong evidence supporting pathogenicity but insufficient data for definitive classification, functional studies or WGS could provide for further clarification. Additionally, segregation analysis through family testing could also aid in reclassifying VUS as either benign or pathogenic.\n\n    The phenotypic heterogeneity of INS-associated IODs reflects the diverse array of underlying genotypes. Clinically, INS-associated IODs can be classified into two main phenotypic categories: non-syndromic and syndromic. The majority are non-syndromic, primarily resulting from mutations in retina-specific genes, including those associated with achromatopsia, LCA, X-linked RP, blue cone monochromatism and congenital stationary night blindness. In contrast, syndromic INS-associated IODs, which involve multiple organs beyond the eyes, include conditions such as albinism (Fig. 1). A more detailed analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations of INS-associated IODs will be addressed in a future publication.\n\n    Among our solved cases, TYR mutations were the most frequently encountered, consistent with previous studies reporting TYR as the predominant gene associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1). We found that 65% of OCA1 patients harbored compound heterozygosity for a severe TYR variant and the hypomorphic TYR c.1205G>A (p.Arg402Gln) variant, which is insufficient to cause OCA1 in the heterozygous state alone. This finding is consistent with previous studies and highlights the need to consider hypomorphic alleles in the diagnostic evaluation of OCA1.\n\n    Mutations in CNGB3 and CNGA3, commonly associated with achromatopsia, accounted for over 10% of genetically diagnosed cases in our cohort. The CNGB3 c.1148delC variant was particularly prevalent, consistent with previous studies identifying this variant as a major contributor to achromatopsia.\n\n    Variants in RPGR are associated with X-linked RP. It is well recognized that female carriers can show a disease phenotype of variable severity. Two out of six patients in our genetically diagnosed cases were carrier females. Given the therapeutic potential for RPGR-related diseases, the identification of these mutations is particularly relevant as gene therapy trials for RPGR-associated RP are underway.\n\n    We identified three distinct mutations in FRMD7, a gene previously linked to idiopathic INS. All three patients with FRMD7 mutations had a family history suggestive of X-linked inheritance. Two exhibited pendular nystagmus waveforms, while the third had unidirectional jerk nystagmus. One patient carrying a hemizygous in-frame deletion variant presented with relatively poor visual acuity and foveal hypoplasia on optical coherence tomography, features atypical for FRMD7-related INS. Mutations in FRMD7 represent the most common genetic cause of inherited nystagmus, followed by mutations in GPR143, the gene responsible for ocular albinism. Our cohort's lower detection rate for FRMD7 variants compared to previous studies may reflect differences in population genetics or gene panel composition. Additionally, GPR143 mutations have been reported in idiopathic INS cases, albeit without a distinctive clinical phenotype.\n\n    A significant finding in our study was the identification of 30 patients with actionable genotypes for gene-based therapies currently in clinical trials, including those targeting CNGA3, CNGB3 and RPGR. As gene therapies for these conditions advance, the demand for molecular diagnoses will increase, facilitating patient access to clinical trials and targeted treatments.\n\n    Despite the strengths of this study, several limitations should be noted. First, we used panel-based NGS without incorporating WGS, potentially missing structural or intronic variants. Second, the gene panel used evolved over time, with earlier patients tested on smaller panels, which may have affected diagnostic outcomes. Our low CNV detection rate further underscores the limitations of panel-based approaches, because WGS is more adept at identifying CNVs. Finally, family testing was not always feasible, limiting our ability to perform segregation analysis for VUS.\n\n    In conclusion, we achieved a molecular diagnosis in 41.5% of pediatric INS cases using targeted NGS, with actionable findings for gene-based therapies in 35% of solved cases. The remaining unresolved cases highlight the need for more comprehensive genetic testing, including WGS, and further research into non-coding regions and CNVs. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating clinical, genetic, and imaging data, is essential for managing INS and its associated conditions. Our findings provide a foundation for future research aimed at improving the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for INS and its related inherited ocular disorders.",

        "Title": "    Benefits of Exome Sequencing in Children with Suspected Isolated Hearing Loss",
        "Abstract": "    Purpose: Hearing loss is characterized by an extensive genetic heterogeneity and remains a common disorder in children. Molecular diagnosis is of particular benefit in children, and permits the early identification of clinically-unrecognized hearing loss syndromes, which permits effective clinical management and follow-up, including genetic counselling. Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing with the analysis of a panel of 189 genes associated with hearing loss in a prospective cohort of 61 children and 9 adults presenting mainly with isolated hearing loss. Results: The overall diagnostic rate using exome sequencing was 47.2% (52.5% in children; 22% in adults). In children with confirmed molecular results, 17/32 (53.2%) showed autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, 14/32 (43.75%) showed an autosomal dominant condition, and one case had X-linked hearing loss. In adults, the two patients showed an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Among the 32 children, 17 (53.1%) had nonsyndromic hearing loss and 15 (46.7%) had syndromic hearing loss. One adult was diagnosed with syndromic hearing loss and one with nonsyndromic hearing loss. The most common causative genes were STRC (5 cases), GJB2 (3 cases), COL11A1 (3 cases), and ACTG1 (3 cases). Conclusions: Exome sequencing has a high diagnostic yield in children with hearing loss and can reveal a syndromic hearing loss form before other organs/systems become involved, allowing the surveillance of unrecognized present and/or future complications associated with these syndromes.",
        "Introduction": "    Almost one in 500 infants is affected by hearing loss (HL). The prevalence increases dramatically with age in adults, and it has been estimated that approximately one-half of all adults aged between 60 and 69 years and 80% of those over 80 years old suffer from HL. More than one-half of congenital or early-onset, bilateral sensorineural (SN) cases are believed to have a genetic cause, with the remainder either acquired or idiopathic. Genetic etiologies are further divided into isolated or syndromic HL (associated with dysmorphic features and/or additional medical problems). However, it is often difficult to distinguish between syndromic and non-syndromic forms at an early age, as other signs and symptoms may appear only later in life. Hearing screenings are recommended for newborns, as early detection and diagnosis of HL has been proven to improve health outcomes. Universal newborn hearing screening was recommended in 1998 in the European Consensus Statement on Neonatal Hearing Screening in Newborns and introduced in Switzerland in 1999 under the auspices of the \"Swiss Working Group: Hearing Screening in Newborns\".\n\n    Screening in Switzerland is performed by estimating otoacoustic emissions (OAE) during the newborn's stay at the maternity unit. If the OAE test fails in one or both ears, further evaluation is recommended, usually starting by repeating OEA measures the same or the following day. If OAEs are still undetectable uni- or bi- laterally after repeated measures, the infant is referred for additional investigations within the first months of life. Exclusion of congenital cytomegalovirus infection by polymerase chain reaction analysis on a \"Guthrie\" ('blood spot') card is part of the routine diagnostic evaluation. Ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialists determine the type and degree of HL through audiometry. In the event of rapidly progressive or sudden or unilateral deafness, ear imaging is performed using a computed tomography (CT) scan of the temporal bone in thin sections and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the inner ear and auditory pathways.\n\n    Before the emergence and accessibility of broad genetic testing to identify syndromic HL forms, etiological assessment of HL often included additional examinations, such as thyroid assessment, electrocardiogram, urinary tract ultrasound and ophthalmologic examination. These examinations are no longer requested at the time of initial HL diagnosis, but they are performed if necessary, depending on the genetic assessment. In the absence of an environmental cause, international recommendations emphasize the importance of an early genetic analysis as a first-line assessment of a hearing disorder, as a molecular diagnosis can help guide management and counseling. However, one of the challenges of molecular analysis resides in the high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Indeed, over 70 genes have been associated with isolated SN HL and with limited phenotypic clues. Thus, it is impossible to target a particular gene based on the phenotype alone. This may also hold true for syndromic cases as infants. Indeed at early age, HL may be the first sign of an underlying syndromic form, and therefore, infants affected by syndromic HL may be referred to a genetic consultation with isolated HL. Children affected by HL can greatly benefit from next-generation-sequencing in order to identify a genetic cause. To date, 30 genes are known to be associated with late onset or progressive HL. As there is a high prevalence of HL in adults, it is important to identify those with a genetic etiology, as this might influence their management and permit early counseling. The purpose of this study was to describe the outcome of molecular analyses performed in 70 cases with a HL diagnosis, including a brief clinical description of confirmed cases.",
        "Methods": "    A total of 61 children and 9 adults with an HL diagnosis were referred to the molecular laboratory of the Division of Medical Genetics at Geneva University Hospitals (Geneva, Switzerland) between January 2017 and December 2020. Following written informed consent obtained from all adult patients and the parents or guardians of children, as well as health insurance approval, patients underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES) with a bioinformatic analysis of HL and an ear malformation updated panel ranging from 172 to 189 genes, including GJB2/GJB6. Genes were selected according to the PanelApp classification of genes involved in hearing loss (Genomics England PanelApp. Available online:  (accessed on 1 August 2021)). Of the 222 indicated genes, all green and litterature-relevant orange genes were chosen to build our in house gene panel (Table S1).\n\n    DNA from affected individuals and family members was extracted from whole blood. Exome sequencing was captured using one of the following kits according to the manufacturers' recommendations: SureSelect QXT All Human Exon v5, v7 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) or Twist Core exome + Refseq kits (Twist Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA). Paired-end sequencing was carried out on a NextSeq500 Instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Targeted bioinformatic analysis of a panel of genes involved in HL was performed through locally-developed pipelines. Reads mapping and variant calling were performed using BWA V0.7.13, Picard V2.9.0 and GATK Haplotype-Caller V3.7 and annotated with annovar V2017-07-12 and UCSC RefSeq (V2018-08-10). The variants were searched for in various databases including dbSNP151, gnomAD 2.1, ClinVar 2018 and HGMD 2016. Pathogenicity prediction scores were assessed using dbscSNV and SpliceAI. Variant filtering and classification was performed based on the guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology. Sanger sequencing of custom-designed amplicons was used to confirm potentially disease-causing variants in probands and to perform segregation analysis. Pathogenicity scores were obtained for missense and splicing variants using SIFT, PolyPhen, MutationTaster, CADD, pAI, dbscSNV, spliceAI. Intermediate results were discussed in a multidisciplinary team including geneticists, biologists and ENT specialists. Copy number variation (CNV) detection on exome data was performed using an in-house read depth-based algorithm combining CoNIFER and XHMM. CoNIFER calculates normalized read-depth z-scores for each exon, generating a matrix of dimension n x M, with n being the number of captured exons and M the total number of samples. This matrix is then fed to XHMM, which uses hidden markov models to find streches of duplicated or deleted exons. Duplications and deletions overlapping genes of the hearing-loss panel are visually reviewed using a private instance of jBrowse, together with the per-exon read-depth z-scores. CNV calls detected by our algorithm were independently confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis.\n\n    In Switzerland, patient access to WES is dependent on approval by the health insurance company. In some cases, GJB2-GJB6 analysis is asked for beforehand, even if present in our exome gene panel, as it is one of the most frequently involved genes in non-syndromic HL. Four additional children and one adult were found to carry GJB2 mutations by this strategy and were therefore not included in our exome cohort.",
        "Results": "    Sixty-one children (female, 26; male, 35; age range, 13 months to 18 years) and nine adults (female, 6; male, 3; age range, 34-78 years) benefited from a molecular analysis for HL. Most presented with SN HL (52 children (85.2%); 8 adults (88.9%)). Six children (9.8%) had mixed (conductive and SN) HL, two children (3.3%) and one adult (11.1%) had transmission HL, and one child had right SN HL and left mixed HL. HL severity among children was as follows: eight had mild HL (13.1%); 35 had moderate HL (57.4%); 10 had severe HL (16.4%); eight had profound HL (13.1%); and 6 showed progressive HL (9.8%). (Severity was defined as mild: 26-40 db hearing loss; moderate: 41-70 db hearing loss; severe: 71-90 db hearing loss and profound >91 db hearing loss).\n\n    The majority of children (53/61 (86.8%)) had bilateral HL. Congenital HL was diagnosed in 36/61 (59%) cases. Eleven (18%) children were diagnosed with prelingual HL (defined as identified at <=1 year of age) and the remainder (14 patients (22.9%)) had postlingual HL (defined as identified at >1 year of age). Forty-one had no family history (67.2%) and only four probands (6.5%) were born from consanguineous parents. Of the 41 patients who underwent a CT scan and/or MRI investigation, 15 (36.6%) had middle/inner ear malformations. Twenty-one patients (34.4%) had other signs and symptoms in addition to HL (Table S2).\n\n    Four adults had moderate HL (44.4%), four had severe HL (44.4%), and one had profound HL (11.1%); all cases showed progressive HL (Table S3). Three patients experienced a violent worsening of HL associated with upper airway infection for one patient and vertigo for the second case. The third patient did not recall any infection or vertigo associated with the onset of worsening of HL. All had bilateral HL at the time of consultation, but three patients had marked asymmetry at diagnosis. All were diagnosed with postlingual HL, but the age of onset was highly variable (8 to 65 years). Five patients had a family history (55.6%), three patients had no family history (33.3%), and one patient was adopted (no family history available). Two probands (22.2%) were born from consanguineous parents. Seven (77.8%) were investigated through CT scan and/or MRI, which revealed that four (44.4%) had middle/inner ear malformations. Interestingly, six of nine (66.7%) patients had additional symptoms to HL, with vertigo being the most frequent (Table S3).\n\n    All four children that were diagnosed through direct sequencing of GJB2/6 presented with SN, bilateral HL. Three had congenital HL and one was diagnosed with pre lingual HL. Three had severe HL and one had moderate HL. None were known with any family history or consanguinity. One adult was diagnosed through direct sequencing of GJB2/6. He displayed congenital, SN, bilateral profound HL. Three of the patient were males and two were females, out of wich one was an adult.\n\n    Among the 61 cases investigated through WES, molecular confirmation was performed in 32 probands (52.5%) with the involvement of 22 different genes (Table S4). Five patients (patients 1, 33, 42, 46,51), showed a variant of unknown significance (VUS) (Table S5). Of note, patient 1 had a likely pathogenic de novo mutation in COL4A5 and two missense variants in compound heterozygosity in COL11A2 classified as VUS. (Tables S4 and S5). These variants did not fulfill ACMG criteria and were not counted or reported as positive, even if highly concordant with the patient's phenotype. This was mostly due to the inherited status of the variant from a parent with normal audition or because segregation analysis was not possible.\n\n    Seventeen of 32 (53.1%) patients had autosomal recessive inheritance patterns; 14 (42%) had an autosomal dominant disorder, and one case had X-linked HL (Table S4). Among the 14 autosomal dominant cases, nine were reported de novo, three were inherited from a healthy parent, and one was inherited from an affected parent. One patient (# 21) had one HL variant (POU4F3) inherited from an affected father and a de novo incidental finding in OPA1. Another patient (# 24) had a de novo causative variant in COL11A1 and an inherited SMAD3 variant from an affected mother (Table S4).\n\n    Of the 32 children with a positive molecular diagnostic test, 17 (53.2%) had mutations in non-syndromic HL-associated genes, of which 14 were autosomal recessive (43.8%). Fifteen (46.9%) cases had pathogenic variants in syndromic HL-associated genes, of which 11 were transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern (32.4%). Seven patients were counted as syndromic, but did not display any other sign apart from HL at the time of diagnosis (Figure 1). The most common HL causative genes were STRC (5 cases), ACTG1 (3 cases), COL11A1 (3 cases), and GJB2 (3 cases) (Table S4; Figure 2). Among these, only COL11A1 is responsible for both syndromic and non-syndromic HL. Four additional children were diagnosed with a GJB2 mutation through direct sequencing (Table S6). Three patients were compound heterozygotes for a STRC point mutation and carried a STRC deletion on the other allele. Two other patients showed bi-allelic deletion of the STRC gene. One case was caused by a heterozygous gene conversion on one allele and CNV on the other; one patient showed heterozygous deletion of COL11A1. A total of seven cases were caused by CNV (21.9%).\n\n    Among the nine adults that underwent molecular investigations, two had a molecular diagnosis (Table S4). One was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 and the other displayed a variant in the COCH gene. Both patients followed an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. No family segregation was available and therefore it was not possible to conclude on a de novo or inherited status of these variants (Table S4). One patient was diagnosed with GJB2 variants by direct sequencing (Table S6 (# 75)) and another showed a rare missense variant in the TBC1D24 gene (Table S5 (# 64)). The latter variant was classified as a VUS based on ACMG criteria.\n\n    Patient 1. A six-year-old female presented with language delay, mild left and moderate right HL, associated with cochlear malformation. She had a conventional binaural behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid. No relevant family history was reported. WES identified a heterozygous likely pathogenic de novo missense variant in COL4A5 (c.1525G > C, p.(Gly509Arg)). The COL4A5 gene is associated with X-linked Alport syndrome characterized by SN HL, as well as ocular and kidney involvement. Females with COL4A5 mutation can display HL, but it is usually less frequent and tends to occur in later life. Nevertheless, a nephrology follow-up was organized, given the risk of renal complications in these patients. WES also identified two missense variants in COL11A2 classified as VUS and described below.\n\n    Patient 2. A 21-month-old female was diagnosed with profound bilateral SN HL with no relevant family history. WES identified a homozygous missense variant c.1373A > T, p.(Asp458Val) in USH1G and parental segregation was confirmed. USH1G is responsible for Usher syndrome type 1, an autosomal recessive condition that associates a congenital, profound SN HL, vestibular areflexia, and adolescent-onset retinitis pigmentosa. She benefited from a sequential bilateral cochlear implantation and a routine ophthalmologic evaluation. The ophthalmological check-up revealed a pathological electroretinogram and close follow-up is ongoing.\n\n    Patient 3. A four-year-old male was diagnosed with bilateral, moderate, congenital SN HL, with no relevant family history. He had a conventional binaural BTE hearing aid. WES revealed a deletion c.35delG and a heterozygous missense c.101T > C, p.(Met34Thr) variant of GJB2. Parental segregation confirmed that mutations were in trans.\n\n    Patient 8. An eight-year-old male with congenital moderate SN HL, a conventional binaural BTE hearing aid and no relevant family history. An inner ear CT scan was normal. WES identified a compound heterozygous c.35del, p.(Gly12Valfs*2); c.139G > T, p.(Glu47*) in GJB2. Parental segregation confirmed that mutations were in trans.\n\n    Patient 20. A two-year-old boy with congenital severe, bilateral SN HL. He also presented palmoplantar keratoderma. Family history was unremarkable. An inner ear CT scan showed dilatation of the internal auditory canals and inner ear malformation. He benefited from a sequential bilateral cochlear implantation. WES revealed a pathogenic heterozygous de novo c. 223C > T, p.(Arg75Trp) in GJB2. Missense in this residue is associated with autosomal dominant HL and palmoplantar keratoderma.\n\n    Patient 4. An 11-year-old male with moderate SN HL on the right side and mixed, profound HL on the left side, and no family history of HL. He had bilateral inner ear malformations revealed by CT scan and left side congenital cholesteatoma. At physical examination, he presented with a pre-auricular pit on the left side. He had a conventional binaural BTE hearing aid. WES revealed a heterozygous de novo SIX1 pathogenic missense mutation (c.386A > C, p.(Tyr129Ser)). SIX1 is associated with branchiootorenal syndrome, which is characterized by branchial arch anomalies, hearing impairment (malformations of the auricle with pre-auricular pits and conductive or SN hearing impairment), and renal malformations. Follow-up was completed with renal ultrasonography, which was normal.\n\n    Patient 5. An eight-year-old female with postlingual profound, bilateral, SN HL and no relevant family history. She benefited from a cochlear implantation on the right side. WES showed two compound heterozygous mutations (c.457A > C, p.(Asn153His) and c.1565C > A, p.(Thr522Asn)) in LARS2. Mutations were classified as likely pathogenic and pathogenic respectively. LARS2 is associated with Perrault syndrome, which is characterized by SN HL in males and females and ovarian dysfunction in females. Pubertal development will be monitored in the future in order to induce puberty and permit normal bone mineralization. In the case of ovarian insufficiency, oocyte cryopreservation will be considered. Follow-up was completed with ovarian ultrasonography and an endocrinological follow-up was organized.\n\n    Patient 6. A 10-year-old male with congenital, profound, bilateral SN HL. He benefited from a unilateral cochlear implantation. Apart from being born into a consanguineous union, he had no other relevant family history. WES identified a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.942C > A, p.(Cys314*)) in ILDR1, classified as pathogenic. Mutations in this gene are known to cause a prelingual, nonprogressive, nonsyndromic form of SN deafness.\n\n    Patient 7. A five-year-old male with postlingual unilateral (left) mild mixed HL. He had no relevant family history and no other health problems. The CT scan showed an uncus malformation on both sides, but normal inner ears. WES identified a heterozygous, likely pathogenic de novo mutation, c.440G > A, p.(Arg147His) in the ACTG1 gene.\n\n    Patient 16. A 15-year-old female with postlingual, bilateral, moderate SN HL. She had a binaural conventional BTE hearing aid. No relevant family history was noted. WES revealed a heterozygous, likely pathogenic de novo mutation, c.826G > A, p.(Glu276Lys) in ACTG1.\n\n    Patient 30. A 17-year-old male with an initial mild SN postlingual HL that had progressed to moderate HL. Both his paternal grandmother and his maternal grandfather showed late onset HL. He had a bilateral conventional BTE hearing aid since the age of 16 years. WES identified a heterozygous, pathogenic de novo mutation, c.830C > T,p.(Thr277Ile) in ACTG1.\n\n    ACTG1 variants are responsible for DFNA20/DFNA26, usually associated with postlingual and progressive SN HL and a type 2 Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Our patients did not have any syndromic features to date and thus we considered that these mutations were related to autosomal dominant deafness 20/26 (MIM: 604717).\n\n    Patient 9. A five-year-old male with congenital moderate SN HL and bilateral renal cysts. He had a binaural conventional BTE hearing aid. No relevant family history was noted. WES identified a pathogenic heterozygous de novo mutation c.778 + 1G > A, p.?, in GATA3.\n\n    Patient 19. An 18-month-old male with a similar history to patient 9. He presented bilateral moderate SN HL, unilateral kidney dysplasia and cystic dilatation of the rete testis of the right testis. He had a bilateral conventional BTE hearing aid. WES identified a pathogenic, de novo heterozygous c.431delG, p.(Gly144Alafs*51) in GATA3.\n\n    GATA3 is associated with HDR syndrome, i.e., hypoparathyroidism, SN deafness and renal dysplasia. Hypoparathyroidism can appear later in life and both patients are under endocrinological surveillance.\n\n    Patient 10. A four-year-old-male with congenital bilateral, moderate SN HL. His maternal grandmother was also known for HL, without further information. He had a bilateral conventional BTE hearing aid. WES identified a likely pathogenic, heterozygous mutation (c.634C > A, p.(Pro212Thr)) in SLC17A8 inherited from his mother with normal audition.\n\n    SLC17A8 is known to be associated with highly variable non-syndromic HL. Affected male members are reported with earlier onset and a more severe phenotype.\n\n    Patient 11. An eight-year-old female with bilateral moderate SN HL and no relevant family history. She had a bilateral conventional BTE hearing aid. WES identified a pathogenic homozygous mutation (c.3061 + 1G > A, p.?) in LOXHD1. Parental segregation was confirmed in the mother, but was not available for the father. LOXHD1 is associated with autosomal recessive bilateral SN HL, which can be progressive. Mutations in this gene have also been recently associated with late-onset Fuchs corneal dystrophy and therefore ophthalmological surveillance was recommended.\n\n    Patient 17. A three-year-old female with bilateral mild-to-moderate congenital SN HL born to consanguineous parents without any relevant family history. WES identified a paternal gene conversion between OTOA gene and OTOAP1 pseudogene and a maternal deletion of OTOA. Gene conversion between OTOA and its pseudogene OTOAP1 is a known mechanism leading to the generation of a pathogenic OTOA allele. Exons 20 to 28 of the OTOA gene are located in a 68 kb region that was segmentally duplicated during evolution and resulted in the emergence of the OTOAP1 pseudogene located 820 kb upstream of OTOA. Therefore, these genes share a high level of homology (>99%). In our patient, gene conversion occurred between the exon 20-21 of the OTOA gene replaced by exon 1 and 2 of the pseudogene OTPAP1. This gene conversion is expected to result in a premature stop codon that would either result in a truncated protein or an absence of protein through mRNA nonsense-mediated decay. These findings were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction/Sanger sequencing and MLPA. Family segregation confirmed the inheritance of each allele from one of the parents. OTOA is related to autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL.\n\n    Patient 18. A two-year-old female who suffered from congenital bilateral moderate SN HL. HL was progressive and she had profound bilateral deafness. No relevant family history was noted. She benefited from sequential bilateral cochlear implantation. WES identified a pathogenic de novo heterozygous mutation (c.2051C > T, p.(Ala684Val)) in WSF1.\n\n    WSF1 is associated with an autosomal dominant Wolfram-like syndrome, which associates progressive HL, optic atrophy and, later, diabetes mellitus. After diagnosis, the patient had an ophthalmological evaluation that revealed partial bilateral optic atrophy. Endocrinological follow-up was organized.\n\n    Patient 12. A seven-year-old male was diagnosed with mild bilateral SN HL when he started elementary school. He had a conventional binaural BTE hearing aid. MRI was normal, and there was no relevant family history. WES identified a compound heterozygous CKMT1B, STRC, CATSPER2 deletion, confirmed by MLPA (chr15:g.(43851199_43890333)_(43940820_44038794)del) and (c.4917_4918delACinsCT, p.(Leu1640Phe)) in STRC. Family segregation was confirmed.\n\n    Patient 13. A seven-year-old male with postlingual, moderate bilateral SN HL. The audiogram showed a \"U-curve\". He had a conventional binaural BTE hearing aid. MRI was normal with no relevant family history. WES identified a compound heterozygous CKMT1B, STRC deletion and a CKMT1B, STRC, CATSPER2 deletion). This result was confirmed by MLPA (chr15:g.[(43851199_43890333)_(43897676_43924279)del];[(43851199_43890333)_(43940820_44038794)del] and family segregation.\n\n    Patient 14. A nine-year-old female with moderate prelingual SN bilateral HL and no relevant family history. WES identified a compound heterozygous c.4425G > C, p.(Trp1475Cys) in STRC and CKMT1B, STRC, CATSPER2 deletion confirmed by MLPA (chr15:g.(43851199_43890333)_(43940820_44038794)del) and family segregation confirmed bi-allelic inheritance.\n\n    Patient 15. A nine-year-old male with congenital moderate bilateral SN HL and no relevant family history. He had a conventional binaural BTE hearing aid. WES identified a homozygous deletion of CKMT1B, STRC, CATSPER2 confirmed by MLPA (chr15:g.(43851199_43890333)_(43940820_44038794)del) and family segregation confirmed bi-allelic inheritance.\n\n    Patient 22. A 14-year-old female with moderate, prelingual bilateral SN HL. Her father suffered from moderate bilateral HL and her uncle suffered from unilateral moderate HL. She had a conventional BTE hearing aid since the age of one year. WES identified a heterozygous deletion of CKMT1B and STRC and probably CATSPER2 confirmed by MLPA (chr15:g.(43'851'199_43'890'391)_(?_44'038'820)del), as well as a heterozygous (c.4837G > T,p.(Glu1613*)) mutation in the STRC gene. Family segregation confirmed the inheritance of each allele from a healthy parent.\n\n    STRC alterations cause autosomal recessive nonsyndromic SN deafness type-16. HL starts usually during childhood (birth to the age of 10 years). Contiguous gene deletion syndrome on chromosome 15q15.3, including STRC and CATSPER2, as identified in patient 15, is responsible for a deafness-infertility syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by early-onset deafness in both males and females and associated with infertility in males.\n\n    Patient 21. A six-year-old female with a moderate bilateral SN HL detected at elementary school screening. Her audiogram was \"spoon\"-shaped. She had a conventional binaural BTE hearing aid. Family history was positive on her father's side (paternal uncle, grandfather and great-grandfather affected with adult onset moderate HL). Her father had encountered difficulties discriminating sounds since childhood, but he reported his audiological evaluation as normal at 18 years of age. WES revealed a heterozygous pathogenic mutation (c.502del, p.(Ala168Profs*36)) in POU4F3 inherited from the father and a likely pathogenic, heterozygous de novo mutation (c.1118C > G, p.(Ser373Cys)) in OPA1, never reported previously.\n\n    POU4F3 is associated with autosomal dominant deafness type 15, a progressive form of nonsyndromic SN HL. Onset is postlingual, usually between the second and sixth decades of life. Intrafamilial variability has been reported. OPA1 is related with optic atrophy and optic atrophy plus syndrome. Multisystem neurological disease involving optic atrophy, deafness and neuromuscular complications is associated with all types of mutations. However, optic atrophy plus syndrome is more frequent with a missense mutation in OPA1 gene, while classic optic atrophy is mostly associated with deletion. Both groups of mutations are most frequently observed in the GTPase domain of the OPA1 gene. The mutation carried by our patient was located in this GTPpase domain. Although she had a normal ophtalmological and neurological evaluation, close follow-up was recommended as the signs and symptoms can be progressive and highly variable, with a mean onset around 10 years of age.\n\n    Patient 23. A three-year-old male was referred to an ENT specialist due to delayed speech. Audiograms showed mild prelingual SN bilateral HL. He benefited from neuropediatric evaluation because of interaction difficulties, excessive shyness and motor coordination problems. The family history revealed that his two brothers, his mother, two of his maternal aunts and his grandmother suffer from HL. No one was wearing hearing aids. Age of onset was highly variable (35 years for his mother and 10-15 years for his brothers). HL appeared to be isolated in the family and, in particular, there was no history of cleft palate. WES revealed a large heterozygous pathogenic deletion of COL11A1 (chr1:g.[(103388956_103400026)_(104094395_?)del]) inherited from his mother and present in both of the patient's brothers. The patient and his brothers underwent ophtalmological investigations, which were completely normal.\n\n    Patient 26. A 15-year-old male with congenital bilateral moderate SN HL. His grandmother had a very late onset history of HL. Hearing aids were added sequentially (right ear at 2 years and left ear at 4 years). WES revealed a heterozygous likely pathogenic deletion of a splicing site in COL11A1 (c.4519-2Adel,p.?) inherited from his apparently asymptomatic mother who never benefited from an audiological examination. Close ophtalmological follow-up was recommended, even if HL seemed isolated.\n\n    Patient 24. An 18-year-old female with congenital bilateral moderate SN HL who had been wearing hearing aids since the age of 4 years. She was born with a cleft palate and was highly myopic. She reported bruising easily and chronic knee pain related to recurrent patella luxation. The family history revealed that her mother needed surgical correction of cervical vertebrae, complicated by severe hemorrhage, but without further information. She had two healthy brothers. All of her mother's pregnancies were uncomplicated. WES revealed a heterozygous pathogenic de novo variant in COL11A1 (c.4547G > T, p.(Gly1516Val)) and a likely pathogenic heterozygous variant in SMAD3 (c.3G > A (p.Met1?)) inherited from her mother.\n\n    COl11A1 is associated with Marshall syndrome and Stickler syndrome type II or autosomal dominant deafness type 37. Marshal syndrome is characterized by dysmorphic signs (microcretrognathia, long philtrum, robin sequence) and key clinical features, such as cleft palate, myopia and SN HL. Main complications are vitreoretinal degeneration, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Stickler syndrome is characterized by dysmorphic signs (micrognathia and Pierre Robin sequence with cleft palate), SN HL, early onset myopia, glaucoma and a risk of retinal detachment. Joint hypermobility is common and associated with an increased risk of early onset arthrosis.\n\n    Patients 23 and 26 were affected only by HL, while patient 24 displayed clear signs of Stickler syndrome. It has recently been highlighted that COL11A1 is associated with nonsyndromic HL and should be included in nonsyndromic HL gene panels.\n\n    SMAD3 is associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 3, characterized by cardiac malformation (mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, left ventricular hypertrophy) and an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection, arterial aneurysm and arterial tortuosity, pectus deformity, and an increased risk of internal organ ruptures.\n\n    Patient 24 underwent extensive vascular investigations and had no signs of vascular involvement or characteristic Loeys-Dietz dysmorphic features. However, she did describe bruising easily, had fair skin and long fingers. Due to her young age, we proposed to introduce a regular vascular follow-up.\n\n    Patient 25. A five-year-old female was referred to the ENT department for profound, seemingly isolated and congenital HL. No relevant family history was noted, but her parents were consanguineous. WES revealed homozygous pathogenic duplication in the TRIOBP gene (c.3214dup, p.ArgArg1072Profs*12). Family segregation confirmed a bi-allelic inheritance.\n\n    The TRIOBP gene is associated with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive HL, which is usually bilateral and prelingual.\n\n    Patient 27. A nine-year-old female was referred to the ENT department due to severe bilateral progressive HL. She had been wearing regular BTE hearing aids since the age of 8 years with poor results. The family history was unremarkable. WES revealed compound heterozygosity in the TMPRSS3 gene (c.400 A > T, p.(Lys134*); c.646C > T, p.(Arg216Cys)); both variants were reported as pathogenic. Family segregation confirmed that each variant was inherited from a healthy parent.\n\n    Patient 29. A three-year-old male was referred to the ENT department due to speech delay. OAEs at birth were reported normal, but a hearing evaluation revealed severe bilateral \"ski slope\" pattern SN HL. He had a sister whose audition was in the normal range. His father reported unilateral HL since childhood. Hearing aids were implemented since the diagnosis. WES revealed compound heterozygosity in the TMPRSS3 gene (c.916G > A, p.(Ala306Thr); (c.749delT,p.(Leu250Argfs*25)); both variants were reported as pathogenic. Family segregation confirmed the bi-allelic inheritance of the variants.\n\n    The TMPRSS3 gene is associated with nonsyndromic recessive SN HL type 8/10. HL can be pre- or post- lingual, depending on the type of mutation, and HL has been described as isolated.\n\n    Patient 28. A 10-year-old male with mild bilateral SN HL. The family history revealed that both his father and grandfather suffered from mild HL, but progressive for his father. He had one healthy brother. We could not find an audiological examination (OEA) performed at birth, but screening at the age of 5 years was pathological. WES revealed a heterozygous, likely pathogenic mutation in COL4A3 inherited from his father (c.4826G > A, p.(Arg1609Gln)).\n\n    COL4A3 mutations are associated with several phenotypes, such as Alport syndrome that associates renal failure, variable HL (which can be of late onset) and ocular involvement, including cataract and retinopathies. Heterozygous mutation in the COL4A3 gene responsible for autosomal dominant Alport syndrome might also generate isolated HL or HL with ocular involvement in some carriers. Neither our patient nor his father showed any sign of kidney or ocular involvement, but close follow-up was organized as phenotypic variability has been described, even in the same family.\n\n    Patient 31. A 16-year-old male presenting with severe bilateral HL. He wore regular BTE hearing aids. In addition, he suffered from cholestatic hepatopathy since infancy, as well as hyperactivity and impaired concentration. The family history was unremarkable. His parents of European descent were not related. WES revealed a homozygous pathogenic mutation in the MARVELD2 gene (c.1331 + 2T > C, p.(?)).\n\n    MARVELD2 is associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic HL type 49 more often found in the East Caucasian population. No association with hepatic involvement in this patient could be demonstrated. However, MARVELD2 is a tight junction protein and therefore we might reconsider this statement in the years to come. Indeed we might stretch out that a defect in tight junction protein could easily affect the integrity of the epithelia, and therefore, the function of the organ.\n\n    Patient 32. A two-year-old male with profound bilateral congenital HL. At birth, he presented with hypothyroidism and an atrial septal defect. He benefited from a sequential bilateral cochlear implant (Nov 2020, right side; Feb 2021, left side). He had one older sister without any hearing impairment. His paternal grandfather was reported with mild HL and his great-granduncle with very early HL (without further information). His parents have normal audition. WES revealed a homozygous variant in the MYO15A gene. Family segregation confirmed inheritance of each of the variants from a healthy parent.\n\n    MYO15A gene is associated with autosomic recessive severe nonsyndromic HL type 3. HL is described as congenital and severe to profound.\n\n    Patient 62. A 40-year-old male presented with unilateral progressive HL and bilateral tinnitus. MRI revealed bilateral schwannoma, which raised the hypothesis of neurofibromatosis type 2. Exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the NF2 gene (c.1579G > T, p.(Glu527*)), which confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n    A NF2-related syndrome is characterized by the progressive appearance of vestibular schwannomas, which are usually bilateral and responsible for HL, and may or may not be associated with tinnitus. Schwannomas may also develop on other cranial, spinal or peripheric nerves with related symptoms. Some patients may develop intracranial or intraspinal meningiomas or a malignant tumor of the nervous system (ependymoma). Ophtalmological involvement, including cataract and loss of visual acuity, is quite common. Seventy percent of NF2 patients have cutaneous tumors.\n\n    Patient 63. A 66-year-old female with bilateral severe HL since 30 years. Lately, she noticed worsening of hearing impairment and bilateral vestibular areflexia. She wore regular hearing aids. Her sister had bilateral HL and wore hearing aids. Her brother and father displayed late-onset HL, but less severe. Her son is being evaluated for HL. WES revealed a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the COCH gene (c.341T > C, p.Leu114Pro). The mutation associated with the COCH gene leads to progressive bilateral HL with autosomal dominant transmission. Vestibular involvement is frequent. Onset is described from 20 to 60 years of age.\n\n    Patient 1 (described previously). In addition to the COL4A5 variant, she was found to carry two missense variants in compound heterozygosity in COL11A2 classified as VUS. Mutations in COL11A2 are known to be responsible for autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive nonprogressive profound, congenital or prelingual HL. This gene is also associated with a syndromic HL, otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia. To date, our patient does not present any other signs and symptoms suggestive of a collagenopathy.\n\n    Patient 33. A 12-year-old male with prelingual bilateral severe SN HL. His younger brother was also affected. They had no other signs and symptoms. WES identified compound heterozygous mutations (c.641G > A, p.(Arg214His)) and (c.643T > G, p.(Trp215Gly)) classified as VUS in TBC1D24. Both variants were also present in the affected brother and family segregation was confirmed.\n\n    Patient 64. A 33-year-old female referred to the ENT department due to bilateral HL since the age of 18 years, with moderate, but progressive bilateral SN HL. The family history revealed that her father suffered from late-onset unilateral HL. She was born to a consanguineous union. WES revealed a heterogygous mutation in TBC1D24 (c.418 C > G p.(Leu140Val)) classified as a VUS.\n\n    TBC1D24 has been described with autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant HL.\n\n    Autosomal recessive TBC1D24-related syndromes show a marked phenotypic pleiotropy with multisystem involvement. The severity spectrum ranges from isolated deafness to benign myoclonic epilepsy restricted to childhood with complete seizure control and normal intellect, to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with severe developmental delay and early death. There is no distinct phenotypic correlation with the pathogenic variant type or location as yet, but patterns are emerging. Autosomal dominant TBC1D24-related syndromes are marked by adult onset and progressive HL. For both families of patients 33 and 64, the variants did not fulfill ACMG criteria and were not counted as positive results.\n\n    Patient 42. An 11-year old female with congenital bilateral non-syndromic SN HL. Neonatal hearing screening was abnormal and she underwent a cochlear implant. The family history revealed that she was born to a consanguineous union (2nd degree cousins), but with no history of HL. Her parents were of Egyptian origin. WES revealed a heterozygous variant in the CDH23 gene. This latter gene is associated with autosomal recessive HL, autosomal dominant Usher syndrome 1D or autosomal recessive/digenic Usher syndrome. A family segregation study was not possible and therefore pathogenicity through segregation could not be concluded. As ACMG criteria were not met, the variant was classified as a VUS, The patient will be re-evaluated on a regular basis.\n\n    Patient 46. A 14-year-old male with HL detected at the age of 3 years who wore regular BTE hearing aids since then. At age 12, he benefited from a cochlear implant. He was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and benefits from special support at school. The family history was unremarkable. WES revealed two variants in PCDH15 (c.4885delA, p.S1629fs & c.964T > A, p.Ser322Thr) and two variants in USH2A (c.13133C > T, p.Pro437Leu & c.6800C > T, p.Pro2267Leu). Family segregation confirmed the position in cis of all variants inherited from the healthy mother. All variants were classified as VUS.\n\n    PCDH15 gene is associated with autosomal recessive HL type 23 and autosomal recessive/digenic Usher syndrome. USH2A gene is associated with autosomal recessive Usher syndrome type 2A and retinitis pigmentosa 38.\n\n    Patient 51. A 10-year-old female presenting with auditory neuropathy resulting in moderate HL. An attempt with hearing aids was not successful. The family history was unremarkable. WES revealed a heterozygous variant in the OSBPL2 gene (c.852_854delTATinsATG, p.(Phe284_Met285delinsLeuTrp)) inherited from the healthy mother. Therefore, this variant did not fulfill ACMG criteria and was not considered as a positive result.\n\n    The OSBPL2 gene is responsible for autosomal dominant HL with high variability in terms of age of onset (5-32 years) and expressivity; HL is usually progressive.\n\n    Patient 71. A three-year-old male with congenital severe bilateral SN HL and no relevant family history. Direct sequencing of GJB2 and GJB6 revealed a homozygous deletion in the GJB2 gene (c.35delG, p.(Gly12Valfs*2).\n\n    Patient 72. An eight-year old male with prelingual severe bilateral SN HL and no relevant family history. Direct sequencing of GJB2 and GJB6 revealed a homozygous deletion in the GJB2 gene (c.35delG, p.(Gly12Valfs*2). Family segregation was confirmed.\n\n    Patient 73. A five-year-old female with moderate congenital SN HL. Her mother had moderate-to-high frequency HL. She wore regular bilateral BTE hearing aids. Direct sequencing of the GJB2 and GJB6 locus revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the GJB2 gene (c.59T > C, p.Ile20Thr and c.109G > A,p.Val37Ile). Family segregation was confirmed.\n\n    Patient 74. A 6 year-old male with prelingual moderate bilateral SN HL and no relevant family history. Direct sequencing of GJB2 and GJB6 locus revealed a homozygous mutation in the GJB2 gene (c.269T > C, p.(Leu90Pro). Family segregation was confirmed.\n\n    Patient 75. A 20-year old female with congenital severe HL. She wore regular BTE bilateral hearing aids and was referred to the genetics department because of her wish to conceive a child. She had two sisters with severe bilateral HL who also wore hearing aids. She had also one sister and one brother without any hearing impairment. Direct sequencing of the GJB2 locus revealed a homozygous deletion in the GJB2 gene (c.35delG, p.(Gly12Valfs*2).",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, exome DNA sequencing and analysis of pathology-related gene panel(s) has become the gold standard for the investigation of HL. Our results emphasize the advantages of a global approach with careful variant and case discussion involving a multidisciplinary team to obtain a genetic diagnosis of SN HL. In addition to its undeniable value in clinical practice, with a 50-60% genetic diagnostic yield for SN HL (including GJB2/GJB6 alterations), it improves prognostic accuracy, as well as genetic and reproductive counseling. Importantly, this approach can also reveal clinically-relevant undiagnosed syndromes, thus changing the outcome of the disorder and avoiding the occurrence of preventable complications.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    WES performed on a cohort of 61 children and 9 adult patients with HL identified a genetic etiology in 52.5% of children and 22.2% of adults. Our diagnostic yield in the child cohort was within the upper range (10-80%) of results published in the literature. A high diagnostic yield from genomic testing has been associated with the inclusion of patients with early onset HL and suspected genetic syndromes, but who have not undergone any previous genetic testing for common genes, such as GJB2-GJB6. In our cohort, only three patients showed a GJB2 mutation revealed by exome sequencing. When including the four children excluded from our exome cohort, our diagnostic rate reached 55.4% in this population. The inclusion of greater numbers of deafness genes and the addition of CNV analysis can also increase the diagnostic yield. In our cases, we used large gene panels and pipeline analysis optimized to identify CNV. Seven cases were caused by CNVs detected by this algorithm, representing a substantial proportion of our cohort (21.9%). Therefore, it is important that the pipeline allows for the detection of such CNVs.\n\n    The genetic causes of hearing loss have also been explored in different adult populations. Epidemiological studies focusing on the heritability of adult onset HL ranked it as between 19-53% in twin studies, without differentiation between monogenic and polygenic rates. However, a recent study suggests that the diagnostic rate can be very high if patients are carefully selected. In our cohort, the diagnostic rate was 22.2%. As we only included 9 adults with HL, this diagnostic rate has to be re-evaluated in a larger cohorts. A molecular diagnosis will help the medical team to adapt follow-up and provide appropriate genetic counseling.\n\n    Diagnostic rates of up to 60-80% are expected in patients with suspected autosomal recessive non-syndromic congenital deafness. In our cohort of molecularly diagnosed patients, 43.75% were autosomal recessive non-syndromic cases (14 patients); three patients with autosomal recessive inheritance were syndromic. In total, 53% of patients had autosomal recessive inheritance patterns and 43.75% had autosomal dominant transmission, of which 11 were syndromic. One patient showed an X-linked inheritance pattern, which corresponds to expected rates. Both adults with a confirmed molecular diagnosis showed an autosomal dominant disorder. Autosomal dominant HL, especially later onset HL, is associated with genes that show incomplete penetrance and high variability and this is therefore not surprising. Our rate of syndromic HL in children (46.9% syndromic) is slightly higher compared with those reported in the literature for a Caucasian population (30%). Among the 15 patients with syndromic HL, nine had other signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis. For two cases, these additional signs were discovered thanks to the investigations launched after molecular diagnosis. The seven patients without any additional sign at the time of diagnosis are being closely followed-up according to molecular diagnosis recommendations. Molecular identification of these patients is extremely important as follow-up and treatment can be adapted in order to prevent potential complications.\n\n    Mutations in the GJB2 gene are among the most frequent causes of non-syndromic congenital HL, with a variable range depending on ethnic variations (8% to 42.32%). The second most frequent non-syndromic HL-associated genes are SLC26A4 and OTOF. In our cohort, we found STRC (five cases) to be the most frequent cause of non-syndromic congenital HL. Other genes that were most often altered in our population were ACTG1 (n = 3), COL11A1 (n = 2) and GJB2 (n = 3). We did not identify any patient with SLC26A4 and OTOF variants. Interestingly, our data expand the phenotype of already known HL genes, and we report two patients with non-syndromic hearing loss and a pathogenic de novo variant in ACTG1, responsible for DFNA20/DFNA26 and type 2 Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Therefore, our results contribute to expand the genotypic spectrum of ACTG1, which is associated with postlingual progressive SN HL.\n\n    We reported two patients with a TMPRSS3 variant, which is a rare cause of non-syndromic HL in Caucasian patients (<1% vs. 6.3% in our cohort), but more frequent among Pakistani (1.8%), Tunisian (5%), Korean (5.9%), and especially Turkish patients (12%). Patient 27 is of Italian origin and patient 29 has French origins, thus suggesting that TMPRSS3 mutations might be more frequently involved in non- syndromic HL than reported in the literature, even in Caucasian patients. As shown previously, the local epidemiology and diagnostic rate vary widely regarding ethnicity. Geneva is a city located at the crossroads of Europe and is known for its mixed ethnicity and thus our rates probably do not reflect a classical Western Europe Caucasian population epidemiology.\n\n    VUS were identified in five children (8%) and one adult (11.1%). We recommend the regular re-analysis of noninformative exomes and exomes containing VUS every 18 to 24 months after the first analysis. As WES data is stored in our bioinformatics department, re-analysis of these exomes with newly-described genes can be easily performed. Two cases have potentially two molecular diagnoses for HL. Of note, these findings can make genetic counseling more difficult and should be handled with care. Reported rates of dual diagnosis are around 1% to 4%. In our cohort, two patients had a dual diagnosis (3.2%), which is concordant with the reported data in the published literature. No secondary accidental findings were identified as bioinformatic analyses were centered on the 189-gene panel for HL and ear malformations.",

        "Title": "    Mutation analysis of related genes in hamartoma polyp tissue of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare disease with clinical manifestations of pigmented spots on the lips, mucous membranes and extremities, scattered gastrointestinal polyps, and susceptibility to tumors. The clinical heterogeneity of PJS is obvious, and the relationship between clinical phenotype and genotype is still unclear.\n\n    To investigate the mutation status of hereditary colorectal tumor-associated genes in hamartoma polyp tissue of PJS patients and discuss its relationship with the clinicopathological data of PJS.\n\n    Twenty patients with PJS were randomly selected for this study and were treated in the Air Force Medical Center (former Air Force General Hospital) PLA between 2008 and 2017. Their hamartoma polyp tissues were used for APC, AXIN2, BMPR1A, EPCAM, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, PMS1, PMS2, PTEN, SMAD4, and LKB1/STK11 gene sequencing using next-generation sequencing technology. The correlations between the sequencing results and clinical pathological data of PJS were analyzed.\n\n    Fourteen types of LKB1/STK11 mutations were detected in 16 cases (80.0%), of which 8 new mutations were found (3 types of frameshift deletion mutations: c.243delG, c.363_364delGA, and c.722delC; 2 types of frameshift insertions: c. 144_145insGCAAG, and c.454_455insC; 3 types of splice site mutations: c.464+1G>T, c.464+1G>A, and c.598-1G>A); 9 cases (45.0%) were found to have 18 types of heterozygous mutations in the remaining 13 genes except LKB1/STK11. Of these, MSH2: c.792+1G>A, MSH6: c.3689C>G, c.4001+13C>CTTAC, PMS1: c.46C>t, and c.922G>A were new mutations.\n\n    The genetic mutations in hamartoma polyp tissue of PJS are complex and diverse. Moreover, other gene mutations in PJS hamartoma polyp tissue were observed, with the exception of LKB1/STK11 gene, especially the DNA mismatch repair gene (MMR). Colorectal hamartoma polyps with LKB1/STK11 mutations were larger in diameter than those with other gene mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Core tip: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is currently considered an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by germline mutations of the LKB1/STK11 gene. Gastrointestinal hamartoma polyps are one of the most common clinical manifestations. In order to investigate the mutation status of these familiar genetically-related genes in PJS hamartoma polyp tissues, high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the mutations of related genes in PJS hamartoma polyps. In addition, the relationships between the mutation status and the clinical pathological data of PJS are discussed.\n\n    Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease. The main manifestation of PJS is hamartoma polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene LKB1/STK11 are involved in the etiology of PJS. The encoded product of LKB1/STK11 gene is a serine/threonine protein kinase which is widely distributed in various tissues and plays an important role in regulating cellular energy metabolism, chromatin remodeling, DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest, p53-mediated apoptosis, as well as cell polarization. Although PJS is a rare clinical disease, these hamartoma polyps can cause serious clinical damage and obvious heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mutations of LKB1/STK11 gene and other hereditary colorectal tumor-associated genes in PJS hamartoma polyp tissue to investigate the correlation between genotype and phenotype. Twenty patients with PJS were randomly selected for this study, and were treatment in the Air Force Medical Center (former Air Force General Hospital) PLA between 2008 and 2017. Fourteen genetically-related genes (APC, AXIN2, BMPR1A, EPCAM, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, PMS1, PMS2, PTEN, SMAD4, LKB1/STK11) were sequenced in hamartoma polyp tissue from these patients using next-generation sequencing technology to determine the mutation status of these familiar genetically-related genes in PJS hamartoma polyp tissues, and examine the relationship between the mutation status of these genes and the clinical pathological data of PJS.",
        "Methods": "    Twenty patients with PJS were randomly selected for this study, and were treated in the Air Force Medical Center (former Air Force General Hospital) PLA between 2008 and 2017. All patients met the diagnostic criteria for PJS recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and complied with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The guardians of children and adult patients were informed of the purpose of the study, and signed an informed consent form. Their complete clinicopathological data were recorded, and hamartoma polyp tissue samples were obtained and preserved, excluding cancerous polyps (Table 1).\n\n    The genomic DNA was extracted from PJS polyp tissue using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit microsample genomic DNA extraction kit, and the experiment was performed according to the kit instructions (QIAamp Tissue DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, QIAGEN, QIAGEN Strasse 1407124 Hilden, Germany).\n\n    A normalized cDNA library was built using Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two types of Ion Ampliseq custom panels: IAD72340_182_pool 1 and IAD72340_182_pool 2, were used as multiplex PCR primers, which covered all exons and exon-intron junctions of 14 common hereditary colorectal tumor-associated genes (APC, AXIN2, BMPR1A, EPCAM, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, PMS1, PMS2, PTEN, SMAD4, LKB1/STK11). After amplification, the paramagnetic particle method (AMPure XP Reagent, Beckman, United States) was used to purify the library. The library was quantitatively detected using fluorescence quantitative PCR (ViiA 7 Dx, Life Technologies Holdings PTE Ltd Block, Singapore city, Singapore). Template preparation (Ion OneTouch2) and template enrichment (Ion OneTouch ES) was then performed using an automated template preparation instrument (Ion OneTouchTM 2 system). High-throughput sequencing was performed using sequencer Ion PGM (Life Technologies).\n\n    Quality control sequencing data with a target capture rate > 75%, coverage uniformity > 80%, and average sequencing depth > 150x were used as parameters, and the sequencing results were analyzed using Torrent Suite software (Life Technologies; v5.0.4) and compared using the hg19 Human reference genome. The detected gene mutations were annotated with Ion Reporter software  and ANNOVAR package software .\n\n    Candidate verification sites were screened according to the mutation frequency. The dbSNP database , 1000 Genomes Project  and the genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, ) were used in the population frequency database. Suspect or clear pathogenic sites included in HGMD (version 2017.03, ) and database frequency < 0.01, and between 0.01 and 0.05 were retained for verification.\n\n    Prime3 online software  was used to design PCR primers for candidate verification sites. The designed primers were synthesized by Xi'an Qingke Biological Company. The primers were detected and purified after amplification, and were sequenced using the AB 3500xl Dx automatic DNA sequencer (Xi'an Qingke Biological Co., Ltd.). The results verified the preliminary screening of candidate sites.\n\n    Protein functional prediction of mutant genes using software Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2, ), MutationTaster , Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM, ) and Mendelian Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity (M-CAP, ) for primary screening candidate sites verified by first-generation sequencing, and software GERP++  and PhyloP  were used to make conservative predictions of amino acid evolution. Protein models were built using SWISS MODEL  online software.\n\n    Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the SPSS 24.0 software package. The normal distribution measurement data are expressed as the mean +- SD, and the non-normal distribution data are described as the median (interquartile range Q). The number of statistical data and the composition ratio were compared. The chi2 test or Fisher's exact probability method was used to compare the composition of the groups. In the quantitative data, the time of occurrence of dark spots, the interval between the appearance of dark spots and abdominal symptoms, the age at initial diagnosis and the maximum diameter of polyps, etc. were determined. The inter-group comparison of the state distribution data was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    In this patient group, LKB1/STK11 gene mutations were detected in 16 of 20 cases, with 14 types of mutations, of which 8 new mutations were detected. According to the prediction of Mutationtaster software, 8 types of protein truncation mutations were found in 10 cases (2 types of nonsense mutations detected in 3 cases, 6 types of frameshift mutations in 7 cases). Among them, the frameshift mutations can cause truncation protein mutations (Table 2). These mutations can change protein function and the prediction of amino acid evolution conservatiion is shown in Table 3.\n\n    In this patient group, 18 types of gene mutations were detected in 9 of 20 cases, all of which were heterozygous mutations (Table 4). The prediction of protein function change and amino acid evolution conservation caused by the mutations are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. It is less likely that the PMS2 mutation in patient No. 3 and 4 and the AXIN2 mutation in patient No. 7 were pathogenic based on the results of each software.\n\n    Relationship between mutations and family history: Of the 20 patients in this group, 11 had a family history and 9 had no clear family history. The sequencing results showed the following trend (Figure 1): PJS patients with a family history had a higher LKB1/STK11 mutation rate than those without a family history (81.1% vs 77.8%, PLKB1/STK11 = 1.000), and the incidence of LKB1/STK11 truncation mutations was slightly higher than that in those without a family history (54.5% vs 44.4%, Ptruncation mutation = 1.000), In addition, the incidence of mutations in other genes was slightly lower than that in those without a family history (27.3% vs 66.7%, Premaining genes = 0.175). However, due to the small sample size in this group, no statistical difference was observed.\n\n    Relationship between mutations and age of dark spots: Of the 20 patients in this group, 11 had black spots aged <= 3 years and 9 had black spots aged > 3 years. The former was referred to as the early-onset group and the latter as the late-onset group. The sequencing results showed the following trend (Figure 1): Patients with PJS in the early-onset group had a higher LKB1/STK11 mutation rate than those in the late-onset group (90.9% vs 66.7%, PLKB1/STK11 = 0.285), and the incidence of LKB1/STK11 truncation mutations was slightly higher than those in the late-onset group (54.5% vs 44.4%, Pmutation = 1.000). In addition, the incidence of mutations in other genes was slightly lower than those in the late-onset group (27.3% vs 66.7%, Premaining genes = 0.175). However, due to the small sample size in this group, no statistical difference was observed.\n\n    Relationship between mutation and clinical pathological parameters: The group was divided according to the presence or absence of LKB1/STK11 mutations, presence or absence of LKB1/STK11 truncation mutations, and other gene mutations. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the differences in polyp distribution, polyp load, and internal or surgical intervention. The results showed that the maximum diameter of colorectal polyps was greater in the presence of LKB1/STK11 mutations (U = 32.000, P = 0.048), and the others were not statistically different (Table 7).\n\n    All patients of this study were followed-up to January 10, 2020. The final follow-up age was 25.9 +- 15.307 years, and the oldest patient was 47 years. The time span from the patient's first admission was 8.9 +- 8.837 years. Five of these patients were re-admitted to our hospital for a total of 14 colonoscopy examinations and treatments.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this patient group, 80.0% (16/20) of PJS cases were found to have LKB1/STK11 mutations in hamartoma polyps, consistent with previous reports. In addition, 9 patients (45.0%) also had 18 types of mutations in other genes. The total incidence of mutations in this group of patients was 90.0% (18/20). Among them, LKB1/STK11 gene: c.243delG, c.363_364delGA, c.722delC, c.144_145insGCAAG, c.454_455insC, c.464+1G>T, c.464+1G>A, c.598-1G>A, MSH2: C.792+1G>A, MSH6: c.3689C>G, c.4001+13C>CTTAC, PMS1: c.46C>T, and c.922G>A are newly discovered mutations, which suggest that the genetic mutations in PJS hamartoma polyp tissue are complex and diverse. In addition, we found that the cases with mutations in the exon 5 of LKB1/STK11 gene were all in the early-onset group and the cases with splice site mutations in the exon 3 were all in the late-onset group. Those with negative LKB1/STK11 mutations but carrying other gene mutations were all in the late-onset group. This suggests that different clinical phenotypes of PJS may have a different molecular genetics basis. This is worth further study.\n\n    The clinical phenotypic heterogeneity of PJS is obvious. With the continuous improvement in gene detection technology, the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype has become a focus. However, PJS has scattered populations and relatively few cases as it is also a very rare disease in the clinic. A lot of research has been carried out at home and abroad, but no consensus has been reached on the relationship between genotypes and clinical phenotypes. Although this study did not detect a statistically significant mutation frequency in patients with or without a family history due to the small sample size, we found that the colorectal polyps with LKB1/STK11 mutations were larger (U = 32.000, P = 0.048). There was no statistically significant relationship between whether LKB1/STK11 gene was mutated and whether it was a truncation mutation and the patient's polyp distribution, polyp load, polyp size, and medical or surgical intervention. Some studies have demonstrated that MLPA assay technology can improve the detection rate in LKB1/STK11 gene mutation screening in PJS patients. If the MLPA assay is performed in patients with negative mutations, there may be new findings. However, we also found that two patients with LKB1/STK11 gene exon 5 anterior and posterior splicing site mutations had early-onset of pigment spots, and two patients with cleavage site mutations in exon 3 had late-onset of pigment spots, and patients without LKB1/STK11 gene mutations but with other gene mutations all had late-onset of pigment spots. Limited by the sample size in this study, there was no statistical difference between the two groups, and we may be able to uncover the molecular genetic mechanism of clinical subtypes if the sample size is increased in further studies.\n\n    In addition, the mutation rate of LKB1/STK11 gene in PJS patients has not reached 100% using various sequencing techniques, which may be related to the limitations of current technology, but it is more likely to suggest that PJS is a heterogeneous genetic disease, or that there are signaling pathways related to its development and progression. Moreover, we also found that there were other gene mutations in the PJS hamartoma polyp tissue, in which the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene is particularly prominent (accounting for 88.9% of all other gene mutations). According to a variety of software predictions, 81.8% (9/11) of them may be pathogenic and conservative in amino acid evolution. These may be the inherent genetic mechanism of the clinical phenotypic heterogeneity of PJS. The MMR system mainly includes proteins such as hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH6, hPMS1, and hPMS2, which maintain gene stability mainly by repairing mismatched bases and insertion/deletion loops in DNA synthesis. Among them, MSH2 and MSH6, MSH2 and MSH3 constitute MutSalpha and MutSbeta, respectively. The former can recognize single base mismatch and insertion/deletion loops, and the latter can recognize 2-8 base insertion/deletion loops. However, MutLalpha and MutLbeta are composed of MLHL with PMS2 and PMSL, and their functions are to localize the mismatch site, cooperate with Exo I, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and DNA polymerase to remove base mismatches and resynthesize the correct DNA. Functional alterations in MMR may cause microsatellite instability, which can be found in sporadic and hereditary tumors in various tissues, and have clear guiding significance for prognosis and drug efficacy prediction in colorectal cancer patients. In particular, only MSH6 mutation was detected in the PJS hamartoma polyps without LKB1/STK11 mutation. This also indicates that there may be other mechanisms besides LKB1/STK11 involved in the occurrence, development and malignant transformation of PJS hamartoma polyps. Therefore, we consider that destruction of the MMR system may play an important role in the development course of some PJS patients, and with the continuous accumulation of DNA replication errors, it leads to an increased risk of malignant transformation in various tissues and organs. This is worthy of further study.\n\n    It was reported that the risk of intussusception in PJS patients was 50% at age 20 years, the incidence of intestinal intussusception was 95%, and 80% of intussusceptions manifested as acute abdomen and 92.5% of cases were treated with surgery. All patients in the present group did not experience intestinal obstruction, intussusception or other gastrointestinal emergencies and malignant changes of polyps during the follow-up period, and did not undergo surgical treatment. We believe that high-frequency enteroscopy and microscopic treatment effectively alleviate the progress of the disease and prolong the patient's survival.\n\n    Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease, which belongs to the category of hereditary colorectal cancer. It is currently believed that the occurrence of PJS is closely related to mutations in the LKB1/STK11 gene, and that different types of mutations have different effects on clinical phenotype. The genetic heterogeneity of PJS is obvious, and no other pathogenic genes have been found except the STK11 gene, and the relationship between genotype and phenotype is not clear.\n\n    This study aimed to investigate the mutation status of hereditary colorectal tumor-associated genes in hamartoma polyp tissue of PJS and discuss its relationship with the clinicopathological data of PJS.\n\n    To investigate mutations in genetically-related genes, try to explain the genetic heterogeneity of the disease, and investigate whether the disease has a relatively clear genotype-phenotype relationship.\n\n    Twenty patients with PJS were randomly selected for this study who were treated in the Air Force Medical Center and their clinicopathological data were collected, including family history, polyp distribution, polyp load, and internal or surgical intervention. Next-generation sequencing technology was used to study the mutation status of the genetically-related genes in PJS hamartoma polyp tissues, and examine the relationship between the mutation status of these genes and the clinical pathological data of PJS.\n\n    LKB1/STK11 gene mutations were detected in 16 of 20 cases, with 14 types of mutations, among which 8 new mutations were detected. 18 types of other gene mutations were detected in 9 of these 20 cases, all of which were heterozygous mutations. There was no statistical difference between mutations and family history, and between mutations and blackspot age. The maximum diameter of colorectal polyps was greater in the presence of LKB1/STK11 mutations.\n\n    We found a series of gene mutation types in hamartoma polyp tissues of PJS patients, and destruction of the MMR system may play an important role in the development course of some PJS patients. The colorectal hamartoma polyps with LKB1/STK11 mutations were larger than those with other gene mutations.\n\n    Improvements in gene sequencing technology and the identification of new mutation sites of STK11 and other possible pathogenic genes are necessary to describe the pathogenesis of PJS at the genetic level. In addition, an investigation into whether the disease has a relatively clear genotype-phenotype relationship is a hot spot for future research.",

        "Title": "    E-cadherin variants associated with oral facial clefts trigger aberrant cell motility in a REG1A-dependent manner",
        "Abstract": "    Germline mutations of E-cadherin contribute to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) and congenital malformations, such as oral facial clefts (OFC). However, the molecular mechanisms through which E-cadherin loss-of-function triggers distinct clinical outcomes remain unknown. We postulate that E-cadherin-mediated disorders result from abnormal interactions with the extracellular matrix and consequent aberrant intracellular signalling, affecting the coordination of cell migration.\n\n    Herein, we developed in vivo and in vitro models of E-cadherin mutants associated with either OFC or HDGC. Using a Drosophila approach, we addressed the impact of the different variants in cell morphology and migration ability. By combining gap closure migration assays and time-lapse microscopy, we further investigated the migration pattern of cells expressing OFC or HDGC variants. The adhesion profile of the variants was evaluated using high-throughput ECM arrays, whereas RNA sequencing technology was explored for identification of genes involved in aberrant cell motility.\n\n    We have demonstrated that cells expressing OFC variants exhibit an excessive motility performance and irregular leading edges, which prevent the coordinated movement of the epithelial monolayer. Importantly, we found that OFC variants promote cell adhesion to a wider variety of extracellular matrices than HDGC variants, suggesting higher plasticity in response to different microenvironments. We unveiled a distinct transcriptomic profile in the OFC setting and pinpointed REG1A as a putative regulator of this outcome. Consistent with this, specific RNAi-mediated inhibition of REG1A shifted the migration pattern of OFC expressing cells, leading to slower wound closure with coordinated leading edges.\n\n    We provide evidence that E-cadherin variants associated with OFC activate aberrant signalling pathways that support dynamic rearrangements of cells towards improved adaptability to the microenvironment. This proficiency results in abnormal tissue shaping and movement, possibly underlying the development of orofacial malformations.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12964-024-01532-x.",
        "Introduction": "    Over the last decades, the role of CDH1 in cancer aetiology has been extensively investigated. It is well established that CDH1 pathogenic variants are the cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), which is defined by family aggregation of diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. In this syndrome, germline mutation carriers develop highly invasive cancers characterized by diffuse spreading of isolated neoplastic cells at the very early stages of disease. Interestingly, congenital malformations have also arisen as a clinical phenotype associated with CDH1 variants. In particular, oral facial clefts (OFC), such as cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), or cleft palate alone (CP) have been described both in HDGC family members and as independent disorders associated with CDH1 genetic alterations. OFC are among the most prevalent birth defects, with an incidence of 1 in 700 newborns worldwide. Affected individuals require comprehensive care as they experience difficulties with feeding, speech, hearing, as well as dental issues and mental health problems.\n\n    Given that CDH1 encodes E-cadherin:a critical cell-cell adhesion molecule for tissue function and integrity:it is not unexpected that its disruption may lead to defects during embryonic development and cancer. In fact, correct fusion of the palate is dependent on a complex sequence of processes, such as cell migration, growth, differentiation and apoptosis, coordinated by cell-cell interactions and molecular regulators. In line with this, high levels of E-cadherin expression are detected during critical phases of lip and palate development, including in the fourth and fifth week of human embryogenesis at the frontonasal prominence, and in the sixth week at the lateral and medial nasal prominences.\n\n    Despite the progress in OFC genetics, the mechanistic effects mediated by E-cadherin that are involved in lip and palate abnormal closure are unknown. In this study, we have addressed the hypothesis that E-cadherin-mediated disorders result from abnormal cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), and consequent aberrant intracellular signalling, which impact the coordination of epithelial migration. For that purpose, we have explored E-cadherin variants affecting the same nucleotide, although originating distinct clinical outcomes. Taking advantage of in vivo and in vitro approaches, we investigated unique migratory and adhesive features, as well as transcriptomic profiles generated by HDGC and OFC mutants. Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that variants associated with OFC induce an atypical migration performance and increased cell plasticity in response to different microenvironments. These abilities occur upon activation of a specific molecular program, in which Regenerating Protein 1 alpha (REG1A) acts as a potential regulator of lip/palate closure.",
        "Methods": "    E-cadherin variants D254H (c.760G > C) and P373L (c.1118C > T) found in the HDGC context, and D254N (c.760G > A) and P373R (c.1118C > G) associated with OFC were generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the hCDH1 pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech, Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). For assays involving stable transfection, variants were induced in the entry vector CDH1pENTR 221 (Clone ID: IOH46767, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and subcloned into the pEF6/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen) by LR recombination, as previously described. Direct sequencing was used to verify all cloning vectors, and the corresponding empty vector (Mock) was used as a control.\n\n    A transgenic Drosophila model based on the Gal4/UAS system was used to target tissue-specific gene expression. The plasmids encoding the D254H, P373L, D254N, and P373R mutant forms in the pENTR backbone were subcloned onto the pPW-attB destination vector (produced in) using LR clonase II-mediated recombination. The different transgenes were then inserted into the attP40 landing site via PhiC31 site-specific transgenesis (CONGENTO, Consortium for Genetically tractable organisms, Portugal), placing all E-cadherin variants under the same genetic environment of a previously published CDH1 wild-type version. For specific expression in border cells, we generated flies containing UAS-hE-cad wild-type, UAS-hE-cad D254H, UAS-hE-cad P373L, UAS-hE-cad D254N, or UAS-hE-cad P373R together with UAS-CD8::GFP and slbo-GAL4 (BDSC, Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center #76,363 Genotype: w[*]; P{w[+ mC] = GAL4-slbo.2.6}16, P{y[+ t7.7] w[+ mC] = 10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP}attP40). Fly food was supplemented with yeast, and flies were incubated for 1 day at 29  C to boost transgene expression and stimulate ovary development. Overexpression of mCherry (BDSC #35,787, Genotype: y1 sc* v1 sev21; P{UAS-mCherry.VALIUM10}attP2) was used as a control.\n\n    Drosophila ovaries were dissected in 0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixation was performed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Alexa Fluor 562 phalloidin (ThermoFisher) was used for F-actin staining. Ovaries were washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS and mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Fixed tissue was imaged using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5 II, Leica Microsystems) with a HC PL 20x/NA 0.70 objective, or a HC PL APO CS 63x/Glycerol 1.30 objective, and processed using Leica Application Suite software. Fiji was used to measure the migration index in stage 10 egg chambers. The position of the border cell cluster was normalized to the total distance from the anterior part of the egg chamber to the oocyte. Morphological parameters such as length, width, height, sphericity, and surface area of border cells were also analysed. Border cell cluster segmentation was achieved using ilastik 1.3.0, whereas 3D representation was obtained through Imaris software (version 10.0.1).\n\n    CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ATCC number CCL-61) and AGS cells (Gastric Adenocarcinoma, ATCC number CRL-1739) were cultured at 37  C under 5% CO2 humidified air, in alpha-MEM (Gibco, Invitrogen) and RPMI medium (Gibco, Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen). Cell transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. For overexpression experiments, we used 1 microg of DNA of vectors encoding the wild-type protein or the D254H, P373L, D254N and P373R variants, as well as the empty vector (Mock). Transfected cells were selected by antibiotic resistance to blasticidin (5 mug/ml; Gibco, Invitrogen). For inhibition assays with small interfering RNA (siRNA), a SMARTpool of 4 different siRNAs targeting REG1A mRNA was purchased from Dharmacon and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Non-silencing siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon) were used as a negative control. Depletion efficiency was at its maximum at 48 h, using 200 nM siRNA.\n\n    A suspension of AGS cells at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml was plated onto a 24-well plate with wound healing inserts (CBA-120, Cell Biolabs), and incubated at 37  C under 5% CO2 humidified air. After 24 h, the inserts were removed and cells were washed with PBS to exclude detached cells. Warm supplemented medium was added to the cells and live imaging was started immediately, maintaining culture conditions. Cells were imaged for 24 h, with 10 min intervals, using a Leica DMI6000 microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a 20x objective coupled with the Leica Application Suite X software (Leica Microsystems).\n\n    Cell motile features were assessed through the \"Manual Tracking\" plugin from Fiji. Specifically, moving individual cells were traced in image sequences, enabling extraction of XY coordinates, and estimation of velocity and distance covered between two frames. Based on these data, cell trajectories were evaluated and mapped. Travelled distance was determined as the sum of all distances covered during 24 h of cell tracking. Mean-Squared Displacement (MSD) of single cells was quantified using a visual basic macro for Microsoft Excel, and diffusion (D) was calculated from the expression MSD = 4 D t, where t is time (in hours). Wound closure rate was defined as (A0:An)/A0 x 100, where A0 represents the area of the initial wound and An represents the area of wound at a particular time point. Regularity of the wound gap was estimated as the dispersion of the distance between the edge and the migration front, in a given time.\n\n    Cell-matrix attachment ability was determined using a MicroMatrix  of 36 ECM combinations printed on a hydrogel surface (MicroStem). Upon slide hydration, a suspension of CHO cells at a concentration of 2.5 x 105 cells/ml was seeded on the array slides. Slides were incubated at 37  C under 5% CO2 humidified air, allowing cell adhesion to the spots during 48 h. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 min. Nuclear staining was achieved with a 1 microg/ml DAPI solution. Slide imaging was performed on an automated microscope IN Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare) with a Nikon 10x/0.45NA objective. Nuclei segmentation was accomplished with ilastik 1.3.0 and image quantification with CellProfiler. Data was subsequently used for analysis.\n\n    Total RNA was extracted from AGS cells transfected with E-cadherin variants and the corresponding controls, using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. For quality control of total RNA, RNA integrity number (RIN) and concentration were evaluated through the Agilent 2200 TapeStation System. Next generation RNA-seq analysis was conducted by STABVIDA, Lda (Lisbon, Portugal). cDNA library construction was carried out using Kapa Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit, and the generated DNA fragments were sequenced in an lllumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with 150 bp paired-end sequencing reads to achieve a target output of 40 M reads per sample. Raw sequencing data was analysed with CLC Genomics Workbench 12.0.3.\n\n    High-quality sequencing reads were mapped against the reference genome, Homo sapiens (hg38), using the following settings: length fraction = 0.8 and similarity fraction = 0.8. Reads shorter than 30 nucleotides were excluded, and thus 96.81% to 97.19% of the total fragments were successfully mapped. Gene expression levels were determined through a Transcripts per Million (TPM) approach. Differential expression analysis between sample groups was carried out, and fold changes were calculated using the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), which corrects for differences in library size and confounding factor effects (edgeR, Bioconductor). DEGs were considered when fold change >= 2 or <= -2, along with FDR P-value <= 0.05.\n\n    Functional classification and enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms were determined using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, version 2021), considering a P-value of at least 0.05. The list of DEGs exclusive from the OFC variant group was used for functional annotation. Fold enrichment of GO terms was examined to identify relevant categories. Additionally, clustering strength of GO terms was assessed using the enrichment score estimated with the DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering tool. GO terms and clusters with a fold enrichment > 1 and an enrichment score > 0.9 were considered for further analysis.\n\n    Protein lysates were prepared using catenin lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) in PBS] supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche and Sigma, respectively). Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford-based assay (Bio-Rad). For analysis of total protein samples, 20-40 microg of protein were eluted in sample buffer, separated in 10% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), and electroblotted onto Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk or 5% BSA in 0.5% Tween-20 in PBS for 1 h, and immunoblotted with antibodies against E-cadherin (1:1000, Clone HECD1, Invitrogen), REG1A (1:500, Invitrogen) and alpha-Tubulin (1:10,000, Sigma). The secondary antibodies sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences) were then incubated, followed by detection with ECL reagents (Bio-Rad). Protein bands were quantified using the Quantity One 4.6.9 Software (Bio-Rad).\n\n    Cells were cultured on glass coverslips, washed with PBS and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated for 2 h with an E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (1:250 dilution, BD Biosciences). The Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:250, Invitrogen) was applied for 1h30 in the dark as a secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (0.1 microg/ml in PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) and coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5 II, Leica Microsystems) with a HC PL APO CS 63x/Glycerol 1.30 objective, and processed with Fiji software.\n\n    Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0.2). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to verify whether data followed a normal distribution. Data were analysed using unpaired Student t-test with Welch correction. For evaluation of migration features over time, we have exploited the paired Student t-test. In all statistical tests, P <= 0.05 was required for significance.\n\n    Raw sequencing data has been deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (PRJNA1051159). https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA1051159?reviewer=jslcla2aatah6ve66rtoqca9d\n\n    Not applicable.\n\n    Not applicable.",
        "Results": "    In order to investigate the migratory abilities yielded by CDH1 variants associated with HDGC and OFC, we have first engineered an in vivo model in Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, wild-type hE-cadherin, D254H and P373L variants found in the HDGC context, or D254N and P373R identified in OFC patients were overexpressed in border cells of the fly ovary (Fig. 1A-B) - a well-established system to study the underlying mechanisms of collective cell migration. Of note, to exclude possible site-specific effects, we have selected variants affecting the same amino acid, although resulting in different disorders. With the exception of P373L, none of the studied variants were present in population databases, which argues in favour of rare alterations associating with disease. No correlation was verified between the class or predictions of amino acid alterations and the clinical manifestation (Supplementary Table 1). Likewise, all selected variants are located at the extracellular portion of the protein to prevent confounding factors related to the domain impaired (Supplementary Fig. 1A-B). We observed that expression of wild-type hE-cadherin hampers migration of border cells towards the oocyte, yielding approximately 30% of the expected distance for stage 10 egg chambers, while D254H and P373L HDGC mutants migrate 75% and 70%, respectively. Remarkably, expression of D254N and P373R OFC variants enables complete migration of border cells (Fig. 1C-D), resembling cells expressing an inert UAS-driven transgene (UAS-mCherry).\n\n    Taking advantage of this system, we have examined whether CDH1 variants affect border cell morphology during migration (Fig. 1E-F, Supplementary Movie 1). Through 3D reconstruction of migrating cells, we were able to demonstrate that cell clusters expressing D254N and P373R OFC variants exhibited an elongated structure, reflected in significant increased length and decreased sphericity, when compared with HDGC and wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1G-H). Altogether, these results indicate that CDH1 variants linked to OFC and HDGC display distinct morphology and migratory behaviour in vivo, underscoring the potential of site-specific mutants to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie divergent clinical impacts.\n\n    To further explore the motile behaviour induced by OFC variants, we have established an in vitro model in which AGS cells (negative for cadherin expression) were transfected with vectors encoding wild-type E-cadherin and the different variants. We observed that D254 mutants lead to reduced E-cadherin levels, whereas both variants in P373 do not affect protein stability. Thus, the distinct clinical outcomes cannot be explained by changes in E-cadherin expression (Supplementary Fig. 1C-G). A comprehensive characterization of cell motility was then attained using gap closure migration assays coupled with time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 2A). We verified that E-cadherin variants associated with HDGC and OFC yield distinct migration performances and trajectory patterns. Specifically, cells expressing P373R and D254N OFC variants close the wound faster than those expressing P373L and D254H HDGC variants or the wild-type protein. Moreover, P373R and D254N single cells migrate in a direct way, in contrast to cells expressing P373L and D254H HDGC variants, which display a random migration pattern, characterized by disoriented cell movements (Fig. 2B-C and Supplementary Fig. 2). Accordingly, mean square displacement (MSD), diffusion, and overall distance travelled by individual cells are lower for OFC variants, when compared with those observed for HDGC variants (Fig. 2D-F). By analysing collective cell behaviour during wound closure, we could also detect an increased velocity of OFC cells, which is consistent with their directed movement (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, all cellular conditions reach their highest velocity at 12 h upon barrier removal. After that time, velocity decreases possibly due to a reduction in free space and to the proximity of the two leading edges. Quantitative analysis of wound closure over time revealed that cells expressing the P373R OFC variant take 8.2 h to close 50% of the gap area, while P373L HDGC cells require approximately 12 h to reach the same position (Fig. 2H). Due to enhanced migration velocities, the P373R OFC variant produced a more irregular wound leading edge, as reflected in a higher variance of the distance between the initial position and leading edge (8046.5 microm2 in the P373R variant, 2756.1 microm2 in the P373L, and 1174.5 microm2 in wild-type cells, Fig. 2I). Similar effects were noticed for D254H HDGC and D254N OFC variants (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, we conclude that OFC variants precipitate cell migration, resulting in uncoordinated tissue movements.\n\n    Given that the ECM plays a crucial role in regulating migratory behaviours, we addressed the impact of HDGC and OFC variants on the cell s interplay with different matrices. For that purpose, we implemented a high-throughput ECM array with 36 combinations of ECM proteins, namely Collagen I, Collagen III, Collagen IV, Collagen V, Collagen VI, Laminin, Fibronectin, Vitronectin, and Tropoelastin (Fig. 3A). Cells transfected with vectors encoding wild-type E-cadherin or the variants found in OFC and HDGC contexts were assayed in this platform, and the number of cells attached to each ECM spot was quantified to estimate cell-matrix adhesive ability. We verified that cells expressing D254N and P373R OFC variants exhibited a greater ability to adhere to a wide panel of ECM combinations than those expressing the D254H and P373L variants identified in HDGC setting (Fig. 3B). Quantitative analysis of matrix similarity, based on Pearson correlation distance, demonstrates that OFC mutants present a significantly different matrix from that displayed by HDGC conditions (P < 0.0001), and a closer adhesion profile to the wild-type cells (Fig. 3C-E). Importantly, OFC variants showed a significant increase in the ability to adhere to specific compositions, namely Collagen I + Collagen V, Collagen I + Laminin, Collagen I + Tropoelastin, Fibronectin + Laminin + Collagen I, Laminin + Collagen IV, Laminin + Collagen VI, and Tropoelastin (Fig. 3F). In accordance, a high number of D254N and P373R OFC cells adhere to these ECM combinations, whereas a limited number of cells can be detected in the presence of wild-type E-cadherin, D254H, or P373L protein forms (Fig. 3G). These data suggest that OFC variants promote cell attachment to a variety of matrices, and may therefore improve cell adaptability to the surrounding niche.\n\n    To identify potential genes involved in aberrant migration and adhesive capacities of OFC mutants, we used RNA-seq technology. Analysis of mRNA from cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin or the D254H, P373L, D254N, and P373R variants revealed no bias between samples, since all conditions presented similar transcript abundance and followed a normal distribution (Supplementary Fig. 3). Wild-type expression levels were used as a reference to define up- or downregulation of genes induced by OFC and HDGC variants, with fold change >= 2 or <= -2 and an FDR <= 0.05 defined to screen for DEGs. The transcriptomic profile of D254N and P373R OFC variants encompasses 145 and 198 significant DEGs, respectively, whereas D254H and P373L HDGC variants result in a lower number of DEGs (Fig. 4A). However, when comparing OFC and HDGC variant groups with the wild-type profile, we could identify 46 significant DEGs, 8 of which with no functional annotation and therefore excluded. While 31 genes were exclusively altered in the OFC setting, only 2 genes were specific to the HDGC context, and 5 genes were common to OFC and HDGC phenotypes (Fig. 4B-C). Out of the 31 genes associated with OFC, 26 were found to be upregulated and 5 were downregulated (Supplementary Fig. 3D). For subsequent assessment of the biological significance of DEGs induced by OFC variants, we submitted them to gene ontology analysis, unveiling an enrichment in genes included in the Cellular Components category (Fig. 4D). In particular, Plasma Membrane and Extracellular Space were the sub-categories that stood out with the more significantly upregulated genes. Among DEGs, REG1A was selected as a strong candidate to be involved in the migratory behaviour of OFC mutants, given that it has been described to regulate cell growth, proliferation, survival, motility, and invasion in several diseases. Suggestive of its functional significance, we could detect increased REG1A protein levels in cells expressing D254N and P373R OFC variants, when compared with D254H and P373L HDGC variants, as well as with wild-type cells (Fig. 4E-F).\n\n    To address the role of REG1A in our model, we undertook its specific inhibition using an effective siRNA approach (Supplementary Fig. 4A-B). We observed that silencing of REG1A compromised the migratory ability of P373R OFC variant, leading to a general delay in the wound closure. A less evident impact was observed in the motility of cells depleted of REG1A and expressing wild-type E-cadherin (Fig. 5A). Moreover, upon REG1A depletion, P373R cells shifted their migration pattern from a direct to a disoriented trajectory, as confirmed by increased MSD and diffusion rates. Accordingly, the overall travelled distance by REG1A depleted P373R cells was higher than that achieved by cells treated with siRNA control (Fig. 5B-E). Concerning wound closure, we observed that P373R siRNA control cells take around 13 h to close 50% of the gap, whereas P373R siREG1A cells require approximately 18 h, which is consistent with the lower velocities observed for the latest (Fig. 5F-G). Notably, the leading edge of migrating P373R siREG1A cells presents a more regular structure when compared to the controls: variance of distance between the initial position and the leading edge was 1112.7 microm2 for REG1A silenced P373R cells and 1941.9 microm2 for the corresponding P373R siRNA control cells (Fig. 5H). Comparable data was obtained in cells expressing the D254N OFC variant upon modulation of REG1A (Supplementary Fig. 4C-J). These data indicate that REG1A is determinant for the aberrant migratory behaviour of cells expressing OFC variants.",
        "Conclusion": "    This is the first evidence that E-cadherin synergizes with a specific signalling pathway impacting cell migratory behaviour in the context of congenital malformations. We have shown that OFC E-cadherin variants lead to abnormal tissue shaping and movement in a REG1A-dependent manner. Ultimately, we demonstrate the potential of site-specific mutant cell lines and fly models for the discovery of cellular mechanisms involved in disease intricacies. The significance of this study goes beyond the understanding of the molecular networks underlying OFC and HDGC. In the future, genetic counselling of CDH1 variant carriers could benefit from variant classification pipelines including the assessment of migration features through in vitro assays. This will be crucial to identify those at risk of gastric cancer and those that could have a neonate affected by congenital anomalies, such as OFC.\n\n    Publisher's Note\n\n    Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\n    Raquel Seruca is deceased.",
        "Discussion": "    In this work, we aimed to disclose the critical signalling events that are responsible for the abnormal lip/palate closure in E-cadherin germline mutation carriers. It is well established that craniofacial development is a highly intricate process, involving both spatial and temporal coordination of cell adhesion, migration, growth, and differentiation. Disruption of this regulated interplay, through genetic variations and environmental factors, and their potential interactions, can result in structural birth defects, namely OFC. In this scope, genes associated with Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs), Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), and Wnt pathways are already known to influence midfacial growth and/or lip fusion. Only recently, CDH1 germline alterations have been proposed as causative of OFC in both HDGC-dependent and -independent contexts. However, there has been little research on how mutations in this gene can trigger strikingly different clinical manifestations.\n\n    To address this unmet question, we have studied two pairs of E-cadherin missense variants located at the extracellular domain of the protein. The D254H and P373L variants were described in HDGC context, whereas D254N and P373R have been reported in OFC patients. In accordance to recent studies evaluating the CDH1 spectrum of malignancies, no relationship was identified regarding amino acid properties and clinical presentations. Of note, we verified that while the D254 pair leads to a decrease in protein expression, the P373 pair does not affect total protein levels. As previously described for other variants affecting the extracellular portion of E-cadherin, these may not be recognized by mechanisms of quality control and do not undergo premature degradation. In such cases, mutant forms can reach the plasma membrane and be rapidly internalized due to their inability to establish homophilic interactions with neighbouring cells. It is therefore not uncommon to observe aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation along with an irregular membrane staining, or even diffuse protein distribution of E-cadherin throughout the cell.\n\n    Our in vivo model first showed that E-cadherin variants associated with OFC grant cells an elongated and ergodynamic configuration, which could be linked with less resistance and increased movement across the microenvironment. As illustrated by 3D reconstructions, cell clusters expressing OFC variants extend oriented and prominent protrusions that contribute to force generation and subsequent translocation. In vitro experiments further confirmed an unusual ability for cells to migrate faster and with an abnormal directionality in OFC mutants, when compared with cells expressing HDGC variants.\n\n    OFC are characterized by failed fusion of the embryonic facial prominences, although our results suggest that this may not be the outcome of delayed cell migration. Instead, we propose that an excessive motility performance prevents the coordinated movement of the epithelial cell sheets, generating finger-like projections and irregular leading-edges, which can ultimately result in anomalous facial structures. For normal lip and palate closure, we postulate that epithelial migration must occur in a slower manner, allowing a synchronised movement at the leading edges and thereby accurate fusion of the facial prominences and palatal shelves. On the other hand, despite that HDGC mutants display slower migration, this occurs along with erratic movement of isolated cells, corroborating the diffuse dissemination abilities observed even at early stages of tumours.\n\n    OFC variant effects are consistent with a phenotype of mechanical advantage provided by attachment to the ECM. Accordingly, we found that cells expressing OFC variants adhere to a wide range of ECM substrates, suggesting increased ability to adjust when compared to cells carrying HDGC alterations. More so, ECM combinations preferred by OFC mutants enclose structural elements for palatogenesis, namely type I, IV, V, and VI collagens. Mansell and colleagues were the first to notice alterations in collagen cross-linking and turnover, as well as an overall increase in collagen content during rodent palatal development. Interestingly, ECM composition and remodelling were suggested to play a role in the aetiology of CL/P. An imbalance in fibronectin abundance is associated with CL/P, in line with the lower adherence of OFC mutant cells to fibronectin observed herein. On the contrary, it was recently demonstrated that gastric cancer cells bind selectively to fibronectin-enriched ECMs, where they are able to exert increased traction forces.\n\n    These results prompted us to investigate whether plasticity of OFC mutant cells would be related with the activation of a dedicated expression profile. Following implementation of an RNA-seq workflow, it was verified that OFC and HDGC genotypes produce distinct molecular signatures, exposing a high number of DEGs in the OFC context. In addition, the OFC group was enriched in gene sets of Plasma Membrane and Extracellular Space subclasses, corroborating the improved cell-matrix attachment observed in OFC mutants. Among significantly overexpressed candidate genes, we selected REG1A as a potential regulator of the OFC phenotype. Thus, confirmation of REG1A upregulation at the protein level motivated its modulation through siRNA assays. We found that REG1A downregulation rescues the aberrant epithelial movement produced by OFC mutants, forming a more regular and slower migration front. Moreover, individual cells exhibit a clear lack of orientation cues and undertake random trajectories. The same trend, although less striking, was observed for trajectories and velocity of wild-type cells after REG1A inhibition. This is consistent with previous work showing that REG1A overexpression was associated with invasion and poor prognosis of colorectal and bladder cancer patients, while its inhibition impaired cancer cell migration. In gastric carcinomas, there is limited data on the role of REG1A, despite reports of its downregulation through epigenetic methylation.\n\n    In agreement with the present findings, other studies have already proposed deregulated adhesion and migration programs as critical determinants of OFC pathogenesis. Nonetheless, their significance was not addressed at the cellular level, limiting interpretation and translation of data into the clinics.",

        "Title": "    A retrospective study of eating and psychosocial problems in patients with hepatic glycogen storage diseases and idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia: Towards a standard set of patient-reported outcome measures",
        "Abstract": "    There is a paucity in literature on eating and psychosocial problems in patients with hepatic glycogen storage disease (GSD) and idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia (IKH), problems that can greatly affect quality of life. This is a monocentre, retrospective, observational mixed method study of patients with hepatic GSD or IKH treated at the Beatrix Children's Hospital Groningen, who had been referred to SeysCentra, a specialist centre for the treatment of eating problems. Additionally, a systematic literature review has been performed to identify instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures of psychosocial problems in hepatic GSD patients. Sixteen patients from 12 families were included with ages ranging between 3 and 24 years. Five out of sixteen patients were diagnosed with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and six patients showed characteristics of this disorder. Fourteen patients experienced sleeping problems, and 11 out of 12 parent couples experienced stress about the illness of their child. We subsequently identified 26 instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures for GSD patients. This study demonstrates that GSD patients can develop Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder influencing quality of life at multiple domains. The identification of instruments to assess psychosocial wellbeing is an important step towards a standard set of patient-reported outcome measures.",
        "Introduction": "    Hepatic glycogen storage disease (GSD) is a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) characterised by an abnormal synthesis or degradation of glycogen, because of a missing enzyme or transporter. Clinically, patients are characterised by reduced fasting tolerance, failure to thrive and hepatomegaly. Biochemical hallmarks of the diseases are GSD subtype specific and include ketotic and hypoketotic hypoglycaemia. The most frequent cause of hypoglycaemia in childhood is idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia (IKH), which is a diagnosis of exclusion. The primary aim of dietary treatment in both GSD patients and IKH patients is to maintain euglycemia. In GSD, equally important and related to glycaemic control is to prevent secondary metabolic derangements and long-term complications. Treatment modalities may include frequent feeds, daytime complex carbohydrates, limitation of mono- and disaccharides and a nocturnal continuous supply of carbohydrates in the form of either a late-evening meal (ie, uncooked cornstarch (UCCS) or modified cornstarch (Glycosade ) or gastric drip feeding administered via nasogastric (NG) tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Additionally, a high protein diet is beneficial for patients with ketotic GSD subtypes.\n\n    Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a recently acknowledged feeding or eating disorder, included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) and was previously referred to as Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood (DSM-IV). This disorder is characterised by eating too little and/or too selectively, associated with weight loss, poor growth, nutritional deficiencies, the need for supplementary enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements and/or impaired psychosocial functioning. The DSM-5 provides three representations of ARFID, namely (1) a lack of interest in food or eating, (2) an avoidance of food due to its sensory characteristics, and (3) a concern about the aversive consequences of eating the food. It has been found that the health-related quality of life (QoL) is decreased in patients with ARFID, which emphasises the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment. A retrospective case-control study of 712 children demonstrated, that ARFID patients are more likely to have an underlying medical disorder.\n\n    Psychosocial problems have been reported in patients with hepatic GSD. A prospective study of 31 youth with GSD I reported reduced QoL and less independently functioning. Moreover, it was recognised that their parents experienced more stress compared to parents of healthy control children. In a study that interrogated 64 individuals with GSD with questionnaires and interviews, it was observed that GSD patients demonstrated more dysfunctional attitudes towards food, with a lower body esteem. Furthermore, GSD patients more often displayed a selective food intake and increased fear of feeding. It seems evident that, especially GSD I patients may be at a higher risk of developing feeding disorders, as some patients even demonstrate complete food refusal.\n\n    Recently, we have shown that young GSD patients and their parents experience many safety issues and acute complications accompanying their disease and dietary treatment. However, there is paucity in literature on feeding/eating disorders and psychosocial problems in patients with hepatic GSD. Therefore, we performed two studies: first, we carried out an observational, retrospective systematic analysis of clinical characteristics, eating problems and psychosocial problems in a subset of GSD patients, who were referred to a specialist centre because of the severity of their eating problems. Subsequently, we performed a systematic literature review to identify instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in GSD patients.",
        "Methods": "    The Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) stated that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act was not applicable and that official study approval by the Medical Ethical Committee was not required (METc 2019/119). Patients with GSD or IKH were followed at the Section of Metabolic Diseases, Beatrix Children's Hospital, UMCG, an endorsed centre of expertise for GSD patients. For the retrospective part of this study, additional written informed consent to study the patient file was obtained from the patients who had been treated at SeysCentra, a specialised centre for the multidisciplinary treatment of severe eating problems.\n\n    First, we performed a monocentre retrospective, observational mixed method study of medical files of hepatic GSD patients before October 1, 2020. Longitudinal data were retrieved from both the UMCG paper and electronic medical files, and from the files at SeysCentra, a specialised centre in paediatric feeding and eating issues. We subsequently performed a systematic review of literature to list the instruments to quantify PROMs in patients with hepatic GSD.\n\n    Data were studied from all patients followed at the UMCG in the Netherlands, who had been referred to SeysCentra, and who either had a genetically or enzymatically confirmed diagnosis of hepatic GSD, or fulfilled the criteria of the diagnosis IKH.\n\n    From the paper and electronic files from all included patients at UMCG and from all patients treated at SeysCentra, retrospective data were studied by one researcher. With the help of the co-authoring panel of experts in hepatic GSD and eating disorders, a checklist was made including following themes: demographic information, medical history and complications, social (family, school) items, eating problems, psychosocial and school problems. Data of meals per day, dietary restrictions, supplements and late evening meal of dietary management was noted as the advised dietary treatment at time of the research. Regarding eating problems, data collection focused on qualitative descriptions of problems with certain meals or products, problems with eating transitions, problems with the prescribed GSD diet, aversive experiences related to eating, behavioural observations of food refusal, lack of appetite or interest in food, sensory aversion to food, tension around meal times, delaying eating, the start of the eating problems and eating disorders (including ARFID) according to DSM-5 criteria as mentioned in the files. Considering psychosocial problems, emphasis was on self-image, being bullied, problems in social life, attachment problems, social consequences of the GSD diet, dependence of parents, problems at school, parent/family situation, parental stress and the treatment at SeysCentra. It was investigated whether any of the above-mentioned parameters appeared in a patient's file from the UMCG or SeysCentra. To this end, all notes, letters and documents from doctors and paramedics (dieticians, psychologists, nurses, remedial educationalists and social workers) were systematically searched.\n\n    The data were analysed in both a quantitative and qualitative manner. Data from the group of patients were mostly analysed quantitatively, and individual patient data were analysed qualitatively. Descriptive statistics were used, as numbers and percentages.\n\n    A systematic review of literature was performed by one researcher about psychosocial problems in patients with hepatic GSD, to investigate the used instruments for measuring psychosocial outcomes. The research question was: 'Which instruments are used to measure psychosocial outcomes in patients with hepatic glycogen storage disease?' A detailed presentation of the search strategy including the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist, is presented as a supplementary file. In brief, the inclusion criteria were: GSD 0, Ia, Ib, III, IV, VI and IX, all ages, sex, race, ethnicity, the use of questionnaires, inventories or assessments and QoL or psychosocial outcomes. The exclusion criteria were: no English article available, other types of GSD.",
        "Results": "    Between June 2012 and December 12, 2019 out of 201 GSD patients and 4 IKH patients (nine males, seven females) from 12 families followed at UMCG were referred to SeysCentra. The GSD patients were diagnosed with GSD Ia (n = 2), Ib (n = 2), IIIa (n = 4), and IX (n = 4). Median age at referral to SeysCentra was 6.5 years (range: 2.2-23.2 years). Table 1 summarises the general patient characteristics, diets, symptoms and complications of the patient cohort. Thirteen patients used UCCS or Glycosade  and 14 of the 16 patients had an NG tube of a PEG tube. Seven patients had experienced several chronic complications of their diseases, such as growth retardation, hypertriglyceridaemia or muscle weakness.\n\n    Twelve out of the 14 patients who used UCCS experienced problems with it. Four patients had trouble with the introduction, four patients experienced diarrhoea and four patients complained about the bad taste. Other problems were intolerance (n = 2), vomiting (n = 2), abdominal pain (n = 2) and increased defecation frequency (n = 1). Seven out of the 12 patients who had used Glycosade  reported the following problems: diarrhoea (n = 3), vomiting (n = 3), trouble with introduction (n = 2), intolerance (n = 2) and bad taste (n = 2). Fourteen patients used protein supplementation of whom five patients reported the following problems: bad taste (n = 3), trouble with the introduction (n = 1), intolerance (n = 1) and changed defecation (n = 1).\n\n    Table 2 summarises the eating problems identified in this cohort. All referred patients showed a form of selective eating and food refusal behaviour. In the categories 'selective eating' and 'tension around meal times' two patients (Patients 1 and 11, see Table 1) were not taken into account because they were fully dependent on tube feeding, of whom Patient 1 (see Table 1) had never tried to eat food. Seven patients experienced a period of complete food refusal, and seven patients did not eat age appropriately. In four patients it was mentioned that there was trouble with introducing new food, three patients had trouble with discontinuing tube feeding and five patients did not eat independently.\n\n    In four patients, the eating problems had started before the first year of life. Crucial moments that luxated or worsened the eating problems included: being dependent on tube feeding, traumatic experiences due to sickness or tube insertion, start of the dietary management, restriction of simple carbohydrates in diet, acute hospitalisations and intercurrent illnesses. At least in six patients it was mentioned that eating problems worsened when the patient was sick, whereas three patients experienced worsened eating problems when stressed.\n\n    Out of the 16 patients that were referred from UMCG to SeysCentra, only seven patients were eventually treated at SeysCentra, while one patient was treated twice. The most often mentioned reason for not starting treatment was the fact that treatment was too time intensive. The indications for treatments were selective eating (n = 5), more responsibility for disease or diet (n = 4), trouble with the GSD diet (UCCS, Glycosade ) (n = 3), help with quitting tube feeding (n = 2), aversive symptoms (n = 1), eating independently (n = 2), eating faster (n = 1), education around disease (n = 1) and food refusal (n = 1). Most patients had more than one reason for indications for treatments. The median duration of treatment at SeysCentra was 9 months (range 1 week - 14 months). The following treatments were mentioned: day treatment, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, ambulatory treatment, 24-h treatment, treatment at home and part-time day treatment. Six of the seven patients had achieved their treatment goals.\n\n    Five out of 16 patients were diagnosed with ARFID at SeysCentra. Six patients showed characteristics of ARFID, and five patients had no characteristics of ARFID based on information in the medical files. In Table 1, the patients with the diagnosis ARFID are indicated with an asterisk. Most patients with (characteristics of) ARFID met multiple subtypes, such as (1) avoidant or restrictive food intake due to the sensory characteristics of food (n = 8), (2) lack of interest in food (n = 7), and (3) avoidance of certain foods or eating due to fear of the aversive consequences (n = 1). Importantly, no characteristics of other eating disorders were found.\n\n    One patient had documented problems with his/her self-esteem and four patients compared themselves much with other people. Three patients experienced problems with their diet at school. It was found that five patients were not reaching self-dependence in their diet or disease management as expected for age. Trouble with sleeping emerged as an important theme as well. It was found that of the 16 patients, 14 patients had problems with sleeping.\n\n    Fifteen patients went to school, one patient was too young. Eight patients who went to school experienced problems at school. Four of those had to repeat school years, three patients were absent much because of their diseases, three patients were struggling to keep up with the teaching material, three patients complained of tiredness, three patients had concentration problems. Lastly, three of the patients had trouble with their diet at school.\n\n    Parental stress was also an important theme. Eleven out of 12 parent couples experienced stress because of the condition of their child(ren) based on the medical files.\n\n    References of all included articles are presented in supplementary file. In brief, this systematic review initially included 210 references. Figure 1 presents the flowchart of the search strategy together with the steps of the systematic review. Table 3 presents the 26 instruments for PROMs applied to GSD patients reported in the literature to date",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This is the first study to report the presence of (characteristics of) ARFID in a number of patients with GSD or IKH that were referred to a specialised treatment centre for paediatric eating problems (SeysCentra). In addition, multiple eating and psychosocial problems were identified in this population. These GSD and IKH patients struggled with poor appetite, selective eating, slow eating and aversive symptoms during mealtimes. We assume that the patients in our study represent a typical top of the iceberg and that eating and psychosocial problems are underexposed during regular patient care. Secondly, we have identified 26 instruments PROMs for GSD patients. The above-mentioned problems can all have a serious effect on the QoL of these families. Therefore, awareness and multidisciplinary assessment are warranted to prevent eating and psychosocial problems in these patients.\n\n    This study builds on existing evidence of feeding difficulties in children with IEMs. Evans and co-workers performed an observational, pilot study in 20 children with a variety of IEMs, including urea cycle defects, organic acidurias and aminoacidopathies (not phenylketonuria). Caregivers, by answering questionnaires, reported poor appetite, limited food variety and lengthy mealtimes. More recently, Berat and co-workers performed a retrospective descriptive study on the use of enteral tube feeding in 98 out of 190 IEMs patients, amongst whom were 23 GSD patients receiving enteral tube feeding. In this study, parents reported a decrease in oral feeding and total feeding difficulties after gastrostomy. Furthermore, parents reported an improvement in QoL after gastrostomy but eating problems and psychosocial problems were not systematically addressed. In their cross-sectional prospective study in 36 GSD patients, Martinez and co-workers observed eating problems in 50-72% of the patients. Previous studies have described an association between food refusal and NG tube exposure >3 months in children with various disorders, and this phenomenon was also described in a study of Dello Strologo in children with severe chronic renal failure. Hence, GSD patients can present eating disorders and psychosocial problems, especially when receiving a NG tube or gastrostomy. Food refusal can lead to life threatening situations for these patients with fasting intolerance, causing both patient and parental stress, possibly aggravating eating and psychosocial problems.\n\n    It is important to note that in the general population nearly half of children are selective eaters at some point during early childhood. Prevalence of picky eating is mostly transitory behaviour in preschool children between 0 and 4 years, corresponding with the age at which most GSD and IKH patients are usually diagnosed, which illustrates that dietary management is initiated at a vulnerable age. We cannot exclude that some eating problems can be a consequence of the dietary treatment of hepatic GSD patients. Due to frequent meals and the intake of complex carbohydrates, these patients often feel full, not hungry and lack appetite to eat. The insertions of NG tubes may have aggravated the development of eating problems.\n\n    It became apparent that 14 of the patients experienced sleeping problems. Sleeping problems are associated with poorer QoL in preschool aged children and they can be an underlying factor for mental health problems in adolescents. Sleeping problems are recognised in other chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, sleeping problems may be a practical consequence of nocturnal dietary treatment, or due to the fear of nocturnal hypoglycaemias.\n\n    The results of the present study should be interpreted with caution, due to some important methodological limitations. Psychosocial problems have not been systematically assessed during medical follow-up, hence assessment of the medical files may have caused certain factors being overlooked and to a certain degree of interpretation. The data in the files were originally collected for other purposes, namely the treatment and guidance of the individual patient and not for research purposes, which may have resulted in sampling bias. Related to this is the fact that part of the data were collected before the diagnosis of ARFID - with its current criteria - was included in the DSM-5. Therefore, some of the symptoms and representations of ARFID might have been described differently in the medical files before and after this new diagnosis became customary in the field (around 2017). There was also a potential selection bias towards patients referred to a centre specialised in the treatment of eating problems. This study certainly did not cover all patients with hepatic GSD with eating and psychosocial problems and we assume that the referred patients represented the top of the iceberg, for which we obviously could not include a control group. IKH patients were also included in this cohort study. IKH is a diagnosis of exclusion with a variable presentation, but in a subset of the patients, dietary management may have similarities with care for hepatic GSD patients. Although the cohort may not be representative for the whole cohort of patients with fasting intolerance, the authors believe that important lessons can be learnt from the observations in these patients with GSD and IKH.\n\n    Dietary management is key for many IEM patients. Specifically in GSD and IKH patients, continuous nocturnal gastric drip feeding or UCCS supplementation aims to prevent hypoglycaemias and glycogenolysis-, proteolysis- and lipolysis-related metabolic decompensation. In current GSD guidelines, information and guidance is either scarce or absent regarding ARFID, other eating problems, psychosocial problems and sleeping problems. Management guidelines for GSD I patients acknowledge that biomedical targets for the management of patients should be attempted to be approached as much as closely, 'without deterioration in QoL'. And that, 'if psychosocial issues are apparent, the family may be referred to the clinical social worker or the child may need a full psychological evaluation'. Although outcomes for many patients with multiple IEMs have significantly improved in the last decades by dietary management and other medical-technical interventions, it can be hypothesised that both the IEMs and the dietary management interventions are potential predisposing factors for the development of eating and psychosocial problems, and hence affecting QoL.\n\n    The recent international priority setting partnership for liver GSD acknowledged QoL as an overarching research priority. Our systematic review identified suitable instruments for quantifying PROMs, such as questionnaires to measure QoL (the Paediatric Quality of Life, suitable for patients between 2 and 18 years old and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36] for patients older than 14 years old), or to screen for eating problems (The Eating Disorders Inventory-3 [EDI-3] and a special version for children; the Eating Disorders Inventory-Child [EDI-C]). The authors emphasise the importance of multidisciplinary assessments of these patients, however it is yet unclear what measures can be taken to prevent psychosocial problems in GSD patients.\n\n    To conclude, this study demonstrates that GSD patients can develop ARFID and that their QoL can be influenced by multiple factors. We have generated an overview of 26 instruments quantifying PROMs for GSD patients in medical literature. Next, patients and families should be involved in the selection of the outcome measures that matter the most to them, as exemplified for diabetes mellitus in collaboration with the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement. Systematic, prospective evaluation can improve value and QoL for patients and families and may contribute to the active screening and prevention, diagnosis and specialised management of eating disorders and accompanying psychosocial problems.",

        "Title": "    Regional distribution of polymorphisms associated to the disease-causing gene of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3",
        "Abstract": "    Knowledge about the distribution and frequency of the respective haplotypes on the wildtype and mutant allele is highly relevant in the context of future gene therapy clinical studies in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3, the most common autosomal dominantly inherited ataxia. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated to the disease-causing gene, ATXN3, have been determined. We wanted to investigate the frequency and regional distribution of two intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large European SCA3 cohort and their relation to the clinical phenotype.\n\n    The genotypes of the two polymorphisms at base pair positions 987 and 1118 of the ATXN3 were determined for their co-localization on the normal and expanded allele, respectively, in 286 SCA3 mutation carriers and 117 healthy controls from 11 European sites.\n\n    The distribution of genotypes on the expanded allele differed from those of the wildtype allele of SCA3 mutation carriers and of healthy controls, and was mainly influenced by the regional origin. In our cohort, no particular clinical phenotype was associated with any specific haplotype.\n\n    Our results confirm distinct allocations of SNPs associated to the expanded ATXN3, and accordingly the consideration of allele-specific therapies.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00415-024-12829-9.",
        "Introduction": "    Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease, MJD, is caused by a coding elongated CAG repeat expansion and is one of the most common autosomal dominantly inherited ataxias. SCA3 has a clinical onset in adulthood and is characterized by progressive ataxia, which can be accompanied by additional neurological symptoms such as oculomotor dysfunction or spasticity. The highest prevalence is found in the Azores (Portugal).\n\n    The disease-determining CAG repeat expansion is located on chromosome 14q32.12, in the protein coding region of the ATXN3 gene. Wildtype alleles usually have a length of up to 44 CAG repeats. Due to the CAG repetition on the expanded allele, with around 60-87 repeats, the resulting ATXN3 protein exhibits an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract causing dysfunction of the altered protein. Such mutant ATXN3 is prone to aggregation and responsible for a \"toxic gain of function\" disturbing cellular homeostasis. Currently, there is no disease-modifying treatment available and the clinical management remains symptomatic and supportive. However, first clinical trials with gene therapy approaches such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) have been initiated (https://clinicaltrials.gov, NCT05160558, NCT05822908). ASOs and other approaches including small interfering RNAs (siRNA) aiming at silencing the ATXN3 gene are currently promising therapeutic options in SCA3. Importantly, a general aim of gene therapies is to reduce the disease protein in an allele-specific manner to preserve the physiological function of the wildtype allele. Consequently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked to the ATXN3 gene, especially to the expanded allele, are of particular interest for an allele-specific gene therapy approach. The knowledge about the frequency and regional distribution of the related haplotypes is of central relevance regarding personalized therapies.\n\n    Several SNPs associated to the ATXN3 gene have been described particularly with regard to the expanded, disease-determining allele. Two well-described SNPs showed an association with the disease determining allele: first, rs12895357 at base-pair (bp) 916 (c.916G > C; p.Gly306Arg) is historically known and thus also in the present work labeled as bp987, and second, rs7158733 at bp1118 (c.1118C > A; p.Tyr349*). These two SNPs are part of the haplotype described in the two major ancestral origins of SCA3: (i) the Machado lineage, determined by the GTGGCA haplotype, which is geographically more restricted to the Azorean island of Sao Miguel and mainland Portugal, and (ii) the TTACAC haplotype, also known as the Joseph lineage, is found in the ancient mutation origin in Asia, which later spread throughout Europe, especially on the Portuguese mainland and on the Azorean island of Flores. Several studies showed the segregation of the C-A haplotype on the expanded allele in the majority of the families of various ethnic backgrounds including Portugal (Azores and mainland), Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, Germany, Japan, France, UK, India, US, Cambodia, and China.\n\n    The determination of SNPs is not part of standard diagnostic genetic testing and characterizations of SNPs in large cohorts of SCA3 mutation carriers are up to now missing. In particular, the frequency and regional distribution of the two SNPs linked to the expanded allele across Europe remains elusive, even though allele-specific protein-lowering therapies covering bp987 and bp1118 are already under development. The aim of this work was to study the frequency and regional distribution of the two above-mentioned SNPs (bp987 and bp1118) in a large European cohort of 280 SCA3 mutation carriers and to determine the relation of the intragenic SNPs to the clinical phenotype.",
        "Methods": "    All participants were included in the longitudinal observational study European Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3/Machado-Joseph-Disease Initiative (ESMI) and gave their written informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) age >= 18 years, (ii) known SCA3 mutation carrier, or first-degree relative of a SCA3 mutation carrier or healthy control. Participants were recruited at 11 European research centers (London, UK; Bonn, Aachen, Essen, Tubingen and Heidelberg, Germany; Coimbra and the Azores, Portugal; Nijmegen and Groningen, The Netherlands; Santander, Spain). EDTA blood samples were taken following a standardized protocol. In total, DNA samples from 286 SCA3 mutation carriers and 117 healthy controls were genotyped for the SNPs rs12895357 at bp987 and rs7158733 at bp1118 of the ATXN3 gene. As demographic and genetic data, age at baseline and sex as well as the CAG repeat length of both alleles were extracted. Determination of CAG repeat length was assessed centrally for all participants at the Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, Tubingen.\n\n    Two SCA3 mutation carriers were homozygous for the disease-specific mutation. They were excluded from the main analysis to maintain statistical conformity. Their descriptive information is provided in a separate paragraph of the results' section.\n\n    Clinical assessment included the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). The INAS assesses the presence vs. absence of the following neurological symptoms: hyperreflexia, areflexia, extensor plantar reflex, spasticity, paresis, muscle atrophy, fasciculations, myoclonus, rigidity, chorea/dyskinesia, dystonia, resting tremor, sensory symptoms, urinary dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction and brainstem oculomotor signs, the latter comprising ophthalmoparesis on horizontal and/or vertical gaze and/or slowing of saccades. The INAS count sums up the number of present additional neurological symptoms, ranging from 0 (no other neurological symptom) to a maximum of 16 neurological symptoms.\n\n    Age of ataxia onset was defined as the reported first occurrence of gait disturbances. For SCA3 mutation carriers, not yet experiencing gait disturbances or with missing information about the age of onset (n = 16), the age of onset was calculated on the basis of CAG repeat and age.\n\n    Mutation carriers with a SARA sum score of < 3 at baseline were categorized as pre-ataxic, according to the established SARA sum score cut-off, irrespective of SARA scores at follow-up visits. To assess the clinical phenotype, we examined the SCA3 mutation carrier within their haplotype at bp987 and bp1118.\n\n    The CAG repeat of ATXN3 was amplified using CAG repeat flanking primers. Shortly, 150 ng of genomic DNA were amplified by a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by capillary electrophoresis using the Beckman Coulter Fragment Analysis Software (Beckman Coulter).\n\n    SNPs at bp987 and bp1118 were determined in an allele-specific manner using fragment analyses. Therefore, PCR reactions were carried out using two different reverse primers that differ at the respective base position of the SNP bp 987 or bp1118, each labeled with a different fluorophore (forward primer 5'-CCAGTGACTACTTTGATTCG-3' for both bp987 and bp1118 SNPs; reverse primer bp987 wildtype 5'-IRD700-ACTCTGTCCTGATAGGTCCCC-3'; reverse primer bp987 SNP 5'-Cy5-ACTCTGTCCTGATAGGTCCCG-3'; reverse primer bp1118 wildtype 5'-IRD700-GCAAAAATCACATGGAGCTCG-3'; reverse primer bp1118 SNP 5'-Cy5-GCAAAAATCACATGGAGCTCT-3'). 150 ng of genomic DNA was amplified in a standard PCR reaction containing 5% HiDi  formamide (bp987; Life Technologies LTD, Warrington, UK) or 4 microl 5 x Q-Solution (bp1118; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), respectively, and 10 microM of each primer. The optimal annealing temperatures were set at 59.5  C for bp987 and 58  C for bp1118, respectively. PCR products were separated by size using capillary electrophoresis determining the respective fluorophores using Beckman Coulter Fragment Analysis Software (Beckman Coulter, Brea, US).\n\n    Statistical analysis was performed with R (version 4.2.1), except for the pie-charts that were created with SPSS (Version 23.0.0.2). The annual SARA progression was calculated as the average annual rate between SARA at baseline and the last visit. Chi-square test was used to determine Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).\n\n    We applied the exact Fisher test to study the distributions of SNPs at bp987 and bp1118 between the wildtype and the expanded alleles of SCA3 mutation carriers and healthy controls and also between ataxic and pre-ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers.\n\n    To study group differences between the subgroups of controls and SCA3 mutation carriers, and pre-ataxic and ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers, the exact Fisher test was used for the variable sex, and the Mann-Whitney test for the variables CAG repeat, SARA sum score, SARA-annual progression, INAS count and disease duration at baseline. Group differences of age at baseline and age of onset were determined using a T-test.\n\n    The relation between the four different haplotypes of the expanded allele within the group of ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers was tested with the Fisher's test for sex, One-way ANOVA for age at baseline, reported and age of onset. Kruskal-Wallis Test was used for the variables CAG repeat length, SARA sum score, SARA-annual progression, INAS count and disease duration at baseline. Additionally, closed post-hoc test was done for further analysis of SARA sum score.\n\n    Furthermore, an exact Fisher test was used to compare the presence and absence of single INAS items between the four different haplotypes of the expanded allele within the group of ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers. Subsequently, those items that showed a significant difference, were subjected to a closed post-hoc test with a corrected alpha, due to alpha error correction for , with n equals the number of considered items, to study the relation of haplotypes and the respective INAS items.\n\n    Data will be made available upon reasonable request and as patient consent allow.",
        "Results": "    A total of 226 ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers, 54 pre-ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers and 113 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. Table 1 gives an overview of the demographic, genetic and clinical data of controls and all SCA3 mutation carriers. Eight subjects (4 SCA3 mutation carriers and 4 healthy controls) were excluded from the final analysis due to missing clinical data.\n\n    The two patients who were homozygous for the disease-causing gene with two expanded alleles were excluded from the main analysis. Their demographic, genetic and clinical information is given separately.\n\n    Frequencies of both, the whole cohort (including healthy controls and mutations carriers) and control group, were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (SNP 987: all p = 0.5998; CNTR p = 0.144; SNP 1118: all p = 0.158; CNTR p = 0.718) Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found in mutation carriers for all analyzed SNPs (SNP 987 p = 0.0086; SNP 1118 p = 0.0144).\n\n    The distribution of the wildtype alleles of the SCA3 mutation carriers did not differ statistically from healthy controls. However, the distributions of SNPs in healthy controls and wildtype allele in SCA3 is significantly different from those observed on the expanded allele in SCA3 (p < 0.001, Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). For the SNP at position bp987 the majority of healthy controls and the majority of wildtype alleles in SCA3 showed Guanine (HC: 74.16%; wildtype allele SCA3: 72.5%), compared to only one-fourth of the expanded alleles in SCA3 (27.14%). For the SNP at bp1118 the majority of healthy controls as well as wildtype alleles in SCA3 showed Cytosine (HC: 75.28%, wildtype SCA3: 69.29%), compared to only 28.93% of the expanded alleles in SCA3 (Fig. 1). Genotype distribution in expanded alleles in ataxic and pre-ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers did not differ (Supplementary Table 1).\n\n    Moreover, we studied the percentage, where the SCA3 wildtype allele differed from the expanded allele: In 57.5% the wildtype SNP differed from the expanded allele at bp 987, and in 58.9% at bp1118 (Fig. 1, right box).\n\n    The two homozygous SCA3 mutation carriers that were excluded from the final analysis had an early age of onset (23 and 30 years) and a high SARA sum score at baseline examination (28.5 and 23) with a disease duration of 16.05 and 17.02 years, respectively. They showed Cytosine:Guanine and Guanine:Guanine at bp987, and both Adenine:Adenine at bp1118. The CAG-repeats on the expanded alleles were 64/64 and 60/66, respectively.\n\n    The majority of SCA3 mutation carriers at continental European research centers show on the expanded allele at bp987 Cytosine and Guanine on the wildtype. However, Portuguese research centers in Coimbra and on the Azores as well as London showed a different vice versa pattern. A similar constellation is depicted for the SNP at bp1118 with mostly Adenine on the expanded allele and Cytosine on the wildtype allele. Again, the Portuguese research centers in Coimbra and on the Azores showed a larger proportion of Cytosin on the expanded allele (Fig. 2). At the German site Aachen, only 2 participants were included, thus we do not recognize the proportions here as a trend.\n\n    Four different haplotypes, defined by the SNPs at positions bp987 and bp1118, were found in both wildtype and expanded alleles of the analyzed SCA3 mutation carriers. The haplotypes of the wildtype allele in SCA3 mutation carriers present a frequency of 67.5% Guanine-Cytosine, 25.71% Cytosine-Adenine, 5.0% Guanine-Adenine and 1.79% Cytosine-Cytosine at bp987 and bp1118, while expanded alleles in SCA3 mutation carriers at bp987 and bp1118 demonstrate a frequency of 68.0% Cytosine-Adenine, 23.27% Guanine-Cytosine, 5.09% Cytosine-Cytosine and 3.64% Guanine-Adenine (Fig. 3).\n\n    Genotypic and clinical evaluation of the cohort showed significant differences between SCA3 mutation carriers and controls in CAG repeat lengths, SARA sum score and annual progression and INAS count (p < 0.001, Table 1). Pre-ataxic and ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers showed significant differences regarding age at baseline, SARA sum score and SARA progression, INAS count as well as the disease duration at baseline (p < 0.001, supplementary Table 2).\n\n    SARA annual progression, INAS count, age of disease onset and disease duration at baseline as well as the CAG repeat length of the longer allele were similar between the four haplotypes in SCA3 (Table 2, supplementary Table 3).\n\n    SARA sum score in the group of all SCA3 mutation carriers (Table 2) and the subgroup of ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers (supplementary Table 3) showed a statistically significant difference between the haplotypes (p < 0.05; Table 2; supplementary Table 3). The post hoc testing revealed a statistically higher mean SARA sum score in ataxic SCA3 carriers with the haplotype Guanine:Adenine (mean SARA = 20.00, N = 10) and the haplotype Cytosine:Adenine (mean SARA 11.00, N = 150) (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n    To further study potentially different phenotypes related to the analyzed SNPs we compared the distribution of INAS subitems among the haplotypes of the expanded allele in the group of ataxic SCA3 mutation carriers (Fig. 4; supplementary Table 4). Areflexia (C-A versus C-C), extensor plantar reflex (C-A versus G-C), spasticity (C-A versus G-C), muscle atrophy (C-A versus G-A), myoclonus, dystonia (C-A versus G-C, C-A versus G-A, C-C versus G-A) and brainstem oculomotor signs (C-A versus C-C; C-C versus G-A) showed a significant difference between the four haplotypes of the expanded allele (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).\n\n    To study the regional distribution in Europe, frequencies of haplotypes of the SCA3 expanded allele at bp987 and bp1118 were calculated for each research center separately (Fig. 5). In Portugal, SCA3 mutation carriers from the Azores (N = 65) and from Coimbra, mainland Portugal (N = 52) showed all possible haplotypes with a particularly high proportion of G-C (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 6).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    To explore the potential of well-known SNPs (bp987, bp1118) in ATXN3 for allele-specific therapies, such as ASOs, we studied the frequency and regional distribution in a large European cohort of > 200 SCA3 mutation carriers. In line with previous studies, the distribution of haplotypes on the expanded allele showed a considerable difference from those of wildtype alleles of SCA3 mutation carriers and of healthy controls. Additionally, this distribution across Europe was mainly influenced by regional origin. The haplotype of the two intragenic SNPs at bp987 and bp1118 is known to be linked specifically to the CAG expansion in around 70-72% of the mutation carriers. Similar results were found in our study in which 68% of the expanded alleles presented the haplotype C-A at bp987-1118, whereas 67.5% of the wildtype alleles in mutation carriers showed the G-C haplotype. Our comprehensive European haplotyping is in line with previous smaller or less regional distributed descriptions of haplotypes in SCA3. While the eight German, Dutch and Spanish research centres exhibited limited to no variation with a predominance of the C-A haplotype, associated to the Joseph lineage, of 92.8% to 100%, this haplotype was less frequent in the UK (68%), the Azores (48%) and the Portugal mainland (35%). In contrast, the latter three research centres showed an increased proportion of the Haplotype G-C (18.2%, 38.5% and 59.6%, respectively), associated to the Machado lineage. The haplotypes C-C and G-A were found less frequent with a specific regional origin. In previous studies, the G-A haplotype was described in one family from Morocco, French Guyana and two families from the United States. In addition, the C-C haplotype was not described earlier in SCA3 mutation carriers.\n\n    Our results provide for the first time a comprehensive overview of the European distribution, where regional differences may partially be explained by different main founder mutations. As highly standardized clinical data were available, we could for the first time analyse the relation between haplotypes and the clinical phenotype. Our data demonstrated, that the SARA sum score and the distribution of INAS subitems were slightly significantly differently distributed among the different haplotypes. Generally, patients with the most common haplotype C-A at the expanded allele demonstrated less frequently pathological extensor plantar reflexes and spasticity compared to the second most often haplotype G-C. Importantly, SCA3 mutation carriers carrying haplotypes C-A and G-C had similar numbers of CAG repeats in the expanded allele, providing evidence that this effect is not biased by different repeat length. Even though, differences in haplotype expression are conceivably related to different phenotypes and symptoms due to ATXN3 isoforms caused by SNPs. It is well known that the SNP at bp1118 leads to a premature stop codon and therefore, to a shorter ATXN3 isoform, known as ATXN3a short (ATXN3aS). The two most expressed ATXN3 isoforms in the brain ATXN3a short (ATXN3aS, harbouring the A at bp1118) and ATXN3a long (ATXN3aL, harbouring the wildtype sequence with C at bp1118), demonstrated that the isoform ATXN3aS showed shorter half-life, faster degradation by the autophagic as well as proteasomal pathways and formation of larger aggregates compared to ATXN3aL. However, in summary, we could not identify reliable overarching clusters of phenotypic features related to one haplotype. Nevertheless, the haplotypes C-C and G-A were underrepresented, thus further studies with an increased number of SCA3 mutation carriers, in particular of those haplotypes, are needed.\n\n    Surprisingly, genotype analyses revealed that only around 60% of SCA3 mutation carriers will benefit from an allele-specific protein-lowering therapy as 40% harbours the same nucleobase at the wildtype and the expanded allele. ASOs and siRNAs aiming at silencing the ATXN3 gene are currently promising therapeutic options in SCA3. Because of autosomal-dominantly inheritance, most SCA3 mutation carrier represent only one pathogenic expanded allele, therefore an allele-specific gene therapy approach is of particular interest to preserve the physiological function of the wildtype allele. Allele-specificity can be achieved by using SNPs that are specifically linked to the expanded allele. As ASOs and siRNA are short (12-25 nucleotides long) in size, only one or two very closely located SNPs can be targeted by this allele-specific strategy . Therefore, a haplotype-based stratification strategy is not helpful to develop new allele-specific therapies. To get more insights into the use of SNP for allele-specific targeting, we especially focused on the genotype of SNP 987 and 1118 in our large European SCA3 cohort. On average our data with approximately 68% are in line with previous reports of 70-72% of Cytosine for bp987 and Adenine for bp1118. However, the proportion of SCA3 mutation carriers which are non-treatable with an allele-specific therapy considering the SNPs bp987 and bp1118 since their nucleobases do not differ between wild type and expanded allele differs strongly depending mainly on the origin (in our study between 12 and 69%). There will be SCA3 mutation carrier (in our study between 12 and 69%, depending on the regional origin) which are non-treatable with an allele-specific therapy considering SNPs at bp987 and bp1118 since their nucleobases do not differ between wildtype and expanded allele. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further characterize the allele-specificity of other ATXN3 specific SNPs in large, regional wide-spread SCA3 cohorts. In summary, with allele-specific protein-lowering therapies under investigation, there is an urgent need to understand the worldwide distribution of SNPs linked to the expanded allele in SCA3. Currently, SNP determination within ATXN3 is not part of the standard diagnostic genetic CAG repeat evaluation. Our study provided important information about the European distribution of the two examined SNPs, bp987 and bp1118, and might therefore be of help by providing a trial-ready cohort for allele-specific, protein-lowering therapies.",

        "Title": "    Geographical Distribution of E-cadherin Germline Mutations in the Context of Diffuse Gastric Cancer: A Systematic Review",
        "Abstract": "    E-cadherin (CDH1 gene) germline mutations are associated with the development of the autosomal cancer syndrome known as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. About 30% of families fulfilling the clinical criteria established by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium have constitutional alterations of the CDH1 gene. Different patterns of CDH1 germline mutations have described as truncating, deletion, insertion, splice site, non sense, silence, and at last, missense alterations. The frequency of the different E-cadherin germline mutations in countries with different incidence rates for gastric carcinoma has reported extremely variable. In this study we aimed to assess the worldwide frequency of CDH1 germline mutations in gastric cancers coming from different geographical areas, using a systematic approach.\n\n    Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a complex and multifactorial inherited cancer predisposition syndrome caused by CDH1 germline mutations. Nevertheless, current CDH1 genetic screening recommendations disregard an unbalanced worldwide distribution of CDH1 variants, impacting testing efficacy and patient management. In this systematic review, we collected and analyzed all studies describing CDH1 variants in gastric cancer patients originating from both high- and low-prevalence countries. Selected studies were categorized as family study, series study, and unknown study, according to the implementation of HDGC clinical criteria for genetic testing. Our results indicate that CDH1 mutations are more frequently identified in gastric cancer low-incidence countries, and in the family study group that encompasses cases fulfilling criteria. Considering the type of CDH1 alterations, we verified that the relative frequency of mutation types varies within study groups and geographical areas. In the series study, the missense variant frequency is higher in high-incidence areas of gastric cancer, when compared with non-missense mutations. However, application of variant scoring for putative relevance led to a strong reduction of CDH1 variants conferring increased risk of gastric cancer. Herein, we demonstrate that criteria for CDH1 genetic screening are critical for identification of individuals carrying mutations with clinical significance. Further, we propose that future guidelines for testing should consider GC incidence across geographical regions for improved surveillance programs and early diagnosis of disease.",
        "Introduction": "    In the first half of the past century, GC was the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although steadily declining, in 2017 GC remained the third cause of cancer-related deaths, after lung and colorectum, with almost over 850,000 deaths globally. It was also the third cause of years of life lost (YLL), after lung and liver cancer. A total of 1.22 million incident cases were estimated, with the highest incidence reported in Asia Pacific and East Asia, of which almost 50% were in China. In the European Union, about 100,000 GC-related deaths were predicted for 2020.\n\n    Almost two thirds of GC cases occur in developing countries with 42% in China alone. In fact, the geographical distribution of GC is widely heterogeneous, with high-risk areas including East Asia (China, Japan and Korea), Eastern Europe, and parts of Central and South America. Incidence rates are lower (<10 per 100,000 in men) in Southern Asia, North and East Africa, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Eastern Europe is the highest European risk area for GC with an incidence of 70,000 per year (Belarus area). Portugal and Italy also represent relevant European areas for stomach cancer prevalence, with incidence reports around 41,100 and 33,400 per year, respectively.\n\n    Widespread decline in GC incidence and mortality have been mainly associated to those of the corpus and pylori and have coincided with implementation of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication programs, along with socio-economic improvements and advances in diet and food preservation. In contrast, cancer of the gastric cardia has increased in several high-income countries due to the increase in overweight and obesity, known etiological factors of gastro-esophageal reflux.\n\n    Although environmental risk factors account for variations in incidence and mortality rates worldwide, family history is a major risk factor for gastric cancer. A number of genetic loci have been associated with GC risk, which may directly impact disease progression or interact with environmental factors in the causal pathway.\n\n    GC presents familial aggregation in about 10%, and only 3% shows a clear inherited cancer predisposition, so-called \"hereditary\", associated with a documented germline mutation. Among these, germline defects in CDH1, encoding the epithelial cadherin, have been particularly explored in the context of both familial and sporadic gastric cancer development.\n\n    The first description of CDH1 germline mutations was reported in Maori kindred and families with diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC) aggregation. In 1999, the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) defined the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome and established clinical criteria for CDH1 genetic screening of individuals and families at risk. Using those first guidelines, the detection rate of CDH1 mutations was approximately 40% in individuals fulfilling the clinical criteria. However, the guidelines were subsequently revised given that CDH1 germline mutations were also identified in individuals who did not meet testing criteria. Hansford and colleagues reported that in individuals meeting the IGCLC 2010 criteria and with CDH1 germline mutation, the cumulative lifetime GC risk at 80 years of age was 70% (95% CI, 59-80%) for males and 56% (95% CI, 44-69%) for females, whereas breast cancer lifetime risk for females was 42% (95% CI, 23-68%).\n\n    To date, more than 155 CDH1 mutations affecting the entire coding sequence and functional domains of E-cadherin have been identified in the context of HDGC. Whereas the majority of HDGC patients display CDH1 truncating mutations that induce a deleterious effect and are thus a bona fide DGC cause, around 20% harbor mutations of the missense type, which represent a major clinical challenge Indeed, missense variants are difficult to assess phenotypically, thus leading to critical issues concerning genetic counseling and clinical management. Further, their incomplete penetrance masks their identification and classification, contributing to variant dissemination among populations. Importantly, failure to incorporate information and ascertain pathogenicity of missense variants perpetuates misestimating of CDH1 penetrance and the diagnostic dilemma surrounding affected families. In an era of high-throughput genome sequencing and multiplex gene panel testing, this problem is becoming unwieldy with the identification of an increasing number of variants of unknown significance (VUS), not only in disease but also in individuals without family history of gastric cancer This, along with the fact that the majority of cancer screening programs do not recommend CDH1 testing in the absence of specific clinical criteria, urges the need to streamline CDH1 screening. More so, there is a lack of systematic results regarding CDH1 genetic screening across countries, creating a void in terms of mutation geographic distribution. This has prompted us to perform a comprehensive evaluation of germline mutations associated to HDGC, which may explain the large variability in GC epidemiology and provide insights to define priorities for effective screening and improved management.",
        "Methods": "    Accuracy of this systematic review was assessed using the checklist of items in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. In particular, we organized this review as following: (a) Identification: to assess the CDH1 germline mutation frequency in the world; (b) Screening: to search all identified CDH1 germline mutations in DGC patients and in asymptomatic carriers; (c) Eligibility: to include all data reported in an accessible source bank (the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database); (d) Inclusion: to analyze the obtained results with a study of frequencies (Figure 1).\n\n    We revised all CDH1 germline mutations reported in MEDLINE from 1998 to November 2019, including original reports and literature reviews edited in English language. For search of available literature, the following terms were used: E-cadherin; CDH1 gene; germline mutation; genetic screening; HDGC; IGCLC; familial GC; diffuse histotype; Maori kindred; and prophylactic gastrectomy.\n\n    The analysis was limited to studies involving subjects affected by HDGC, early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC), and unselected GC patients screened for CDH1 germline mutations, in which at least one likely pathogenic, VUS or pathogenic CDH1 variant was identified. These studies were subsequently categorized into three categories: series study, family study and unknown study, depending on whether or not they fulfilled clinical criteria for genetic testing.\n\n    The series study group included 31 studies from populations screened for CDH1 germline mutations, comprising only individuals affected by GC. The authors analysed a consecutive series of GC population, but members of these individuals were not screened. Patients were grouped according to the inclusion of clinical criteria established by the IGCLC: no criteria GC patients (11 studies); patients fulfilling HDGC criteria (15 studies); and early onset GC patients (five studies). The early onset GC subset encompassed cases of sporadic GC with age at diagnosis of less than 45 years old. In the series study only individuals affected by GC were analysed for CDH1 germline mutations.\n\n    The family study group comprised 36 studies of families strictly fulfilling the IGCLC criteria. In those studies, genetic screening was performed both in GC patients and asymptomatic individuals.\n\n    Finally, the unknown study group (five studies) included individuals for whom familial information regarding cancer phenotypes is lacking.\n\n    For the series study group, information on country of origin (or ethnicity, when origin was not available), type of mutation, ClinVar/LOVD classification, total number of subjects screened for CDH1 mutations and total number of CDH1 mutation carriers was retrieved (Table S1). When available, mean age of all subjects screened for CDH1 mutations and mean age of CDH1 mutation carriers was calculated.\n\n    For the family study articles, we collected data on country (or ethnicity), mutation type and classification, age of proband, total number of screened subjects harbouring CDH1 mutations, number of carriers affected by gastric cancer, and number of carriers affected by other cancer types (Table S2). Mean age of CDH1 mutation carriers affected by gastric cancer and mean age of carriers affected by other cancer types was also determined.\n\n    In the unknown study, we have explored data on country of origin (or ethnicity), as well as mutation type and classification (Table S3).\n\n    Descriptive statistics (absolute and relative frequencies) are presented to describe frequencies of CDH1 mutations and total number of CDH1 mutation carriers by type of study design and countries and differences in frequencies are compared with Chi-square tests. All tests were two-sided and statistical significance was set at p-value < 0.05.\n\n    The potential effect of CDH1 missense variants was scored considering ClinVar variant interpretation (available at  accessed on 6 November 2020), in silico predictions and functional in vitro assays. Variants that were not submitted to ClinVar were investigated at LOVD database ( accessed on 6 November 2020). For in silico prediction of variant pathogenicity, scores from 20 algorithms were retrieved from Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) web interface ( accessed on 6 November 2020), using GRCh37 assembly and CDH1 gene (localization GRCh37:CM000678.1). Scores evaluated include CADD, DANN, Eigen-PC, FATHMM, GERP++, LRT, M-CAP, MetaLR, MetaSVM, MutPred, MutationAssessor, MutationTaster, PROVEAN, Polyphen2_HDIV, Polyphen2_HVAR, REVEL, SIFT, SiPhy_29way_logOdds, fathmm-MKL and phyloP100way_vertebrate. Ranked scores (varying from 0 to 1) were selected to allow a normalization of scales across predictive tools. Subsequently, ranked scores were averaged to provide a single and unbiased value combining the distinct methodological approaches of each in silico tool. Published data from in vitro functional tests, including aggregation and matrigel invasion assays, were collected. Variant score was attributed as following: Benign/Retains function/Tolerated is represented as ---; Pathogenic/Loss of function/Damaging as +++; Likely pathogenic/Possibly damaging as ++/-; Likely benign/Possibly tolerated as +/--; VUS/Inconclusive as +/-; and Not submitted/Not studied as 0. The percentage of + frequency was calculated and variants with values > 50% were considered relevant, whereas variants below 50% were considered not relevant. Variants with + frequency of 50% were categorized as undetermined.",
        "Results": "    To perform a comprehensive analysis of CDH1 alterations and their correlation with GC incidence, we have first collected and assembled reports into series study, family study and unknown study groups, according to the compliance or not of HDGC criteria for CDH1 genetic screening. Among the series study group, a total of 2.547 primary GCs were screened for CDH1 germline mutations, identifying 187 germline alterations (7.2%). Specifically, 52 (4.2%) CDH1 mutations were identified in 1.224 GC patients from no criteria studies, 113 in 653 (17.3%) GCs from HDGC criteria studies, and 22 in 670 (3.2%) early onset GCs. Regarding the mutation type, we have identified nine deletions, one insertion, 29 missense, three non-sense and 10 splice site mutations in no criteria studies. In HDGC criteria studies, we have detected 36 deletions, nine insertions, 19 missense, 31 non-sense and 18 splice site alterations. Finally, in early onset GCs, the distribution was as following: one deletion, zero insertions, six missense (27.3%), two non-sense and 13 splice sites (Table S1).\n\n    In the family study group, 356 CDH1 germline mutations were detected, including 225 in patients affected by GC (63.2%) and 131 in asymptomatic carriers (36.8%). The mean age of proband affected by primary GC (CDH1 mutation positive) was 38.4 years old, and 40.1 in the remaining GC patients identified as carriers of CDH1 mutations. Additionally, 20 CDH1 alterations were identified in patients diagnosed with other primary cancers, namely 10 mutations in breast (mean age at diagnosis 49.6 years old), six in colon (mean age at diagnosis 51.1 years old), two in abdominal carcinomatosis, one in tongue, and one in prostate cancer.\n\n    Interestingly, regarding missense mutations, the GC probands displayed a mean age of 36.9 years old, and within a total of 71 alterations identified, 30 (42.3%) were found in asymptomatic carriers. In the non-missense mutation group, the mean age of the GC proband was 38.8 years old, and 101 (101/285, 35.4%) were GC-negative (Table S2).\n\n    In the unknown study group we identified a total of 20 CDH1 germline mutations (Table S3).\n\n    A total of 563 CDH1 germline mutations were identified, with the vast majority detected in the family study group (356/563, 63%). Type of mutation is significantly associated with study groups (p = 0.05). In the series study group 187 (33.2%) mutations were registered, whereas only 20 (3.6%) mutations were reported in the unknown study group (Table 1). Overall, missense variants represent 23.3% of the cases, followed by deletions (22.6%), non-sense (22.2%), and splice-site alterations (21.5%). Insertions are less frequently described, constituting 10.3% of all CDH1 mutations. However, the relative frequency of mutation types varies across the different study groups (Figure 2). In particular, in the family study group, non-sense mutations represent the most frequently identified alterations (23.9%), with deletions and splice-site alterations accounting for 21.6% each. In the series study and unknown study groups, missense variants comprise the largest subsetting, reaching respectively 28.9% and 30%, in contrast to the 19.9% observed in the family study group. Deletions are the second most frequent mutation type detected in both the series and unknown studies groups (24.6% and 20.0%, respectively). Non-sense variants are found in 19.3% of carriers included in the series study group and in 20% of cases from the unknown group.\n\n    These results suggest that different mutation types may reflect distinct GC management and surveillance programs. More so, it is not surprising that truncating mutations (non-sense, deletions and splice-site) are promptly diagnosed given their severe and possibly more penetrant effect. In contrast, missense variants may retain residual E-cadherin activity, producing less striking familiar cancer aggregation and, consequently, impairing their predictive value as drivers of HDGC.\n\n    Given that prevalence of gastric cancer is not homogenous worldwide, we next evaluated the geographical distribution of mutations collected in the series and family studies groups. For this purpose, we grouped mutations with known country of origin by continent. The unknown study group was not included in this analysis since we lacked information on country of origin in 55% of alterations, and the remaining mutations were collected from only three reports, which could potentially result in a bias. In the series study group, we verified that 45.5% (71/156) of alterations were detected in individuals from European origin, with lower percentages identified in Asian and American individuals (26.3 and 16.0%, respectively), as well as in Oceania (11.5%). Remarkably, we verified that the predominant mutation type varies across geographical regions. As depicted in Figure 3A, deletions are more frequent in Europe (34%), splice-site in America (48%), missense in Asia (68%), and non-sense in Oceania (78%). The high prevalence of missense mutations in Asia is mainly attributed to Korean and Japanese populations.\n\n    Despite obvious differences in the number of mutations reported in each setting (series or family study), we demonstrate that, in the family study context, 51.9% (150/289) of mutations are of European origin, 26.6% (77/289) of American, 15.6% (45/289) of Oceania and 5.9% (17/289) of Asian origins. In this group, a distinct distribution pattern of mutation classes was also observed worldwide (Figure 3B). Deletions (33%) and missense (33%) alterations are the most common alteration type in Europe, non-sense in America (69%), deletions in Asia (47%), and splice-site in Oceania (87%). A striking difference was found in Europe, where the relative frequency of splice-site alterations decreases from series to family studies, while the missense category increases. Likewise, in the American continent, splice-site alterations decrease from 48% in the series study group to 10% in the family group, which in turn depicts a substantial increase of non-sense mutations. The opposite effect is verified in Oceania: splice-site alterations, that were not identified in the series study, appear in 87% of the family study subjects; whereas the non-sense relative frequency decreases from 78% to 4%. Another difference is detected at the Asian region and involves missense variants, where a very high frequency of these variants (78%) occurs in the series study but not in the family study group. This could be a result of low penetrance of missense variants, in turn leading to their underestimation and, consequently, segregation within populations. We observe that, along with other host genetic and environmental factors, CDH1 missense variants are associated to the high incidence of gastric cancer in Asian populations.\n\n    To further evaluate the impact of CDH1 missense variants and establish potential associations with population distribution, we have collected data from ClinVar classification, as well as from in vitro experimental evidence and in silico predictions, which are currently not considered by the ACMG/AMP variant curation guidelines.\n\n    From the 42 missense variants gathered, 14 (33%) were classified by ClinVar as VUS. However, upon application of a combined score system, we unveiled useful information for a possible categorization in 13 out of the 14 variants (Table 2). Overall, we have categorized 41 (out of 42) missense variants: 15 as not relevant and 26 as relevant variants. With this approach, we were able to provide insights on the relevance of variants that would remain unclassified or are classified disregarding in vitro and in silico data, according to just ClinVar criteria. Unfortunately, no in vitro studies were published concerning the effect of 14 missense variants, impairing a more accurate grading.\n\n    Having established a comprehensive score for missense variant categorization, we next investigated its significance on the different geographical areas and study groups. As observed in Figure 4, with the exception of 1 variant, missense alterations reported in the family study group (59/60) were considered relevant.\n\n    A very distinct situation was observed in the series study context, particularly, in those variants identified in American and Asian individuals. In fact, all variants with American origin were scored as not relevant, and from those reported in Asia (n = 28), 15 were relevant and 13 were categorized as non-relevant.\n\n    Within the series study group, missense mutations occur as sparse events in countries with low-incidence for GC, such as USA, New Zealand, France, Canada, and UK, but are frequent in Korea, Japan, China and Italy, which are high-incidence countries (9% vs. 51% respectively, p-value < 0.001 Chi-square test)\n\n    Overall, it is clear that selection based upon family criteria identifies individuals carrying mutations with clinical relevance. On the other hand, unbiased screening may lead to an over selection of individuals harboring CDH1 variants that, certainly, do not award increased risk of developing gastric cancer.",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CDH1 mutations are more frequently identified in countries with low-incidence for GC, and that the application of criteria for genetic screening is critical for a higher detection rate, as well as for the identification of mutations with proven clinical relevance. This systematic analysis clearly corroborates that following guidelines for screening and surveillance of patients at high risk has the potential to diagnose and treat GC at an earlier stage, improving survival rates. In the absence of clinical criteria and of familial genotype-phenotype correlation, detection of a CDH1 mutation imposes a clinical management issue given that the consensual risk-reducing recommendation regarding DGC is a radical and life-changing gastrectomy. It is our recommendation that those individuals should be closely monitored through an intense surveillance program, which should both contribute to early diagnosis and to enlighten disease etiology.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    GC remains one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality, despite reported significant declines over the past 50 years. Not surprisingly, decreased GC mortality has been largely associated to a trending decrease in incidence. Progress in survival rates over the past few decades has been limited to western countries, with overall five-year survival around or below 30%. Strikingly, in Japan and Korea, historically high incidence countries, five-year survival is now over 60%, which has been attributed to their extensive screening and early diagnosis programs.\n\n    Family history also accounts for GC incidence variations worldwide, with rates ranging from 2.8% in Sweden to 36.6% in Japan. Identification of germline inactivating mutations of E-cadherin were the first evidence of a clear molecular basis for familial GC susceptibility. The association of germline CDH1 mutations and HDGC predisposition was a breakthrough that sparked the establishment of specific guidelines for genetic screening and surveillance of patients who are at high risk of developing GC However, current CDH1 genetic testing guidelines neglect worldwide distribution of variants, in part because such information has not been carefully curated. Furthermore, identification of unexpected CDH1 due to the increasing use of multigene panels poses a challenge in GC management. As such, we found it crucial to compile a systematic review encompassing all reports of CDH1 variants described in GC patients and analyze mutation profiles and worldwide incidence with respect to implementation of HDGC clinical criteria for genetic testing. Information about family history for GC remains fundamental to plan a genetic test and to adopt strategic intervention aiming to reduce the GC risk in asymptomatic individuals.\n\n    In accord with some recent literature data, we observed that the cumulative incidence of GC within CDH1 germline mutations is decreasing. Xicola et al. reported that the overall cumulative risk of GC by age 80 in families with at least one GC was about 37% among men and 24% among women. Also, Roberts described that the cumulative incidence of GC at age 80 years was 42% (95% CI, 30-56%) for men and 33% (95% CI, 21-43%) for women with pathogenic variants in CDH1. Both studies were a review of already published families, and not original analysis, as reported in Hansford et al..\n\n    A key finding of this review is that, overall, screened GC patients depicted a low frequency of CDH1 germline mutations (about 7% in 2587 GCs). Importantly, the probability to identify a CDH1 mutation with clinical relevance increased when individuals were selected based upon clinical criteria for HDGC screening (17.3% in cases fulfilling HDGC criteria vs. 4% in unselected cases).\n\n    According to our analysis, overall GC frequency with familial clustering was 23.9% vs. 11.9 in high- and low-risk areas, respectively. Interestingly, we could determine that the frequency of CDH1 germline mutations is not directly related with the incidence of familial gastric carcinoma. In fact, in the family study group, we could observe a high number of mutations detected in North America and a lower number in Asia. In support of these results, other studies have proposed that in high-risk areas, aggregation of GC cases is probably associated with environmental and cultural factors, including dietary habits. Further, other reports describe that genetic factors, such as CDH1 germline alterations, are rarely identified in high-risk areas. Nonetheless, it should not be disregarded that these outcomes may reflect distinct resources and screening programs across countries. Geographical variability represents a risk factor for gastric carcinoma. We verified in this study that CDH1 germline mutations in GC middle/high-risk area are rather rarely identified respecting to low-risk area; and in middle/high-risk area the probability to perform a CDH1 genetic screening with negative result is high enough, in which maybe operates environmental factors. Diet and high consumption of specific foods are associated positively with GC risk, in particular with the intestinal sub-type.\n\n    Regarding mutation type, we determined that missense, deletions, non-sense and splice-site alterations present similar overall frequencies (23.3-21.5%). More so, mean age at GC diagnosis was similar in carriers of both missense and truncating CDH1 mutations. However, 42% of missense mutation carriers were asymptomatic, whereas a lower percentage of truncating mutation carriers (35%) was unaffected by GC. This can be partly due to the lower penetrance of missense mutations as a result of residual activity retained by these E-cadherin molecules encompassing an amino acid substitution. The pleiotropic effect of CDH1 mutations can also play a role in this context. Recent evidence has emerged demonstrating that CDH1 mutations may result in lobular breast cancer and in several congenital abnormalities, without personal or family history of GC. Unfortunately, incorporation of information regarding clinical history of missense mutation carriers remains scarce hampering ascertainment of missense mutation pathogenicity and perpetuating the diagnostic dilemma surrounding affected families.\n\n    Within the series study group, missense mutations occur as sparse events in countries with low-incidence for GC, such as USA, New Zealand, France, Canada, and UK, but are frequent in Korea, Japan and Italy, which are high-incidence countries. This suggests that missense mutations exert a less aggressive effect in family phenotypic genealogy, consequently leading to their concealment and segregation at very low frequencies in the general population. It is of note that evaluation of putative relevance of missense mutations revealed that only 53% of those reported in Asia are clinically different. In America, the impact of mutation categorization was even more striking with 100% of mutations scored as not relevant. In the family study population, we verified that the contribution of non-sense, deletions and splice-site alterations is indisputable, despite the huge difference in the type of mutations across continents. In this context, the frequency of missense mutations varies from 2% in Oceania to 33% in Europe. Noteworthy, in 98% of these cases, a relevant effect was estimated.\n\n    This study presents a limitation in the method that should be considered. The CDH1 germline mutation frequency could be affected by research activity, as publication bias or access to medical care, considering that some CDH1 mutations could be unpublished in MEDLINE. However, MEDLINE is the unique search engine in which we can access easily and freely and unfortunately, we do not have access in confidential as well in unpublished data. This bias should be very small, because we carefully collected all CDH1 mutations recorded in MEDLINE, and all collected data were revised from four independent Authors.",

        "Title": "    Diversity of Mycotoxins Produced by Fusarium Strains Infecting Weeds",
        "Abstract": "    Although Fusarium is mainly known as an agricultural pathogen that affects monocotyledonous plants, it can also infect different species of weeds in the agricultural environment, thereby contributing to the production of mycotoxins in cereals. In this study, we present new developmental data on the diversity of mycotoxins produced by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium avenaceum strains from weeds under field conditions. Regarding the potential for the strain dependence of mycotoxin production, this study demonstrated that all F. graminearum strains isolated from weeds and spring wheat showed high potential for deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON), and nivalenol (NIV) production in spring wheat under field conditions. It was determined that F. graminearum is a typical producer of B-type trichothecenes. All strains of F. avenaceum isolated from spring wheat and weeds have the potential to produce enniatins and moniliformin in spring wheat. Each type of weed can host different Fusarium species and strains that produce completely different mycotoxins. Therefore, the distribution of mycotoxins in spring wheat grain may depend more on the Fusarium species or strains that infect the weeds than on the pathogen's host plant species. The predominance of specific mycotoxins in cereals depends on the year's weather conditions and the diversity of Fusarium species present in the field.",
        "Introduction": "    Fusarium spp. are considered to be among the pathogens that pose the greatest risk to crops and other plants due to the high economic losses incurred in terms of yield reductions and the risk of mycotoxin production. One of the characteristics of the Fusarium species' Fusarium head blight (FHB) is represented by their ability to biosynthesize various mycotoxins. The primary sources of FHB infection may include crop residues left in a field from the previous season. In recent years, weeds have also been perceived as reservoirs of fungal spores and sources of disease infection, as they emerge together with a crop during the growing season and many of them are resistant to herbicides. Weeds can grow over several field seasons and provide a habitat for the overwintering and survival of Fusarium species. Fusarium fungi produce many types of mycotoxins, the distribution of which also varies. Fusarium graminearum is considered to be the most important causal agent of FHB in wheat in many regions, and it is locally dominant and can occur and develop in some hosts.\n\n    Fusarium avenaceum is widespread worldwide, well-adapted to cold regions such as Northern Europe and Canada, and is the main causal agent of FHB. F. avenaceum has also been reported as a common saprophyte and pathogen in warmer regions, but the emergence of competing species may limit the distribution of this species and its related mycotoxins.\n\n    The current discourse revolves around the emergence of Fusarium mycotoxins, which can now be detected at considerable levels in crops worldwide due to alterations in climate and fungal biota. The main members of this group are enniatins (ENN), beauvericin (BEA), and moniliformin (MON).\n\n    Enniatins have been reported in Europe as contaminants of wheat, rye, oats, barley, and sorghum, with F. avenaceum as the predominant species in the cereal grains where enniatins are detected. F. avenaceum is a prevalent plant pathogen and soil saprophyte with a wide host range.\n\n    As of now, there are no regulatory thresholds in place for MON. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has indicated that additional studies on its toxicity are necessary and has recommended the gathering of further data on the prevalence of MON. The detection of MON contamination in cereals from both Scandinavian and Southern European countries indicates that it can be synthesized by various Fusarium species under diverse climatic conditions.\n\n    Regrettably, our understanding of the bioavailability and production of numerous lesser-known mycotoxins, such as the extensive enniatin family, remains limited. In this study, we present occurrence data for mycotoxin production under field conditions in spring wheat that was spray-inoculated with F. graminearum and F. avenaceum strains from weeds.",
        "Methods": "    From 2015 to 2016, asymptomatic weeds were collected in fields situated in Central Lithuania (55 23'50'' N, 23 51'40'' E) and F. graminearum and F. avenaceum strains were isolated. An inoculation procedure was conducted on heads of the spring wheat cultivar 'KWS Chamsin' in 2019 at the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry in experimental fields. During mid-flowering, the main Fusarium pathogens responsible for Fusarium head blight (FHB), including F. avenaceum and F. graminearum, were isolated from the internal tissues of asymptomatic weeds and were used to inoculate the ears of spring wheat.\n\n    A total of 12 F. graminearum and 12 F. avenaceum strains were isolated, comprising 10 F. graminearum and 10 F. avenaceum strains from asymptomatic weeds (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Fallopia convolvulus, Poa annua, Tripleurospermum inodorum, and Viola arvensis), 2 F. graminearum from the primary host plant spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), and 2 F. avenaceum from the primary host plant spring wheat (Triticum aestivum). Under field conditions, these strains were evaluated for their capacity to produce mycotoxins in grains of spring wheat. A total of 25 treatments were tested in four replicates. The control samples were inoculated with sterile distilled water. The study scheme is presented in Table 2. The wheat head inoculation procedure was carried out following the methodology described in prior research studies.\n\n    We used 50 mL polypropylene (PP) tubes to extract the ground samples, which weighed 2.50 +- 0.01 g, with a mixture of deionized water (10 mL), acetonitrile (10 mL), and formic acid (20 microL) on a mechanical shaker for 10 min. Following the addition of the QuEChERS salt mixture, the samples were shaken for 10 min on a mechanical shaker, then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm at room temperature. The supernatants were transferred to 15 mL PP tubes, which were then placed in an ultra-low temperature freezer for 15 min at -80  C. After removal from the freezer, the tubes were immediately centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 10 min at a temperature of 10  C.\n\n    We used 15 mL PP tubes to transfer 3 mL portions of the extracts, which were then evaporated to dryness under a slow nitrogen stream at 50  C. After evaporation, 100 muL of a 0.1% solution of formic acid in acetonitrile: water (1:1) was added to the samples, which were shaken on a Vortex mixer. Subsequently, 250 microL of a 0.1% aqueous formic acid solution was added. Then, 0.22 microm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (PVDF) were used to filter the extracts and then they were centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature at 3000 rpm. Matrix-match calibration was used for quantification. A blank sample extract was used as the matrix component. For samples with mycotoxin concentrations exceeding the highest calibration level, the sample preparations were repeated, but instead of evaporation, the extracts were diluted and quantified using external solution calibration.\n\n    In the case of MON, after sample freezing and centrifugation, a 1 mL aliquot was taken and evaporated. The residue that was dried was then dissolved again in 100 muL of acetonitrile.\n\n    An HPLC analysis was conducted using an UltiMate 3000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantiva MS/MS detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Separation was carried out on a Phenomenex Luna C18 reversed-phase analytical column (150 x 2.0 mm, 3 microm) for the toxins DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, NIV, NEO, T-2, HT-2, ZEA, ENN A, ENN A1, ENN B, and ENN B1, and a Phenomenex Luna HILIC analytical column (100 x 3.0 mm, 3 microm) was used for MON. The autosampler was set at 4  C and the column temperature was set at 40  C. The sample injection volume was 25 microL for DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, NIV, NEO, T-2, HT-2, ZEA, ENN A, ENN A1, ENN B, and ENN B1, and 5 microL for MON. Ion monitoring was conducted in both positive and negative ion modes using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) (Table 3). The instrument settings included a spray voltage of 3.5 kV (positive ion mode) and 2.5 kV (negative ion mode), a vaporizer temperature of 350  C, an ion transfer temperature of 300  C, sheath gas at 55 arbitrary units (arb), auxiliary gas at 25 arb, and sweep gas at 5 arb. Data processing was performed with TraceFinder and Xcalibur  software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The composition of Phase A was 0.1% formic acid and 0.5 mM ammonium acetate in water, while Phase B was composed of 0.1% formic acid and 0.5 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile.\n\n    To evaluate the linearity, the standard mycotoxin mixtures were spiked into blanks to create five-point calibration curves. The least-squares regression method was used to calculate the slope and determination coefficients (R2) of the calibration curves, which were considered a good fit if they were equal to or greater than 0.99. For quality control purposes, the blank samples were spiked with mycotoxin standards at the following concentration levels: 10, 50, and 100 microg kg-1 for DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, NIV, NEO, T-2, HT-2, ZEA, and the enniatins (A, A1, B, and B1) and 100 and 800 microg kg-1 for MON. Standard deviations (Sn) were obtained from 6 replicates of the spiked samples at the lowest (10 microg/kg) validated levels for each compound. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) levels were obtained during the validation procedure, and the following formulas were used for the calculations: LOD = 3.3   Sn (6), LOQ = 10   Sn (6).\n\n    Table 3 displays the results of the method validation, which included the analysis of five replicates at each of the three spiking levels to validate the precision and accuracy of the method.\n\n    In Lithuania, the prevailing meteorological conditions are conducive to the growth of Fusarium fungi, which cause plant diseases and produce mycotoxins, leading to significant damage. On 17 June 2019, spring wheat heads were inoculated with F. graminearum and F. avenaceum isolated from weeds. Meteorological data were taken from the central Lithuania meteorological station (55 23'49'' N, 23 51'55'' E, Kedainiai district). The year 2019 had high humidity and warm temperatures during the wheat flowering and seed filling stages, which led to an elevated risk of Fusarium head blight (FHB) and subsequent mycotoxin production in harvested grains. More detailed information on meteorological conditions is available in the study by Matelioniene et al..\n\n    Statistical analysis was performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 to ensure data reliability. The data scatter and differences between data averages were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) package, and significant differences between the two samples were determined using Duncan's criterion. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Results": "    In this study, specific mycotoxins were detected in between 0% and 100% of spring wheat samples. In some cases, the grains were contaminated with more than one mycotoxin. The predominant mycotoxins detected from the samples field-inoculated with the F. avenaceum strains were enniatin B (ENN B) (100%), enniatin B1 (ENN B1) (100%), moniliformin (MON) (100%), enniatin A (ENN A) (98%), and enniatin A1 (ENN A1) (67%) (Table 1). The predominant mycotoxins detected in the samples field-inoculated with the F. graminearum strains were deoxynivalenol (DON) (100%), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON) (100%), 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON) (84%), and nivalenol (NIV) (96%). The concentration range of these mycotoxins is presented in Table 1. We note that the highest recorded concentrations of DON exceeded 84,000 microg kg-1, which was 67 times higher than the regulatory limit.\n\n    Of the 24 strains tested for mycotoxin production, 12 were F. avenaceum strains and 12 were F. graminearum strains. In spring wheat inoculated with F. graminearum, DON was produced by all strains at high concentrations (31,849 microg kg-1, on average). In wheat inoculated with F. avenaceum strains, DON was detected at low levels (89 microg kg-1, on average). All 12 strains of F. graminearum also produced 3-ADON (334 microg kg-1, on average) and NIV (up to 39 microg kg-1). Furthermore, 15-ADON was produced by 10 of the 12 F. graminearum strains (average of 1192 microg kg-1 among the positive samples) and zearalenone (ZEA) was produced by 9 of the 12 F. graminearum strains (up to 28 microg kg-1). ENN B was detected in 2 of the 12 wheat samples inoculated with F. graminearum (up to 39 microg kg-1), and ENN B1 was found in 4 of the 12 samples inoculated with F. graminearum (up to 44 microg kg-1).\n\n    All 12 strains of F. avenaceum produced ENN A, ENN B, ENN B1, and MON, with average concentrations among the positive samples of 23, 585, 299, and 470 microg kg-1, respectively. Eight of the twelve F. avenaceum strains produced ENN A1 (up to 17 microg kg-1). Traces of the HT-2 toxin were also detected in 6 of the 12 samples inoculated with F. avenaceum (up to 23 microg kg-1) and in 4 of the 12 samples inoculated with F. graminearum (up to 20 microg kg-1).\n\n    Regarding the capacity for mycotoxin synthesis, all strains of F. graminearum that were obtained from weeds and spring wheat were determined to have the potential to produce trichothecenes, including DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, and NIV in spring wheat. Figure 1 shows the sum of the trichothecene production potential and concentrations in comparison to that of the water control sample. Statistically significant amounts of trichothecenes were produced by all F. graminearum strains isolated from weeds compared to the control. Spring wheat (SW-6K4V1) strains produced the highest combined concentrations of DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, and NIV. Among all strains, only one of the wild buckwheat (WB-144r) and one of the field pansy (FP-541s) samples did not produce 15-ADON in spring wheat. The spring wheat strain SW-6K4V1 produced the highest concentration of 15-ADON. The wild buckwheat strain WB-144r produced the highest concentration of 3-ADON. The most prominent producers of NIV were the strains isolated from spring wheat. All strains produced DON at particularly high concentrations. The spring wheat strain SW-6K4V1 produced the highest concentration of DON. We did not find statistical differences between the strains from the same host plants.\n\n    The investigation discovered that all the strains of F. avenaceum that were isolated from weeds and spring wheat had the potential to generate enniatins and moniliformin in spring wheat, with the potential for mycotoxin synthesis varying by strain. Figure 2 shows the production potential for the sum of the ENNs and MON found and the observed concentrations in comparison with the control sample. Compared to the control, statistically significant amounts of ENNs and MON were produced by the F. avenaceum strains isolated from weeds (two strains) and spring wheat (one strain). One spring wheat strain (SW-G1) produced the highest concentration of the sum of ENN A, ENN A1, ENN B, ENN B1, and MON.\n\n    All the strains isolated from F. avenaceum produced ENN A. The spring wheat strain SW-G1 produced the highest concentration of ENN A. The shepherd's purse strain SP-1149s produced the lowest concentration of this mycotoxin group.\n\n    One strain of shepherd's purse (SP-1149s), one of meadow grass (MG-1128f), one of wild buckwheat (WB-1178fl), and one of spring wheat (SW-TG5) did not produce ENN A1 in spring wheat. The spring wheat strain SW-G1 produced the highest concentration of ENN A. Although the ENN A concentrations were very low, they were detected in many samples.\n\n    In our study, all the F. avenaceum strains also produced ENN B and ENN B1. The meadow grass strain MG-1126s produced the highest concentration of ENN B. The wild buckwheat strain WB-1178fl produced the lowest concentration of this mycotoxin group. The higher ENN B producers were the strains isolated from meadow grass (MG-1126s) and spring wheat (SW-G1).\n\n    Remarkably, the meadow grass strains showed statistical differences between strains from the same host plants. We did not find statistical differences between the other strains from the same host plants.\n\n    Among the samples inoculated with the F. avenaceum strains in the field, enniatin B was the toxin found in the highest quantity, while ENN B1, ENN A, and ENN A1 followed in descending order. The samples inoculated with the F. avenaceum strain isolated from scentless false mayweed (SFM-1118c) exhibited greater concentrations of MON compared to the control.\n\n    In this study, we found that ENN A and ENN B1 co-occurred with DON in the wheat samples field-inoculated with the F. avenaceum strains.\n\n    Zearalenone (ZEA), neosolaniol (NEO), T-2, and HT-2 were not detected at all or were present at trace concentrations, mostly below the limit of detection (<LOD), in all tested samples.\n\n    The concentrations of the different mycotoxins were evaluated for their correlation using Pearson correlation tests. The correlation between moniliformin and the enniatins was examined, resulting in Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.63 for the associations between ENN BENN B1 and MON, respectively. The correlation coefficient 0.65 was calculated for the correlation between MON and ENN B1. The correlation between deoxynivalenol, the enniatins, and moniliform was also investigated. The correlation coefficients -0.38, -0.49, and -0.50 were calculated for the correlations between DON and MON, ENN B, and ENN B1, respectively. The correlation coefficient -0.50 was calculated for the correlation between DON and the sum of the enniatins (A, A1, B, and B1).",
        "Conclusion": "    This study has revealed that different species and strains of Fusarium can occur in the same weed or other host plants, producing completely different mycotoxins. Therefore, the distribution of mycotoxins in spring wheat grain may depend more on the Fusarium species and strains that infect weeds than on the pathogen's host plant species.\n\n    Some Fusarium avenaceum strains from weeds may have more potential for MON production than those from spring wheat.\n\n    The specific mycotoxin types dominating in cereals depend on the year's climatic conditions and the diversity of Fusarium species present in the field environment. If the climatic conditions are favorable for F. avenaceum, more enniatins and moniliformin are likely to be produced. If the climatic conditions are more favorable for F. graminearum, then more trichothecenes B will be produced.\n\n    In integrated pathogen control, weed control should be a key focus, as weeds may not show disease symptoms but may be a potential source of Fusarium infections in spring wheat. This leads to reductions in grain yield and grain quality and a high risk of mycotoxins in the grain. In the future, attention should be paid not only to the regulated mycotoxins but also to newly emerging modified mycotoxins, the occurrence of which may be influenced by the presence of weeds in crops.",
        "Discussion": "    This study compared the mycotoxin contamination potential among various Fusarium species obtained from different host plant groups, including weeds and Triticum. Previous data have indicated that Fusarium isolates from various host plants can produce FHB disease with differing severity. Weeds often become a source of pathogens when there are no significant host plants nearby. It is known that F. graminearum strains from alternative host plants are potential producers of trichothecenes. In previous research by Krnjaja et al., a quantitative analysis indicated a significant potential for producing DON among the identified strains isolated from Triticum at amounts that exceeded 20,000 microg kg-1. In our study, various F. graminearum strains isolated from weeds and Triticum also were characterized as having high toxigenic potential towards the production of trichothecenes. Various F. graminearum strains isolated from weeds produced DON at average levels of more than 29,000 microg kg-1. F. graminearum strains isolated from spring wheat produced DON with an average concentration of more than 45,000 microg kg-1. Stankovic et al. found significant levels of DON in F. graminearum strains isolated from wheat grains collected from different regions in Serbia. Their study showed that the high levels of DON, ranging from 160 to 45,260 microg kg-1, varied depending on the region. Obradovic et al. reported wheat samples with high DON levels ranging from 23,800 to 88,700 microg kg-1. According to Gerling et al., the highest levels of DON and ZEN mycotoxins were found in the sampling sites closest to the Fusarium spp.-infested grass strips. Other studies have shown that DON and NIV can be detected at relatively low frequencies and concentrations in weed samples. However, in the study by Dong et al., DON and NIV were detected in >50% of the samples, and the concentrations were 1468 and 303 microg kg-1, respectively. NIV was also detected in 96% of the samples in our study, but the maximum concentration was 39 microg kg-1. In addition, in our study, F. graminearum strains isolated from weeds produced significant amounts of 15-ADON, with an average concentration of more than 800 microg kg-1. In contrast, strains isolated from spring wheat produced double the amount of 15-ADON, with an average concentration of more than 1700 microg kg-1. F. graminearum is considered to be the most important causative agent of FHB and the most aggressive producer of DON. Under favorable conditions, it can spread up to 33 m into a wheat field from a source of infection, such as wild grasses or weeds.\n\n    In the few field-inoculated grain samples with F. graminearum strains, ENN B and ENN B1 were detected but not quantified. Moniliformin was not detected in the grain samples field-inoculated with the F. graminearum strains. Jestoi et al. detected MON only in a sample that was contaminated with F. avenaceum.\n\n    In our study, in contrast to F. graminearum, the F. avenaceum strains isolated from weeds and spring wheat produced higher levels of ENNs and MON. Only low levels of DON were detected in the grain samples field-inoculated with F. avenaceum strains, pointing to the significance of wheat infestation with DON producers from the environment. This was also confirmed by the traces of mycotoxins detected in the water control samples.\n\n    Bertuzzi et al. found that the level of MON exceeded that of DON in their study. The co-occurrence of these toxins was observed in 43.7% of the samples, but no significant correlation was established. This led to the assumption that the toxins were produced by different species of Fusarium. In our study, the correlation between the concentrations of DON and MON was also insignificant. These findings corroborated the results of Beccari et al., who investigated the various Fusarium species present in Italian durum wheat and assessed their potential to produce mycotoxins in vitro. Specifically, F. avenaceum strains were found to produce high levels of MON, while F. graminearum strains were predominantly associated with DON production. In a study from France, ENN B was the most frequent (68%) of the total enniatin content, followed by ENN B1 (22%), ENN A1 (7%), and ENN A (3%). In good agreement with our findings, F. avenaceum was the most prolific producer of ENNs, including ENN B (62% of the total enniatin content), followed by ENN B1 (36%), ENN A (2%), and ENN A1 (0%).\n\n    Thus, weed control is crucial for disease prevention in crops, especially pertaining to fungal invasion. Weeds can serve as a source of fungal inoculum and compete with crops for water and nutrients, thereby weakening them and contributing to contamination. Grasses should also be considered as a source of Fusarium infection, especially after rainfall during flowering or when a field is irrigated. Consequently, weed control measures should be consistently implemented.",

        "Title": "    NDUFV1 mutations in complex I deficiency: Case reports and review of symptoms",
        "Abstract": "    Mitochondrial complex I (CI) deficiency is the most common oxidative phosphorylation disorder described. It shows a wide range of phenotypes with poor correlation within genotypes. Herein we expand the clinics and genetics of CI deficiency in the brazilian population by reporting three patients with pathogenic (c.640G>A, c.1268C>T, c.1207dupG) and likely pathogenic (c.766C>T) variants in the NDUFV1 gene. We show the mutation c.766C>T associated with a childhood onset phenotype of hypotonia, muscle weakness, psychomotor regression, lethargy, dysphagia, and strabismus. Additionally, this mutation was found to be associated with headaches and exercise intolerance in adulthood. We also review reported pathogenic variants in NDUFV1 highlighting the wide phenotypic heterogeneity in CI deficiency.",
        "Introduction": "    Dysfunctions in complex I (NADH ubiquinone dehydrogenase) (CI) represents a third of all early-onset mitochondrial disorders and are genetically and clinically diverse. They are caused by mutations in mitochondrial and nuclear genes, with clinical phenotypes ranging from severe lactic acidosis and death in infants to muscle weakness in adults. Five clinical groups were associated with CI deficiency: Leigh syndrome, progressive leukoencephalopathy, neonatal cardiomyopathy, severe infantile lactic acidosis, and a miscellaneous group of unspecified encephalomyopathies. Correlations between genotype and phenotype in mitochondrial diseases are not fully understood and need further exploration\n\n    CI is a protein complex composed of 44 different subunits, seven of which are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the remaining by nuclear DNA (nDNA). CI catalyzes the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the mitochondrial matrix, supplying electrons to complex III via reduction of coenzyme Q. The electron flux through CI sustains the translocation of four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus contributing to the mitochondrial electrochemical potential. CI is also an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, which causes cellular oxidative stress. CI is subdivided into three modules: the electron input (N) module, the electron output (Q) module, and the proton translocations (P) module. The N module is composed of subunits encoded by the genes NDUFV1, NDUFV2, and NDUFS1 . The NDUFV1 gene (NG_013353.1) is located on chromosome 11 and encodes the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase flavoprotein (NM_007103.4), a hydrophilic polypeptide of 51 kDa, which oxidizes NADH and is a major site of ROS production.\n\n    In this report, we presented three patients with mutations in the NDUFV1 gene. The first patient is a compound heterozygous for a missense mutation c.640G>A (p.Glu214Lys) and a frameshift mutation c.1207dupG (p.Asp403Gly*fs), the second is homozygous for a missense mutation c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met), and the third, combining the c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met) and a likely pathogenic variant c.766C>T (p.Arg256Cys).",
        "Methods": "    This work received the approval of the ethical standards committee of the Federal University of Parana (CAAE: 84773818.2.0000.0102).\n\n    Total DNA was extracted from blood using the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, DE). Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was carried out using Illumina  2000 HiSeq with Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V7 for the first two cases, and Nextera  Exome Capture to third, the GRCh37 reference genome and a GATK-based pipeline was used to call, filter and annotate variants. After identification of relevant variants, the region containing each variant was re-sequenced and family segregation was performed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n    The position of the mutations was mapped to the corresponding amino acids in the protein structures of Bos taurus (NM_174808.1) and human (PDB ID: 5XTB). The impact of the mutated amino acids on CI was investigated by visualizing the mutations in the context of the CI structures by using the PyMOL structure viewer.\n\n    MR imaging and MR spectroscopy of the brain were performed with a 1.5-T MR unit (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). T1-weighted images [echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) 11 ms/550 ms], T2-weighted images (TE/TR 93 ms/4000 ms), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (TE/TR/inversion time 110 ms/10000 ms/2250 ms) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) (TE/TR: 105 ms/5200 ms) were performed. Spectroscopic imaging was performed with long (144 ms) and short TE (35 ms).\n\n    The pathogenicity was predict by SNPs&GO, PolyPhen-2 e MutationTaster and allele frequency was searched in Exome Aggregation Consortium (EXAC), 1000genomes, gnomAD AbraOM, TopMed and Kaviar. Association between mutation c.766C>T and symptoms in family members of patient P3 were estimated by Chi-Square test with Monte Carlo simulations by using the R program.",
        "Results": "    Patient P1\n\n    Patient 1 (P1), male, 4 years old, was born by cesarean delivery at 40 weeks of gestation with 3760 g. The mother presented three previous miscarriages (8-, 8- and 12-weeks' gestation) and placenta detachment during P1 pregnancy with indication of resting. The father presented childhood seizures and no consanguinity was reported. P1 had three healthy brothers, two of whom were maternal half-brothers.\n\n    P1 was 3 years old when he presented developmental delay and autistic spectrum disorder and was admitted to the hospital after episodic vomiting and dehydration associated with a cutaneous rash. After treatment P1 developed respiratory insufficiency needing orotracheal intubation. Viral encephalitis was evaluated with negative outcomes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), however empiric treatment with Acyclovir for 14 days showed complete recovery of neurological symptoms, with normal daily activities and no functional impairment. Brain MRI was performed after treatment and showed T2-weighted hyperintense and T1-weighted hypointense focal lesions in central portions of the upper segment of the cervical spinal cord, with additional symmetric lesions in midbrain, pons, and bulb.\n\n    One month later, P1 was admitted to the hospital with prostration, nausea, vomiting and absence seizures, developing a cutaneous rash and apnea after two days. Orotracheal intubation was performed and extubation failure occurred due to the persistency of apnea, therefore, tracheostomy and gastrostomy were performed. Arterial blood gas analysis, blood lactate, blood acylcarnitine's profile, urinary organic acids, and blood amino acid chromatography were normal. The patient continued to have recurrent apneas, but no seizures. A new MRI showed increased hyperintense lesions in T2 and hypointense lesions in T1, affecting the central portions of the upper segment of the cervical spinal cord (Figure 1, P1: A-B). Symmetric lesions also increased when compared with the first MRI, mainly affecting the mesencephalon, pons, medulla oblongata, cerebellum and upper portions of the cervical spinal cord with an elevation of lactate detected by MR spectroscopy (Figure 1, P1: C).\n\n    Based on the hypothesis of mitochondrial disease, treatment was started with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) (300 mg/day) and L-carnitine (100 mg/kg/day). At 4 years old, P1 presented slight clinical improvement with apnea stabilization, progressive drowsiness reduction and progress in wakefulness.\n\n    Patient P2\n\n    Patient 2 (P2), male, 11 years old, was born by cesarean delivery at 38 weeks of gestation with 2470 g, 45 cm height and 33.5 cm head circumference. Pregnancy was uneventful and no symptoms were reported in the first four months of life. The mother was 46 years old when pregnant and presented one previous miscarriage. P2 had a deceased 5 years old sister with a clinical history of seizures, and a healthy older sister. Parents were consanguineous (first degree cousins).\n\n    At 4 months old, P2 presented minor cervical hypotonia and mild right hemibody hypertonia. At 7 years of age, he started to present developmental delay, aggressive behavior, learning difficulties, and motor regression. An organic acid profile in urine showed 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. He was admitted to hospital in the same year due to lethargy alternated with irritability and needed orotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation after apnea. Tracheostomy was performed due to the extubation failure.\n\n    When P2 was 11 years old, he presented optic atrophy, sensorineural deafness, ptosis, hypotonia, hyperreflexia with diplegic spasticity, dysphagia and hyperhidrosis. Similar brain MRI patterns were seen in P2 at the age of 7 (Figure 1, P2: A) and 10 (Figure 1, P2: B) years. The second MRI showed hyperintensity in T2/FLAIR/T2 in the thalamus, lentiform nucleus, frontal lobe, and a lactate peak at spectroscopy (Figure 1, P2: C). Current treatment includes CoQ (300 mg/day), L-carnitine (2 g/day), carbamazepine (17.5 mg/kg/day), biotin (20 mg/day), creatine (2 g/day), clobazam (0.4 mg/kg/day), baclofen (15 mg/day), vitamin C and B complex and P2 is in a stable clinical condition.\n\n    Patient P3\n\n    Patient 3 (P3), female, 3 years old, the younger of two siblings from non-consanguineous parents. The mother had 4 pregnancies, with one miscarriage at 10 weeks. P3 had uneventful perinatal history, she was born at term, and had no clinical symptoms. Neurodevelopment milestones were normal up to 9 months old when she developed progressive hypotonia and somnolence, followed by a gradual loss of motor skills in the following month. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for markers of viral infection. Her sister was healthy, however, her father presented epilepsy in infancy and frequent headaches in adulthood.\n\n    The first diagnostic hypothesis for P3 was acute disseminated encephalitis, showing normal electroencephalogram, diffuse white matter lesions by MRI and a lactate peak on spectroscopy (Figure 1, P3: A-C). Symptoms improved after treatment with methylprednisolone for three days, with an improvement of the symptoms. However, after a week, a gradual clinical decline was observed with lethargy, dysphagia and general hypotonia. After 13 months, a new MRI (not shown) showed increased white matter lesions, suggesting a mitochondrial disorder. An acylcarnitine profile in blood showed increased concentrations of 3-hydroxy-butyrylcarnitine and acetylcarnitine, amino acid chromatography showed increased alanine (656.1, normal 146 - 494 mcmol/L). Lactate levels in plasma ranged from 2.7 to 7.6 (normal <2.2mmol/L) over one year. Lactic acid levels in cerebrospinal fluid were often increased, ranging from 3.5 to 5.3 (normal <0.8mmol/L). Levels of urinary organic acids were normal. Supplementation with CoQ and carnitine was started but with no significative improvement. At 3 years old, P3 lost neurodevelopmental milestones and developed hypotonia, strabismus and severe inappetence. She was submitted to an endoscopic gastrostomy and current treatment was based on supplementation with CoQ, creatine, sodium bicarbonate, acetyl L-carnitine, riboflavin, and biotin.\n\n    P1 revealed the heterozygous mutations c.640G>A (p.Glu214Lys) of maternal inheritance and c.1207dupG (p.Asp403Glyfs*27) from paternal inheritance in NDUFV1 gene. The allele frequency of p.Glu214Lys was not reported, whereas p.Asp403Glyfs*27 shows a frequency of 0.0008% (ExAC and gnomAD) and 0.0004 (TOPMED) in control population, the frameshift mutation causes the premature stop codon of the protein in Asp429.\n\n    The Glu214 residue was highly conserved among bilaterally symmetrical metazoans (Figure 2A) and was positioned in the interface with the subunit NDUFS4 linked by a hydrogen-bonded (Figure 2B). The mutation p.Glu214Lys disrupted the hydrogen bond and likely destabilized the interface with the neighboring subunit, NDUFS4.\n\n    P2 shows the c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met) mutation in homozygosity in the NDUFV1 gene. The highest allele frequency in control population was below 0.01%. The Thr423 residue was highly conserved among bilaterally symmetrical metazoans (Figure 2A) and faces the 4Fe-4S domain of NDUFV1 (Figure 2B). The mutation of threonine to a larger methionine was likely to disturb the assembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster into the protein or to cause dysfunction in the assembled protein.\n\n    WES analysis of P3 identified the compound heterozygous mutations in the NDUFV1 gene, c.766C>T (p.Arg256Cys) and c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met). Analysis of the mutations in the family members showed c.766C>T segregating from the father, and c.1268C>T from the mother (Figure 2C). Five members of the paternal lineage were carriers for c.766C>T. The mutation c.766C>T caused the missense change p.Arg256Cys with no associated clinical conditions. Allele frequency of this variant corresponded to one heterozygous individual (0.00001648%) only and bioinformatic tools predicted this alteration as pathogenic (score 0.99 and 0.87). The amino acid arginine in this position was highly conserved in bilaterally symmetrical metazoans (Figure 2A). Arg256 was localized in the tip of the hydrophilic arm of NDUFV1 subunit and this sidechain was not resolved in the protein structure (Figure 2B). Family carriers for p.Arg256Cys presented frequent headaches and exercise intolerance (Figure 2C) with statistically significant (p-value 0.027) association between frequent headaches and the mutation was found.\n\n    Several studies described mutations in the NDUFV1 gene associated with CI deficiency (Table 1). In this review we found 24 patients with mutations in the NDUFV1 gene, of which 8 were homozygous and 15 were compound heterozygous. The most frequent mutations were c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met) and c.1156C>T (p.Arg386Cys).\n\n    The onset of symptoms ranged from 5 months of age to adulthood. Several common symptoms were described, mainly neuromotor regression, with spasticity, tremors, ataxia, dystonia, seizures, hypotonia, apnea, dysphagia, vomiting, lethargy, ptosis, strabismus, nystagmus, optic atrophy, cognitive decline, autistic behaviors, progressive weakness and exercise intolerance.\n\n    The most common features in MRI were hyperintense lesions in T2 affecting several regions of the brain, white matter changes, brain atrophy, and presence of lactate peak in MR spectroscopy.",
        "Conclusion": "    CI deficiency was associated with many nuclear and mitochondrial genes, and the understanding of the genetics of this mitochondrial disease has expanded significantly in recent years. Here we described three cases of mutations in the NDUFV1 subunit, associated with mitochondrial disease and possibly CI deficiency. The case reports and the review of NDUFV1 mutations showed heterogeneous phenotypes and severity. We propose the association of p.Arg256Cys to frequent headaches in family members of P3. Combination of p.Thr423Met and p.Arg256Cys mutations in heterozygosity were sufficient to cause the clinical features of an autosomal recessive CI deficiency, but confirmation of this deficiency by biochemical approaches were not possible and further studies are necessary.\n\n    The addition of new mutations to the literature contributes to a better understanding of the etiology of mitochondrial disease, as well as the potential of future correlations between genotype and phenotype, allowing the earlier implementation of mitochondrial dysfunction preventive therapies.",
        "Discussion": "    This work presents three patients with clinical presentation of mitochondrial disease with mutations in the NDUFV1 gene (Table 2). The mutation p.Asp403Glyfs*27 was found in trans with p.Glu214Lys in P1, and the combination of p.Arg256Cys with p.Thr423Met was observed in P3. Both p.Glu214Lys and p.Thr423Met were described as pathogenic and cause CI deficiency. The homozygous mutation p.Thr423Met in NDUFV1 gene was found in P2.\n\n    The mutation p.Asp403Glyfs*27 leads to a truncated protein with likely functional consequences due to a stop codon preceding the 4Fe-4S domain, and was not previously associated with mitochondrial disease. Despite this, the frameshift variant should be classified as pathogenic following the ACMG guideline. The variant p.Glu214Lys was previously described as likely pathogenic in a patient with seizures, cerebellar ataxia, and psychomotor regression presenting CI deficiency. The phenotype described was different from P1, which presented a mitochondrial disease phenotype characterized by developmental delay, autistic spectrum disorder, respiratory insufficiency, T1-weighted hypointense, symmetric lesions in white matter and presence of lactate peak at spectroscopy. The recurrent apneas, prostation and vomiting led P1 to hospitalization several times, making artificial respiration necessary, despite this, metabolic and laboratory profiles were normal.\n\n    p.Glu214Lys changed a medium-sized acid residue to a large basic amino acid and may prevent hydrogen bonds, thus destabilizing the interface with the subunit NDUFS4. Mutations in this position probably reduce electron transfer through the redox Fe-S centers of CI. Modeling of the reported mutation in NDUFV1 suggested a disturbance of the assembly or function of the 4Fe-4S cluster\n\n    P2 was identified as homozygous for c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met) mutation in NUDFV1. This mutation was described leading to myopathy, depression, fatigue, strabismus, progressive muscular hypotonia, myoclonic epilepsy and psychomotor regression. Another case of homozygosity for c.1268C>T was described leading to horizontal nystagmus, dysarthria, bilateral dysmetria and intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, and gait ataxia, a different presentation from P2, which presented hypotonia, developmental delay, learning difficulties and motor regression, nevertheless presenting a typical mitochondrial disease phenotype with presence of lactate peak in spectroscopy and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.\n\n    P3 presented two compound heterozygous missense mutations, c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met), also found in P2, and c.766C>T (p.Arg256Cys) segregating from the father with a clinical history of infant seizures and exercise intolerance with frequent headaches in adulthood. An association of headaches and exercise intolerance was found for the paternal family carriers of c.766C>T, which was statistically significant. Arg256 residue was highly conserved in bilaterally symmetrical metazoans and was localized in the tip of the hydrophilic arm of NDUFV1 subunit, which unfortunately, was not structurally elucidated and further studies are needed for its functional characterization. Despite that c.766C>T (p.Arg256Cys) is found described in ClinVar as likely pathogenic and, the Arg257 residue, neighboring Arg256, was associated with CI deficiency. This residue was shown to be essential for protein function and predicted to be post-translationally modified to a N-methylarginine by similarity with the mouse protein. The variant c.766C>T (p.Arg256Cys) was predicted as pathogenic (score 0.99 and 0.87) and we propose that in combination with c.1268C>T (p.Thr423Met), they might be responsible for P3 phenotype, characterized by a childhood-onset development of hypotonia, muscle weakness, physical exercise intolerance, psychomotor regression, lethargy, dysphagia, and strabismus. The same phenotype was commonly associated with mild CI deficiency. This phenotype could be explained by a dominant-negative effect of the post-translational modification in the affected region, masking the effect of the wild-type version of the protein.",

        "Title": "    SEC16A Variants Predispose to Chronic Pancreatitis by Impairing ER-to-Golgi Transport and Inducing ER Stress",
        "Abstract": "    Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a complex disease with genetic and environmental factors at play. Through trio exome sequencing, a de novo SEC16A frameshift variant in a Chinese teenage CP patient is identified. Subsequent targeted next-generation sequencing of the SEC16A gene in 1,061 Chinese CP patients and 1,196 controls reveals a higher allele frequency of rare nonsynonymous SEC16A variants in patients (4.90% vs 2.93%; odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.33). Similar enrichments are noted in a French cohort (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.67-4.50) and in a biobank meta-analysis (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31). Notably, Chinese CP patients with SEC16A variants exhibit a median onset age 5 years earlier than those without (40.0 vs 45.0; p = 0.012). Functional studies using three CRISPR/Cas9-edited HEK293T cell lines show that loss-of-function SEC16A variants disrupt coat protein complex II (COPII) formation, impede secretory protein vesicles trafficking, and induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to protein overload. Sec16a +/- mice, which demonstrate impaired zymogen secretion and exacerbated ER stress compared to Sec16a +/+, are further generated. In cerulein-stimulated pancreatitis models, Sec16a +/- mice display heightened pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis compared to wild-type mice. These findings implicate a novel pathogenic mechanism predisposing to CP.\n\n    SEC16A is a crucial regulator in the formation of COPII vesicles, mediating protein transport from ER to Golgi apparatus. Here, a link between rare SEC16A variants and chronic pancreatitis, demonstrating that loss of SEC16A function disrupts ER-to-Golgi trafficking of secretory proteins in pancreatic acini is identified. This disruption leads to protein overload-induced ER stress, thereby predisposing individuals to the disease.",
        "Introduction": "    Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease of the pancreatic tissue, resulting from the intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Both the incidence and prevalence of CP have been increasing in most developed countries, with an estimated global incidence of about 10 cases per 100 000 person-years. Since the pivotal discovery in 1996, genetic studies over the past 27 years have yielded unique insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CP, exemplified by the identification of distinct pathogenic pathways involving trypsin-dependent processes and the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.\n\n    Irrespective of the specific pathogenic pathways involved, most of the CP susceptibility genes reported to date encode pancreatic digestive proteases or their inhibitors. These include cationic trypsinogen (protease, serine, 1; PRSS1), serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), chymotrypsinogen C (CTRC), carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1), carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), chymotrypsinogen B1 and B2 (CTRB1-CTRB2), and pancreatic lipase (PNLIP). However, it is important to note that some of these findings have not been consistently replicated in subsequent studies owing to ethnic differences in disease susceptibility.\n\n    More recently, functionally defective variants in the TRPV6 gene (transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6) have been associated with CP. Unlike the aforementioned CP susceptibility genes, TRPV6 is expressed in multiple epithelial tissues, including the epididymis, placenta, prostate, and exocrine pancreas. This characteristic of expression across multiple tissues is also observed with CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), another gene associated with CP. In this study, we describe the association of rare variants in another widely expressed gene, SEC16A (Sec16 homolog A, endoplasmic reticulum export factor), with CP across diverse populations. We then explore the underlying pathogenic mechanisms employing both cellular and mouse models.",
        "Methods": "    Sixteen teenage CP patients along with their healthy parents were subjected to exome sequencing. These patients had remained genetically unexplained after a comprehensive screen for mutations in their PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR, CTRC, and CLDN2 genes. The 1061 Chinese CP patients and 1196 Chinese healthy controls (584 males and 612 females) subjected to targeted sequencing of the SEC16A gene have been described elsewhere.\n\n    The cohort comprised 383 CP patients, split between 192 with idiopathic CP and 191 with familial or hereditary CP (for term definitions, see Masson et al.). These patients were characterized by the absence of known causative mutations in PRSS1, SPINK1, and TRPV6 genes, as well as the lack of CFTR genotypes comprising a severe allele plus a mild allele. The 574 subjects in the FREX Project (http://lysine.univ-brest.fr/FrExAC/) were used as controls.\n\n    Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committees of both the Shanghai (China) groups and Brest (France). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. In cases involving participants under the age of 18, consent was appropriately acquired from their parents or legal guardian.\n\n    A single-variant association data from three biobanks were collected: i) FinnGen (freeze 9, April 2022): Data with Risteys for CP (K11_CHRONPANC), including 3320 CP patients and 330903 controls; ii) UK Biobank (pan-UKB, version 0.4) [Pan-UKB team. https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org. 2020]: Data with International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 entries for CP (K86), comprising 607 CP patients and 417106 controls; iii) The BioBank Japan Project: Data with ICD-10 entries for CP, including 457 CP patients and 177471 controls.\n\n    Variant nomenclature adhered to the guidelines set by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). NM_01 4866.2 was used as the SEC16A mRNA reference sequence. The genomic sequence of SEC16A was sourced from the human GRCh37/hg19 build, accessible via the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/).\n\n    Genomic DNA from the 16 Chinese trios was processed to create paired-end read libraries with a 100-bp fragment size, following the protocols specified by Illumina (Illumina, California). Exome sequencing was carried out as previously described. Candidate variants were identified from VCF (Variant Call Format) files based on the following criteria: i) a minimum read depth of 10 in the trios, ii) inclusion of only missense, nonsense, small indel or canonical splice site variants, and iii) a minor allele frequency of <1% in the ExAC database. For targeted sequencing, a total of 62 specific primer pairs were designed (Table S4, Supporting Information) for the coding sequence and exon/intron boundaries of the SEC16A gene using Primer3 (http://primer3.org). All called rare variants were subjected to validation by Sanger sequencing (Table S5, Supporting Information). For further details, see the Supporting Information.\n\n    The SEC16A variants identified in the CP patients and controls from the FinnGen, UK Biobank, and BioBank Japan datasets were evaluated using a gene-based burden analysis. The inclusion criteria for variants in this analysis were: i) missense, nonsense, small indel, or canonical splice site variants; ii) variants with a minor allele frequency of <1% in the gnomAD database. The frequencies of these aggregated variants in patients versus controls using the Chi-square test were compared. Additionally, a meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model, implemented with the meta package (version 6.5) in R.\n\n    To predict the pathogenicity of the identified variants, The CADD method was utilized. This tool effectively measures the deleteriousness of genetic variants and aids in prioritizing potential causal variants in genetic analyses. It is accessible through the CADD website (GRCh37-v1.6; 2019. https://cadd.gs.washington.edu). Variants yielding a PHRED-like CADD-score of >=20 were classified as likely pathogenic.\n\n    HEK293T cell lines carrying the c.3115C>T (p.Arg1039Cys), c.4484G>A (p.Arg1495Gln), and c.5839G>T (p.Val1947Leu) knock-in alleles of the SEC16A gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, as per previously established methods were generated. The experimental procedures encompassed several key steps: i) construction of a lentiviral Cas9 vector containing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) (Table S6, Supporting Information), ii) validation of sgRNA activity, iii) creation of a corrective adeno-associated virus containing the donor template (single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides), iv) co-transfection of Cas9, sgRNA, and the donor template into HEK293T cells, and v) screening of CRISPR/Cas9 clones for mutations. These procedures were carried out by Obio Technology (Shanghai, China). The validation of clones was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing by the Shanghai participating group (Figure S2, Supporting Information).\n\n    Wild-type and mutant HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Lentivirus packed with either AMY2A (NM_000699.4), PRSS1 (NM_0 02769.5) or CPA1 (NM_0 01868.4) were purchased from Obio Technology (Shanghai, China). For lentiviral infection, HEK293T cells were initially seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 x 104 cells per well for 24-36 h until they reached 50-70% confluence. Subsequently, the culture medium was replaced with 100 microL of either lentivirus-AMY2A, lentivirus-PRSS1, or lentivirus-CPA1, each with a titer of 1 x 108 transducing units per mL (TU/mL) in fresh media. The cells were incubated with the virus for 24 h, after which the virus-containing medium was discarded and replaced with fresh normal medium. Post-infection, cells that successfully integrated the virus were selected using 10 microg mL-1 puromycin for a minimum of 72 h. These puromycin-selected cells were then utilized for subsequent experiments.\n\n    Initially, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. These were then permeabilized and blocked with a blocking buffer composed of PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated overnight at 4  C with primary antibodies (anti-SEC16A and anti-SEC31A, both at a 1:200 dilution). This step was followed by a 30 min incubation at 37  C with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. The nuclei of the cells were stained using 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The captured images were processed using ImageJ software. For the quantification of SEC31-positive ERES structures, images were acquired using a LeicaSP5 confocal microscope and THUNDER imagers on a Mica wide-field microscope. The quantification was then performed using the particle count tool in ImageJ, as detailed in a previously study.\n\n    To assess the rate of clearance of cellular secretory proteins, an inhibition of protein synthesis was performed. Cells were initially cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 1 x 105 cells per well for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with cycloheximide at a concentration of 100 microg mL-1. Following a 120 min treatment period, the cells were fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The subsequent immunofluorescence procedures involved staining the secretory proteins using an anti-V5 tag antibody (13202, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:5000 dilution) and marking the ER using anti-GRP94 (ab238126, Abcam; 1:200 dilution). Additionally, the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were acquired using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and THUNDER imagers on a Mica wide-field microscope.\n\n    All mouse experiments conformed to ethical guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Changhai Hospital (CHEC[A.E]2022-008). Mice on a C57BL/6J genetic background to generate the Sec16a knockout model was used, designed, and developed by Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc (Shanghai, China). The genomic DNA sequence of the Sec16a gene was retrieved from the Ensembl database (http://asia.ensembl.org).\n\n    Cas9 mRNA was transcribed in vitro with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra Kit (Ambion, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two guide RNAs (sgRNA1 targeted to intron 1, 5'-AAGGAGATGCTGCTTATCAA-3'; sgRNA2 targeted to intron 16, 5'-TCACCAGTGCTTGCTTGTTA-3') of the Sec16a gene were transcribed in vitro using the MEGAshortscript Kit (ThermoFisher, USA). The Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs were injected into zygotes of C57BL/6J mouse, resulting in the deletion of exons 2-16 of the Sec16a gene and subsequent fusion of the flanking introns through non-homologous end joining. The zygotes were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients.\n\n    Genotyping involved analyzing DNA samples extracted from the tails or toes of F0 mice at 3 weeks of age, using a forward primer (5'-CTGTCAGACTGGCAACAGGT-3') and a reverse primer (5'-GACACCTGCACTCCCCTAAC-3'). Positive F0 mice were selected and crossed with C57BL/6J mice to obtain F1 heterozygous Sec16a knockout mice. The genotype of F1 mice was identified by PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Male and female F1 heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous Sec16a knockout mice. The mice were housed under a 12 h light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to a standard diet. No phenotypic differences between the sexes were noted in the experiments.\n\n    The isolation of primary pancreatic acinar cells was carried out following previously established protocols with some modifications. For detailed procedures, refer to the Supporting Information.\n\n    The specific methodologies and protocols for developing both cerulein-induced AP and CP mouse models are detailed in the Supporting Information.\n\n    Histological analysis was performed through the examination of five random fields at 100x magnification. Two independent investigators, blinded to the sample identities, graded the samples on a score from 0 to 4 for parameters such as edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and acinar necrosis. The results were then quantified as means +- SEM. Comprehensive details regarding the antibodies used for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, the TUNEL assay, the TEM procedure, and the protocols for measuring trypsin and amylase activity are provided in the Supporting Information.\n\n    For the semiquantitative measurement of XBP1 mRNA splicing, PCR analyses were conducted using primers capable of amplifying both spliced and unspliced forms of XBP1, resulting in amplicons of 415-bp and 441-bp, respectively. Additionally, the primers used for genes encoding fibrogenic and proinflammatory factors, including Col1a1, Fn1, Tgf-beta, and Il6, are detailed in Table S7 (Supporting Information). Comprehensive information about the procedures and antibodies used for these analyses can be found in the Supporting Information.\n\n    The significance of differences in variant carrier and allele frequencies between patients and controls was assessed by a two-tailed Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, utilizing GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0.1) for calculations. Meta-analysis of all cohorts was conducted using R software (version 6.5), which included generating forest plots to visually represent the data. All experimental data are presented as means +- SD. A significant difference between control and multiple mutated groups was performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey's multiple comparisons test; a two-tailed Student's t-test was used for comparison between two groups. All experiments were performed at least three times. A p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves; differences between the survival curves of groups were evaluated by a log-rank test with a 0.05 significance level.",
        "Results": "    Among 16 Chinese teenage CP patients subjected to trio exome sequencing, a 12-year-old boy with a history of recurrent acute pancreatitis was found to harbor a heterozygous de novo frameshift variant, c.6491_6492delTG (p.Val2164AlafsTer20), in the SEC16A gene. SEC16A, located on chromosome 9q34.3 and comprising 32 exons, encodes a protein of 2357 amino acids (mRNA reference sequence: NM_01 4866.2). The c.6491_6492delTG variant, not present in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) and previously unreported, likely results in a significant truncation of the SEC16A protein, eliminating amino acids 2106-2357, a critical region for its interaction with SEC23A (SEC23 Homolog A, COPII Coat Complex Component).\n\n    Scrutiny of the gnomAD database (last accessed on August 2, 2023) revealed that predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants within the SEC16A gene, including nonsense, frameshift or GT-AG splice site variants as defined by Lek et al., have been subjected to moderate selection, as indicated by a LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) score of 0.32. SEC16A participates in the formation of coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles, which play an important role in the membrane transport of folded proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.\n\n    Taking these strands of evidence together, SEC16A was considered to be a plausible candidate gene for CP susceptibility.\n\n    Next, we analyzed the entire coding sequence and exon/intron boundaries of the 32-exon SEC16A gene in 1061 Chinese CP patients and 1196 controls using targeted next-generation sequencing. Consistent with our prior study, we focused on rare variants (<1% global allele frequency in gnomAD as of August 2020), including i) micro-deletions or micro-insertions that affected canonical GT-AG splice sites and/or coding sequence and ii) single nucleotide substitutions altering canonical GT-AG splice sites or resulting in missense or nonsense mutations. The resulting 77 rare variants (74 missense, 1 splice site, 1 frameshift, and 1 in-frame deletion; all confirmed by Sanger sequencing) are listed in Table  1 . These variants were heterozygous, except for one that was homozygous (c.5011A>G [p.Ile1671Val]).\n\n    Crucially, all three non-missense variants, namely the splice site (c.3803-1G>A), frameshift (c.6691delA [p.Thr2231ProfsTer36]), and in-frame deletion (c.3493_3513del [p.Leu1165_Pro1171del]) variants, were exclusively found in CP patients. These variants are inherently most likely to be of pathological significance. The splice site variant disrupts the canonical splice acceptor site of intron 5, likely causing a frameshift. The frameshift variant presumably leads to a non-functional protein due to the loss of the 126 C-terminal amino acids, crucial for SEC16A's interaction with SEC23A. The in-frame deletion, removing 7 amino acids within a critical region (encompassing amino acids 1102-1405) for ER localization, likely impacts protein structure and function. Additionally, compound heterozygous SEC16A missense variants were identified in four patients but not in controls (Table 1), further suggesting a role for SEC16A in CP.\n\n    To explore the association between SEC16A variants and CP, we first performed an aggregate analysis using all identified rare variants in the Chinese patients versus controls (Table 1). Rare SEC16A variants were more prevalent in patients (99/1061, 9.33%) than in controls (70/1196, 5.85%), signifying a significant over-representation (odds ratio [OR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.26; p = 1.73 x 10-3). The allele frequency was also higher in patients (104/2122, 4.90%) as compared to controls (70/2392, 2.93%) (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.26-2.33; p = 5.83 x 10-4; Figure  1A).\n\n    We further classified the SEC16A missense variants into two subcategories based on Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) predictions, using a score of 20 as the cut-off value (generally, a CADD score of 20 is held to denote that the variant is among the top 1% of deleterious variants in the human genome). The c.6691delA frameshift variant and the c.3493_3513del in-frame deletion variant were assigned an honorary CADD score of >=20 on the basis of their likely severe phenotypic consequences. This classification revealed a significant over-representation of variants with a CADD score of >=20 among patients (42/1061, 3.96%) compared to controls (26/1196, 2.17%) (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.13-3.01; p = 0.013); allele frequency analysis also showed a significant difference (CP versus control: 2.12% versus 1.09%; OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.23-3.17; p = 5.34 x 10-3) (Table 1; Figure S1, Supporting Information).\n\n    We further sequenced the SEC16A gene in a French cohort using the above described variant inclusion criteria. Rare nonsynonymous SEC16A variants (all missense and heterozygous) were found at similar frequencies in idiopathic (10.94% [21/192]) and familial/hereditary (12.04% [23/191]) CP patients (Table S1, Supporting Information). Therefore, the two datasets were merged into a single dataset: rare nonsynonymous SEC16A variants were found in 11.49% (n = 44) of the 383 French patients. By contrast, rare nonsynonymous SEC16A variants were found only in 4.36% (n = 25) of the 574 French Exome (FREX) subjects (Table S2, Supporting Information). Using the FREX data as a control, rare nonsynonymous SEC16A variants were associated with CP in the French population (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.70-4.76; p = 2.92 x 10-5). Allele frequency analysis corroborated this (CP versus control: 5.74% versus 2.18%; OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.67-4.50; p = 4.12 x 10-5) (Figure 1A). Variants with a CADD score of >=20 were also more prevalent in French CP patients in terms of both carrier frequency (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.29-6.78; p = 7.44 x 10-3) and allele frequency (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.29-6.62; p = 7.86 x 10-3) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Pooled ORs for rare nonsynonymous SEC16A variant alleles in our in-house Chinese and French cohorts were 1.95 (95% CI, 1.50-2.53; p = 6.26 x 10-7) (Figure 1A) and 2.18 (95% CI, 1.43-3.30; p = 2.58 x 10-4) for those with a CADD score of >=20 (Figure S1, Supporting Information), respectively.\n\n    Additionally, we analyzed data from three external CP cohorts in publicly available biobanks (FinnGen, UK Biobank, and BioBank Japan) for further replication. The allele frequencies of rare nonsynonymous SEC16A variants in CP patients were 3.57% (237/6640) in FinnGen, 3.71% (45/1214) in UK Biobank, and 1.97% (18/914) in BioBank Japan (Table S3, Supporting Information). A significant over-representation in patients compared to controls was found in FinnGen (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02-1.33; p = 0.023) and in a meta-analysis of all three external cohorts (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31; p = 0.011) (Figure 1A).\n\n    The combined OR for SEC16A variant alleles in both in-house and external cohorts was 1.27 (95% CI, 1.15-1.41; p = 4.84 x 10-6) (Figure 1A), with a similar OR for variants with a CADD score of >=20 (Figure S1, Supporting Information).\n\n    We previously identified rare pathogenic genotypes involving four primary CP susceptibility genes, SPINK1, PRSS1, CTRC, and CFTR, in 535 (50.42%) of the 1061 Chinese patients. We therefore ascertained whether the rare SEC16A variants were more frequently found in patients with a known pathogenic genotype or vice versa in the Chinese dataset. Fifty-four (54.5%) of the 99 patients with rare SEC16A variants and 481 (50.0%) of the 962 patients without rare SEC16A variants were found to harbor a known pathogenic genotype, a difference that was not statistically significant (p = 0.39).\n\n    Next, we explored whether the rare SEC16A variants might influence the age of disease onset, one of the most commonly used parameters for studying genotype-phenotype relationships. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that neither the presence nor the absence of SEC16A variants influenced the age of disease onset in patients who carried a known pathogenic genotype (29.7; 95% CI, 20.0-37.0 versus 29.8; 95% CI, 27.6-32.0) (Figure 1B). However, in patients who did not carry a known pathogenic genotype, the median age at onset of CP in the SEC16A variant-positive patients was significantly earlier than that in the SEC16A variant-negative patients (40.0; 95% CI, 37.0-44.6 versus 45.0; 95% CI, 42.5-47.0; p = 0.012) (Figure 1C).\n\n    To investigate the potential pathogenic mechanism(s) underlying the rare SEC16A variants, we selected three missense variants, c.4484G>A (p.Arg1495Gln), c.5839G>T (p.Val1947Leu) and c.3115C>T (p.Arg1039Cys), for functional characterization in CRISPR/Cas9-edited HEK293 cell lines (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The variants p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu were chosen due to their greatest degree of enrichment in Chinese cases compared to controls (Table 1). By contrast, p.Arg1039Cys (not listed in Table 1), which has a global allele frequency of 20.9% in gnomAD, showed similar allele frequencies in both 1061 Chinese patients (60/2122, 2.8%) and 1196 controls (76/2322, 3.2%).\n\n    To facilitate observation and characterization of the potential effects of these variants on SEC16A protein expression, homozygous cell lines were used. Western blot analysis of cell lysates from wild-type and mutant HEK293T cells demonstrated that SEC16A expression was significantly reduced in the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cell lines but not in the p.Arg1039Cys cell line (Figure  2A). This suggested that both p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu had a significant impact on SEC16A expression or stability.\n\n    Given the important role of SEC16A in secretory cargo trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, we next analyzed the potential effect of p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu on the secretion of exogenously expressed pancreatic zymogens, using p.Arg1039Cys as a negative control. The three mutant and wild-type HEK293T cells were each infected with AMY2A (Amylase Alpha 2A)-, PRSS1-, or CPA1-lentivirus, followed by Western blot analysis of the exogenously expressed zymogens in both cell lysates and media. All exogenously expressed zymogens were significantly increased in lysates but significantly decreased in the media of the infected p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cells compared to the wild-type. By contrast, no significant differences were observed between the p.Arg1039Cys cells and wild-type (Figure 2B). This finding was corroborated by significantly lower amylase and trypsin activities in the media of the infected p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cells compared to both wild-type and p.Arg1039Cys cells (Figure 2C,D). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis also confirmed fewer secretory vesicles in the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cells compared to p.Arg1039Cys (Figure 2E). These findings indicated that the secretory function (but not the exogenous gene expression) of the HEK293 cells was impaired by the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu variants.\n\n    The selective export of proteins and lipids from the ER is mediated by COPII, which assembles at discrete sites on the membrane known as ER exit sites (ERESs). COPII consists of two proteinaceous layers: the inner layer (a flexible SEC23-SEC24 lattice) and the outer layer (SEC13-SEC31A heterotetramers). Since Sec16A orchestrates the formation of COPII-coated vesicles by directly interacting with several components of COPII, including SEC31A, we postulated that p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu would affect the formation of COPII vesicles. This hypothesis was substantiated by staining AMY2A-virus infected cell lines for SEC16A and SEC31A. In the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cell lines, a marked reduction in the number of ERESs was observed compared to the wild-type and p.Arg1039Cys HEK293 cells (Figure  3A). Although we prefer the explanation that the reduced immunofluorescent signals of SEC31A are due to reduced COPII assembly, we cannot exclude the possibility that the reduced signals may also be related to decreased expression of SEC31A.\n\n    The secretion defect in the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cell lines suggested the possibility of ER stress due to protein overload. To investigate this, we first tracked the intracellular fate of exogenously expressed CPA1 protein. After inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide, a higher accumulation of CPA1 protein was noted in the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cell lines compared to the wild-type and p.Arg1039Cys HEK293 cell lines (Figure 3B,C), indicating impaired protein secretion and consequent protein overload.\n\n    Next, we examined XBP1 mRNA splicing, a key ER stress marker, in the different cell lines under exogenous zymogen expression. The spliced/unspliced XBP1 ratio was substantially higher in the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cells than in the wild-type and p.Arg1039Cys cells, while total X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA levels were comparable across these cell lines (Figure 3D,E). Additionally, we analyzed two other ER stress markers, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BIP) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Both markers were upregulated in the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cell lines, but not in the Arg1039Cys cell line (Figure 3F).\n\n    Finally, we explored unfolded protein response (UPR) activation by detecting three main pathways: PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1). All three markers were significantly upregulated in p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu cell lines (Figure 3G).\n\n    Taken together, these results serve to confirm our hypothesis by demonstrating that the p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu variants disrupt the secretory pathway, leading to protein accumulation and subsequent cellular stress.\n\n    To validate the above in vitro findings, we generated Sec16a knockout mice using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (Figure  4A). Homozygous Sec16a knockout resulted in embryonic lethality, whereas heterozygous mice (Sec16a+/- ) exhibited normal lifespan and development. Histological examination of key organs (pancreas, liver, heart, kidneys, lungs) under a light microscope showed no obvious abnormalities in adult mice under natural growth conditions. Consequently, all subsequent experiments were conducted using heterozygous knockout mice.\n\n    As shown in Figure 4B, Sec16a+/-  mice displayed significantly reduced SEC16A expression compared to their wild-type counterparts. We first explored the effects of heterozygous Sec16a knockout on cellular secretion capabilities using primary pancreatic acini as a model system. Pancreatic acinar cells were isolated from 8-week-old Sec16a+/-  and Sec16a+/+  mice, cultured for 24 h, and then divided into two experimental groups.\n\n    In the first experiment, we mimicked the impact of overexpressed secretory proteins on ER secretion by infecting pancreatic acini with AMY2A-lentivirus. In the second experiment, we stimulated the pancreatic acini with cerulein to establish a cell-culture model of pancreatitis. For the AMY2A-lentivirus group, cells were infected with empty or AMY2A-lentivirus for 24 h before collecting cell lysates and media. For the cerulein group, cells were treated with 100 nm cerulein or saline for 1 h, followed by an additional hour in a fresh medium.\n\n    Western blot analysis from both experiments showed significantly lower amylase secretion in pancreatic acinar cells of Sec16a+/-  mice compared to Sec16a+/+  mice (Figure 4C for AMY2A-lentivirus infection; Figure 4D for cerulein stimulation). Analysis of ER stress makers revealed higher ER stress levels in pancreatic acinar cells of Sec16a+/-  mice compared to Sec16a+/+  mice, even without viral infection or cerulein stimulation (Figure 4F, blue dots). Additionally, ER stress was further exacerbated in the pancreatic acinar cells of Sec16a+/-  mice relative to Sec16a+/+  mice after AMY2A-lentivirus transfection (Figure 4E, red squares) or cerulein-stimulation (Figure 4F, red squares).\n\n    Finally, TEM evaluation of isolated pancreatic cells (without viral infection or cerulein stimulation) from Sec16a+/-  mice showed increased intracellular vacuolization and visible ER dilations with protein overload compared to Sec16a+/+  mice (Figure 4G).\n\n    These results collectively demonstrate that heterozygous loss of Sec16a function leads to impaired zymogen secretion and exacerbated ER stress, mirroring the protein overload-induced cellular stress observed in our variant knock-in cell studies.\n\n    Next, we investigated whether heterozygous knockout of Sec16a affects the severity of pancreatitis in the context of cerulein-induced AP. Using parameters such as pancreas mass, plasma amylase levels, and histological changes of pancreatic sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, we assessed the severity of AP in 8-week-old Sec16a+/+  and Sec16a +/- mice following cerulein stimulation (Figure  5A). While normal 8-week-old Sec16a+/+  and Sec16a +/- mice showed no significant pancreatic differences (Figure S3, Supporting Information), cerulein-treated Sec16a+-  mice demonstrated significantly increased severity of pancreatitis compared to cerulein-treated wild-type mice. This was evidenced by an elevated pancreas/body weight ratio, higher serum amylase levels, and more severe histology scores (Figure 5B-E; Figure S4A, Supporting Information). Although intrapancreatic trypsin activity showed no significant differences between Sec16a +/- and Sec16a+/+  mice in cerulein-induced AP model (Figure S4B, Supporting Information), massive infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in Sec16a +/- mice post-cerulein treatment (Figure S4C,D, Supporting Information). Additionally, terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining and elevated expression of BIP and spliced XBP1 revealed increased acinar cell apoptosis and ER stress in Sec16a +/- mice compared to Sec16a+/+  mice (Figure 5F,G). Altogether, these data demonstrated that the heterozygous knockout of Sec16a aggravates the severity of cerulein-induced AP.\n\n    Finally, we evaluated the impact of heterozygous knockout of Sec16a in a CP model (Figure  6A). Cerulein-treated Sec16a +/- mice exhibited a notable reduction in pancreas mass compared to Sec16a+/+  mice (Figure 6B; Figure S5A, Supporting Information). Immunohistochemistry-stained acinar amylase was significantly lower in Sec16a+/-  mice, reflecting severe atrophy of the exocrine pancreas (Figure S5B, Supporting Information). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of pancreas sections from Sec16a+/-  mice showed pronounced acinar cell atrophy (Figure 6C). Sirius red and Masson's trichrome staining, along with immunohistochemistry of the fibrogenic marker alpha-SMA, indicated higher levels of collagen deposition and fibrosis in Sec16a+/-  mice than in Sec16a+/+  mice (Figure 6D,E; Figure S5C, Supporting Information). Gene expression analyses revealed significant upregulation of three fibrogenic factor genes (i.e., collagen type I alpha 1 [Col1a1], fibronectin [Fn1], and transforming growth factor-beta [Tgf-beta]) and one proinflammatory factor gene (i.e., interleukin-6 [Il6]) in the pancreata of Sec16a+/-  mice (Figure 6F). Cerulein-induced pancreatitis in Sec16a+/-  mice was characterized by an increased infiltration of inflammatory cells, including CD45 leukocyte and F4/80 macrophages (Figure S5D, Supporting Information). Staining for the ductal cell marker cytokeratin 19 (CK19) revealed increased proliferation of pancreatic duct cells in pancreas sections from Sec16a+/-  mice, implying acinar-to-ductal metaplasia instead of acinar cell dropout (Figure 6G). Significantly elevated ER stress markers were also observed in the Sec16a+/-  mice compared to the Sec16a+/+  mice (Figure 6H).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The genetic landscape of CP is mainly characterized by genes expressed specifically or predominantly in pancreatic acinar cells, such as PRSS1, SPINK1, CTRC, CPA1, CEL, CTRB1-CTRB2, and PNLIP, or pancreatic ductal cells, notably CFTR. By contrast, the recently reported CP susceptibility gene, TRPV6, is expressed in multiple tissues, among which pancreas ranks second in terms of TRPV6 RNA expression according to the Human Protein Atlas database.\n\n    In this study, we found a significant association between rare SEC16A variants and CP. The association was significant across both Chinese and French cohorts, as demonstrated in an aggregate analysis of all rare variants and those with a CADD score of >=20. This significant association was also observed when combining data from three biobanks. Notably, all four pLoF variants identified:one from trio exome sequencing and three from targeted sequencing:were found exclusively in patients, not in controls. Based upon gnomAD data, it may be concluded that pLoF variants in the SEC16A gene have been subject to moderate negative selection. Furthermore, in patients that did not carry a known pathogenic genotype involving PRSS1, SPINK1, CTRC and/or CFTR, the presence of rare SEC16A variants was significantly associated with an earlier onset of CP. These various lines of genetic evidence strongly support the hypothesis that loss-of-function variants in SEC16A are novel risk factors for CP.\n\n    SEC16A is a key regulator in the formation of COPII vesicles, which mediate protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. SEC16A interacts with key components of the COPII machinery, regulating their function. Depletion of SEC16A reduces the number of COPII budding sites on the ER, thereby slowing the rate at which secretory cargoes exit the ER and disrupting the early secretory pathway. These observations align with those from Sec23b (encoding another key component of COPII) conventional or conditional knockout mouse models. These models exhibited a decrease in zymogen granules, ER distention, and increased apoptosis in the pancreatic acini, leading to pancreatic degeneration. Additionally, Sec23b hemizygosity (Sec23bki/ko ) mice (ki, knocked in p.E109K mutation:the most common human mutation in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II patients; ko, knockout) displayed phenotypes consistent with CP. These findings underscore the critical role of ER-to-Golgi transport in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis. Unlike previously identified CP susceptibility genes, SEC16A is ubiquitously expressed, with high abundance in the pancreas. SEC16A's role has been rarely studied in specific tissues or organs, but it has been reported to be involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, whole-body glucose homeostasis, and both conventional and unconventional secretion of CFTR.\n\n    Given SEC16A's crucial role and the distinct mechanism of ER stress resulting from misfolding variants underlying CP, we first conducted functional analyses of selected SEC16A variants using CRISPR/Cas9-edited HEK293T cell lines. We focused on two rare missense variants enriched in Chinese patients (p.Arg1495Gln and p.Val1947Leu) and one common variant equally present in patients and controls (p.Arg1039Cys). Our experiments in the variant knock-in cell model demonstrated that loss-of-function variants in SEC16A impede pancreatic enzyme secretion, ultimately leading to protein accumulation and inducing ER stress. More specifically, the results suggest that the excessive accumulation of proenzymes in the ER triggers the ER overload response (EOR), inducing ER stress and leading to the inflammatory response. Additionally, we found that the UPR pathways (encompassing PERK, ATF6, and IRE1) were concurrently activated, often co-occurring with EOR. Whereas the UPR facilitates cellular adaptation to ER stress, persistent UPR activation leads to cell death. Furthermore, PERK activation also upregulates genes involved in autophagy. These pathological mechanisms may contribute to the progression of pancreatitis.\n\n    Two points are worth mentioning in relation to the use of the variant knock-in cell model. First, given the study's relevance to pancreatitis, using pancreatic acinar cells would be ideal. However, no human acinar cell lines are available, and the widely used rat acinar cell line AR42J is a doubtful alternative for this purpose owing to its diminished secretory function. Instead, HEK293 or HEK293T cells have been used effectively to study the secretory effects of missense variants in CP genes such as PRSS1, SPINK1, CTRC, CPA1, CEL, and PNLIP, as well as the function of SEC16A. Second, to minimize interference from endogenous SEC16A, we conducted functional analyses on SEC16A homozygous missense variants in CRISPR/Cas9-edited HEK293T cell lines. This approach is analogous to transfecting cell lines that do not express the gene of interest with plasmids harboring missense variants (e.g., the functional effects of missense variants in the aforementioned CP genes were analyzed this way). One caveat of this approach is the inability to analyze potential dominant negative effects of the studied missense variant. However, this limitation does not affect the main conclusion of the study.\n\n    Findings from the variant knock-in cell model were further validated using Sec16a+/-  mice, which exhibited more severe pancreatitis under cerulein stimulation compared to their wild-type counterparts. Cerulein, an analog of cholecystokinin, triggers excessive secretion of pancreatic enzymes and enhances the exocytosis of zymogen granules from acinar cells, thereby increasing the ER's burden for protein modification and secretion. Considering the vital role of SEC16A in ER-to-Golgi trafficking, its reduced expression in Sec16a+/-  mice likely aggravates the effects of cerulein stimulation. In short, our mouse studies confirmed that the loss of SEC16A function increases susceptibility to severe and progressive pancreatitis by impairing ER-to-Golgi transport and inducing ER stress. Notably, this pathogenic mechanism aligns with findings from other studies. For example, impaired ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking contributes to ER stress in lipotoxic mouse beta cells, and recessive mutations in YIPF5 disrupt ER-to-Golgi trafficking, causing neonatal diabetes and microcephaly through ER stress.\n\n    The origins of ER stress-related mechanisms described in this study differ fundamentally from those previously reported in pancreatic pathology. In our study, ER stress results from the reduced secretion of normally synthesized pancreatic zymogens due to impaired ER-to-Golgi trafficking caused by reduced SEC16A function. By contrast, previously described mechanisms involve misfolded zymogens attributable to missense variants. Notably, misfolding variants in CPA1  and PRSS1  are often associated with hereditary pancreatitis, characterized by large effect sizes and a frequent family history. In this study, we identified four clear loss-of-function SEC16A variants (c.6491_6492delTG, c.3803-1G>A, c.6691delA, and c.3493_3513del). All four variants were found exclusively in patients without a family history (note, however, that the c.6491_6492delTG variant occurred de novo). Furthermore, the overall ORs from the analysis of all rare SEC16A variants across all populations are relatively small (Figure 1A). These differences in genetic effects may be intricately related to the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.\n\n    Another notable finding is that there were no significant differences in intrapancreatic trypsin activity between Sec16a+/-  and Sec16a+/+  mice after cerulein stimulation (Figure S4B, Supporting Information). This phenomenon may be explained as follows: pathological trypsinogen activation mainly occurs with the co-localized lysosomal and digestive enzymes, whereas no trypsinogen activation occurs during ER synthesis or in the ER-to-Golgi transport pathway, possibly due to the co-synthesis of trypsinogen with pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. Our results suggest that ER stress induced by protein overload is independent of the pathological intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen in pancreatitis development.\n\n    As previously noted, SEC16A is a ubiquitously expressed gene, with the pancreas being one of the organs with the highest expressing levels. To date, only a few studies have suggested potential links between SEC16A variants and human diseases. One such case involved a three-amino-acid in-frame deletion in SEC16A (p.Ser369_Ala371del) in a well-characterized, multigenerational family with axial spondylarthritis. However, this association was complicated by a co-inherited, unambiguous loss-of-function variant in the MAMDC4 gene. Similarly, the significance of three rare SEC16A missense variants (c.1019G>A [p.Gly340Glu], c.1037G>A [p.Arg346His] and c.1480G>C [p.Gly494Arg]) identified in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patients remains uncertain due to the absence of functional data and their co-inheritance with rare variants in other candidate genes. Additionally, SEC16A c.3820C>T (p.Arg1274Cys) was identified as a candidate variant associated with various developmental delays and abnormalities in a Saudi Arabian girl. In short, the pathological relevance of these associations remains to be fully established.\n\n    Taking these findings into consideration, we re-examined our cohort of 1061 Chinese CP patients for the potential presence of extra-pancreatic chronic inflammatory syndromes. However, we were unable to draw any meaningful conclusions about other potential disease associations owing to the rare occurrences of such incidences (e.g., chronic bronchitis and epididymitis in isolated cases). Whilst future research may uncover associations between SEC16A variants and extra-pancreatic pathologies, it is crucial to recognize the unique vulnerability of pancreatic acinar cells. These cells synthesize and secrete abundant proteins and have a substantially large volume of ER, rendering them especially susceptible to disruptions in SEC16A function and ER homeostasis. Nevertheless, a global gene knockout in mice may impact other organs, and future studies could benefit from creating a pancreas-specific knockout mouse model.\n\n    In summary, this study is the first to identify an association between rare SEC16A variants and CP and to construct a Sec16a knockout mouse model. Our functional analyses in cellular and mouse models show that loss-of-function variants in SEC16A disrupt ER-to-Golgi trafficking, leading to protein overload-induced ER stress. These findings implicate a role for SEC16A in CP pathogenesis and highlight the need for ongoing research into the genetic underpinnings of this complex disease.",

        "Title": "    Genetic Analysis of a Cohort of 275 Patients with Hyper-IgE Syndromes and/or Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis",
        "Abstract": "    Hyper-IgE syndromes and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis constitute rare primary immunodeficiency syndromes with an overlapping clinical phenotype. In recent years, a growing number of underlying genetic defects have been identified. To characterize the underlying genetic defects in a large international cohort of 275 patients, of whom 211 had been clinically diagnosed with hyper-IgE syndrome and 64 with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, targeted panel sequencing was performed, relying on Agilent HaloPlex and Illumina MiSeq technologies. The targeted panel sequencing approach allowed us to identify 87 (32 novel and 55 previously described) mutations in 78 patients, which generated a diagnostic success rate of 28.4%. Specifically, mutations in DOCK8 (26 patients), STAT3 (21), STAT1 (15), CARD9 (6), AIRE (3), IL17RA (2), SPINK5 (3), ZNF341 (2), CARMIL2/RLTPR (1), IL12RB1 (1), and WAS (1) have been detected. The most common clinical findings in this cohort were elevated IgE (81.5%), eczema (71.7%), and eosinophilia (62.9%). Regarding infections, 54.7% of patients had a history of radiologically proven pneumonia, and 28.3% have had other serious infections. History of fungal infection was noted in 53% of cases and skin abscesses in 52.9%. Skeletal or dental abnormalities were observed in 46.2% of patients with a characteristic face being the most commonly reported feature (23.1%), followed by retained primary teeth in 18.9% of patients. Targeted panel sequencing provides a cost-effective first-line genetic screening method which allows for the identification of mutations also in patients with atypical clinical presentations and should be routinely implemented in referral centers.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10875-021-01086-4.",
        "Introduction": "    Hyper-IgE syndromes (HIES) and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) constitute rare primary immunodeficiency syndromes with overlapping phenotypes. HIES have traditionally been characterized by the clinical triad of recurrent pneumonias, recurrent skin abscesses, and markedly elevated serum IgE levels. Eczema and eosinophilia represent further hallmarks. The most common underlying genetic defects are loss of function mutations of the transcription factor STAT3, which, in addition to the triad already mentioned, are associated with dental, skeletal, and connective tissue abnormalities. In contrast, DOCK8 deficiency is characterized by severe viral infections, e.g., with herpes viruses, papilloma viruses, and molluscum contagiosum virus as well as the increased occurrence of malignancies, especially hematological and epithelial cancers. DOCK8 deficiency is classified as a combined immunodeficiency in the latest International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) classification. More recently, mutations in CARD11, ERBB2IP, IL6R, IL6ST, PGM3, TGFBR1/2, and ZNF431 have been recognized as further genetic causes of HIES-like phenotypes. A similar phenotype may be produced by genetic skin disorders such as Comel-Netherton syndrome, an ichthyosis syndrome caused by mutations in SPINK5 encoding, a serine protease essential for skin barrier integrity. Also, severe atopic dermatitis (AD) may lead to a similar phenotype, which may be hard to distinguish from primary immunodeficiencies as the impaired barrier function in AD may lead to infections. The hyper-IgE phenotype overlaps with the one of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) in that patients may show increased susceptibility to fungal infections. CMC is characterized by enhanced susceptibility to infections caused by Candida ssp. and dermatophytes. While the majority of patients suffer from recurrent skin, nail, or mucous membrane infections, a smaller subgroup of patients develops invasive fungal disease associated with a high burden of morbidity and mortality. In recent years, a growing number of genetic defects underlying CMC have been identified, which confirm a role for both the innate and the adaptive immune systems (CARD9, STAT1, ACT1, IL-17F, IL-17RA, IL17RC, AIRE, IL12B, IL12RB1, RORC) in antifungal immunity. Depending on the underlying molecular defect, additional clinical manifestations may include autoimmunity, endocrinopathy, increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, and malignancies. Laboratory findings may also include elevated IgE and eosinophilia, adding to a common hyper-IgE phenotype.\n\n    With a rising number of known underlying genetic defects and overlapping clinical phenotypes, novel sequencing techniques have been gaining importance to reach a definite diagnosis. Obtaining a genetic diagnosis in these patients with inborn errors of immunity is crucial for identifying the best course of treatment and counseling patients and their families regarding the prognosis and further family planning. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has since greatly facilitated this process at reduced costs and a shorter turnaround time by allowing the simultaneous analysis of a multitude of genes. In order to promote the time- and cost-effective identification of the genetic diagnosis, we have established a targeted panel sequencing approach relying on Agilent HaloPlex and Illumina MiSeq technologies. Here, we present our results on targeted panel sequencing of known disease-causing genes in a cohort of 275 patients with a clinical diagnosis of HIES or CMC. This approach allowed us to identify 87 mutations in 78 patients.",
        "Methods": "    This study was conducted under the ethics protocols 239/99-120,733 and 302/13 (ethics committee of the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany). All patients, or for children their legal guardians, have consented according to local ethics guidelines. DNA or whole blood samples of patients who had either a clinical diagnosis of HIES or CMC, and whose samples were referred to our laboratory for genetic workup on a research basis by their local physicians, were obtained. Around 211 patients had a clinical diagnosis of HIES, while 64 patients were diagnosed with CMC. With two exceptions, all patients were unrelated index patients. If DNA samples were available, other family members were subsequently investigated for the detected mutations by Sanger sequencing. The investigated patients were from Algeria (5 patients), Belgium (2), Bosnia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), Chile (2), Colombia (2), Denmark (1), Egypt (30), Finland (1), France (3), Germany (41), Great Britain (44), Greece (3), India (2), Iran (34), Ireland (8), Israel (5), Italy (10), Lebanon (1), Libya (2), Macedonia (2), Malaysia (1), Morocco (21), Oman (1), Peru (3), Portugal (3), Qatar (1), Slovakia (1), Spain (3), Switzerland (2), Tunisia (4), Turkey (29), USA (3), and the West Indies (1). The cohort comprises an initial group of 90 patients, in whom conventional diagnostics including Sanger sequencing of the suspected underlying target gene (STAT3, DOCK8, PGM3, STAT1) had not led to a definite molecular diagnosis. Subsequently, the cohort was expanded to include patients with a clinical diagnosis of HIES or CMC without prior Sanger sequencing.\n\n    DNA extraction was performed according to local protocols. In brief, erythrocytes were lysed with RBC buffer, and the remaining nucleated cells were subjected to Qiagen Cell Lysis Solution. Qiagen Protein Precipitation Solution was used to precipitate the proteins. The DNA was subsequently precipitated with isopropanol, washed with ethanol, and resuspended and stored in Qiagen DNA Hydration Solution.\n\n    A customized gene panel was designed through Agilent's web-based SureDesign application. The panel design initially comprised 15 genes in which published evidence has established that mutations can cause HIES or CMC and was updated regularly to optimize coverage and include new candidate genes. A list of sequenced gene sets is found in Supplemental Table 1.\n\n    Targeted enrichment was performed with Agilent's HaloPlex Target Enrichment System for Illumina sequencing. The manufacturer's instructions as detailed in Agilent's user manual were followed. In brief, DNA samples were subjected to digestion by adding a restriction enzyme master mix prepared following the kit's protocol and an incubation step at 37  C, and digestion was validated by gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the restriction fragments were hybridized to the HaloPlex probe capture library by the addition of a hybridization master mix and indexing primer cassettes. The mix was incubated at 95  C for 10 min followed by a 3-h incubation at 54  C. The target DNA was captured with a biotin-streptavidin system using HaloPlex Magnetic Beads. After a washing step, the circular fragments were closed through a ligation reaction at 55 . The captured target libraries were amplified by PCR with the master mix prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. In a final step, the amplified target libraries were purified through AMPure XP beads and washed in ethanol. Enrichment was validated on an Agilent TapeStation system.\n\n    Samples were pooled in equimolar amounts for multiplex sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq system. An Illumina v2 reagent kit was used, and the provided protocol was followed. Libraries were denatured with NaOH and diluted to a final concentration of 8-12 pM. For loading and starting the MiSeq system, the manufacturer's instructions as detailed in the MiSeq System User Guide were followed.\n\n    Data analysis was performed using Agilent's SureCall software. In brief, this included the trimming of adapter sequences and alignment to the human reference genome (hg19/GRCh37) using Burrows-Wheeler aligner. The Agilent SNP caller was used for detecting single nucleotide variants. SNP filtering, mutation classification, and annotation were performed as part of the SureCall analysis workflow. Copy number variants were determined from sequencing coverage data using a genomic analysis toolkit. Single nucleotide variants with an allele frequency > 0.01 in the general population were excluded. Detected missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations were annotated. For prioritization databases, such as HGMD (Human Gene Mutation Database), ExAc (Exome Aggregation Consortium), and dbSNP (the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database), as well as polymorphism phenotyping tools/mutation severity predictors such as PolyPhen2 and combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) were used.\n\n    The average read depth of all detected mutations was 914 x . Mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR amplification in the case of larger deletions. Around 91.8% of all bases in target regions were covered at least 100-fold, and 97.6% were covered at least 20-fold.\n\n    All detected mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing according to established protocols. Regions of interest were amplified from genomic DNA by standard PCR. PCR primers were used for Sanger sequencing according to standard techniques. All primer sequences are available upon request. Sequencing was performed on an AB3130xl Genetic Analyzer, or PCR products were sent for commercial sequencing at GATC (Konstanz, Germany).\n\n    In order to confirm suspected copy number variations (deletions), the regions in question were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR as detailed previously. Amplification of patient and control DNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n    If available, functional testing on patient cells was performed for novel variants. While not diagnostic, phosphorylation assays contribute to the assessment of potential pathogenicity and mechanism of STAT variants. Cell surface staining or intracellular staining for the assessment of variants was performed by flow cytometry. PBMCs from patients were stained with pPSTAT3-PE, pSTAT1-Alexa 647, or IL17RA-APC and were subsequently analyzed on a BD FACS Canto II.\n\n    Data can be made available upon request.",
        "Results": "    Within this study, we analyzed a cohort of 275 patients by targeted panel sequencing, out of whom 211 had been clinically diagnosed with HIES by their referring physicians and 64 with CMC. Targeted panel sequencing identified underlying disease-causing mutations in 78 patients, i.e., 28.4% of all analyzed patients. Specifically, we detected 25 homozygous and one compound heterozygous mutations in DOCK8, 21 heterozygous STAT3 mutations, 13 heterozygous mutations in STAT1, five homozygous and one compound heterozygous mutation in CARD9, two compound heterozygous and one heterozygous mutation in AIRE, three homozygous mutations in SPINK5, one homozygous and one compound heterozygous mutation in IL17RA, two homozygous ZNF341 mutations, one homozygous RLTPR mutation, one homozygous mutation in IL12RB1, and one hemizygous WAS mutation in this cohort (Fig. 1). The average coverage of detected mutations in this study amounted to 914 reads.\n\n    The mean age of patients at the time point of sequencing was 17.9 years (range: 1-62 years; mean for patients with clinical hyper-IgE phenotype: 15.7 years, for patients with CMC: 24.3 years). Around 55.1% of analyzed patients were male and 44.9% female. Around 20.5% were reported to be consanguineous. The mean age at first clinical presentation was 8.41 years (median: 5 years, range: 0-51 years).\n\n    Clinical data were available for 183 patients and are summarized in Fig. 2. The majority of patients had elevated IgE levels (81.5%), and 62.9% had eosinophilia. The most commonly reported symptom was eczema (71.7%). Regarding infections, 54.7% of patients had a history of radiologically proven pneumonia, while 28.3% of patients were reported to have had other serious infections. Twelve patients had passed away from infectious causes. Around 53% of patients in this cohort had a history of mucocutaneous candidiasis or fungal infection and 52.9% had a history of skin abscesses. About 37.2% had recurrent sinusitis with at least 3 episodes per year. Around 46.2% of patients had skeletal or dental abnormalities with a characteristic face being the most commonly reported item (23.1%), followed by retained primary teeth reported in 18.9% of patients. Around 9.8% had hyperextensibility and 8.5% a history of fractures with inadequate trauma.\n\n    Sixteen patients were reported to have enteropathy. Neurologic features were generally rare (reported in 7 patients) and included epilepsy, delayed development, encephalomalacia, and cerebral atrophy. Malignancy or suspicion thereof was only reported in three patients, one of which had a sarcoma, one multiple skin tumors, and another a lymphoma. HIES patients had an average NIH HIES score of 34.0 points (n = 122; min.: 6, max.: 73), whereas CMC patients scored an average of 9.75 points (n = 20).\n\n    Out of 211 patients referred for genetic workup with a clinical diagnosis of HIES, we were able to make a genetic diagnosis in 54 patients, i.e., 25.6%. A detailed list of detected mutations and clinical presentations of patients can be found in Table 1. In this cohort, DOCK8 mutations were the most common underlying genetic defect. A total of 26 patients were shown to have homozygous or compound heterozygous DOCK8 mutations. Out of these, four patients had splice site defects, six nonsense mutations, and five frameshift mutations. One patient had a one amino acid deletion, whereas another patient (HIES53) had a compound heterozygous mutation consisting of a heterozygous one amino acid deletion and a heterozygous splice site variant. Staining for DOCK8 protein confirmed severely reduced protein expression by flow cytometry. Seven patients were found to have larger homozygous exonic deletions, which could be confirmed by PCR amplification.HIES46\n\n    Eighteen patients had heterozygous STAT3 mutations. Of these, two patients had splice site mutations, one a nonsense mutation, two single amino acid deletions, and 13 patients had missense mutations. Functional testing was performed for the novel variants p.K531Q and p.I711F as well as for patient HIES46, who had two previously undescribed missense variants, p.L571F and p.Y575D. Testing showed reduced STAT3 phosphorylation consistent with a loss of function for two patients and mildly reduced phosphorylation of unclear significance for the third patient (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we identified two patients with a homozygous ZNF341 nonsense mutation. Biallelic mutations in ZNF341 lead to diminished STAT3 expression, resulting in hyper-IgE syndrome. In addition to recurrent respiratory infections, skin abscesses, and severe eczema, the two patients suffered from micrognathia.\n\n    Interestingly, two patients clinically diagnosed with HIES were shown to have previously published CARD9 mutations (p.R373P and p.Q295*) associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, respectively, deep dermatophytosis. Patient HIES03 had IgE levels of > 20,000 IU/l and marked eosinophilia adding towards a total NIH HIES score of 40 points. However, he had suffered from candida meningitis, and thus invasive fungal infection, hinting towards a CARD9 defect. Notably, no clinical sign or history of lung disease : typical of HIES : was present. Patient HIES04 suffered from persistent thrush in infancy and candida nail infection; however, he had been diagnosed with HIES due to elevated IgE and hypereosinophilia.\n\n    Three patients clinically diagnosed with HIES had homozygous mutations in SPINK5, which cause Comel-Netherton syndrome, a rare syndrome associated with erythroderma, ichthyosis, short and brittle \"bamboo\" hair, atopy, and elevated IgE. One patient had a nonsense mutation, one a frameshift, and one a splice site mutation. All patients had severe eczema and elevated IgE, and only one of the three patients did not have a history of recurrent infections.\n\n    Notably, another patient (HIES50) clinically diagnosed with HIES was shown to have a hemizygous mutation in WAS (p.P403L), which had previously been published as causing mild immunodeficiency, muscle dystonia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient had eczema, marked hypereosinophilia (69%, absolute count: 21,962/microl) with hypereosinophilic skin lesions, and elevated IgE levels (15,064 IU/ml). Platelet count and platelet volume were noted to be normal.\n\n    Additionally, we have identified one patient with a homozygous splice site defect in RLTPR, who had been clinically diagnosed with HIES. The patient suffered from severe dermatitis from infancy on and, in addition, had multiple episodes of sinusitis and nail candidiasis necessitating systemic treatment as well as hyperreactive airway disease. He has multiple allergies and was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis at the age of 2 years (eosinophilia of 27.1%). The clinical phenotype is thus similar to the one published by Alazami et al., although this patient so far only demonstrated mild signs of immunodeficiency compared to the combined immunodeficiency phenotype described originally by Wang et al.. Recurrent measurements showed mildly elevated IgE, but other immunoglobulins and vaccination responses were normal. Further laboratory workup showed persistent lymphocytosis. The patient was shown to have decreased FOXP3+ CD4+ regulatory T cells in line with the so far described phenotype.\n\n    Furthermore, two patients had compound heterozygous mutations in AIRE. Patient HIES01 suffered from asthma, sinusitis, and mild eczema and was found to have a multinodular goiter and a large pulmonary cyst. Laboratory workup showed elevated IgE levels. Additionally, he had a Marfanoid habitus and osteoporosis with a history of multiple fractures upon minor trauma, leading to the clinical diagnosis of HIES. The other patient (HIES02) additionally had a homozygous frameshift mutation of DOCK8 and thus had presented with recurrent pneumonias, severe sinusitis, and eczema with recurrent skin infections and diarrhea.\n\n    Out of 64 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CMC, targeted panel sequencing allowed us to make a genetic diagnosis in 24 patients, i.e., 37.5%. A detailed list of detected mutations and clinical presentations of patients can be found in Table 2. As expected, gain-of-function mutations in STAT1 were the most common identified defects (Fig. 4). Specifically, 15 CMC patients were shown to carry heterozygous missense mutations in STAT1; some of these patients have been previously published. Out of these, one patient additionally had a compound heterozygous CARD9 mutation and another one a mutation in IL17RA.\n\n    Four CMC patients were found to have homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in CARD9. One patient had a homozygous nonsense mutation, two had homozygous missense mutations, and one patient had a compound heterozygous mutation consisting of a heterozygous frameshift mutation and a heterozygous splice site mutation. Two of these four patients had suffered from candida meningoencephalitis.\n\n    Furthermore, two patients were found to have mutations in IL17RA. One patient had a homozygous frameshift mutation, where flow cytometric analysis showed severely reduced surface expression of IL17RA (see Fig. 5). The other patient had a heterozygous nonsense mutation (p.R66*) and a heterozygous missense variant predicted to be damaging (p.W320R). Primary cells of this patient for staining were not available.\n\n    One patient was shown to have a heterozygous missense variant in AIRE (p.R471C), which has previously been published as being associated with autoimmune features but not overt APECED (autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy). He had suffered from recurrent oral candida infections in infancy and was reported to have recurrent respiratory tract infections and obstructive bronchitis. Anticytokine autoantibodies against IL17 or IL22, which are commonly observed in APECED, were below the detection level. However, the patient was shown to have autoantibodies against IL28A/B, which have previously been described in APECED, but do not belong to the most prevalent anticytokine autoantibodies. The type III interferons IL28A/B have been shown to play a role in antifungal immunity, thus these autoantibodies may play a role in the development of CMC.\n\n    Finally, three patients with the clinical diagnosis of CMC had heterozygous mutations located in the linker domain of STAT3 (p.F561del and p.D570N). Functional workup of the F561del mutation had shown normal STAT3 expression and functional phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. Further analysis showed reduced STAT3 target gene activation and increased STAT1 target gene activation, thus mimicking a STAT1 gain-of-function phenotype with a clinical presentation of mucocutaneous candidiasis.\n\n    Out of 90 patients, in whom previous Sanger sequencing PCR amplification of the suspected underlying target gene (STAT3, DOCK8, PGM3, STAT1) had not led to a definite molecular diagnosis, we were only able to detect a genetic defect in 13 patients, i.e., 14.4% by panel sequencing. Here, the most common defects identified by panel sequencing were STAT3 mutations (7 patients), followed by homozygous DOCK8 variants (3 patients). One patient each had a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in CARD9, ZNF341, and AIRE. Out of the seven patients with STAT3 mutations, three had previously undergone Sanger sequencing for STAT3. This suggests that although Sanger sequencing was considered the gold standard for genetic testing, this method is not free of errors itself and in the case of strong clinical suspicion, further genetic testing should be considered.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we used a targeted gene panel sequencing approach to search for underlying mutations in a cohort of 211 patients clinically diagnosed with HIES and 64 patients diagnosed with CMC by their referring physicians. In total, we have detected 87 mutations in 78 patients. This translates into a diagnostic hit rate of 28.4% in our cohort, which is in line with other studies published on next-generation sequencing approaches in primary immunodeficiencies, which have reported rates of 15 to 40%, depending on patient preselection. Out of the 87 detected mutations, 32 constituted novel mutations, whereas 55 mutations had been published before.\n\n    Due to many patients within this cohort hailing from Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt, Turkey, Iran, and Morocco, where consanguinity is more common, there was a selection bias, which may account for the fact that DOCK8 mutations were the most commonly identified defects in this cohort. Previous reports have identified STAT defects as the most common defects in European cohorts. Similarly, among patients with European ancestry, also in this cohort, STAT1 and STAT3 defects were by far the most prevalent. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that previous Sanger sequencing of a part of the cohort may have led to further bias. Out of an overall cohort of 613 HIES and 93 CMC patients analyzed by our laboratory, 322 had undergone Sanger sequencing for the target gene deemed most likely, revealing 91 STAT3, 39 DOCK8, and 5 PGM3 mutations in HIES and 23 STAT1 and 4 CARD9 mutations in the CMC cohort. Thus, overall, STAT3 and STAT1 constituted the most frequent defects.\n\n    While it was originally published that TYK2 mutations may cause a hyper-IgE phenotype, this phenotype could not be replicated and hence TYK2 has been removed from the list of HIES defects in the IUIS classification. Also, in our cohort, we did not detect any mutations in TYK2, confirming that an HIES phenotype is not typically caused by mutations in TYK2.\n\n    The three most commonly reported clinical features in the described cohort were IgE elevation, eczema, and eosinophilia, which are common to all hyper-IgE phenotypes but are unfortunately largely unspecific. The most common condition with this phenotype is severe atopic dermatitis. Several authors have addressed the issue of how to distinguish primary immunodeficiency from atopic disease. Schimke et al. found internal abscesses and severe infections among other features predictive of primary immunodeficiency (PID). In this cohort, 8.2% of patients had no history of major or increased minor infections, whereas 41.7% did not have a history of severe infections (pneumonia or other severe or fatal infection), rendering the diagnosis of immunodeficiency uncertain. Thus, despite their clinical diagnosis of HIES, some patients may in fact suffer from other conditions within the spectrum of hyper-IgE phenotypes. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that we have detected variants in filaggrin (FLG) in patients from this cohort, some of which are known to be associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis.\n\n    In addition, individual noninfectious features were nonspecific to the mutational status. A characteristic facies was the most commonly reported skeletal feature in this cohort (23.1%); however, this is not an objectively quantifiable criterion and relies heavily on the expertise of the referring physician. Bone fractures with inadequate trauma were reported in six patients with STAT3 mutations (6/21) but also in six patients without detected genetic defect (6/197). Severe scoliosis was reported in two patients with STAT3 defects (2/21) and seven patients without detected genetic defects (7/197). Pneumatocele formation was reported in five patients (5/21) with STAT3 mutations, one (1/3) with AIRE mutation, and eight (8/197) without any detected genetic defect. This is consistent with earlier findings from Schimke et al. describing pneumatoceles, nail or mucocutaneous candidiasis, bone fractures without adequate trauma, and scoliosis to be predictive of STAT3. While, thus, distinguishing STAT3 from other genetic defects, these features fail to clearly distinguish patients with and without a genetic defect. These findings highlight again that each individual clinical feature by itself is nonspecific. For this reason, scores such as the HIES NIH score were developed to predict underlying genetic defects with a higher likelihood. However, these are only available for the more common and established hyper-IgE phenotypes such as STAT3 and DOCK8, and an overall score to our knowledge so far does not exist. Furthermore, scoring systems such as the NIH HIES score may impede an early diagnosis as they rely on morphological criteria that develop late in childhood (e.g., teeth, skeletal anomalies) and on the manifestation of infections and end-organ damage, which may take years to become obvious. This issue may be circumvented by early genetic analysis for underlying defects. Broader sequencing may help particularly to identify atypical presentations.\n\n    In this study, the targeted panel sequencing approach has allowed us to identify mutations in patients with atypical clinical presentations, such as CARD9 mutations in patients with a clinical diagnosis of the hyper-IgE syndrome, STAT3 mutations in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and patients with low HIES scores that may otherwise have been missed, or a WAS mutation in a patient with a typical HIES phenotype.\n\n    This highlights the importance of making a genetic diagnosis, as the clinical picture may be variable and the genetic background unexpected. However, the latter may have crucial relevance regarding the counseling and treatment of the patient and their family members. Furthermore, several patients with mutations in multiple genes were identified, which may contribute to atypical, complex, or more severe phenotypes. In addition, the in-depth molecular characterization of underlying mutations and the involved pathways constitutes a prerequisite for the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of targeted drug therapy and novel therapeutic approaches such as gene surgery.\n\n    In our experience, the targeted panel sequencing approach provided a cost-effective first-line genetic screening method. Material costs for panel sequencing amounted to $141 per sample, whereas commercial whole exome sequencing costs $600-$700 including data processing for a single patient and approximately $1400 for a trio of child and parents. Data analysis for panel sequencing does not require complex bioinformatical analysis but can be performed on preexisting software, rendering analysis time and cost effective.\n\n    Covering a smaller number of genes highly preselected for those known to be disease causing reduces the effort and time spent on interpreting variants of unclear significance. While panel sequencing precludes the identification of novel genetic defects, the process is more time efficient. Particularly, in a diagnostic setting, fast turnaround times are crucial to ensure a quick diagnosis, thus favoring a panel sequencing approach.\n\n    The average coverage of detected mutations in this study amounted to 914 reads. The achieved high coverage is one of the distinct advantages of panel sequencing over the whole exome and especially whole genome sequencing and is crucial to reduce errors, particularly in a diagnostic setting. Disadvantages to panel sequencing include the constant need to update the panel to reflect the current literature and the need for further follow-up, including further sequencing in case no variants are detected. This is also a limitation of this study as the majority of patients without detection of a genetic defect were not subjected to further genetic workup. The variable number of genes sequenced due to the continuous adaptation of the panel may be regarded as a further limitation of this study.\n\n    For the time being, however, we propose a stepwise approach with targeted panel sequencing as the first step in genetic diagnostics. For patients, in whom no mutation could be detected, further workup, including whole exome sequencing, should be considered especially in the case of young age and positive family history and if further family members are available for sequencing. In the future, whole exome sequencing (WES) will probably substitute panel sequencing in the diagnostic setting as both WES and whole genome sequencing and the ensuing data analysis are becoming cheaper and quicker and databases with annotation of variants are improving. The continued improvement of sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis will further facilitate the discovery of single nucleotide variants and indels (insertions/deletions) and other structural rearrangements in the future.\n\n    In conclusion, we present a targeted panel sequencing approach for the identification of genetic variants underlying the clinical spectrum of hyper-IgE syndromes and mucocutaneous candidiasis. In total, we have detected 87 mutations in 78 out of 275 patients, of which 32 were novel mutations.",

        "Title": "    Cellular and molecular characterization of two novel asparagine synthetase gene mutations linked to asparagine synthetase deficiency",
        "Abstract": "    Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) catalyzes synthesis of asparagine (Asn) and Glu from Asp and Gln in an ATP-dependent reaction. Asparagine synthetase deficiency (ASNSD) results from biallelic mutations in the ASNS gene. Affected children exhibit congenital microcephaly, continued brain atrophy, seizures, and often premature mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This report describes a compound heterozygotic ASNSD child with two novel mutations in the ASNS gene, c.1118G>T (paternal) and c.1556G>A (maternal), that lead to G373V or R519H ASNS variants. Structural mapping suggested that neither variant participates directly in catalysis. Growth of cultured fibroblasts from either parent was unaffected in Asn-free medium, whereas growth of the child's cells was suppressed by about 50%. Analysis of Asn levels unexpectedly revealed that extracellular rather than intracellular Asn correlated with the reduced proliferation during incubation of the child's cells in Asn-free medium. Our attempts to ectopically express the G373V variant in either HEK293T or JRS cells resulted in minimal protein production, suggesting instability. Protein expression and purification from HEK293T cells revealed reduced activity for the R519H variant relative to WT ASNS. Expression of WT ASNS in ASNS-null JRS cells resulted in nearly complete rescue of growth in Asn-free medium, whereas we observed no proliferation for the cells expressing either the G373V or R519H variant. These results support the conclusion that the coexpression of the G373V and R519H ASNS variants leads to significantly reduced Asn synthesis, which negatively impacts cellular growth. These observations are consistent with the ASNSD phenotype.",
        "Introduction": "    Human asparagine synthetase (ASNS) catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine (Asn) and glutamate (Glu) from the substrates aspartate (Asp) and glutamine (Gln) in an ATP-dependent amidotransferase reaction. The human ASNS gene consists of 13 exons covering about 35 kb and is located at chromosome 7 region 7q21.3. Transcription from the ASNS gene is highly regulated in response to a wide variety of cell stresses, in particular amino acid deprivation and endoplasmic reticulum stress (reviewed in). The human ASNS enzyme consists of 561 amino acid residues with an approximate molecular mass of 64 kDa. The crystal structure of human ASNS was recently reported (protein database [PDB]: 6GQ3) and is homologous to that for Escherichia coli ASNS B (PDB: 1CT9). The C-terminal domain (residues 209-561) is composed of several alpha-helices and a 5-stranded, parallel beta-sheet that contains the ATP- and Asp-binding sites. The reaction catalyzed by the C-terminal domain leads to activation of the Asp carboxyl group by an ATP-dependent process to yield an enzyme bound beta-aspartyl-AMP intermediate. Within the distinct N-terminal domain (residues 1-208), Gln binds with the carboxamide group oriented toward the interface of the two domains to allow the glutaminase activity to generate an ammonia group that diffuses through a predicted intramolecular tunnel to react with the beta-aspartyl-AMP intermediate, producing Asn.\n\n    ASNS deficiency (ASNSD) was first described in 2013 based on four families with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ASNS gene. The affected children shared the features of severe encephalopathy, congenital microcephaly, progressive brain atrophy, early onset seizures, axial hypotonia, severe appendicular spasticity, and often, mortality at a premature age (reviewed in). Since the initial report, about 50 independent ASNS protein variants have been identified (summarized by). The exact mechanisms that cause the overt symptoms of the disease are not well understood, and at present, the disease can only be diagnosed through DNA sequencing. Some, but not all, affected individuals have a measurable decrease in the amount of Asn in their serum or cerebrospinal fluid, and thus, this analysis is not a definitive screening approach for suspected cases. Based on animal growth studies, Asn is considered a \"nonessential\" or \"dispensable\" amino acid, but at the level of individual cells, an ASNS enzyme deficiency that is sufficiently large leads to extracellular Asn dependence. Our previous characterizations of fibroblasts from ASNSD patients revealed that lowering the extracellular Asn concentration results in a significant decrease in cell proliferation. Depending on the severity of the mutation, fibroblasts from some asymptomatic heterozygotic parents also exhibited a decline in proliferation in the absence of sufficient extracellular Asn.\n\n    The present results describe a female child with ASNSD who inherited two novel mutations in the ASNS gene, c.1118G>T (paternal) and c.1556G>A (maternal), that lead to aberrant proteins containing G373V or R519H substitutions, respectively. The child has a history of developmental delay, microcephaly, and epilepsy typical of other ASNSD patients. Growth of the child's fibroblasts was suppressed in medium lacking Asn and measurement of enzyme activity revealed that the R519H variant exhibited reduced function, whereas the G373V variant was too unstable to purify. Transduction with WT ASNS resulted in nearly complete rescue of growth in ASNS-null Jensen rat sarcoma (JRS) cells, but expression of either variant produced little or no growth in the absence of medium-supplied Asn. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that the compound heterozygotic coexpression of the G373V and R519H ASNS variants leads to a significant defect in the cellular ability to produce sufficient Asn, which has a deleterious impact on cellular growth.",
        "Methods": "    Whole exome sequencing was performed on the child's and parental genomic DNA using the NimbleGen V3 targeted sequence capture method to enrich the whole exome (Roche). Sequencing was done using the Illumina HiSeq2500 system with 125 bp paired-ended reads at a minimum coverage of 10x of 95% of the target regions. The exome DNA sequences were mapped and compared to the human genome build UCSC hg19 reference sequence using the GATK Appistry 2013.2 and Alamut Batch 1.4.0 (SOPHiA Genetics) software packages. Assessment of quality and coverage for targeted coding exons of known protein coding genes was >97% at 10x. Genes of interest were generated based on the following key phenotypes: microcephaly, developmental delay, intractable seizures, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and triangular facies. Exome analysis filtered thousands of genetic variants in the child and used parental data to help in the filtering process. A subset of these variants was identified as clinically relevant. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm all potential positive variants. The child's serum amino acid levels were quantified at age 4 as part of the patient's clinical care at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center by the clinical laboratory.\n\n    The available human ASNS protein model (Uniprot ID: P08243) was used as a template in UCSF Chimera software (version 1.15). The recently crystallized human ASNS (PDB: 6GQ3) was overlayed with E. coli AS-B structure (PDB: 1CT9) to confirm the similarity in structure and allow for human ASNS modeling in the C-terminal active site based on the location of AMP in the E. coli AS-B crystal. The human crystal structure sequence does not include the initial methionine residue, thus, G373 and R519 are residue locations G372 and R518, respectively. G373V and R519H variants were introduced with the rotamers tool, and the most probable rotamer was selected based on backbone-dependent rotamer library predictions. Predictions of hydrogen bonding were performed with the FindHBond tool set to default H bond constraints provided by the Chimera software. Predictions of clashing residues were obtained through the Find Clashes/Contacts tool set to parameters for default clash criteria. Predicted hydrogen bonds and clashes were confirmed by manual structure inspection and used to infer potential variant impacts on enzyme stability and activity.\n\n    Fibroblast cell lines were developed from skin samples collected from the affected child and the parents. An unrelated human adult dermal fibroblast cell line was obtained from ATCC (#PCS-201-012) and serves as a WT cell line. HEK293T (#CRL-3216) and JRS (#CCL-45) cells were obtained from ATCC. All cell lines were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Corning #10-013-CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Bio-Techne #S11550), ABAM (streptomycin, penicillin G, and amphotericin B), 1x nonessential amino acids (Corning #25-025-CL), and 2 mM Gln. To generate DMEM without Asn, 10% dialyzed FBS was used (Bio-Techne #S12850) and the 1x nonessential amino acids supplement was replaced with 0.1 mM glycine, L-alanine, L-Asp, L-Glu, L-proline, and L-serine individually added to the DMEM. Cell seeding densities are listed for each experimental protocol. Cell nutritional basal state was obtained 12 to 18 h before all experiments by changing to fresh complete DMEM media. For all time course cell treatments, the appropriate media were changed every 24 h.\n\n    For mRNA studies, fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 x 105 cells per well. RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen #15596026) per the manufacturer's protocol. A 1 mug RNA aliquot was converted to cDNA with the qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quantabio #95047) and then 10% of the cDNA was utilized for each qRT-PCR reaction. qRT-PCR reactions were performed with cDNA, 300 nM forward primer, 300 nM reverse primer, and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems #4309155) in a Bio-Rad CFX-Connect Real-Time System with cycling parameters of 1x 95  C for 10 min, 40x 95  C for 15 s and 60  C for 1 min with a SYBR measurement, 1x 95  C for 15 s, and a melting curve from 55  C to 98  C increasing 0.5  C every 5 s. Primers used for GAPDH mRNA were forward 5' -TTGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTC- 3' and reverse 5' -ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT- 3'. Primers used for ASNS mRNA were forward 5' -GCAGCTGAAAGAAGCCCAAGT- 3' and reverse 5' -TGTCTTCCATGCCAATTGCA- 3'. Primers for ATF4 were forward 5'-GGGACAGATTGGATGTTGGAGA-3' and reverse 5'-ACCCAACAGGGCATCCAAGT-3'. Primers for SLC1A5 (ASCT2) were forward 5'-TCCTCTTCACCCGCAAAAACCC-3' and reverse 5'-CCACGCCATTATTCTCCTCCAC-3'. Analysis was performed by the DeltaDeltaCt method.\n\n    Fibroblasts were seeded at 5 x 104 cells per chamber in 8-well Millicell EZ-slides (Millipore Sigma #PEZGS0816). After concluding the experimental protocol, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT), washed with PBS, permeabilized 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Fisher #BP-9703-100), washed with PBS, and then incubated for 1.5 h with 1:100 anti-ASNS rabbit polyclonal antibody (ProteinTech #14681-1-AP). The primary antibody was removed, and the chambers were incubated with 1:500 anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam #ab150077) for 1.5 h in the dark. The secondary antibody was removed and slides were mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech #0100-20). Images were taken on an Olympus IX 73 inverted microscope with an X-Cite LED fluorescence light source. DAPI manual imaging exposure was 488 mus and ASNS was 23 ms with a 4x gain set for both.\n\n    For immunoblotting, after treatment for the indicated time in DMEM with or without Asn, cells were scraped for collection in 1 ml medium, collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer of the following composition: 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1x protease inhibitors (Roche #04693159001). Resuspended pellets were left at 4  C for 15 min and then centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min to remove cell debris. Protein quantification was done by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad #5000006), and 20 mug of protein was subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Primary ASNS mouse mAb was diluted 1:500 and the mouse GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz #sc32233) was diluted to 1:8000 in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 containing 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk. The secondary antimouse horseradish peroxidase antibody (Bio-Rad #170-6516) was diluted 1:5000 and added for 1 h at RT. FLAG primary antibody (Cell Signaling #147935) was used at 1:1000 dilution and detected with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase -conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad #170-6515) at 1:10,000 dilution. Films were scanned into digital format and analyzed using ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2018).\n\n    Fibroblasts or JRS cells were plated at 1 x 106 cells per plate in 10 cm dishes. Cells were allowed to reattach and acclimate for 24 h and then incubation in DMEM +- Asn was initiated. After 24 h, the treatment media was aspirated into 15 ml tubes and frozen at -80  C. The attached cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 5 min in 0.25% trypsin to detach from the plate, and collected into 15 ml tubes. A 50 muL aliquot of the cell suspension was taken for cell counting, and the remaining cell suspension was pelleted at 300g for 5 min at 4  C. The cell pellets were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and final pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen at -80  C until processing. Cell pellets and media samples were processed and analyzed by GC-MS exactly as in published methods. In brief, cell pellets were spiked with DL-norleucine internal standard, extracted with acetonitrile:isopropanol:water (3:3:2 by volume), dried with a speedvac, reconstituted in acetonitrile:water (1:1 by volume), and dried in GC-MS reaction v-vials. Without any extraction, 20 mul of media were dried down in GC-MS reaction v-vials. Dried cell extracts and media samples were incubated with 50 mul of 2% MOX reagent for 1.5 h at 30  C, followed by the addition of 50 mul of MTBSTFA + TBDMS and a 1 h incubation at 60  C. V-vials were centrifuged and derivatized samples were loaded into GC sample vial inserts. GC-MS data acquisition was accomplished with a Thermo Scientific Single Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (ISQ) and Gas Chromatograph (Trace 1310). The GC was outfitted with a Restek 30 m dimethyl/diphenyl polysiloxane RTX-5MS column (0.25 mm ID and 0.25 mum film) and a 10 m guard column. Oven temperature was increased from 60  C (held for 60 s) to 325  C at a rate of 10  C/min with a final 5 min hold time. The ion source was set to a temperature of 230  C and helium (Ultra High Purity) was utilized as a carrier gas. Amino acid peak areas were processed with XCalibur Quan Browser software (ThermoFisher Scientific) and normalized to the peak area of DL-norleucine internal standard.\n\n    The WT C-terminally FLAG-tagged ASNS sequence and stop codon from the Sino Biological (#HG-16454-CF) plasmid was subcloned into the MSCV-PIG retroviral expression plasmid between the BglII and XhoI restriction sites by Genscript. The ASNS MSCV-PIG plasmid was then mutated by Genscript to generate the independent 1118G>T and 1556G>A ASNS mutant-encoding plasmids. The MSCV-PIG plasmid itself encodes for puromycin selection and expresses IRES-driven GFP. For retrovirus packaging, a 10 mug aliquot of the MSCV-PIG plasmid, containing either WT-ASNS ASNS or an ASNS mutant, and a 10 mug aliquot of pCL-ECO plasmid (IMGENEX) were cotransfected into a 100 mm plate of HEK293T cells at a 1 mug:8 mug ratio of DNA to polyethyleneimine. At 8 h after transfection, the medium was changed to fresh DMEM with 4% FBS, and the transfection efficiency was checked by GFP fluorescence 36 h post-transfection. The medium containing the virus was collected 36 h post-transduction, centrifuged at 800g for 3 min to pellet debris, filtered through a 0.45 mum syringe filter, mixed with polybrene at a ratio of 1 ml medium to 4 mul polybrene, and then added to JRS cells. The transduction was repeated every 24 h for a total of three times. Cells were maintained in fresh DMEM medium containing 1 mug/ml puromycin for 3 days of selection. Stable expression was confirmed by GFP fluorescence and ASNS mRNA and protein abundance.\n\n    The transduced JRS cells stably expressing WT ASNS or the individual G373V or R519H variants were collected during growth phase culture for analysis by flow cytometry to quantify percentage of cells expressing GFP. Nontransduced JRS cells were used to set the gate based on exclusion of autofluorescence inherent to the JRS cell line. The cells were resuspended in PBS and processed on a BD LSRFortessa instrument to measure at least 10,000 events.\n\n    Fibroblasts were plated at 5 x 104 cells per well in 6-well plates. Following incubation in DMEM +- Asn for the indicated time, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS to remove dead cells and debris, and then, the remaining cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin and collected for counting. For incubations of 48 or 72 h, fresh medium was provided every 24 h. Viable cell counts were determined using the Applied Biosystems Countess II FL automated cell counter per the manufacturer's trypan blue staining protocol. The percentage of viable cells was routinely greater than 99%. To measure the cell death for JRS cells expressing ASNS individual variants by trypan blue staining, the normal cell counting protocol was adapted to retain the dead cells. The rinsing step with ice-cold PBS was eliminated and instead the culture medium, containing any detached dead cells, was aspirated into a 15 ml tube. The attached cells were independently collected by trypsin and then added to the 15 ml tube containing the previously collected medium. After centrifugation at 300g for 5 min, the cells were resuspended in 200 muL PBS, and a Countess II FL automated cell counter was used to measure the total and trypan blue stained cells by the manufacturer's recommended protocol.\n\n    A C-terminal FLAG-tagged WT ASNS expression construct was obtained from Sino Biological (#HG16454-CF). Constructs for the 1118 C>T (G373V) and 1156G>A (R519H) mutations were generated by Genscript and confirmed by sequencing. Expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells with X-tremeGENE 9 transfection reagent (Roche #06 365 787 001) and stable lines were selected through growth in DMEM containing 100 mug/ml Hygromycin B (EMD Millipore #400052-5ML) for 14 days. The relative expression level of each ASNS variant was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Cell Signaling #147935).\n\n    HEK293T stable lines independently expressing WT ASNS or the variant ASNS proteins were maintained in culture with 50 mug/ml of hygromycin B until 80% confluent. FLAG-tagged ASNS proteins were purified with EZview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Millipore Sigma #F2426) per the manufacturer's protocol. The recommended lysis buffer was modified to contain only 0.1% Triton X-100 to minimize any effect on enzyme activity, and the binding step was extended to overnight to increase yield. Purified proteins were confirmed with SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 staining (Bio-Rad 1#61-0400). Quantification of purified protein was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad #5000006) and then aliquots were stored at -80  C until use. Aliquots were only thawed once.\n\n    The Promega AMP-Glo Assay (#V5011) was adapted to detect the AMP produced by purified WT or variant ASNS proteins. A 100 ng aliquot of protein was determined by Bradford dye assay and combined in a reaction with final concentrations of 50 mM Tris, 10 mM L-Gln, 10 mM L-Asp, 1 mM ATP, 0.75 mM DTT, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mM MgCl2. After the incubation for 30 min at RT, it was diluted 1:10 with 50 mM Tris to lower the residual ATP concentration (needed to prevent excess ATP interference with AMP determination), and 25 mul of this dilution was transferred to a white 96-well plate for use with the AMP-Glo assay kit per the manufacturer's protocol for a 25 mul starting volume. The AMP, detected by luminescence for each reaction, is proportional to the ASNS activity. Each assay was performed in triplicate to establish the variability, and each experiment was repeated at least once with a new protein preparation to establish reproducibility. Significant differences between WT and variant ASNS proteins were determined with the Student's t test.\n\n    Data containing SD bars were obtained as assays in triplicate for a given experiment to determine the variability, and each experiment was repeated at least once with an independent batch of cells to assess reproducibility. The data are shown as the averages +- SDs and were analyzed by Student's two-tailed t test. Where indicated with an asterisk, the differences have a p value of <= 0.05 relative to the indicated control. For immunoblots and GFP staining images, the data represent individual experiments, which were repeated at least once to ensure reproducibility.",
        "Results": "    This study describes a female child who has biallelic mutations in the ASNS gene. When whole exome sequencing was performed, mutations in the ASNS gene were identified with c.1118G>T paternally inherited and c.1556G>A maternally inherited (Fig. 1A). The c.1118G>T mutation results in the substitution of valine for glycine at position 373. The G373V variant was not listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) dbSNP database, and no minor allele frequency was noted in the Exome Sequencing Project cohort, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), or 1000 Genome Project database. The c.1556G>A mutation results in the substitution of a histidine for arginine at position 519. The R519H variant was listed in the NCBI dbSNP database (rs568570377). According to several mutation prediction software analyses on PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, and MutationTaster, both variants were predicted to be \"deleterious\" and \"probably damaging.\" Neither variant was listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database or reported in peer-reviewed literature. There were no additional predicted deleterious variants reported in the exome.\n\n    The child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents and was delivered at 40 weeks gestation after an uncomplicated pregnancy. At birth, Apgar scores were within the normal range, 8 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min. Head circumference at birth was 32.0 cm (third percentile) and has remained at or below the third percentile (Fig. 1B). The length at birth was 19 in and weight was 7 lbs 9 oz. The father has a head circumference that is small but still within the normal range at 52.5 cm and the mother's head circumference is 57.0 cm. There is no family history of seizures or additional neurologic concerns. The child was relatively healthy for the first year of life, but parents became concerned about her development at 10 months. Brain MRI at 10 months of age showed microcephaly with diffuse supratentorial white matter volume loss, which primarily involved the central and periventricular white matter (Fig. 1C). She began having seizures at 13 months and she was referred to a genetic specialist at 3 years old for cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy, microcephaly, and global developmental delay. The child's seizures responded quickly to valproic acid, which is often found to be beneficial with other genetic epilepsies. The patient was noted to have dysmorphic features including microcephaly, triangular facies, widely spaced teeth, and bilateral brachydactyly. She was also noted to have some behavioral concerns such as hand flapping and appeared to be overly happy. At 4 years old, her head circumference was 44.0 cm (<1 percentile), weight was 32 lbs, and height was 36 in. She was noted to have a 7 to 10 word vocabulary, could pull to a stand, and could walk with assistance. Prior to clinical whole exome sequencing, studies revealed normal values for single nucleotide polymorphism microarray, Angelman Syndrome methylation studies, and sequencing of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene. Serum amino acid analysis revealed elevated levels of alanine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, tyrosine, and valine, whereas taurine was just below the reference range (Fig. 1D). It is noteworthy that the levels of the ASNS substrates Asp and Gln were normal, as were the products Glu and Asn.\n\n    In contrast to most of the ASNSD patients described previously, this child, 9 years old at the time of this study, continues to make developmental progress both with regard to fine and gross motor skills, despite still being microcephalic below the second percentile. She remains nonverbal but is interactive, sociable, and can indicate needs with simple gestures such as pointing and nodding/shaking of the head. The child has been able to walk without assistance for about 2 years now.\n\n    Both amino acids G373 and R519 are highly conserved in ASNS across species, from human to yeast to E. coli. In humans, the first methionine is removed during protein processing, so the cysteine-2 is the first amino acid in the functional enzyme. With methionine present, as in E. coli AS-B, both Gln and ammonia can be nitrogen donors, but in the human protein, with the terminal cysteine, only Gln can be the donor. Figure 2 illustrates in silico models of the human ASNS protein based on the crystal structure published by Zhu et al.. The locations of residues glycine-373 (G373) and arginine-519 (R519) within the C-terminal domain are shown in Figure 2A. Neither of these residues is located within the active site, which is identified by the location of an AMP molecule, as determined by the crystal structure of the E. coli ASNS-B (PDB: 1CT9). Amino acid G373 resides within a linker region between two helices and R519 is located within a helix near the outer surface of the protein. Indeed, no direct interaction of G373 with other residues is identified in the in silico model, although substitution with the most probable valine rotamer leads to a prediction of possible steric hindrance with residues D368, T371, and K445 (Fig. 2B). The R519 sidechain is predicted to hydrogen bond with the backbone of residues F507 (2.9 and 2.8 A), N508 (3.0 A), and E523 (3.4 and 2.9 A) (Fig. 2C). Modeling of the R519H variant (Fig. 2C) suggests that this substitution may disrupt the ASNS structure because the hydrogen bonds with F507, N508, and E523 are lost, and histidine at this position may cause steric interference with F505.\n\n    One of the hallmarks of the mammalian ASNS gene is increased transcription in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress or following amino acid limitation of cells that triggers a signal transduction pathway referred to as the amino acid response (AAR) (reviewed in). Both of these stress-induced pathways lead to increased expression of the transcription factor ATF4. Furthermore, both of the stress-induced pathways also lead to increased translation of the ATF4 mRNA by a process referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR), despite a concurrent suppression of general translation. Skin fibroblasts from each member of the family were analyzed for the AAR-associated expression of ASNS relative to an unrelated WT human fibroblast cell line (Fig. 3). Incubation of the cells for 0 to 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) +- Asn medium revealed that induction of ASNS mRNA was detectable for all family members (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the level of induction was similar to WT for the maternal- and paternal-derived cells. However, the values of mRNA abundance in the DMEM-Asn condition for the child's cells were significantly greater (p <= 0.05) when compared to either parent's value at the same time point. To establish that the increase in ASNS mRNA was the result of the integrated stress response, it was observed that mRNA abundance for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) itself and the SLC1A5/ASCT2 amino acid transporter, targets of the AAR and ISR, were also increased after incubation of the cells in DMEM +- Asn for 24 h (Fig. 3B). To determine if the ASNS protein expression was uniformly represented within the cell population, anti-ASNS immunostaining of the fibroblasts after 24 h in DMEM +- Asn medium showed the basal expression of ASNS when cells are maintained in complete DMEM medium, as well as the typical AAR-associated increase in ASNS protein expression after incubation of the cells in medium lacking Asn (Fig. 3C, bottom panels). Cell extracts from similarly treated cells were subjected to immunoblotting to detect ASNS abundance (Fig. 3D). While the induction of ASNS protein was modest for the samples from the father and mother, a greater increase was observed for the child. Collectively, these data support the conclusion that the regulated transcription of the ASNS gene and subsequent translation to protein are functional in all family members.\n\n    To determine the impact of variant expression on cell proliferation, the fibroblast line of each family member and an unrelated WT were cultured in DMEM +- Asn and viable cell counts determined at 24 h intervals over a 72 h period (Fig. 4). The proliferation studies revealed that both the paternal (G373V) and maternal (R519H) variant-expressing fibroblasts grew at similar rates to an unrelated WT cell line, even in the absence of Asn in the culture medium (Fig. 4). In contrast, the growth of the affected child's fibroblasts, expressing both variant proteins, grew at a substantially slower rate in the absence of medium-supplied Asn (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data indicate that coexpression of these two variants, in the absence of WT activity, negatively impacts cell proliferation.\n\n    Analysis of intracellular Asn, Asp, Gln, and Glu abundance was investigated in cultured fibroblasts from the ASNSD family. After incubation of the cells in DMEM with or without Asn for 24 h, the cellular content of Asp, Gln, and Glu were elevated relative to WT fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). In contrast, incubation in Asn-free medium caused a decline in Asn in all four cell lines. Given the difference in cell proliferation between the parents and the child, it is noteworthy that the cellular Asn in the child's cells was less than that for either parent. The basis for the decreased amount of Asn in the WT cells incubated in Asn-free medium relative to the complete DMEM is unclear. To provide a broader picture of metabolism for these four amino acids, the extracellular levels were also analyzed (Fig. 5B). The analysis showed that Asp, Gln, and Glu were largely unchanged regardless of incubation of the cells with or without medium Asn. However, medium Asn content substantially declined for all four cell lines after culture in the absence of Asn. Relative to WT, there was a significant decrease in extracellular Asn for either parent, and the Asn content of the child's cells was at or below the GC-MS limits of detection (Fig. 5B). The observation that extracellular Asn content was better correlated with the cell proliferation for the ASNSD fibroblasts than intracellular levels was also observed in separate experiments for two different ASNSD families and using LC-MS for the amino acid analysis (data not shown).\n\n    At the cellular level, analysis of a mutation for an individual allele is difficult in the presence of a functional WT allele. Therefore, ectopic expression in an ASNS-null cell line was used to study the impact of each ASNS variant, independent of the presence of WT ASNS or another variant. JRS cells do not express ASNS due to hypermethylation of the ASNS gene. Consequently, the JRS cells behave as Asn auxotroph and do not survive in Asn-free culture medium. Stable JRS cell lines, each independently expressing WT, G373V, or R519H ASNS, were generated after transduction with the appropriate ASNS-encoding retrovirus. Based on fluorescent images of GFP, all three cell lines displayed a similar level of transduction (Fig. 6A), and flow cytometry confirmed that the transduction efficiency was greater than 99% (Fig. 6B). Immunoblotting of protein extracts revealed that the parental JRS cells had no detectable ASNS protein, as expected (Fig. 6C). The abundance of ASNS protein for WT and R519H ASNS was similar and readily apparent, but even after a long exposure of the blot, only a small amount of the G373V variant protein was detected. To determine if the lower G373V expression was due to a defect in transcription, the mRNA levels of each cell line were analyzed for ASNS mRNA abundance by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) but there were no significant differences (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that the G373V protein may be unstable. The impact of the individual ASNS variants on cell proliferation was determined by measuring the viable cell counts after incubation in DMEM +- Asn for 0 to 72 h (Fig. 6E). To remove any weakly attached, dead cells, the cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS prior to collection for counting and the small number of trypan blue-staining adherent cells were excluded from the data such that only viable cell numbers are reported. As expected, the parental JRS ASNS-null cells showed no growth in the absence of Asn, and the cells expressing WT ASNS showed a significant rescue of growth in DMEM-Asn. Cells stably expressing either G373V or R519H variant showed little to no growth in medium lacking Asn (Fig. 6E).\n\n    Given the scale of Figure 6E, it is difficult to readily see the differences in viable cell number for those cells incubated in Asn-free DMEM medium. When only the DMEM-Asn data from Figure 6E are graphed to expand the scale (Fig. 7A), it reveals that the viable cell number expressing the R519H variant was maintained or slightly increased over 72 h. In contrast, the number of viable cells expressing G373V decline in a manner similar to the parental JRS cells (Fig. 7A). To assess the degree of cell death for each variant, a time course in DMEM +- Asn, analogous to that shown in Figure 6E, was repeated, but during cell collection, the rinsing step was eliminated and instead the nonadherent cells in the culture medium were combined with the attached cells and the percent trypan blue stained cells was assessed. The results reveal that in the absence of supplied Asn, cell death for the G373V variant was extensive and nearly the same as that for the parental JRS cells (Fig. 7B). An increased amount of cell death was also observed for the R519H but to a lesser degree. Collectively, the results of Figures 6 and 7, obtained in an ASNS-null cell line that provides a uniform genetic background, indicate that the reduction of growth in the child's fibroblasts is likely resulting from the lack of ASNS activity rather than an independent or additional defect in cell function.\n\n    The impact of WT, G373V, or R519H ASNS expression on the JRS cellular levels of ASNS substrates and products was determined after incubation of the cells in DMEM +- Asn for 24 h (Fig. 8). The results indicate that cellular Asn content declined after incubation of WT-expressing cells in Asn-free medium, but the decline for cells expressing either G373V or R519H was even greater than WT. The amount of intracellular Asn for the R519H cells was higher than that for JRS control cells lacking ASNS activity, whereas Asn in the G373V cells was below the JRS control. This later result is consistent with the G373V protein instability in the JRS cells (Fig. 6C) and the net cell death of G373V-expressing cells incubated in Asn-free medium (Fig. 7A).\n\n    To directly assay the enzymatic activity of purified G373V and R519H ASNS proteins in comparison to WT, they were stably expressed in HEK293T cells and then purified on a FLAG affinity gel. This protocol yielded about 10 to 15 mug of protein from a 150 mm culture dish for the WT and R519H clones. However, as observed for the JRS cells (Fig. 6C), despite repeated attempts testing alternate vector constructs, several different complementary DNA (cDNA) delivery systems, and cell selection protocols, the level of G373V protein was never sufficient to assay activity (Fig. 9A). To demonstrate that the lack of G373V protein was not the result of poor infection or transcription, ASNS mRNA content was measured and observed to be similar for WT, G373V, and R519H (Fig. 9B). The WT and R519H variant ASNS proteins were purified and assayed for ASNS enzymatic activity, which revealed that the R519H ASNS variant had a 60% reduction relative to WT (Fig. 9C).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The present study describes a family that expresses two novel mutations, c.1118G>T (paternal) and c.1556G>A (maternal), within the human ASNS gene that result in G373V and R519H proteins, respectively. ASNSD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that can arise from homozygosity or, as in this case of the present child, compound heterozygosity. Depending on the mutation(s) present, ASNSD presents with a wide spectrum of severity. The child described here is a 9-year-old female with physical and mental developmental delay, well-controlled seizures, and congenital microcephaly. Many of the most severely affected ASNSD patients succumb to the disease within the first few years of life. The child described here is a 9-year-old who continues to make some developmental progress with regard to fine and gross motor skills, despite still being microcephalic below the second percentile.\n\n    To date, more than 50 unique mutations in the ASNS gene have been reported in association with ASNSD diagnoses. Most are missense mutations that lead to single amino acid substitutions, but mutations leading to frame shifts have also been reported. The amino acid substitutions are spread randomly across the protein sequence. Using the crystal structure of human ASNS, it was determined that amino acids G373 and R519 are both located within the ASNS C-terminal domain. Neither is located directly within the active site, but both are predicted to lead to steric interference, alteration of the protein structure, and possibly, protein instability. The immunoblotting data from both the JRS and HEK293T cells suggests that the G373V variant is unstable.\n\n    Isolation of skin fibroblasts from the family allowed documentation of ASNS expression, function, and variant impact on cellular growth. Both of these newly identified mutations were located within the coding region of the gene. Although one would not expect such mutations to alter transcription from the ASNS gene, the regulatory sequences that control ASNS transcription are not fully described so basal and stress-induced expression of ASNS was analyzed. Measurement of mRNA and protein abundance, as well as the induction in response to the ISR, documented that well-known amino acid-regulated transcription and translation of the ASNS gene were intact (reviewed in). Growth analysis of primary fibroblasts isolated from each family member showed that proliferation of cells from either heterozygotic parent was not suppressed whether medium Asn was present or not. In contrast, fibroblasts from the compound heterozygotic child exhibited about a 50% reduction in proliferation when the cells were maintained in medium lacking Asn.\n\n    To our knowledge, no published study has directly measured the Asn content of an ASNSD patient's cells or tissue. The present results document that when challenged by incubation in Asn-free medium, the decline in intracellular Asn levels in fibroblasts from the child and the parents was similar to that which occurs in WT cells. Conversely, measurement of the extracellular Asn content revealed that the decline in the parents was significantly greater than that for WT cells, and the amount of extracellular Asn for the child's cells was at or below the limit of detection by GC-MS. The observation that extracellular Asn rather than intracellular Asn declines was unexpected. In addition to the data shown here, two independent cell cultures for the present family were analyzed by LC-MS using a metabolomics core facility, and those studies showed that the intracellular Asn levels were unchanged after incubation of the family's cells in medium lacking Asn, while the extracellular Asn levels reflected the growth pattern (data not shown). To test whether or not this response was unique to the fibroblasts from this family, the LC-MS analysis was repeated using fibroblast lines from an independent family in which different ASNS variants are expressed, maternal (T337I), paternal (G289A), and a compound heterozygotic child (T337I,G289A). The results from the second family were qualitatively similar to those obtained for the present family (data not shown). Possible explanations for the correlation between cell proliferation and extracellular amino acid levels include modulation of plasma membrane transporter proteins or flux of Asn through bidirectional exchange transporters, either of which could modify the signaling mechanisms associated with the AAR, UPR, or mTOR pathways, all of which sense amino acids. Further investigation of this phenomenon will require a detailed analysis of intracellular metabolic flux and amino acid transporter functions.\n\n    The ASNS gene in JRS cells is hypermethylated and no protein is expressed, thus providing an ASNS-null cell in which to investigate the consequences of each mutation in the absence of other alleles or compounding cellular differences. Ectopic expression of the WT and R519H variant in the JRS cells documented that WT ASNS rescued their ability to grow in the absence of medium-supplied Asn, but proliferation of the R519H-JRS cells was minimal in the absence of medium Asn. Transduction of the JRS cells with a plasmid encoding the G373V variant resulted in a markedly low level of ASNS protein, despite an mRNA expression level equal to the WT transduced cells. This inability to detect the G373V variant after overexpression is taken as evidence of protein instability. For both R519H and G373V, the degree of cell death in Asn-free medium was significantly greater than for the WT-expressing cells. Thus, the dependence on medium-supplied Asn for the viability and proliferation of JRS cells expressing either R519H or G373V variant alone argues that the Asn dependence of the child's fibroblasts is the result of insufficient ASNS activity, not the result of some independent or secondary genetic defect associated with the fibroblasts themselves.\n\n    Zhu et al. measured ASNS enzymatic activity for two previously reported ASNS variants and discovered that T337I (numbered T336I in the original paper) exhibited little or no activity. This result is consistent with our previous report of significantly reduced growth of fibroblasts from a heterozygotic parent expressing T337I when incubated in Asn-free medium. Matsumoto et al. investigated the effect of ASNS mutations associated with four Japanese ASNSD patients initially described by Yamamoto et al.. For three of the variants, there was a good correlation between reduced enzymatic activity and an inability to support the growth of ASNS KO cells in Asn-free medium. In the present report, a novel method was used to measure ASNS enzymatic activity for specific variant proteins by purification of FLAG-tagged ASNS protein from HEK293T stable cell lines. The enzymatic activity of the purified ASNS protein was analyzed by measuring the Gln-dependent production of AMP. This protocol requires only 100 ng of ASNS protein, a 30 min reaction time, and is highly reproducible. As observed for the JRS cells, despite employing multiple approaches to achieve expression, it was not possible to obtain sufficient G373V protein for enzymatic analysis, even after inhibition of the proteasomal degradation system. Ruzzo et al. were also unsuccessful in blocking ASNS variant turnover by inhibition of the proteasomal degradation pathway. In contrast, the FLAG-tagged WT or R519H constructs led to abundant expression, and the enzymatic analysis documented that the activity of the R519H variant was reduced by about 60%. These data are consistent with the structural models suggesting that the R519H substitution leads to loss of hydrogen bonding that occurs within the native protein and steric hindrance caused by histidine at the 519 position. Thus, for the child described in this report, it appears that little or no G373V protein may exist due to instability and that the R519H variant has a 60% reduction in enzyme activity. Together, these observations are consistent with the approximately 50% reduction of cell proliferation observed for the child's fibroblasts.\n\n    In summary, the present data document two novel mutations in the ASNS gene that lead to coexpression of variants G373V and R519H in the affected child. Several lines of evidence support the interpretation that the G373V and R519H ASNS variants cause the clinical outcome observed, including (1) the apparent instability of the G373V variant, (2) the reduced enzymatic activity of the R519H variant, (3) the inability of either variant to rescue growth of ASNS-null JRS cells, and (4) the lack of cell proliferation by the child's fibroblasts in the absence of extracellular Asn. These results provide further insight into our understanding of ASNSD and describe new approaches to study the disease in the form of ASNS ectopic expression in JRS ASNS-null cells, measurement of cellular Asn production by GC-MS, and direct enzymatic analysis after ASNS protein variant purification.",

        "Title": "    Targeted gene panel provides advantages over whole-exome sequencing for diagnosing obesity and diabetes mellitus",
        "Abstract": "    A small fraction of patients diagnosed with obesity or diabetes mellitus has an underlying monogenic cause. Here, we constructed a targeted gene panel consisting of 83 genes reported to be causative for monogenic obesity or diabetes. We performed this panel in 481 patients to detect causative variants and compared these results with whole-exome sequencing (WES) data available for 146 of these patients. The coverage of targeted gene panel sequencing was significantly higher than that of WES. The diagnostic yield in patients sequenced by the panel was 32.9% with subsequent WES leading to three additional diagnoses with two novel genes. In total, 178 variants in 83 genes were detected in 146 patients by targeted sequencing. Three of the 178 variants were missed by WES, although the WES-only approach had a similar diagnostic yield. For the 335 samples only receiving targeted sequencing, the diagnostic yield was 32.2%. In conclusion, taking into account the lower costs, shorter turnaround time, and higher quality of data, targeted sequencing is a more effective screening method for monogenic obesity and diabetes compared to WES. Therefore, this approach could be routinely established and used as a first-tier test in clinical practice for specific patients.",
        "Introduction": "    Obesity has become a major public health issue in many countries, including China and increases the likelihood of various diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are associated with increased mortality. Although some obese individuals never develop T2DM and some individuals with T2DM are not obese, the increase in obesity prevalence has been linked with rising trends in T2DM prevalence. Patients with obesity or diabetes often share similar clinical characteristics such as insulin resistance, making it much more difficult to establish an aetiological diagnosis and corresponding treatment. These two metabolic disorders arise from the interplay between an at-risk genetic profile and environmental risk factors. A small proportion of obesity and diabetes can present as monogenic conditions, where genetic factors play a greater role with less dependency on environmental triggers.\n\n    Monogenic obesity is a type of rare and severe early-onset obesity, resulting from a single mutation of a gene such as MC4R, LEP, LEPR, and POMC primarily involved in the leptin-melanocortin pathway. Syndromic monogenetic forms of obesity often present with severe obesity and associated disorders such as developmental delay and learning difficulties. Over 100 monogenic obesity syndromes are known, one famous example being the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Identifying these genetic mutations is important to plan personalized clinical management. For instance, patients with causative LEP gene mutations should receive dietary management and leptin replacement therapy, whereas those with LEPR, PCSK1, or POMC deficiency can take the drug setmelanotide, a selective MC4R agonist that was recently approved by the FDA. A previous study in our laboratory showed that monogenic obesity mutation carriers had less weight loss over both short-term and long-term periods after bariatric surgery compared to non-carriers, highlighting the importance of genetic diagnosis for obesity before surgical intervention.\n\n    Monogenic diabetes, accounting for ~1%-5% of diabetes, is caused by a single mutation in one of >40 genes reported to date. The majority of monogenic diabetes categories are maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), and syndromic diabetes such as Wolfram syndrome and lipodystrophy. Misdiagnosis and subsequent non-indicated drug use often happen because of overlapping phenotypes with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), such as young onset and leanness, or T2DM, such as preserved beta cell function and similar family history. The average time from diabetes diagnosis to obtaining a definitive genetic diagnosis in patients with MODY is ~13 years, during which patients are treated as T1DM or T2DM but their glucose levels are not well controlled. Therefore, correct molecular diagnosis plays a substantial role in proper diagnosis and subsequent treatment. For example, patients with HNF1A-MODY have an increased sensitivity to sulfonylureas rather than other hypoglycaemic drugs, whereas those with GCK-MODY improve glycaemic control by diet management and exercise without drug administration.\n\n    Precision medicine, first put forward in 2008, suggests that clinicians should make a diagnosis based on molecular detection instead of their clinical experience. Previously, a molecular diagnosis was usually performed through Sanger sequencing of one or several common candidate genes. However, the increasing number of genes implicated in monogenic obesity or diabetes renders this approach of sequencing single genes less useful. With the development of next-generation sequencing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) have successfully identified numerous causative variants. However, large-scale genetic screening has not yet become a standard part of the diagnostic work-up due to high costs, large data volumes, and complex data analyses. Since lower costs and simpler workflow are two major issues in clinical diagnosis both for patients and clinicians, new diagnostic tools are urgently needed. Targeted sequencing with panels of specific disease-causing genes rather than the whole genome or exome offers an alternative. In a few studies, researchers have performed targeted gene panels for patients diagnosed with suspected monogenetic obesity or diabetes, especially MODY, and obtained considerable genetic diagnostic yields. However, none of the panels contained both genes causative for obesity and diabetes, and none of them was applied to Chinese patients. In addition, there is still a lack of research addressing the use of targeted panels versus WES; thus, clinicians are faced with the challenge of making decisions without sufficient information.\n\n    Here, we constructed a targeted gene panel with 83 genes causative for monogenic obesity or diabetes and applied this panel sequencing in 481 patients with suspected monogenic obesity or diabetes. We also performed WES in 146 of these patients. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of targeted gene panel sequencing in the screening for monogenic obesity and diabetes, compare the quality of variant detection by targeted gene panel sequencing with that by WES, and help patients with causative mutations and potentially deleterious variants in diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counselling.",
        "Methods": "    A cohort of 481 Chinese patients diagnosed with suspected monogenic obesity or diabetes were recruited from Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital for sequencing between 2017 and 2022. All patients were evaluated by clinical endocrinologists. A total of 146 samples were sequenced using both the targeted gene panel and WES. The remaining 335 patients only received panel sequencing. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, and all participants provided informed consent. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or the legal guardians of minors and children.\n\n    For the probe design of the targeted capture regions, we selected a total of 83 genes of interest where mutations had been reported to be causative for monogenic obesity or diabetes: MC3R, MC4R, SIM1, BDNF, MCHR1, LEP, LEPR, PCSK1, NTRK2, and POMC for monogenic obesity; BBS1, BBS2, ARL6, BBS4, and MKKS for BBS; GLIS3, PLAGL1, PTF1A, INSR, and TBC1D for NDM; HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, ABCC8, KCNJ11, and APPL1 for MODY; AKT2, AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, LMNA, PPARG, and ZMPSTE24 for lipodystrophy; and some other associated genes for syndromic diabetes such as Wolfram syndrome, hemochromatosis, and Alstrom syndrome. These genes can cause the disease alone or in combination. Detailed information on these 83 genes is listed in Supplementary Table S4.\n\n    Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples. The concentration and purity of the DNA samples were measured using a NanoDrop 2000. A total of 83 representative capture probes of metabolic disease-related genes were designed using the Agilent SureDesign online tool. The design parameters were: tiling density: 2x; masking: moderately stringent; boosting: balanced; extension into repeats: 20; strand: sense. The capture probe covers an area of 476.147 kb, including all target genes. To obtain the connection product, the sample DNA segments were connected with sticky ends to the connector. Then, 83 gene probes were hybridized and captured to obtain the target fragment. The purified target fragment was amplified by super multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the amplified products obtained after separation and purification constituted a high-throughput library of genes related to metabolic diseases. Finally, based on the Ion Torrent sequencing platform, the amplification products of the target region were sequenced with high throughput, and all exon regions of the 83 target genes were detected simultaneously in one sequencing reaction. According to the flux of different chips, the number of detection samples can be flexibly adjusted on the premise of ensuring the average sequencing depth of ~500x.\n\n    DNA was treated with NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome v3.0 capture reagent (capture target: 64 Mb, Roche) and TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) to construct the sequencing library. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the library was sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform with paired-end 150-bp reads.\n\n    The Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (bwa-mem, version 0.7.17-r1188) was used to align the raw sequences to the human reference genome build hg19/GRCh37. SAMtools (version 1.9) was applied to convert the alignment sam file to a sorted, indexed bam file. For WES, we used Picard to remove the PCR duplicates, followed by the base quality score recalibration with GATK BaseRecalibrator (version 3.7). Finally, GATK HaplotypeCaller (version 3.7) was employed to jointly call germline variants in all samples. The raw multi-sample vcf file was annotated using Annovar.\n\n    Variants were selected through a sequential process (Supplementary Figure S2). We selected non-synonymous and loss-of-function variants, including missense, stop-gain/loss, splice-site, and small frameshift insertion/deletion (InDel). We initially focused on exonic regions and filtered out synonymous variants and non-frameshift InDels at the protein level. To remove polymorphic loci, we applied a maximum threshold of 1% for allele frequency in this study cohort, 2% for MAF in all populations, and 1% MAF for the East Asian population in the oneKG, ExAC, gnomAD, and esp6500 databases. The remaining variants with CADD scores >20 and DANN scores >0.98 were considered candidates for altering the protein structure. Genomic positions with a GERP score >2.0 were considered to be conserved. We also referred to additional public tools that predict damaging or deleterious variants, such as MetaSVM, Polyphen2, SIFT, and M-CAP. Taking the mode of inheritance into account, heterozygous mutations of genes with a known dominant inheritance can be causative, but for genes with known recessive or unknown inheritance, we needed to screen for homozygous mutations or compound-heterozygous variants. Based on all the above results, as well as the clinical information about the patients, all selected variants were classified according to the ACMG guidelines. Only the variants identified as 'pathogenic', 'likely pathogenic', and 'VUS' were further discussed in our study. Those classified as benign or likely benign were not included.\n\n    Remaining variants identified as disease-causing were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The coding regions were amplified by a standard PCR protocol. Then, the PCR products were depurated and sequenced directly using the 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers as well as PCR conditions are available upon request.",
        "Results": "    A total of 481 patients received sequencing tests in this study, of which 146 were sequenced by both the targeted gene panel and WES. Based on both gene detection and clinical evaluation, 102 of 146 patients were finally diagnosed with obesity, of which 19 had accompanying diabetes mellitus. An additional group of 30 patients was diagnosed with MODY. These three conditions accounted for 90.4% of all cases in this study. The remaining patients were diagnosed with NDM or syndromic diabetes. The age of the patients ranged from 2 to 70 years, with a median of 28 years. Another 335 patients only received targeted gene panel sequencing. The characteristics of all patients are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n    Sequencing depth and coverage analysis for each sample sequenced by the targeted panel or WES are shown in Figure 1. Samples of 481 patients were processed for targeted gene panel sequencing, achieving an average depth of 576.6x. An average of 98.39%, 97.38%, and 94.82% of targeted samples had at least 10x, 20x, and 50x coverage, respectively (Figure 1A). In comparison, 146 samples were subjected to WES, and the average depth of coverage for the whole-exome region was 96.7x. An average of 96.54%, 93.14%, and 72.05% of bases had at least 10x, 20x, and 50x coverage, respectively (Figure 1B). Overall, the samples subjected to targeted panel sequencing had better target region coverage than those subjected to WES, which is more obvious when comparing coverage with at least 50x (Figure 1C).\n\n    We next analysed the sequencing coverage of every single gene (Figure 2). Among the 83 target genes, 51 genes were >90% covered by at least 20x across all samples subjected to targeted gene panel sequencing, of which 4 genes (MC3R, BBS10, HAMP, and PRSS1) were 100% covered. The average percentages with at least 20x coverage in the panel were mostly >80%, except for the gene PTF1A, which had the lowest average percentage (65.6%). PTF1A had an even lower percentage (59.5%) in WES. However, only 16 genes were covered >90% with at least 20x coverage across all patients subjected to WES, 12 genes had a <50% average percentage, and 38 genes had a <80% average percentage. These results demonstrated that genes subjected to the targeted gene panel had significantly better coverage in general than those subjected to WES.\n\n    In the targeted panel, 39 pathogenic and 9 likely pathogenic variants were successfully identified in 48 out of 146 patients, achieving a total diagnostic rate of 32.9% (Figure 3A). Besides, variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) were identified in 53 patients. In 45 patients, no candidate variant was detected. Subsequent WES of these 45 unsolved cases identified three additional diagnoses with two novel genes in addition to the selected 83 genes, increasing the total diagnostic yield to 34.9% (51 out of 146 patients). For samples only receiving targeted gene panel sequencing, the diagnostic yield was 32.2% (Figure 3B), which confirmed the stability and consistency of the targeted sequencing approach. In comparison, the diagnostic yield of the WES-only approach was 34.9%. These data reflected that targeted gene panel sequencing and WES shared similar diagnostic yields in this study.\n\n    In addition, the number of variants for each sample after filtering was also comparable between panel and WES (Supplementary Figure S1). However, variants detected by the panel or WES were not exactly the same (Supplementary Table S2). Among the variants detected by the panel, three were missed by WES. For example, in a patient diagnosed with obesity, a likely pathogenic frameshift in TBC1D4 was detected by targeted gene panel sequencing, yet WES failed to obtain this important genetic diagnosis. Another patient was identified a variant in MODY-related gene HNF4A, but WES missed this important identification either.\n\n    Based on the targeted panel sequencing results, 178 variants of the 83 panel genes meeting the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria were conclusively identified in 146 patients (Figure 4A). The majority of diagnoses (70.84%) were autosomal dominant (Figure 4B). For patients diagnosed with obesity, the most common pathogenic variants were detected in the MC4R gene, which were identified in four patients. Among these, a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 84.5 kg/m2) had two pathogenic variants in the same gene, namely p.G98R and p.C277X in the MC4R gene (Table 1). He was first diagnosed with obesity at the age of 1 year and became more and more obese since then. Notably, his sister with a BMI of 74.31 kg/m2 was diagnosed with MC4R-obesity as well. Pathogenic variants in the MCHR1 gene were detected in three patients, followed by variants in NTRK2, PCSK1, and CHN2, which were each detected in two samples. Interestingly, two novel pathogenic variants (p.Y706S and p.Y706X) in the NTRK2 gene were detected in one patient whose BMI was 42.1 kg/m2 with an onset age of 7 years. For each of the genes LEP, MC3R, POMC, BDNF, and SIM1, only one pathogenic variant was identified, whereas none of the patients harboured a pathogenic LEPR variant.\n\n    Among all variants, the ABCC8 gene had the largest number of pathogenic variants with six variants in six different patients; thus, these patients were given a genetic diagnosis for MODY12. Other common pathogenic variants for MODY were identified in the genes GCK and HNF1A, variants of which were identified in three different patients each. Besides, two pathogenic variants were detected in each of the genes HNF1B, INS, NEUROD4, and BLK. Only one patient each harboured a single pathogenic variant in the gene KCNJ11, PDX1, or KLF11. Interestingly, some patients with MODY had more than one pathogenic MODY variant, such as patients no. 19 and no. 45 (Table 1). In total, 24 pathogenic variants were identified. Among these, five were novel in East Asians and 14 were novel in all populations. They have, to the best of our knowledge, not been reported in the published literature and databases.\n\n    Notably, some patients carried both obesity- and MODY-associated gene variants. One good example is patient no. 42 (Table 1) who had pathogenic variants of the MODY-related gene ABCC8 and the obesity-associated genes PCSK1 and CHN2.\n\n    In addition to the 83 panel genes, WES identified three variants of two novel genes in three samples from obese participants, namely PRDM16 and KSR2, which were interpreted as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (Supplementary Table S3).\n\n    About two-thirds of the variants were termed VUS in our study. VUSs were considered likely to play a role in disease, but their exact functional impact remained uncertain due to not fitting the expected inheritance mode, a relatively high minor allele frequency (MAF) in East Asian populations, or not being consistent with clinical information. A large number of the patients with obesity were carriers of VUSs in one or more of those obesity-related genes, among which BBS-related variants were an important part. In addition, some patients carrying variants of MODY-related genes did not show any blood glucose abnormalities but were only obese, hence these variants were classified as VUS as well.\n\n    ALMS1, which has been reported to cause Alstrom syndrome, had 12 variants in our study (Figure 4C). However, some patients carrying these variants did not show characteristic Alstrom syndromic features such as hearing loss and visual disturbance, and we failed to perform sequencing for their parents as this disease is autosomal recessive. Therefore, variants in ALMS1 were all classified as VUS.\n\n    Besides, no variant was identified in 45 patients, more than half of which were diagnosed with obesity. Most of the patients with suspected syndromic diabetes had no detectable variant either.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we performed targeted panel sequencing of 83 genes in 481 patients with obesity or diabetes and compared the results of a subset of 146 patients with the corresponding WES data regarding target coverage and detected variants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of targeted gene panel sequencing and WES in a large cohort of Chinese patients diagnosed with obesity or diabetes. Our study is also the first to construct a panel covering genes causative for both obesity and diabetes, since these two metabolic disorders often accompany each other and are sometimes difficult to distinguish. In this study, 25 patients were initially diagnosed with both obesity and diabetes based on their clinical phenotypes, and clinicians experienced difficulties in accurately diagnosing these patients. Through genetic testing, a pathogenic MODY-related variant was identified in some of these patients, and they were finally diagnosed with MODY. In others, pathogenic obesity-causing variants were identified leading to the final diagnosis of monogenic obesity complicated by T2DM. Moreover, some patients harboured pathogenic variants associated with both obesity and diabetes, whereas some participants did not carry any pathogenic variant.\n\n    Over 70% of genes detected in this study was autosomal dominant for the reason that monogenic diseases such as monogenic obesity and MODY were mainly autosomal dominant inherited. Among all obesity-related genes in the targeted panel, MC4R most frequently expressed variations, which is in accordance with the findings of previous reports. In four patients, five pathogenic MC4R variants were identified, of which two have been reported in the ExAC database, two were novel in East Asians, and one has never been described in any published literature. Unlike shown in previous studies that variations in HNF1A were the most common cause of MODY in Europe, North America, and Asia, it was not the most frequent cause in our study, which identified three pathogenic variants. Likewise, other common MODY-related genes such as HNF1B and GCK had two and three pathogenic variants, respectively. Although ABCCB-MODY is considered rare, our results were unexpected in that the ABCCB gene had the largest number of six pathogenic variants, possibly because ABCC8 is a large 39-exon gene that does not allow routine Sanger sequencing. By contrast, high-throughput next-generation sequencing facilitated ABCC8 testing and led to this unpredicted result. Besides, these inconsistent results may also be due to differences in sex distribution, sample size, and clinical criteria for genetic screening.\n\n    The high concordance of detected variants demonstrated the reliability of both methods. However, coverage was significantly higher in the targeted panel, and WES was more likely to miss variants or produce false-positive results due to insufficient depth of coverage. Usually a standard depth (~50x-60x) sequencing in peripheral samples (such as blood) is recommended for WES. The mean coverage depth for WES in this study was 96.7x, which meant the quality of WES performed in our study was enough to make comparisons with targeted panel. Besides, panels produce a smaller data volume and thus save costs for data storage and analysis. Panels also offer a simpler workflow with a faster turnaround time for routine testing. Furthermore, the cost for panel sequencing in our study was ~1/30 of that for WES. To be specific, WES cost for each sample was >100 pounds (>800 yuan), whereas targeted sequencing just costs an average of ~5 pounds (~40 yuan) for each patient. Different panels vary in the number of genes included, thus leading to a variability of costs. The exact cost for each sample depend on the number of samples tested and will further decrease with increasing sample number. Moreover, a targeted gene panel avoids incidental uncovering of a genetic variant associated with other diseases and therefore circumvents ensuing ethical conflicts. Accordingly, in cases where the clinical information is highly consistent with several candidate genes, a targeted panel is a reasonable first-line choice. Our conclusions were consistent with previous studies. Researchers found that targeted gene panel was a faster and more effective screening method compared with WES for diagnosing early-onset inflammatory bowel disease, inherited retinal dystrophies, movement disorders, and Mendelian diseases.\n\n    However, targeted gene panel sequencing also has shortcomings. Since the genetic cause of most patients with severe obesity and diabetes remains elusive and more contributory genes are discovered, the panel established in this study is not comprehensive and might soon be out of date. By contrast, WES is not limited to the detection of known genes. When a new causative gene is identified, WES data are sufficient for re-analysis. The ACMG recommends WES to be applied in nonspecific cases or in cases where more specific genetic tests such as targeted gene panels have failed to provide a diagnosis. Our study showed that the main challenge for a diagnosis based on sequencing data is the classification of a variant's pathogenicity. Considering complicated clinical phenotypes of patients, unpublished causative variants, and lack of functional data, the current understanding of genes and variants often limits the optimal classification. The results of this study, therefore, not only serve a diagnostic purpose but also facilitate further research. The variants classified as VUS will be further evaluated to determine their clinical relevance. Additionally, our study did not routinely perform genetic testing on family members; therefore, the interpretation of the pathogenicity of variants was more challenging, especially those variants with a known recessive inheritance mode.\n\n    Although sequencing technologies have been greatly improved, the major limitations of both targeted panel sequencing and WES remain constant. Neither can identify changes in noncoding regions, and not all targeted exons have sufficient depth of coverage, especially those with a high GC content. Furthermore, chromosomal deletions, large structural variants, rearrangements, or duplications are not easily detected. Quite a few patients in this study did not have variants fitting their diagnosed disease despite their clinical data suggesting a genetic predisposition. Technically, WGS would overcome all the above limitations. Nonetheless, WGS is not yet widely available for clinical diagnosis because of its higher costs, the larger amount of data generated, and more complicated data processing. Therefore, the targeted gene panel is favoured for patients with specific phenotypes, whereas WES is preferred if a disease phenotype is nonspecific. However, if the targeted panel or WES yields negative results, WGS may be considered a secondary alternative.\n\n    In conclusion, targeted gene panel sequencing is a quick and less costly method compared to WES while generating data of higher quality for genes of interest. These characteristics make the use of targeted gene panels, particularly the panel presented in this study, a promising first-line solution for routine clinical diagnosis of monogenic obesity and diabetes. Subsequent WES can be an alternative method for unsolved cases. Our study helps to provide a more accurate clinical diagnosis of monogenic obesity and diabetes, subsequently paving the way for gene-based treatment and genetic counselling, which helps to move step-by-step towards precision medicine. However, further research in larger cohorts is needed in the future.",

        "Title": "    An Overview of Canine Inherited Neurological Disorders with Known Causal Variants",
        "Abstract": "    This review explores various inherited neurological conditions found in dogs, which can be present from birth or develop later in life. Researchers use two main methods to identify the genetic causes of these diseases: wide-ranging genetic investigations and focused investigations on specific genes. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals currently lists 418 Mendelian disorders in dogs, and 355 of them have their likely genetic causes identified. Most of the reviewed neurological disorders follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means that both parents must carry the faulty gene for their offspring to develop the disease. Some dog breeds are more susceptible to these conditions, with the Golden Retriever and Belgian Shepherd having multiple known inherited neurological disorders. The use of DNA tests is crucial in managing and eventually eliminating these inherited diseases in dogs.\n\n    Hereditary neurological conditions documented in dogs encompass congenital, neonatal, and late-onset disorders, along with both progressive and non-progressive forms. In order to identify the causal variant of a disease, the main two approaches are genome-wide investigations and candidate gene investigation. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals currently lists 418 Mendelian disorders specific to dogs, of which 355 have their likely causal genetic variant identified. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the canine nervous system phenes and their genetic causal variant. It has been noted that the majority of these diseases have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Additionally, the dog breeds that are more prone to develop such diseases are the Golden Retriever, in which six inherited neurological disorders with a known causal variant have been documented, and the Belgian Shepherd, in which five such disorders have been documented. DNA tests can play a vital role in effectively managing and ultimately eradicating inherited diseases.",
        "Introduction": "    Many hereditary neurological conditions have been documented in dogs. These conditions encompass congenital, neonatal, and late-onset disorders, along with both progressive and non-progressive forms. Consequently, it is possible for any dog with neurological clinical signs to have an underlying inherited disorder. In cases where the variant follows a recessive pattern, clinically affected animals are only born when there has been a history of inbreeding, leading to a dog inheriting two identical copies of the variant, one from each parent, which are both healthy. Consequently, specific inherited diseases are typically associated with particular breeds or closely related breeds due to their shared genetic heritage.\n\n    In order to identify the causal variant of a disease, the main two approaches are genome-wide investigations and candidate gene investigation. In a comprehensive genome-wide investigation, the entire genome is scrutinized to identify regions that are potentially harboring the variant(s) associated with a disease. This exploration can be conducted through pedigree-based linkage analysis, a genome-wide association study (GWAS), or whole genome sequencing. A GWAS analyzes a great number of genetic variants across multiple genomes to identify statistical associations with specific traits or diseases. This approach has yielded numerous strong associations for various traits and disorders, and the count of linked variants is anticipated to expand with larger GWAS sample sizes.\n\n    Diseases in dogs are more prevalent in particular purebred breeds due to founder effects that have arisen from centuries of highly selective breeding practices. In dogs, where genetic diversity is lower and linkage disequilibrium is significantly higher compared with humans, the investigation of diseases within purebred populations serves as a robust approach for genomic mapping. In 2005, the publication of the high-quality draft genome sequence of the domestic dog was accompanied by a comprehensive map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning various dog breeds.\n\n    Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) serves as a compendium that documents inherited disorders and single-locus traits, as well as associated genes and variants across 484 different animal species. OMIA currently lists 418 Mendelian disorders specific to dogs, of which 355 have their likely causal genetic variant identified.\n\n    This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the canine nervous system phenes and their genetic causal variant. Among them, categories are synthesized as follows: hereditary ataxias, lysosomal storage disorders, neuronal axonal dystrophy, hereditary neuropathies, congenital myasthenic syndromes, epilepsies, deafness, dyskinesias, encephalopathies and myelopathies, hypomyelinating disorders and leukodystrophies, neurometabolic disorders, and other inherited neurological conditions, which are presented below.\n\n    In humans, hereditary (cerebellar) ataxia encompasses a diverse range of neurodegenerative conditions that display variations in clinical signs, pathological features, and genetic origins. These disorders are characterized by the gradual deterioration of the cerebellum and, to varying extents, other structures outside the cerebellum. The primary clinical characteristic of cerebellar ataxia becomes apparent through clinical signs such as unsteadiness and a loss of coordination. Ataxia can either be the exclusive indication of cerebellar impairment or, more commonly, be accompanied by a diverse array of other neurological signs.\n\n    In a prior review article conducted by Urkasemsin et al. concerning hereditary ataxias in canines, five distinct categories were established based on neuropathological criteria: cerebellar cortical degenerations (CCDs), spinocerebellar degenerations, cerebellar ataxias with limited neurodegeneration, canine multiple system degeneration (CMSD), and episodic ataxia. These conditions are manifested across various dog breeds, each with differing onset ages, rates of advancement, combinations of clinical indicators, and specific locations of lesions within the central nervous system (CNS).\n\n    Cerebellar ataxia typically results in symmetric hypermetria, a type of dysmetria, characterized by unimpeded flexor actions, especially during gait, leading to exaggerated limb lifting. In contrast, spinocerebellar ataxia is often described as having a more dance-like or bouncing quality.\n\n    Research on ataxias in Belgian Shepherd dogs identified a potential causative genetic variant in the KCNJ10 gene linked to spongy degeneration with cerebellar ataxia, subtype 1. The study unveiled genetic diversity among dogs with similar clinical signs, implying the existence of multiple forms of cerebellar ataxia within the Belgian Shepherd breed. The onset of clinical signs was between 4.5 and 8.5 weeks of age, and the dogs exhibited an unsteady and irregular gait, characterized by a lack of coordination, particularly noticeable in the hind limbs. A notable 50% of the affected puppies displayed amplified and abnormal movements during locomotion. Additional inconsistent clinical manifestations included frequent stumbling, a staggering gait, unintentional shaking, and a hopping pattern reminiscent of a bunny, along with compromised equilibrium and instances of falling. The progression and severity of the clinical signs led to the puppies' euthanasia by the 4th month of their life. In Jack Russell terriers, a missense alteration in the gene (KCNJ10) responsible for the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 (c.627C>G) demonstrated a strong and statistically significant association with the condition.\n\n    An additional variant related to cerebellar ataxia was identified in Belgian Shepherd dogs. The likely causal variant involved a ~4.8 kilobase (kb) deletion in the critical interval, comprising exon 35 of the RALGAPA1 gene. Also, the same type of deletion is associated with atrophy of the CNS, particularly in the cerebellum. This deletion encompasses the entire sequence responsible for encoding the SELENOP protein and is anticipated to lead to the total absence of the selenoprotein P it encodes, which is essential for transporting selenium into the central nervous system.\n\n    Using a combined approach that combines linkage and homozygosity mapping, researchers pinpointed a critical region spanning approximately 10.6 megabases (Mb) on chromosome 5. This discovery emerged from the study of a Belgian Shepherd family where four puppies exhibited cerebellar dysfunction. Upon inspecting the 10.6 Mb interval in the whole-genome sequencing data from one affected puppy, a 227-base pair short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) insertion was identified within the ATP1B2 gene. This SINE insertion resulted in abnormal RNA splicing. Immunohistochemistry findings indicated a decrease in ATP1B2 protein expression within the central nervous system of the affected puppies. The variant ATP1B2:c.130_131ins227 was, therefore, considered the most probable causative candidate for a second subtype of spongy degeneration with cerebellar ataxia in Belgian Shepherd dogs, now referred to as spongy degeneration with cerebellar ataxia subtype 2 (SDCA2).\n\n    In Old English Sheepdogs and Gordon Setters with hereditary ataxia, a phenotype with onset between 6 months and 4 years of age was documented. Dogs exhibited prominent hypermetria, accompanied by a swaying of the trunk and intention tremors, with the symptoms progressively leading to significant gait disturbances. Cerebellar atrophy was detected through MRI. Targeted sequence capture and next-generation sequencing of the region identified an A to C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 113 in exon 1 of RAB24, a gene associated with autophagy.\n\n    An early onset progressive cerebellar ataxia was identified in the Norwegian Buhund, with signs including a wide-based stance and hypermetria in all limbs, alongside persistent head tremors and truncal ataxia. Whole-genome sequencing identified a T to C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the KCNIP4 gene (g.88890674T>C), predicted to cause a tryptophan to arginine substitution in a highly conserved region of the potassium voltage-gated channel interacting protein KCNIP4.\n\n    A similar early-onset phenotype, also known as Bandera's neonatal ataxia, was documented in the Coton de Tulear dog breed. The puppies presented at two weeks of age with intention tremors, head titubation, and pronounced ataxia in gait, stance, and ocular movements. The disorder was mapped via a GWAS, and a retrotransposon inserted into exon 8 of gene GRM1 (which encodes metabotropic glutamate receptor 1) was identified as a causal variant.\n\n    The analysis of early-onset progressive cerebellar ataxia in the Finnish Hound discovered a potential functional candidate gene, sel-1 suppressor of lin-12-like (SEL1L), and led to the discovery of a homozygous missense variant within a remarkably conserved protein domain. The affected puppies presented with swiftly progressing generalized cerebellar ataxia, tremors, and an inability to thrive. This variant is denoted as c.1972T>C, resulting in the amino acid change p.Ser658Pro.\n\n    Inherited ataxia in the Norwegian Elkhound, showing vestibulocerebellar signs with onset at 4 weeks of age and histologically distinguishable degenerations in the brain stem and cerebellum was associated with a 1 base pair (bp) deletion in the HACE1 gene, which resulted in a frameshift at codon 333 and a premature stop codon at codon 366.\n\n    Spinocerebellar ataxia, observed in the Parson Russell Terrier canine breed, is characterized by the onset of clinical signs, including gradual development of uncoordinated movement and a decline in balance, between 7 and 12 months of age. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the CAPN1 gene is strongly associated with this pathology. The gene is responsible for encoding the calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain1 (mu-calpain), and the variant leads to a substitution of cysteine with tyrosine at residue 115 of the CAPN1 protein.\n\n    In Italian Spinone dogs, there was a repetitive sequence expansion within intron 35 of the ITPR1 gene, resulting in reduced protein expression in Purkinje cells. This occurrence was highly correlated with the development of spinocerebellar ataxia.\n\n    In Alpine Dachsbracke dogs, with clinical signs including clinical manifestations such as a wide-based stance, spinocerebellar ataxia distinguished by hypermetria in the thoracic limbs, hyperflexion in the pelvic limbs, compromised balance, pendular nystagmus, and truncal swaying, a specific genetic variant affecting a protein within the essential region of the SCN8A gene (c.4898G>T; p.Gly1633Val) has been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia. SCN8A encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel.\n\n    In Belgian Shepherd dogs, a truncating variant causing loss of function in the SLC12A6 gene results in a phenotype associated with slowly progressing spinocerebellar ataxia, paraparesis, and muscle contractions resembling myokymia.\n\n    In Beagle dogs, neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration associated with signs of progressive cerebellar ataxia is linked to an 8 bp deletion in the SPTBN2 gene, which encodes beta-III spectrin.\n\n    Cerebellar abiotrophy is marked by the degeneration of Purkinje and granule cells within the cerebellar cortex, and is observed in the Australian Working Kelpie dog breed. The clinical signs associated with cerebellar abiotrophy encompass ataxia, head tremors, motor coordination difficulties, a wide-based stance, and a distinctive high-stepping gait. The disease is associated with a missense variant in exon 5 of the vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) gene.\n\n    Cerebellar cortical degeneration is a neurodegenerative disease that affects various dog breeds. The common presentation involves progressive cerebellar ataxia, with variations in the age of onset and progression rate among different breeds. In the Hungarian Vizsla, the clinical signs encompass pronounced hypermetric and dysmetric ataxia, swaying of the trunk, intentional tremors, the absence of menace responses, and positional horizontal nystagmus. The associated causal variant indicates an exon 26 splice donor variant in the sorting nexin 14 (SNX14) gene.\n\n    In Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers, a phenotype termed cerebellar degeneration:myositis complex with clinical signs of generalized ataxia and hypermetria, which was more pronounced in the pelvic limbs:was identified. The candidate causal variant was a missense (p.Pro446Leu) in the SLC25A12 gene.\n\n    A Dandy-Walker-like malformation arises from abnormal brain development and is primarily characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia. Specifically, it involves the consistent absence of the rear parts of the cerebellar vermis and, to a lesser extent, the posterior portions of the cerebellar hemispheres, often accompanied by substantial fluid accumulation behind the cerebellum. Dogs affected by this condition exhibit non-progressive ataxia, with the severity of ataxia varying from mild signs, such as trunk swaying, subtle uncoordinated gait, balance issues, and hind limb ataxia, to severe cerebellar ataxia in puppies and episodes of rolling or falling. This condition in Eurasier dogs is associated with a single bp deletion (c.1713delC) in the VLDLR gene.\n\n    In Australian Shepherd dogs affected by hereditary ataxia, clinical signs consisted of moderate ataxia, particularly noticeable in the pelvic limbs. There was also a slight tendency toward overstepping (hypermetria) and minimal-to-no deficits in proprioception in the pelvic limbs. These signs indicated symmetric involvement of the cerebellum. The likely causal variant was a duplication (c.1169_1170dupTT) located in located in the PNPLA8 gene.\n\n    An inherited neurodegenerative disorder was described in the Lagotto Romagnolo, which experienced a gradual onset of cerebellar ataxia, occasionally accompanied by intermittent nystagmus and alterations in behavior. The clinical entity was named neurodegenerative vacuolar storage disease, based on the histological examination, which showed extensive enlargement and clear formation of vacuoles within the neuronal cytoplasm, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The causal variant was identified as a missense change (c.1288G>A) in the autophagy-related ATG4D gene.\n\n    Canine multiple system degeneration (CMSD) is a progressive inherited neurodegenerative condition, typically marked by the degeneration and depletion of neurons in the cerebellum, olivary nuclei, substantia nigra, and caudate nuclei. Dogs that are affected by this condition appear normal until they reach the age of 3-6 months, at which point they begin to exhibit cerebellar ataxia. The ataxia worsens over time, leading to akinesia and severe postural instability, ultimately requiring euthanasia between 1 and 2 years of age. This condition has been linked to two separate breed-specific autosomal recessive variants in the SERAC1 gene. In the Kerry Blue Terrier, it involves a nonsense variant (c.1536G>A) and, in the Chinese Crested, a 4-base pair deletion (c.182+1_182+4del).\n\n    Lysosomal storage disorders are hereditary ailments triggered by genetic defects within lysosomal structures. These defects lead to insufficiencies in one of three components: lysosomal enzymes, transmembrane proteins, or activator proteins. Consequently, there is an abnormal buildup of biomolecules within the lysosomes of certain cell types.\n\n    The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), also known as Batten disease, represent a set of inheritable lysosomal storage disorders marked by ongoing neurodegeneration, alongside the buildup of self-fluorescent lysosomal storage granules in the central nervous system and various other tissues. Individuals affected by these conditions experience vision impairment, gradual deterioration in both motor and cognitive functions, and episodes of seizures. Typically, the disease progresses to a state of continuous vegetative existence and early mortality. Presently, there is no successful treatment available for any of the NCLs.\n\n    In Dachshunds dogs affected by NCL type 1, the onset of clinical signs was at 7 months of age and the causal variant was found to be a single nucleotide insertion within exon 8 of the PPT1 gene. This gene is responsible for encoding the enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1. Also, a case study reported a Cane Corso diagnosed with the same pathology but with a splice donor variant (c.124+1G>A) of the same gene.\n\n    NCL type 2 was also identified in Dachshunds with the same onset age as NCL type 1, and the variant responsible for the condition is a single nucleotide deletion (c.325delC) occurring in exon 4 of the TPP1 gene. This deletion results in a frameshift of the amino acid codons and the premature emergence of a stop codon.\n\n    For NCL type 5, the onset age is between 1 and 2 years of age and the responsible variants have been identified in Border Collies, Australian Cattle dogs, and Golden Retrievers. For Border Collies and Australian Cattle dogs, a nonsense variant (c.619C>T) within exon 4 of the CLN5 gene was identified as the causal variant. In Golden Retrievers, a deletion (c.934_935delAG) within the same gene was predicted to cause a frameshift, resulting in a premature termination codon and the production of a protein variant lacking 39 C-terminal amino acids.\n\n    In Australian Shepherd dogs, NCL type 6 was linked to a missense variant involving a T to C variant (c.829T>C) located in exon 7 of the CLN6 gene. This transition from T to C leads to an amino acid alteration, changing tryptophan to arginine in the predicted protein sequence.\n\n    In Chihuahuas and Chinese Crested dogs affected by NCL type 7, the underlying variant is a single-base pair deletion (c.843delT) found within the MFSD8 gene. This deletion is expected to induce a frameshift and an early stop codon, ultimately leading to the production of a truncated protein lacking the last 239 C-terminal amino acids.\n\n    For NCL type 8, the onset of clinical signs is at 14-18 months and the causal variant was firstly identified in the English Setter and involves a T to C transition in the CLN8 gene that predicts a p.L164P missense variant. In the Alpine Dachsbracke, the causal variant involves the deletion of the entire CLN8 gene, while, in Salukis, a single bp insertion (c.349dupT) in exon 2 of the same gene is involved. Additionally, in German Shorthaired Pointers and Australian Shepherds, a CLN8:c.585G>A transition in the same gene (CLN8) that predicts a CLN8:p.Trp195* nonsense variant was determined as the causal variant.\n\n    In the case of American Bulldogs suffering from NCL type 10, those affected were found to carry a homozygous A allele due to a G to A transition within the cathepsin D gene (CTSD). The onset of clinical signs was before the age of 2. This genetic alteration results in the conversion of methionine-199 to isoleucine.\n\n    In Tibetan Mastiffs with NCL type 12, the onset of clinical signs was at 4 to 6 years of age. The responsible variant was found in the canine ATP13A2 gene. NCL-affected dogs were identified as homozygous for a single-base deletion within ATP13A2, which is expected to result in a frameshift and the emergence of a premature termination codon. A c.1118C>T variant in the same gene that predicts a nonconservative p.(Thr373Ile) amino acid substitution was identified as causal for the same disease in Australian Cattle dogs.\n\n    In Dalmatians, a progressive neurological condition was documented. The onset was at around 1.5 years of age, and included heightened anxiety, increased sensitivity to stimuli, cognitive decline, disrupted sleep patterns, diminished coordination, and urinary and fecal incontinence, as well as visual impairments. The age of onset and the severity varied among individuals. Intracellular inclusions displaying autofluorescence were identified in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, optic nerve, and cardiac muscle, concurrently correlating with immunolabeling of the lysosomal marker protein LAMP2 and binding of antibodies to mitochondrial ATPase subunit c. The likely causal variant was a single-base deletion and frameshift near the 3'-end of the CNP gene.\n\n    The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) constitute a varied collection of lysosomal storage diseases distinguished by the inadequate function of specific lysosomal enzymes vital for the complete degradation of glycosaminoglycans. For MPS type I, the clinical manifestations include stunted growth, the development of degenerative joint ailments, pronounced bone abnormalities (dysostosis multiplex), cardiac complications, and impaired vision, attributable to the presence of corneal clouding. The specific enzymatic modification is a marked deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase activity. In the Plott Hound, a G to A transition in the donor splice site of intron 1 of the IDUA gene was identified as the causal variant. Variants within the same IDUA gene are also incriminated in the occurrence of MPS type I in Boston Terriers (an 8-nucleotide insertion) and in Golden Retriever (a 287 bp deletion resulting in full deletion of exon 10).\n\n    MPS type IIIA is a hereditary disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, stemming from a deficiency in heparan sulfate sulfamidase. The disorder was identified in Dachshunds and New Zealand Huntaway dogs. In Dachshunds, the onset age was 3 years and the dogs displayed pelvic limb ataxia, which gradually intensified over the course of 1 to 2 years, leading to pronounced and widespread spinocerebellar ataxia. The causal variant was identified as a 3-bp deletion in the SGSH gene. In New Zealand Huntaway dogs, a more severe phenotype was documented, in which the disease onset occurred at approximately 1.5 years of age and swiftly progressed over a period of one month, resulting in profound ataxia. The causal variant was identified as a single bp insertion in the same SGSH gene.\n\n    MPS type IIIB was identified in the Schipperke dog breed. The clinical signs were observed at approximately 3 years of age and were consistent with cerebellar disease, including hind limb ataxia, dysmetria, and a broad-based stance accompanied by trunk swaying. Mildly dystrophic corneas and small peripheral areas of retinal degeneration were also observed. MPS type III is characterized by a progressive nature that ultimately necessitates humane euthanasia before the age of six. Deficient enzymatic activity was noticed for the lysosomal glycosidase N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminidase. The causal variant was identified within exon 6, characterized by an insertion composed of a 40-70 bp poly-A and an 11 bp duplication of the exonic region preceding the poly-A within the NAGLU gene.\n\n    MPS type VI is induced by decreased or absent activity of the lysosomal enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (or arylsulfatase B). In Miniature-Poodle-like dogs, the presentation for clinical examination was at 2.5 years, with signs of gross joint laxity and the development of bilateral corneal opacities. Radiological assessment identified malformed vertebral bodies, widespread epiphyseal dysplasia, and luxation/subluxation of the lumbosacral and appendicular joints, accompanied by underdevelopment of the hyoid apparatus and odontoid process. The degenerative nature of the disorder led to euthanasia by the age of 3, due to the decreasing quality of life. A 22 bp deletion in exon 1 of the ARSB gene was pinpointed as the causal variant. In Great Danes with similar clinical signs but with their onset at 4 months, a nonsense variant at position 295 in exon 1 of the same gene (ARSB) was identified. In Miniature Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers with MPS type VI, two different types of variants were identified in the ARSB gene: a 56 bp deletion at the junction of exon 1 (for the Miniature Schnauzers) and a missense variant in exon 5 (for the Miniature Pinschers).\n\n    MPS type VII is an hereditary disorder caused by a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal acid hydrolase beta-glucuronidase. A case report documented MPS type VII in a German Shepherd, with onset of the clinical signs at the age of 3 months. Signs included disproportionate dwarfism, excessive joint flexibility, muscular atrophy of the limbs, and bilateral cloudy corneas with diffuse granularities. A missense variant at nucleotide 599 within the GUSB gene was identified as the causal variant. In Brazilian Terriers, the affected puppies exhibited profound skeletal deformities, noticeable during the initial month of life. Radiographic imaging and histology revealed delayed ossification and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. The progressive nature of the disease let to the euthanasia of the affected dogs. The causal variant was a missense variant (c.866C>T) of the same GUSB gene.\n\n    A late onset form of mucopolysaccharidosis associated with reduced arylsulfatase activity was identified in an American Staffordshire Terrier. The onset of the disorder was between the ages of 3 and 5 years, with signs of ataxia and no visual impairment specific to other NCLs. MRI and necropsy examination revealed cerebellar atrophy. The causal variant was identified as a G to A substitution in exon 2 of the ARSG gene.\n\n    Alpha-mannosidosis represents an inherited lysosomal storage disorder distinguished by immune deficiency, facial and skeletal irregularities, hearing impairment, and cognitive disability. The disorder was identified in a Doberman Pinscher at two months of age, and included an unusually broad calvarium, protrusive frontal sinuses, proprioceptive ataxia, dulled cognitive function, and moderate divergent strabismus. As the disease progressed, the dog was euthanized at 14 months of age due to indications of dementia and evident hallucinatory behavior. A deficiency in the alpha-mannosidase enzyme activity was detected, together with specific autofluorescent vacuolar inclusions. The causal variant was a missense variant (Asp104Gly) in the MAN2B1 gene.\n\n    Beta-mannosidosis denotes an inherited anomaly within glycoprotein catabolism. In a German Shepherd, the onset of the disorder was noticed at 2 months of age, with signs such as slow growth, retained deciduous teeth, and deafness. At 8 months of age, euthanasia was decided due to the stiffness and weakness in the neck and hind limbs, proprioceptive deficits in all four limbs, and depressed mental status. The specific deficiency in beta-mannosidase activity was also detected. The identified causal genetic variant was a T to A transition occurring within exon 4 of the MANBA gene. A different variant was identified in a mixed breed dog with beta-mannosidosis consisting of five bp tandem duplication in exon 16 of the same MANBA gene.\n\n    GM1 gangliosidosis is a degenerative neurosomatic lysosomal storage disorder attributed to variants in the GLB1 gene, which encodes the enzyme beta-galactosidase. The onset age is around 5 months, and dogs affected by the condition typically exhibit dwarfism and advancing cerebellar impairment, together with limb weakness. Manifestations encompass weight loss, ataxia, a broad-based gait, diminished proprioception, intention tremors of the head, hypermetria, dysmetria, internal strabismus, and positional nystagmus. A loss of beta-galactosidase activity is also noted. In Portuguese Water Dogs, the identified variant was a G to A transition in the exon 2 of the GLB1 gene, while, in the Shiba Inu and Miniature Shiba Inu, the identified variant was a deletion of a single bp (cytosine) in exon 15 of the same GLB1 gene. In the Alaskan Husky, the causal variant associated with GM1 gangliosidosis was a 19 bp insertion (duplication) in exon 15 of the GLB1 gene.\n\n    The GM2 gangliosidoses refer to a collection of lysosomal storage disorders distinguished by the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and related glycolipids, primarily within neurons. In Japanese Chin dogs, the onset age of the clinical signs in individuals with GM2 gangliosidosis type I was approximately 18 months of age, and included gradually worsening cerebellar ataxia, alterations in mental state, and visual impairment. An MRI of the brain showed diffuse atrophy, and an increase in beta-hexosaminidase was noticed. The degenerative nature of the disorder culminates in either death or necessitates euthanasia within a few months. The causal variant for this disorder in Japanese Chin dogs was pinpointed to a G to A transition in exon 8 of the HEXA gene. Similar clinical signs were noted in GM2 gangliosidosis type II (or variant 0), but with an earlier onset by the age of 1, and occurrence of death by the age of 2. Additionally, a significant decrease in beta-hexosaminidase activity was identified. A single bp deletion of guanine in exon 3 of the HEXB gene was associated with the disorder in the Toy Poodle, while, in the Shiba Inu, the causal variant was a 3 bp deletion within the same gene.\n\n    Glycogen storage disease type II (also known as Pompe disease in humans) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that arises from the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase. The disorder was identified in Finnish and Swedish Lapphunds, with onset of clinical signs at around 6 months of age, and included severe vomiting, together with marked developing muscle weakness. As the disease progressed, constant panting, difficulty in breathing, altered vocalization, and difficulties in swallowing were evident, as a consequence of the myocardial hypertrophy and esophageal dilatation. The characteristic severe deficiency in acid alpha-glucosidase was noted. Affected dogs usually survive to the age of 2 years. A missense (c.2237G>A) within GAA gene, which results in a premature stop codon, was identified as the causal variant.\n\n    Alpha fucosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder, emerges due to the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase, resulting in the accumulation of undegraded fucose-rich substances within various organs. The disorder is documented in the English Springer Spaniel, occurring at the age of 6 months with behavioral changes. As the disease advances, signs include gradually worsening ataxia, impaired proprioception, alterations in temperament, difficulties in swallowing, altered vocalization, loss of acquired behaviors, muscle atrophy, and apparent visual impairment. Typically, affected dogs succumb to the illness or require euthanasia by the age of 3 to 4 years. The causal variant in affected dogs was pinpointed to a 14-base pair deletion at the 3' end of exon 1 in the FUCA1 gene.\n\n    Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive condition that arises due to an insufficiency in galactocerebrosidase activity. In dogs, clinical sign occurs between 4 and 6 weeks of age. Dogs affected by the condition typically exhibit initial signs of tremors and weakness in the pelvic limbs, which subsequently advance to pelvic limb ataxia and dysmetria in the thoracic limbs. This is succeeded by the onset of tetraparesis and, ultimately, paralysis in the hind limbs between the ages of 3 to 5 months, requiring euthanasia. In the Cairn Terrier and West Highland White Terrier, a base substitution (A to C transversion) at position 473 of the complementary DNA for the GALC gene was identified as the causal variant. In the Irish Setter, a 78 bp insertion within the same gene was pinpointed as the causal variant. Also, in a cohort of mixed breed puppies, a missense variant in the GALC gene was the likely cause of Krabbe disease.\n\n    Neuroaxonal dystrophy (NAD) is a neurodegenerative condition with a distinct histological presentation that can affect either the central or peripheral nervous system, and that lacks specificity in its clinical presentation. NAD is identified by the presence of localized axonal swellings, known as spheroids, and axonal atrophy. Puppies with this condition typically display fetal akinesia, scoliosis, arthrogryposis, cerebellar hypoplasia, pulmonary hypoplasia, thinning of the patellar tendon, spinal cord hypoplasia, and, ultimately, experience respiratory failure.\n\n    For NAD, the causal variant has been identified in a few dog breeds. In Papillon dogs, the c.1579G>A missense variant in the PLA2G6 gene has been associated with the presence of this pathology. A missense variant (g.14777774T > C; p.H835R) is also responsible for the NAD phenotype in young adult Rottweiler dogs, yet the variant is located in the vacuolar protein sorting 11 (VPS11) gene. Additionally, in Spanish Water Dogs, juvenile-onset NAD was associated with a missense variant (c.4009C>T or p.R1337W) in the canine tectonin beta-propeller repeat-containing protein 2 (TECPR2) gene. Other than the above-mentioned missense variants, a 3-nucleotide deletion in exon 13 of mitofusin 2 (MFN2) was associated with fetal-onset NAD in a breeding colony maintained at Michigan State University.\n\n    The clinical manifestations of sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathies vary in accordance with the dysfunctions of the affected nerves. Canine inherited polyneuropathies are homologous to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in humans, sharing similar clinical signs and responsible gene variants. It is important to highlight that inherited sensory and autonomic neuropathies are less prevalent than inherited motor and sensory neuropathies.\n\n    In mixed breed dogs with an absence of superficial and deep pain perception in the entire body, a missense variant (p.Arg921Cys) in the SCN9A gene was associated with this pathology.\n\n    Sensory ataxic neuropathy (SAN) is a neurological condition observed in Golden Retrievers. SAN typically begins subtly during puppyhood and advances gradually. Both males and females are equally affected. Dogs with SAN exhibit signs of ataxia, deficits in postural reactions, and diminished or completely absent spinal reflexes. A DeltaT5304 deletion in the mitochondrially encoded tRNA tyrosine (MT-TY or tRNATyr) gene was identified as a causal variant.\n\n    In mixed breed dogs with chronic progressive proprioceptive ataxia manifesting as generalized muscle atrophy, mainly of the pelvic limbs, spontaneous knuckling, and self-mutilating wounds on the distal part of the pelvic limbs, a missense variant (c.656C > T, p.P219L) in the reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1 or FAM134B) gene was pinpointed as the plausible causal variant. In Border Collies with similar symptomatology, an inversion within the same gene (FAM134B) was identified as a causal variant.\n\n    For acral mutilation syndrome, clinical signs manifest early in young puppies and typically include insensitivity to pain in the extremities, sometimes accompanied by sudden, intense biting, licking, and severe self-inflicted injuries to the feet. Proprioception, motor skills, and reflexes of the spinal cord remain unaffected. For this syndrome, a variant that alters the binding of the regulatory complex located 90 kb upstream of the GDNF gene was identified as a causal variant in German short-haired Pointers, English Pointers, English Springer Spaniels, and French Spaniels.\n\n    A hereditary polyneuropathy has been identified in Leonberger and Saint Bernard dogs. This condition is a severe, juvenile-onset, chronic, and progressive mixed polyneuropathy. It is marked by clinical signs such as exercise intolerance, irregular gait, and muscle wasting in the hind limbs, as well as inspiratory stridor and breathing difficulties. A variant in the ARHGEF10 gene was pinpointed as causal and its sequencing revealed a 10-base pair deletion in dogs with this condition. This deletion encompasses four nucleotides from the 3'-end of exon 17 and six nucleotides from the 5'-end of intron 17. In Leonberger dogs, an additional association between polyneuropathies and a 2 bp deletion in the GJA9 gene was confirmed.\n\n    In Miniature Schnauzers affected by demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy, a 40-base pair deletion was discovered at the 3' end of exon 19 within the SBF2 gene as the causal variant. This deletion results in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncation of the protein by 1070 amino acids.\n\n    Polyneuropathy in the juvenile Greyhound was associated with a 10 bp deletion in exon 15 of the canine NDRG1 gene. Additionally, early-onset progressive polyneuropathy in Alaskan Malamutes was linked to a non-synonymous variant (G>T) occurring in exon 4 of the of the same (NDRG1) gene. This variant results in an amino acid substitution, changing glycine to valine at position 98.\n\n    In Black Russian Terriers with polyneuropathy with ocular abnormalities and neuronal vacuolation, a single nucleotide deletion (c.743delC) within the RAB3GAP1 gene was pinpointed as the causal variant. The same variant was identified in Rottweilers suffering from neuronal vacuolation and spinocerebellar degeneration. The same gene (RAB3GAP1) is involved in the occurrence of polyneuropathy with ocular abnormalities and neuronal vacuolation in Alaskan Huskies, but the causal variant is a 218 bp SINE insertion into exon 7.\n\n    Another entity known as laryngeal paralysis and polyneuropathy features dyspnea and stridor, dysphagia, dysphonia, high-stepping and uncoordinated gait, exercise intolerance, stumbling and tripping, and limb muscle atrophy. A missense variant (p.Gly937Glu) in the CNTNAP1 gene was associated with laryngeal paralysis and polyneuropathy in the Leonberger, Saint Bernard, and Labrador Retriever.\n\n    Myasthenia gravis is a condition impacting neuromuscular communication in dogs and cats. It has traditionally been classified into an acquired or autoimmune form, marked by autoantibodies targeting the neuromuscular junction and typically manifesting after 6 months of age, and a congenital form, which lacks neuromuscular junction autoimmunity and tends to manifest within the first few weeks to months of life. Congenital syndromes affecting the neuromuscular junction, resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue, are collectively referred to as congenital myasthenic syndromes. The term myasthenia gravis exclusively pertains to autoimmunity against the neuromuscular junction.\n\n    In Jack Russel Terriers with congenital myasthenic syndromes manifested as generalized muscle weakness at 7 weeks of age, the causal variant was identified as a single-base insertion occurring in exon 7 of the CHRNE gene. This insertion results in a frameshift variant and the appearance of a premature stop codon. A similar single-base variant within the same gene (CHRNE) was identified as the plausible candidate in the Heideterrier, with lack of reflexes and coordination of the front limbs. In Old Danish Pointer dogs with congenital myasthenic syndrome, a G to A missense variant in exon 6 of the gene encoding choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) was identified as possibly causal.\n\n    According to the International League Against Epilepsy, an epileptic seizure is expounded as the temporary manifestation of signs arising from irregular and heightened neuronal activity in the brain, while epilepsy is a brain disorder distinguished by a persistent inclination to experiencing an epileptic seizure. This description of epilepsy mandates the presence of a minimum of one epileptic seizure for classification. This particular definition of epilepsy mandates the presence of at least one epileptic seizure, although one could argue that, for a comprehensive diagnosis of epilepsy, it is necessary for the individual to undergo two distinct occurrences of seizures, indicating a repeated pattern.\n\n    A type of generalized myoclonic epilepsy with photosensitivity in young dogs was identified in the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed. The mean age of onset age of clinical signs was 6 months, based on the study of 95 individuals. The myoclonic twitches predominantly manifested when the dogs were lying down, in a state of relaxation, drowsiness, or during initial phases of sleep. On occasion, these twitches also emerged when the dogs were in a seated, standing, or ambulatory posture. The progression from myoclonic seizures to generalized tonic-clonic seizures was observed in 38% of dogs within 6 months after the onset. The diagnostic examinations did not reveal any uniform structural irregularities. Visual stimulus-induced seizures were recorded in 35% of the Rhodesian Ridgebacks with generalized myoclonic epilepsy. The causal variation involves a 4-bp deletion in the exon 2 of the DIRAS1 gene.\n\n    Another phenotype of epilepsy known as benign familial juvenile epilepsy (or remitting focal epilepsy) was identified in the Lagotto Romagnolo. The onset of seizures occurs during early life, typically between five and nine weeks of age, with spontaneous remission by thirteen weeks of age. Afflicted puppies show generalized tremors, lack of coordination, and stiffness during seizures, while severe cases may exhibit additional neurological signs such as unsteady gait and excessive muscle activity between epileptic episodes. BFJE puppies exhibit epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram, both during and between epileptic episodes. The associated causal variant concerns the truncation (c.1552A>T) of the LGI2 gene, which prevents secretion and action on neuronal ADAM receptors.\n\n    Lafora disease (myoclonus epilepsy of Lafora) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder identified by the buildup of polyglucosan bodies, also known as Lafora bodies, within the perikaryon and dendrites of neurons in the central nervous system. This condition results in the gradual onset of neurological impairments, predominantly recognized by the presence of myoclonic epilepsy. Lafora disease is characterized by progressive myoclonic epilepsy with a late onset of the clinical signs (8.3 years, median for Beagles) and initial clinical manifestation consisting of myoclonic episodes, accompanied by episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The causal variation was first identified in the Miniature Wirehaired Dachshund and involved a range of 19 to 26 copies of a 12-nucleotide sequence (dodecamer) within the canine NHLRC1 gene (formerly EPM2B). The same variation was also identified in other canine breeds diagnosed with Lafora disease such as the Newfoundland, Chihuahua, and Pembroke Welsh Corgi.\n\n    A particular form of epilepsy was documented in the Parson Russell Terrier (epilepsy with mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration). The disease commenced with epileptic seizures typically emerging between 6 and 12 weeks of age and rapidly advanced to a state of status epilepticus, culminating in death or necessitating euthanasia. Histological analysis unveiled an occurrence of acute neuronal degeneration and necrosis, diffusely impacting the grey matter across the entire brain, accompanied by accumulation of amyloid-beta and substantial intraneuronal crowding of mitochondria. The pinpointed causal variant was a 6-bp deletion in the PITRM1 gene.\n\n    The ear serves as a highly intricate sensory apparatus accountable for hearing, as well as the vestibular regulation of posture and ocular movements. Disorders affecting the inner ear are prevalent among dogs and cats, frequently linked with neurological impairment such as deafness, peripheral vestibular syndrome, Horner's syndrome, and facial paralysis.\n\n    The occurrence of congenital deafness is widespread across dog breeds. In Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs, a missense variant of the KLF7 gene was associated with deafness in this breed. In the Beauceron breed, bilateral hearing loss was associated with a missense variant in the CDH23 gene. A particular type of early onset adult deafness was identified in Rhodesian Ridgebacks, with occurrence within the first 1-2 years of life. The associated variant was a 12 bp deletion in the EPS8L2 gene. In Rottweilers, sensorineural bilateral deafness with onset at a few weeks of age was associated with a missense variant in the LOXHD1 gene.\n\n    A particular phenotype of deafness also includes vestibular deficits. This phenotype was identified in the Doberman Pinscher breed, with onset of the vestibular deficits between birth and 10 weeks of age. In the case of affected Doberman Pinscher puppies, clinical observations confirmed the presence of both bilateral vestibular dysfunction and bilateral deafness. As the puppies commenced their early locomotor activities and nursing behaviors, the vestibular dysfunction became evident through conspicuous side-to-side movements of the head and neck, frequent instances of body collapse, a characteristic \"bobble-head\" appearance, and intermittent head tilting. Notably, the puppies exhibited an absence of startle responses, and brainstem auditory evoked response tests indicated complete sensorineural deafness. Subsequent histological examinations of inner ear tissue confirmed cochlear anomalies, revealing a complete degeneration of the organ of Corti without involvement of the stria vascularis, indicative of consistent neuroepithelial degeneration. The likely causal variant was identified as a missense (c.3719G>A) variant in the MYO7A gene. Also, in the Doberman Pinscher, a slightly different phenotype was documented, with dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system and unilateral deafness caused by a single-base insertion in the exon 39 of the PTPRQ gene.\n\n    Movement disorders encompass a diverse range of conditions found in both humans and animals, marked by involuntary movements that occur without alterations in consciousness. During an episode, the affected dogs do not display signs of autonomic dysfunction, show abnormalities in electroencephalographic patterns, or undergo changes in consciousness. In the field of veterinary medicine, the term 'paroxysmal dyskinesia' is employed as a broad phrase to refer to the recurring, sudden, and involuntary contraction of a set of skeletal muscles. In Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers with paroxysmal dyskinesia, having incidents of hyperkinesia and dystonia that persisted from several minutes to several hours, the possible causal variant was identified as a transition (c.398C>T) in the PIGN gene. In Markiesje dogs, a juvenile form of paroxysmal dyskinesia was described. The affected puppies displayed severe clinical signs, including weakness in all four limbs, dystonia, muscle cramps, and stumbling or falling over when attempting to walk. The plausible causal variant was identified as an indel variant in the SOD1 gene, in which a G-nucleotide of the fourth codon of the gene is replaced by a CAC-trinucleotide.\n\n    Hyperekplexia (startle disease) is a neurological disorder with onset at birth, in which puppies exhibit involuntary 'startle responses' characterized by widespread or sporadic stiffening of their limbs, triggered by sudden handling or loud noises. In the Irish Wolfhound, the affected puppies also experienced cyanosis and pneumonia while feeding, resulting from prolonged episodes of stiffness that lead to apnea. The causal variant in the Irish Wolfhound concerns a 4.2 kb microdeletion encompassing exons 2 and 3 in the SLC6A5 gene. In the Spanish Greyhound, a two-base pair deletion in exon 9 of the same gene (SLC6A5) was identified as the causal variant. In the Miniature Australian Shepherd with clinical signs resembling hyperekplexia, the causal variant pinpointed a 36-bp deletion spanning the exon-intron boundary in the glycine receptor alpha 1 (GLRA1) gene.\n\n    Weimaraner dogs have been documented to exhibit a syndrome characterized by paroxysmal dystonia-ataxia. During these episodes, affected dogs displayed an abnormal gait marked by dystonia, ataxia, and hypermetria, sometimes leading to occasional collapses. Additional consistent features included kyphosis and holding the head low. The onset of signs occurred between 3 and 7 months of age. Emotional arousal or physical activity was noted as causal for these episodes, and could occur multiple times daily, lasting between 5 and 15 min. A frameshift variant (c.831dupC) in the TNR gene was identified as the plausible causal variant.\n\n    Episodic falling syndrome is a condition of sudden, temporary muscle stiffness observed in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. These episodes are typically triggered by exercise, stress, or excitement, and are characterized by increasing muscle stiffness in the front and hind limbs, leading to a distinct 'deer-stalking' posture and possible collapse. The syndrome is a paroxysmal hypertonicity disorder, and in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels the plausible causal variant pinpoints a 15.7 kb deletion in the BCAN gene.\n\n    Neonatal encephalopathy with seizures is an inherited disease specific to Standard Poodles. Puppies affected by this condition are born small and do not undergo normal development. At around 3 weeks of age, they exhibit signs including weakness, ataxia, tremors throughout their bodies, a wide-based stance with increased muscle stiffness, and weakness in their core muscles leading to neck ventroflexion. At around 3 to 6 weeks of age, they experience generalized clonic-tonic seizures and eventually become recumbent on their sides with rigid extensions and opisthotonus posture. Most of the puppies do not survive beyond 7 weeks of age. The causal variant is a missense c.152T>G transversion in the ATF2 gene.\n\n    Subacute necrotizing encephalopathy was described in the Alaskan Husky and Yorkshire Terrier. Clinical signs have an acute onset and include multifocal central nervous system deficits such as altered mentation, seizures, absent menace response, central blindness, dysphagia, hypermetria, proprioceptive positioning deficits, ataxia, tetraparesis, and facial hypoalgesia. For the Alaskan Husky, the likely causal variant was a 4 bp insertion (c.624insTTGC) and SNP (c.625C>A) in the exon 2 of the SLC19A3 gene, while, for the Yorkshire Terrier, the indel affecting ~45 bp was located in exon 2 of the same gene.\n\n    Hereditary necrotizing myelopathy is characterized by progressive ataxia and paralysis. The disease was described in the Dutch Kooiker, which exhibited exaggerated spinal reflexes and postural deficits in the hind limbs. The causal variant was identified in the IBA57 gene associated with the iron-sulfur cluster assembly, resulting in an amino acid substitution known as R147W.\n\n    Canine degenerative myelopathy is a deadly neurodegenerative disease that occurs in adulthood and shares numerous similarities with an upper-motor-neuron-onset variant of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The initial degeneration of upper motor neurons results in spastic paraparesis, and, as the condition progresses, affected dogs develop general proprioceptive ataxia in their hind limbs. As the disease advances, lower motor neuron signs become apparent, including ascending tetraparesis, flaccid paralysis, and widespread muscle atrophy. The first identified potential causative variant was a G to A transition (c.118G>A) located in exon 2 of the SOD1 gene. This variant was documented in more than 120 dog breeds. The responsible variant was exclusively detected in Bernese Mountain dogs and involves a c.52A>T transition within the SOD1 gene. This variant leads to the substitution of threonine with serine at position 18 in the amino acid sequence.\n\n    In Golden Retrievers with congenital hypomyelinating polyneuropathy, variants in three genes were identified as likely causal. The first variant concerns the MTMR2 (myotubulin-related protein 2) gene and is a G to A transition, located within the splice site at the end of exon 12. The second variant involves the MPZ (myelin protein zero) gene and is a missense located in exon 3. The third variant is a C to T nonsense variant in exon 11 of the SH3TC2 (SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats 2) gene.\n\n    Hypomyelination of the central nervous system was first described in the Chow-Chow. The affected dogs exhibited a wide-based stance in their hind limbs and displayed a 'rocking-horse' motion of their entire bodies when trying to walk. Hypermetria was noticeably pronounced in all of their limbs, and they adopted a 'rabbit-hopping' gait when walking on their hind limbs. In affected Weimaraners, the distinctive abnormality observed was the presence of dysmyelination in the peripheral region of the spinal cord, particularly prominent in the cervical and thoracic levels. The variant responsible for the condition in Weimaraners was identified as a deletion of a single A nucleotide within exon 9 of the gene that codes for folliculin-interacting protein 2 (FNIP2).\n\n    For X-linked tremor, the affected puppies may have a smaller size compared with their littermates and commonly display challenges in standing, along with ataxia and widespread tremors that typically manifest at around 10-12 days of age. The affected dogs often do not survive past 3-4 months of age. Significant hypomyelination is evident throughout the central nervous system, with more pronounced effects observed in the cerebrum and optic nerves, compared with the spinal cord. This medical condition was described in the Springer Spaniel, and the variant responsible for the condition is a point variant occurring at position 219 within exon 2 of the coding sequence of the PLP1 gene, leading to a substitution of histidine with proline in the protein.\n\n    The leukodystrophies represent a cluster of hereditary disorders affecting the white matter, characterized by a diverse genetic basis, substantial phenotypic diversity, and a disease onset at all ages.\n\n    Canine inherited spongiform leukoencephalomyelopathy (or leukodystrophy) is characterized by widespread vacuolation in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. In Australian Cattle Dogs and Shetland Sheepdogs, the individuals affected by this condition exhibited tremors starting at 2-9 weeks of age, followed by a progressive neurological deterioration that included ataxia, muscle weakness, paralysis, spasticity, and dysfunction of cranial nerves. The entity is associated with a G to A transition (c.14474G>A) in the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome b (CYTB). In Standard Schnauzers with leukodystrophy, a missense variant affecting exon 5 of the TSEN54 gene was identified as the likely causal variant. In Great Danes and Rottweilers with leukoencephalomyelopathy, a 1 bp insertion (c.345_346insC) in the NAPEPLD gene was pinpointed as the causal variant, while, in Leonbergers, a missense variant (c.538G>C) within the same gene (NAPEPLD) was identified as causal.\n\n    Alexander disease, also part of the leukodystrophies group, is a deadly neurodegenerative disorder attributed to dysfunction of astrocytes in humans. In juvenile Labrador Retrievers, the clinical features included tetraparesis with spastic contraction of the anterior limbs resembling 'swimming puppy syndrome', and the pathological exam revealed the detection in astrocytes of GFAP containing Rosenthal fibers. The causal variant was identified as a nucleotide substitution (c.719G>A) in the GFAP gene.\n\n    L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria in dogs is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by a range of progressive neurological signs. These clinical signs include seizures, dementia, head tremors, muscle stiffness, and cerebellar ataxia, which involves a wide-based stance, swaying of the trunk, loss of balance, and uncoordinated gait. The distinctive biochemical feature of L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is the buildup of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine. In Yorkshire Terriers, the disease was associated with a variant (c.1A>G) disrupting the translation of the initiation codon of the L2HGDH gene, while, in Staffordshire Bull Terriers, the causal variant involves a dual amino acid substitution occurring in exon 10 of the same gene, which consists of two single-nucleotide substitutions separated by a single unchanging T nucleotide.\n\n    Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder causing abnormal metabolism of the neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). The clinical entity was described in Saluki puppies with neurological issues such as seizures and changes in behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a widespread and significant decrease in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, along with symmetrical areas of increased signal intensity in specific brain regions. Upon necropsy, cerebral cortical atrophy with vacuolation (status spongiosus) was observed. A missense variant (c.866G>A) was pinpointed as the causal variant, located within the ALDH5A1 gene.\n\n    Medium-chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is the most prevalent inherited metabolic disorder associated with the beta-oxidation process. The condition was observed in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, which exhibited complex focal seizures characterized by extended periods of lethargy, reduced responsiveness, and proprioceptive ataxia. Brain MRI scans showed breed-specific changes, including occipital malformation with mild cerebellar herniation, syringohydromyelia, and medullary twisting, which are indicative of canine Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia. Organic acid analysis of urine revealed significant excretion of hexanoylglycine and a suberic acid peak. The causal variant was identified as a private protein-changing variant (delins) in the ACADM gene.\n\n    Cerebellar hypoplasia is a characteristic seen in various neurological conditions where the cerebellum does not fully develop. In White Swiss Shepherds, this condition was observed in puppies that did not gain weight and experienced gradually worsening ataxia, starting at approximately 2 weeks of age. Postmortem examination showed severe cerebellar hypoplasia with lissencephaly. A frameshift deletion (p.Val947*) of the reelin (RELN) gene was pinpointed as the plausible causal variant.\n\n    Dilute coat color with neurological defects is the canine equivalent of Griscelli syndrome in humans. This condition was observed in Miniature Dachshunds that exhibited a visible coat color dilution and experienced difficulties holding their heads independently or maintaining a stable prone position for an extended duration. The candidate causative variant was an frameshift insertion (c.4973_4974insA) in the MYO5A gene.\n\n    Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder affecting self-control over sleep. It is distinguished by instances of drowsiness during the diurnal period, sudden episodes of sleep, disruption of sleep patterns, a shortened duration before entering rapid eye movement sleep, and occurrences of cataplexy, marked by sudden reductions or absence of skeletal muscle tone. In dogs, episodes of cataplexy are primarily induced by positive stimuli and excitement. Three different variants have been identified as causal for narcolepsy in the Doberman Pinscher, Labrador Retriever, and Dachshund within the same gene (HCRTR2). In the Doberman Pinscher, a 226 bp SINE insertion was pinpointed as the causal variant. In the Labrador Retriever, a deletion of exon 6 was associated with narcolepsy, and, in the Dachshund, a G to A substitution at exon 1.\n\n    Spinal dysraphisms are inherent abnormalities of the spinal cord, influenced by disruption in the intricate series of embryonic processes vital for spinal development. In the Weimaraner, clinical signs were noticeable at around 2 to 4 months of age, and included paraparesis, symmetric hopping gait, hunched posture, kyphosis, and impaired proprioception in the pelvic limbs. Necropsy findings included asymmetry of the dorsal grey matter, syringomyelia, scoliosis with lateral deviation of the vertebral bodies, and other spinal cord abnormalities such as projections and asymmetry of ectopic grey matter. The causal variant was a G to AA frameshift variant within exon 2 of the NKX2-8 gene.\n\n    Exercise-induced collapse is a hereditary neuromuscular condition marked by exercise intolerance in otherwise healthy young adult dogs. Clinical signs are triggered by vigorous physical activity. Dogs affected by this condition typically experience a 'wobbly' gait within five to fifteen minutes of engaging in intense exercise. This wobbly gait then advances to nonpainful, weakened movement in the hind limbs, and the dogs lose control over them. Collapse episodes usually endure for 5 to 10 min, with most dogs fully recovering within 30 min. In rare cases, the episodes can be fatal. The variant responsible for this condition in Labrador retrievers, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and Curly-coated Retrievers involves a substitution from G to T in exon 6, resulting in the alteration of the amino acid codon from arginine to leucine (R256L) within a strongly conserved region of the DNM1 gene.",

        "Conclusion": "    This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the canine nervous system phenes and their genetic causal variant. The majority of these diseases have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Golden Retrievers and Belgian Shepherds were the breeds with the biggest number of documented neurological diseases with known causal variants.\n\n    Genetic testing can play a vital role in effectively managing and ultimately eradicating inherited diseases. Recessive diseases pose a particular challenge for dog breeders because the parents are often asymptomatic carriers in the population who may only be identified retrospectively, typically after they have already given birth to affected puppies or in some cases after one of their parents has been diagnosed with the disease. This challenge is further complicated when dealing with late-onset disorders, where affected dogs may unknowingly be bred before receiving a diagnosis. This issue applies to both dominant and recessive diseases.\n\n    Given that the majority of variants have low frequencies, it can be challenging for any individual veterinary clinician to identify and stay proficient in diagnosing the wide range of characterized inherited disorders. This underscores the importance of ongoing medical training and the presence of veterinary specialists with specific expertise in genetic counseling. It also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive diagnostic screening technologies.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    Most of the canine inherited neurological diseases share common signs. In addition to the clinical characteristics, it is important to consider the age of onset and the evolution of the disease. Paraclinical examination such as imaging procedures and histology may also be of aid. However, for inherited neurological conditions, the definitive diagnosis is established through genetic testing for the causal variant.\n\n    Mendelian genetics primarily concentrates on disorders that result from single genes, thereby excluding consideration of polygenic or multifactorial traits. The publishing of the domestic dog genome sequence in 2005 and advancements of molecular genetic techniques have made a significant contribution, as more than 200 variants leading to inherited disorders in dogs have been identified in the last 10 years.\n\n    The inherited neurological conditions with known causal variants in dogs that are described in this review are summarized in Table 1. It is worth noting that the majority of these diseases have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Diseases that follow such a pattern manifest when an individual inherits two recessive disease alleles. Consequently, such an individual will display the disease phenotype. In accordance with Mendel's Law of Segregation, this implies that both parents must possess at least one allele that determines the diseases, which they can potentially transmit to their offspring.\n\n    Additionally, as per Table 1, the dog breeds that are more prone to develop such diseases are the Golden Retriever, in which six inherited neurological disorders with a known causal variant have been documented, and the Belgian Shepherd, in which five inherited neurological disorders with a known causal variant have been documented. The most documented and prevalent neurological inherited disorder is canine degenerative myelopathy (CDM). The mutant SOD1:c.118A allele specific to CDM was identified in more than 120 dog breeds. A variant within the same SOD1 gene is also responsible for paroxysmal dyskinesia in the Markiesje dog breed.\n\n    The distribution of types of variants is illustrated in Figure 1. Based on the data from Table 1 and Figure 1, it is highlighted that the most frequent types of variants for canine inherited neurological disorders are the missenses (n = 46, 41%) and the small deletions (n = 21, 19%).\n\n    In order to determine the significance of the variants described in this review, we used the ABC system developed by Houge et al.. This approach employs a step-by-step process, classifying genetic variants of any type. The ABC system is based on functional (A) and clinical (B) criteria, with optional inclusion of a standard comment (C) that aligns with the clinical question. Each step, A and B, employs a 1-5 grading system, with a class \"zero\" designation when knowledge is inadequate. Functional grading (A) is concerned with the biological consequences of the variant, and includes stages from normal function (1) to proven functional effect (5). Clinical grading (B) focuses on the genotype-phenotype relationship, categorizing variants as \"right type of gene\" (1), risk factor (2), or pathogenic (3-5, depending on penetrance). Combining the A and B grading results in the generation of A-F classes, which are correlated with standard comments that reflect national or laboratory policies. Instead of using the standard comments, we replaced them with our own comments, as per the following: \"variant of unknown significance\" for the class F variants, \"likely pathogenic variant\" for class E and D variants, and \"pathogenic variant\" for classes C, B, and A variants. The detailed classification is presented in Table S1. Based on our assessment, 16 of the variants were classified as pathogenic variants and the remaining 96 were classified as likely pathogenic variants.\n\n    A recent research study screened the largest cohort of canines to date, comprising 1,054,293 representative dogs, to investigate the prevalence and distribution of a total of 250 genetic-disease-associated variants within the general population. The study included 811,628 mixed breed dogs and 242,665 purebreds. There was a noted connection, although with a small correlation coefficient, between a widespread reduction in genetic diversity and an increased likelihood of homozygosity for multiple autosomal-recessive-disease-related variants in dogs. This finding provides a concrete, quantifiable example of how elevated genomic homozygosity, which can occur through close interbreeding within a restricted gene pool, may potentially lead to the occurrence of inbreeding depression as a result of the accumulation of harmful recessive alleles. While it is theoretically possible for disease-associated variants to persist in mixed breed populations through random breeding, with their frequencies fluctuating over time due to random genetic drift, it is important to note that matings between closely related individuals, such as those in puppy mills, are known to occur and can play a role in the maintenance of these variants. Additionally, the study revealed that 57% of the dogs tested carried at least one copy of one of the studied Mendelian-disease-associated variants. It is worth highlighting that the majority of the specific variants included in this study have a frequency of less than 1% in the population.\n\n    Functional testing of genetic variations is vital for progressing the comprehension of the genetic origins of illnesses and directing customized treatment methods. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), GWAS, and RNA sequencing have progressively become common methodologies for diagnosing Mendelian diseases.\n\n    Despite their effectiveness, the existing diagnostic rate for genomic analyses encompassing various rare diseases is around 25 to 50%. There are several potential outcomes of employing a WES or WGS strategy: identification of a known disease-causing variant in a disease gene associated with a clinical phenotype that aligns with the patient's condition under investigation, identification of an unknown variant in a known disease gene with a corresponding clinical phenotype, identification of a known variant in a known disease gene with a dissimilar phenotype, identification of an unknown variant in a known disease gene with a dissimilar phenotype, identification of an unknown variant in a gene not previously linked to any disease, and failure to detect any genetic variant that can account for the patient's phenotype.\n\n    The GWAS has emerged over the last 15 years as a primary method for pinpointing the genetic variations linked to complex traits. These studies have linked thousands of variants to hundreds of phenotypes, significantly advancing the comprehension of the genetic framework underpinning complex diseases.\n\n    The transcriptome represents the comprehensive collection of transcripts within a cell, including their quantities, during a specific developmental stage or physiological state. Comprehending the transcriptome is vital for interpreting the functional components of the genome, unraveling the molecular constituents of cells and tissues, and gaining insights into both developmental processes and disease mechanisms. The primary objectives of transcriptomics are as follows: to create a comprehensive inventory of all types of transcripts, encompassing mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, and small RNAs; to ascertain the transcriptional structure of genes, including their start sites, 5' and 3' ends, splicing patterns, and other post-transcriptional modifications; and to quantify the dynamic changes in the expression levels of each transcript during development and across various conditions.",

        "Title": "    ATP13A2 missense variant in Australian Cattle Dogs with late onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis",
        "Abstract": "    The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and declines in neurological functions. Pathogenic sequence variants in at least 13 genes underlie different forms of NCL, almost all of which are recessively inherited. To date 13 sequence variants in 8 canine orthologs of human NCL genes have been found to occur in 11 dog breeds in which they result in progressive neurological disorders similar to human NCLs. Canine NCLs can serve as models for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions for these disorders. In most NCLs, the onset of neurological signs occurs in childhood, but some forms have adult onsets. Among these is CLN12 disease, also known as Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, PARK9, and spastic paraplegia78. These disorders result from variants in ATP13A2 which encodes a putative trans-membrane ion transporter important for lysosomal function. Three Australian Cattle Dogs (a female and two of her offspring) were identified with a progressive neurological disorder with an onset of clinical signs at approximately 6 years of age. The affected dogs exhibited clinical courses and histopathology characteristic of the NCLs. Whole genome sequence analysis of one of these dogs revealed a homozygous c.1118C > T variant in ATP13A2 that predicts a nonconservative p.(Thr373Ile) amino acid substitution. All 3 affected dogs were homozygous for this variant, which was heterozygous in 42 of 394 unaffected Australian Cattle Dogs, the remainder of which were homozygous for the c.1118C allele. The high frequency of the mutant allele in this breed suggests that further screening for this variant should identify additional homozygous dogs and indicates that it would be advisable to perform such screening prior to breeding Australian Cattle Dogs.",
        "Introduction": "    Dogs suffer from many of the same hereditary progressive neuro-degenerative diseases that occur in humans. Among these are a group of disorders designated the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). In people these diseases are characterized by apparently normal development followed by progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions, loss of vision, seizures, and in most cases premature death. These clinical signs are accompanied by progressive degeneration of the central nervous system and usually the retina as well. The human NCLs are designated CLN1 through CLN14 based on the gene in which the pathological sequence variant occurs. DNA sequence variants that underlie the NCLs occur in at least 13 genes (Table S1). The ages of onset of clinical signs and the rates of disease progression vary depending on the gene in which the causative variant occurs and the nature of the variant. The disease phenotype can vary substantially with each form of NCL. Onset of disease signs ranges from infancy to adulthood.\n\n    Diseases with clinical signs similar to the human NCLs have been reported in over 20 dog breeds. The causes of the majority of these canine disorders have been found to be variants in the canine orthologs of genes associated with human NCLs. To date, sequence variants in 9 canine orthologs of human NCL genes have been associated with NCLs in dogs. Among these are diseases with onset of clinical signs ranging from a few months to 7 years of age.\n\n    Australian Cattle Dogs are one of the breeds affected by NCL for which a genetic basis has been identified. The disease-causing genetic variant identified in the breed is a truncating nonsense variant in CLN5. This same variant causes NCL disease in Border Collies. The onset of clinical signs in dogs with this variant becomes apparent around the age of 12 months and affected dogs reach end-stage disease with severe neurological signs at 20 to 27 months of age. Three closely-related Australian Cattle Dogs presented with progressive neurological signs typical of the NCLs that did not become apparent until the dogs were approximately 6 years of age with disease progression from onset to end-stage of up to more than 2 years. None of these dogs had the CLN5 sequence variant previously associated with NCL in this breed. Studies were therefore undertaken to determine whether these dogs suffered from another form of NCL, and to determine whether their disease was associated with a sequence variant in one of the known NCL genes.",
        "Methods": "    The dogs in this study were examined and blood and tissue samples were collected with the consent of their owners. The studies were performed with the approval of the Cantonal Committee for Animal Experiments (Canton of Bern; permit BE75/16). All animal experiments were done in accordance with local laws and regulations including the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\n    This study included 397 Australian Cattle dogs. Three closely related dogs presented clinical signs characteristic of NCL and were designated as cases. These signs are described in detail in the Results section of this paper. The three affected Australian Cattle Dogs in this study consisted of a female (dog A) and two offspring from one of her litters (one male [dog B] and one female [dog C]). Also included is dog D, the father of dogs B and C. DNA samples from the remaining 393 Australian Cattle Dogs were collected in the context of other ongoing research projects. They included 26 Australian Cattle Dogs older than 6 years that did not show any signs of neurological disease and 367 Australian Cattle Dogs, for which no phenotype information was available and which were considered population controls. Samples which had been donated to the Vetsuisse Biobank from 555 additional dogs of 70 diverse breeds were also used as controls (Table S2). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood of each of these dogs.\n\n    Characterization of the behavioral abnormalities in the three affected dogs was based primarily on information provided by the dogs' owners on a symptom survey form that has been in use for over 10 years for identifying dogs with various forms of NCL or by information provided by the owners in a similar manner. Dog A was euthanized at the age of 8 years and 2 months due to the progression of disease signs. Before her death, blood was obtained for DNA isolation, but no tissues were collected at the time of euthanasia. Dogs B and C were euthanized at the age of 6 years and 9 months and at 7 years and 7 months respectively due to progression of disease signs, and tissues were collected at the time of euthanasia, as described below. Dog D lived to the age of 16 years and did not exhibit any behavioral or neurological abnormalities.\n\n    At the time of euthanasia, samples of cerebellum, parietal cerebral cortex, eyes, and heart ventricular wall were collected from dogs B and C and a section of cervical spinal cord was collected from dog C. From each dog, one eye and a portion of each other tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin or \"immuno fix\" (3.5% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, 120 mM sodium cacodylate, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), and the other eye and a portion of each other tissue was fixed in cacodylatebuffered glutaraldehyde or glutaraldehyde-paraformaldehyde. The formalin and \"Immuno\"-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin or Tissue-Tek embedding medium (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) and sections were cut and stained as described in the Results section. Immunostaining of paraffin sections for the lysosomal marker LAMP1 was performed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-LAMP1 primary antibody (Abcam ab24170) using previously described techniques. In addition, unstained sections of the paraffin-embedded samples were deparaffinized and examined unstained with fluorescence microscopy as described previously, as were cryosections of the Tissue-Tek embedded samples. Cryoscections of cardiac muscle samples were also examined after staining with the lipid dye Sudan Black III and counter-staining with Mayer's Hematoxylin. Portions of the glutaraldehydefixed tissues were post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, embedded in epoxy resin and 70 to 90 nm thick sections were cut from the embedded samples. The sections were collected on 200 mesh thin-barred copper grids, stained with uranyl acetated and lead citrate, and were then examined and photographed with a JEOL 1400 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan digital microscope. Sections of the resin-embedded tissues were also cut at a thickness of 0.4 to 0.8 mum, mounted on glass slides, stained with toluidine blue, and photographed with conventional transmitted light microscopy.\n\n    All analyses were performed using the dog CanFam 3.1 genome assembly as reference sequence. Numbering within the canine ATP13A2 gene refers to NCBI RefSeq accessions XM_005617949.3 (mRNA) and XP_005618006.1 (protein). Numbering within the human ATP13A2 gene refers to NCBI RefSeq accessions NM_022089.3 (mRNA) and NP_071372.1 (protein).\n\n    An Illumina TruSeq PCR-free library with an insert size of 350 bp was prepared from one affected Australian Cattle dog (dog B) and 195 million 2 x 150 bp paired-end reads were obtained on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 instrument (21.6x coverage). Mapping and variant calling was done as described. The sequence data were deposited under study accession PRJEB16012 and sample accession SAMEA104500413 at the European Nucleotide Archive. Functional effects and genomic context of the called variants were annotated using SnpEff software together with the NCBI Canis lupus familiaris Annotation Release 104. For private variant filtering we used control genome sequences from 8 wolves and 209 dogs. These genomes were either publicly available or produced during other previous projects in our laboratory (Table S3).\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood samples using the Maxwell RSC Whole Blood DNA Kit in combination with the Maxwell RSC machine (Promega). We used a Sanger sequencing protocol for targeted genotyping of the ATP13A2:c.1118C > T variant. Specifically, a 593 bp PCR product was amplified from genomic DNA using the AmpliTaqGold360Mastermix (Life Technologies) together with primers 5'-GAT GCC TGC ATG TAT GGT TG-3' (forward) and 5'-GTG GGC GGT TTC ACT TTT TA-3' (reverse). After treatment with exonuclease I and alkaline phosphatase, amplicons were sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies). Sanger sequences were analyzed with the Sequencher 5.1 software (GeneCodes).",
        "Results": "    The onset of neurological signs in the affected dogs occurred at approximately 6 years of age and progressively worsened over time. Among the disease-related signs reported by the dogs' owners were anxiety, impaired ability to recognize and respond to previously learned commands, increased sensitivity to loud or unexpected sounds, sleep disturbances, inappropriate or persistent vocalization, impaired ability to navigate stairs and to jump up or down from furniture, trembling, seizures, stiffness or weakness, loss of coordination, and ability to see in both bright and dim light. In addition to these signs, neurological examination findings in affected dog C included hypersensitivity to tactile stimuli, clumsiness, a broad-based stance in the pelvic limbs, mild ataxia, unsteady gait on slippery surfaces, intermittent pacing gait, hopping gait in pelvic limbs while trotting, reduced palpebral reflex and reduced menace response in both eyes, normal pupillary light reflexes in response to bright stimuli, and decreased nasal sensation. In addition, the affected dog that underwent a neurologic exam exhibited slightly delayed proprioception in the pelivic limbs, delayed and reduced hopping in all 4 limbs, and reduced extensor postural thrust. Spinal reflexes were normal. Dog B was euthanized at age 6 years and 9 months, and his littermate dog C was euthanized at age 7 years and 8 months due to the progression of these signs. Dog A, the mother of dogs B and C, was euthanized at age 8 years and 2 months. In addition to exhibiting the signs described above, she became very aggressive starting at about 8 years of age to the point of being dangerous, even toward her owner, and euthanasia was elected for this reason. Dog D, the father of dogs B and C, lived to be 16 years of age without exhibiting any of these behavioral abnormalities.\n\n    Although the behavioral signs exhibited by the affected dogs are consistent with the canine NCLs, other causes are possible, including other inherited neurological diseases or brain tumors. A universal characteristic of both canine and human NCLs is the progressive accumulation of autofluorescent lysosomal storage bodies in cells of the central nervous system, as well as many other tissues. The presence of these storage bodies can be used to distinguish the NCLs from other neurological disorders. Therefore, unstained sections of brain, retina, and heart from affected dogs B and C were examined for the presence of these characteristic autofluorescent storage bodies.\n\n    The cerebellum of dogs B and C exhibited massive accumulations of autofluorescent storage bodies primarily in the Purkinje cell layer, the meninges and large neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 1). These autofluorescent aggregates were also present to a lesser extent in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. In the Purkinje cell layer autofluorescent inclusions were abundant within the perinuclear areas of the Purkinje cells (Fig. 1A), as well as in clumps much larger than typical Purkinje cell bodies (Fig. 1 B). Abundant autofluorescent storage material was also present in the cerebellar meninges (Fig. 1C). Massive accumulations of the storage bodies in the deep cerebellar nuclei were localized to the perinuclear regions of large neurons (Fig. 1D).\n\n    In the cerebral cortex of both affected littermates, autfluorescent storage material was present in almost all neurons (Fig. 2). This material appeared as aggregates of small granules in the perinuclear regions of the cells. When the neurons were cut in the appropriate plane of section, these aggregates could be seen to be concentrated in one region of the cell body rather than being evenly distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 2B). Neurons in both the ventral and dorsal horns of the cervical spinal cord of dog C contained massive amounts of auto-fluorescent storage material (Fig. 3). As in other forms of canine NCL, disease-specific autofluorescent material was observed in retinal ganglion cells and along the outer limiting membrane from affected dog C (Fig. 4A). At the electron microscopic level, the storage material in the ganglion cells consisted on membrane-bounded inclusions containing whorls of condensed membrane-like structures sometimes embedded in a granular matrix (Fig. 4).\n\n    As in some other forms of canine NCL, strands of autofluorescent storage bodies were present between the muscle fibers of the cardiac muscle (Fig. 5A). Based on their location and topography, it appears that these storage bodies are located in the cardiac Purkinje fibers. Substantial aggregates of autofluorescent storage bodies were also present in the neurons of cardiac ganglia (Fig. 5B).\n\n    The ultrastructural appearances of the disease-related cellular inclusion bodies in the tissues of affected dog B were quite distinctive. In the cerebellar Purkinje layer, these consisted of membrane-bounded structures as large as 4 to 5 mum in diameter (Fig. 6). The contents of most of these inclusions consisted primarily of whorls and stacks of membrane-like structures (Fig. 6A). However the contents of some inclusion bodies consisted largely of curvilinear material similar that which is characteristic of the storage material typical of the CLN12 form of NCL (arrows in Fig. 6A). A small minority of the inclusion bodies in the cerebellum consisted of tightly packed fine membrane-like material that was randomly oriented (arrowhead in Fig. 6B).\n\n    The contents of the membrane-bounded disease-related inclusions in cerebral cortical neurons of the affected dogs consisted primarily of clusters of membrane-like structures, much like those in the cerebellum (Fig. 7). However, for the most part these clusters did not occur in the whorl-like arrangements observed in the cerebellum. The sizes and shapes of the individual inclusion bodies were variable and range about 3 to as much as 20 mum in diameter. No inclusions with curvilinear contents were observed in the cerebral cortical samples, but some of the storage bodies contained scattered dark amorphous inclusions that were 0.5 to 1 mum in diameter.\n\n    The ultrastructural appearances of the disease-related auto-fluorescent inclusions of the cardiac muscle from the affected dog were quite different from those of the inclusions present in the brain. The disease-related inclusions in the cardiac muscle consisted of tightly-packed aggregates of membrane-bounded rounded structures and structures that appear to have been round but to have been compressed into other shapes by crowding from the surrounding inclusion bodies (Fig. 8). These inclusions consisted of a mixture of two distinctly different types based on the appearance of their contents. The contents of some of the storage bodies had a uniform electron-dense appearance with no structural detail. The contents of the remaining inclusions consisted of uniform flocculent material. The two types of inclusions were randomly intermixed and ranged in size from less than 0.2 mum to greater than 6 mum. No nerve ganglia were present in the cardiac samples that were preserved for electron microscopic examination.\n\n    The ultrastructural appearances of the uniformly electron dense structures within the cardiac muscle inclusions are typical of lipid droplets. Indeed, these structures stained with the lipid stain Sudan Black III in cryostat sections of cardiac muscle (Fig. 9A), whereas the disease-related inclusion bodies in neural tissues did not stain with this dye. Within the inclusions in the heart, a subset of the granular particles stained with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent, which is specific for the carbohydrate moieties of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids (Fig. 9B). The staining pattern in the heart suggested that only the structures with flocculent material and not the lipid droplet-like structures contained carbohydrate components. The disease-specific inclusions in the cardiac muscle also exhibited LAMP1 immunostaining (Fig. 9C) indicating that these inclusions were derived from lysosomes. The disease-specific cellular inclusion bodies in cerebral cortex and cerebellum also stained strongly with PAS, but those in the retina did not (data not shown). As with the cardiac muscle, the disease-specific cellular inclusions in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and retinal ganglion cells stained with an anit-LAMP1 antibody (Fig. 10), suggesting that these inclusions were also derived from lysosomes.\n\n    In addition to exhibiting a characteristic autofluorescence, the storage material that accumulates in many of the NCLs has been shown to stain with Luxol fast blue in paraffin sections. This was also the case for the storage bodies in every tissue from affected dog B that was examined (Fig. 11). Within the Purjkinje cell layer were clusters of cells variable in shape and size that were filled with autofluorescent material (Fig. 1B) that stained intensely with Luxol fast blue (g in Fig. 11B). These cells may be microglia-derived phagocytic cells (gitter cells) that have taken up large amounts of storage material that originated in Purkinje cells that have degenerated. Non-Purkinje cells in or near the Purkinje cell layer that contain disease-related storage material have been reported in other forms of canine NCL, and a similar clustering of these cells in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum occurs in at least one of these other NCLs. Whether these cells represent phagocytic cells that have taken up storage material originally generated in Purkinje cells remains to be determined.\n\n    In earlier-onset forms of canine as well as human NCL, the diseases are characterized by pronounced astrogliosis. Immunostaining (IHC) of brain and retinal tissues of the affected Australian Cattle Dogs for glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), a marker for reactive astrocytes, indicated that astrogliosis is also a prominent feature of this late-onset disease, although not in the cerebellar cortex (Figs. 12 and 13). In addition, pronounced GFAP immunostaining was observed in small number of cells adjacent to large blood vessels in heart ventricular muscle and surrounding large blood vessels in the inner retina (Fig. 13).\n\n    We performed whole genome sequencing on one affected offspring and searched for private heterozygous and homozygous protein-changing variants in the case by comparing them with genome sequences from 8 wolves and 209 dogs from genetically diverse breeds (Table S3). We did not have any specific information regarding a potential NCL phenotype in the controls. However, as this is a rare condition, we assumed the control dogs and wolves to be homozygous wildtype at the causative variant.\n\n    The variant calling pipeline detected 4,028,278 variants in the genome of the sequenced case. Of these, 151 were absent from the control genomes and predicted to be protein-changing. We prioritized 13 known candidate genes, which had previously been identified in human and animal neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (Table S1). Only one variant was located in one of these candidate genes (ATP13A2), while the other 150 were in genes that we did not consider to be likely functional candidate genes (Table 1; Table S4). The ATP13A2 variant was a missense variant, XM_005617949.3:c.1118C > T, predicted to result in a non-conservative exchange of a threonine into an isoleucine, XP_005618006.1:p.(Thr373Ile). The predicted amino acid substitution is located in the cytoplasmic E1-E2 ATPase domain (pfam00122). The wildtype threonine is conserved in ATP13A2 orthologs across phylo-genetically diverse vertebrates (Fig. 14).\n\n    We then genotyped the variant in a cohort of 397 Australian Cattle Dogs, which included the 3 known cases, dog D, 26 unaffected Australian Cattle Dogs older than 6 years of age and 367 population controls. This revealed a perfect association of the genotypes with the phenotype (Table 2). All three affected dogs carried the variant in homozygous state. Dog D, the sire of the two affected dogs was heterozygous (obligate carrier). Among the other 393 Australian Cattle dogs, we observed 352 dogs that were homozygous wildtype and 41 dogs that were heterozygous and presumably carriers for the disease. These data indicate that among the Australian Cattle Dogs that were sampled, the carrier frequency is around 10%. Because of sampling bias in our population, the carrier frequency among all Australian Cattle Dogs may be different. We also genotyped 555 dogs from genetically diverse breeds. None of these dogs carried the ATP13A2:c.1118C > T variant (Table S2).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    A human autosomal recessive neurological disorder originally named Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS) was first described in 1994 in members of a consanguineous Arabic family in which five siblings were affected. The disease name was based on the name of the region in Jordan where the family resided. The onset of disease signs occurred at 12 to 16 years of age and progressively worsened over time resulting in severe impairment of motor and cognitive functions within 2 years of onset. Initial signs were abnormal facial expressions and progressive slowing of all motor functions. The disease progression is characterized by development of levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (severe akinesia and rigidity), supranuclear upgaze paresis, constant drooling, speech impairment, and dementia. The most severely affected individuals were bedridden with a generalized flexed posture. All of the affected siblings had normal visual acuity and no retinal abnormalities were observed with fundoscopy. Significant atrophy of the globus pallidus and the pyramids, as well as generalized brain atrophy in later stages of disease progression were documented with magnetic resonance imaging. The disease was quite slow, but ultimately affected individuals died as a result of profound neurological decline. There was significant variability in the severity of clinical signs between the affected siblings. A causal genetic variant for this disorder was found to be a 22 bp deletion in exon 16 of ATP13A2.\n\n    Subsequently, over 140 sequence variants in the coding regions of ATP13A2 have been identified in people, many of which have been reported to pathogenic (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar). Many of the pathogenic variants predict single amino acid changes in the protein, although partial deletions and splice site variants associated with neurological disease have also been identified. Among the clinical diagnoses associated with these variants, are NCL (CLN12, OMIM 610513), a Parkinsonian-like disorder designated PARK9, and spastic paraplegia78 (OMIM 617225). Interestingly, the latter authors found that a sequence variant in another NCL gene, TPP1, also resulted in spastic paraplegia that was responsive to L-DOPA. This represents one of a number of overlaps between phenotypes associated with ATP13A2 variants and variants in other NCL genes and supports the classification of ATP13A2 pathogenic variants as NCL types. In most cases of neurologic disease associated with a variety of ATP13A2 sequence variants, at least some of the signs were typical of recognized NCL disorders, including diffuse brain atrophy, myoclonus, progressive cognitive decline, tremor, hallucinations, and behavioral abnormalities. For more detailed information and citations to relevant publications, see OMIM entry 610,513.\n\n    The spectrum of clinical signs associated with these mutations varies both among individuals homozygous for the same variant and between indivuals with different variants in ATP13A2. The bases for this heterogeneity in clinical signs is unknown, but differences in ages of disease onset, progression, and clinical signs among individuals homozygous for the same variant suggest that other genetic differences modulate the effects of abnormalities in or absence of ATP13A2. Environmental factors are less likely to play a significant role in this heterogenity, since the disease pheontype can vary significantly among siblings.\n\n    Given the variability in phenotypes associated with different mutations or even with the same variant in ATP13A2, one may be tempted to assign subsets of the disorders resulting from variants in this gene to either the NCLs, Parkinsonian disorders, spastic paraplegias, or other groups depending on the phenotype, but in some cases this would result in siblings with the same variant but different phenotypes being classified as having different diseases. On the other hand, it has become the convention in the NCL field to classify diseases in this group by the gene in which the variant occurs rather than by disease phenotype. This makes sense with respect to understanding the primary disease mechanisms and potential approaches to therapy. Therefore, because of the variability in phenotypes among patients with ATP13A2 variants, there is an advantage to grouping these disorders together under one designation based on the gene in which the causal variants occur, which we propose to be the currently accepted CLN12. As with the other NCL types, one can differentiate patients within the overall NCL groups as being \"variants\" of CLN12 based on phenotype. We discourage continued use of the disease names KRS, PARK9, and spastic paraplegia78 because it would be cumbersome and not particularly helpful to use a separate disease name for each different pathogenic ATP13A2 variant. Rather, we encourage future use of CLN12 to designate all disorders resulting from pathogenic variants in ATP13A2, with the addition of descriptive terms related to phenotype to describe subtypes of these disorders. This practice is well established in the NCL field for all forms of NCL, so for consistency, should be applied to all disorders resulting from pathogenic variants in ATP13A2.\n\n    The function of the protein or proteins encoded by ATP13A2 has not been firmly established. There is evidence that the ATP13A2 protein is a lysosomal transmembrane ATPase ion pump that appears to be a Zn2+ transporter. Variants that are predicted to alter the function of ATP13A2 result in lysosomal dysfunction and the accumulatiuon of lysosomal storage bodies, as well as altering other celluluar functions including endosomal trafficking and functions that either depend on intracellular zinc homeostasis or are secondary to lysosomal dysfunction. However, experimental evidence also suggests that ATP13A2 plays a direct role in mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy, alpha-synuclein metabolism, and endosome-mediated cargo sorting. Different pathological variants in human ATP13A2 have different effects on the protein, including its complete absence, impaired ATPase activity, mislocation within the cell, enhanced proteosomal degradation, and increased protein stability. Which of these effects are associated with the Australian Cattle Dog p.(Thr373Ile) variant remain to be determined.\n\n    The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by normal development followed in most cases by progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions, loss of vision, seizures, brain atrophy, retinal degeneration, and a generalized accumulation of auto-fluorescent lysosomal storage bodies throughout the central nervous system and in many other tissues. Variants in at least 13 genes underlie different forms of NCL. Naturally occurring NCLs have been described in many dog breeds, and the genetic bases for these disorders have been identified in genes orthologous to those associated with human NCLs. A late-adult onset form of NCL in Tibetan Terriers was found to result from a truncating single base deletion in ATP13A2. This deletion was associated with exon skipping in affected dogs. These discoveries led to a re-evaluation of KRS associated with ATP13A2 variants and its classification as an NCL with the designation of CLN12. The basis for this classification, in addition to the similarity in clinical signs and progressive neurodegeneration, is the finding that like other NCLs, individuals that are homozygous for variants in ATP13A2 exhibit accumulation of auto-fluorescent lysosomal storage bodies with ultrastructural features characteristic of the NCLs.\n\n    Unlike the variability in clinical sigs in human subjects with neurological diseases associated with ATP13A2 sequence variants, even between siblings homozygous for the same variant, the disease signs and progression among Tibetan Terriers with CLN12 disease due to a single base deletion in ATP13A2 were quite uniform. The age of onset is approximately 7 years of age and neurological signs in most affected dogs progress to the stage at which euthanasia is elected at approximately 10 years of age. The clinical signs associated with the Tibetan Terrier disease only partially overlap those of human subjects with ATP13A2-related disease. The canine disease is characterized by anxiety, aggression, cognitive decline, loss of coordination, ataxia, tremors, seizures (primarily near disease end-stage), and progressive vison loss in both dim and bright lighting. Unlike most human subjects with ATP13A2-related disorders, Tibetan Terriers with CLN12 disease exhibited pronounced retinal degeneration and impaired retinal function.\n\n    The Tibetan Terrier disease resulted from a single base deletion (frameshift) that would be expected to result in a complete lack of ATP13A2 protein, whereas the mutant allele in the Australian Cattle Dogs is predicted to encode a p.(Thr373Ile) amino acid substitution in ATP13A2. Because the wildtype threonine is conserved in ATP13A2 orthologs across phylogenetically diverse vertebrates, and replacement of threonine by isoleucine at p.373 results in a disease phenotype very similar to that of Tibetan Terriers with the ATP13A2 single base deletion, it appears likely that Australian Cattle Dog missense variant alters an important functional domain of the protein. This is consistent with the fact that the age of onset was earlier and the rate of disease progression was faster in the Australian Cattle Dogs than that in Tibetan Terriers with the truncating variant. Because the affected Australian Cattle Dogs are expected to produce a dysfunctional form of ATP13A2, biochemical analyses of tissues from dogs with this mutation may lead to a better understanding of the normal function of this protein. The predicted amino acid substitution is located in the cytoplasmic E1-E2 ATPase domain, suggesting that this variant may alter an important function of this protein. Assessment of this possibility can be achieved by analyzing tissues obtained from dogs with this variant. As noted earlier, however, human subjects with single amino acid substitutions at many dispersed locations in APT13A2 have similar progressive neurological disease, so it appears that most domains of the protein are important for its normal functioning.\n\n    The disease-related inclusion bodies that accumulated in neurological tissues were similar in both Tibetan Terriers and Australian Cattle Dogs with late-onset NCL. Membrane-bound autofluorescent inclusions (lipofuscin) also accumulate in many postmitotic cells during normal aging. However, the ultrastructural features of the disease-related inclusions were quite distinct from those of lipofuscin, both in nervous tissues and in the heart. The disease-related inclusions in cardiac muscle of the affected dogs were quite unique and differed substantially from those in the brain and retina (Fig. 8). These inclusions consisted of a mixture of round bodies with contents that had either uniform electron density or a flocculent appearance. Based on their staining properties, uniformly stained bodies appear to be lipid droplets, whereas material within the bodies that co-localize with them appear to have carbohydrate moieties. Cardiac muscle pathology has not been studied extensively in the NCLs, so it would be of interest to determine whether similar inclusions accumulate in the hearts of people and dogs with all of the various forms of NCL. The disease-related storage material that accumulates in all cell types that were examined in the affected dogs were stained with an antibody that specifically labels the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1. Therefore, these cellular inclusions can be classified as lysosomal storage bodies.\n\n    Although only two littermate Australian Cattle Dogs and their mother have been identified that are homozygous for the mutant allele, a screen of 394 other Australian Cattle Dogs with no known close relationship to the affected dogs identified 42 dogs that were heterozygous for the variant, but no other homozygotes (Table 2). It is somewhat unexpected that with such a high carrier frequency, no dogs homozygous for the mutant allele were identified in the population sample. However, now that a fair number of heterozygotes have been identified, it should be possible to identify additional homozygous mutant dogs by selectively screening relatives of the carrier dogs for the mutant allele. Identification of additional affected dogs by such screening should open the possibility of obtaining tissues and cell lines to study ATP13A2 function, and in particular the function of the region of the protein modified by the p.(Thr373Ile) variant. Affected dogs identified by genetic screening may also serve as a model for preclinical therapeutic intervention studies for CLN12 disease. While the late onset of disease signs makes use of affected Australian Cattle Dogs impractical as a laboratory model for CLN12 disease, therapeutic studies could be conducted by recruiting privately owned dogs for treatment studies. Such studies could provide preclinical data necessary for the conduct of human clinical trials for treatments for human CLN12 disease.\n\n    With respect to preventing the propagation of NCL in Australian Cattle Dogs, the relatively high incidence of the disease allele in the population tested indicates that it would be advisable to test dogs in the general population for the presence of this allele before using them for breeding. Because of the late onset of clinical signs, this is the only practical means by which to reduce the disease frequency in the breed. As would be expected, such screening for the disease alleles associated with a number of inherited diseases in purebred dogs has been effective in reducing the frequencies of these alleles and the associated diseases over time. However, in cases where the frequency of the deleterious sequence variant is very high, it is important that maintaining genetic diversity within the breed be considered. In these cases, the best choice may be to continue to breed heterozygotes with dogs that are homozygous for the wildtype allele.\n\n    As with human CLN12 disease, relative to species lifespan the onset of clinical signs was later and the rate of disease progression slower in dogs with ATP13A2-related NCL than in most other forms of NCL. Based on the known functions of the gene product in many of the other NCLs, the reason for the late onset of CLN12 disease is not clear, particularly since all of the known NCLs appear to result in impaired lysosomal function. The reason for this may become apparent with further study of the Australian Cattle Dog disease, particularly now that affected dogs can be identified by genetic screening prior to the onset of clinical signs. The relatively late onset of clinical signs in the canine and human forms of the disease means that with early detection via genetic screening there is a large time window during which therapeutic interventions may be undertaken that would prevent or delay disease onset and progression.",

        "Title": "    Functional validation of the albinism-associated tyrosinase T373K SNP by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) in rabbits",
        "Abstract": "    Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by reduced melanin that are caused by mutations in the gene encoding tyrosinase (TYR), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of the pigment melanin. Many studies or meta-analyses have suggested an association between the TYR T373K SNP and OCA1, but there is limited biochemical and genetic evidence to support this association.\n\n    We overexpressed TYR-WT and TYR-T373K mutants on HK293T cells and tested the changes of melanin production and tyrosinase activity. Then we generated TYR-K373T knock-in (KI) rabbits by microinjection of ssDNA and synthesized RNAs targeting C1118A using CRISPR/Cas9-HDR to observe the formation of melanin.\n\n    We demonstrated that the T373K mutation in TYR can reduce tyrosinase activity, leading to an absence of melanin synthesis at the cell-level. The gene-edited TYR-K373T rabbits exhibited rescued melanin production in hair follicles and irises, as inferred from the evident decrease in pigmentation in TYR-T373K rabbits, thus providing functional validation of the albinism-associated T373K SNP at the animal level.\n\n    Our study provides the first animal-level functional validation of the albinism-associated TYR K373T SNP in rabbits, and these results will facilitate gene therapy of OCA1 in pre-clinical settings in the future.\n\n    The National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research, the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Guangdong Province Science and Technology Plan Project, and the Program for JLU Science and Technology Innovative Research Team.",
        "Introduction": "    Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by hypopigmented hair, skin and eyes. According to the human gene mutation database (HGMD), 249 missense/nonsense mutations affecting 177 amino acids in TYR are associated with OCA1. Many studies or meta-analysis suggested the association between the TYR T373K SNP and oculocutaneous albinism. However, information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the frequent T373K mutation is limited. In this study, we providing functional validation of the albinism-associated T373K SNP at the cell and animal level and explored the possibility that T373K SNP (C1118A) is response for the reduced pigment in OCA1 patients.\n\n    The prevalence of OCA is often estimated as being 0.05-1% of the population, and OCA is the most common cause of depigmentation worldwide. Notably, there is no suitable and effective clinical treatment for OCA currently. We are the first group to explore functional validation of the albinism-associated T373K SNP at animal level. More importantly, new trends in disease research show that gene therapy has emerging clinical potential in cancer therapy. But the biochemical function and genetic evidence to support this association of T373K SNP and oculocutaneous albinism is lacking. Hence, findings in the presents study could provide novel insights into clinical treatment of OCA.\n\n    Here, we identified functional validation of the albinism-associated TYR K373T SNP in rabbits, which could be the targets for gene therapy of OCA1 in pre-clinical settings in the future. Furthermore, decreased tyrosinase activity has been targeted for the prevention of skin hyperpigmentation, such as melasma and age spots. Therefore, the T373K locus could be a potential therapeutic target for further research, and restoration of tyrosinase production and inhibition of tyrosinase could be used to treat skin disorders.\n\n    Alt-text: Unlabelled Box\n\n    Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by hypopigmented hair, skin and eyes. Distinctive ocular changes occur in all types of OCA, including nystagmus and reduced pigmentation of the iris and retina. The prevalence of OCA is often estimated as being 0.05-1% of the population, and OCA is the most common cause of depigmentation worldwide. Moreover, all individuals with OCA are at greater risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of sun-exposed skin than the general population. Notably, there is no suitable and effective clinical treatment for OCA currently.OCA type 1 (OCA1) is the most severe and common form of OCA, characterized by complete absence of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes, which is caused by mutations in the tyrosinase gene (TYR).\n\n    Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyses the first two steps of the melanin biosynthesis pathway, converting tyrosine to L-dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA) and subsequently to DOPA-quinone. According to the human gene mutation database (HGMD) (http://www.hgmd.org/), 249 missense/nonsense mutations affecting 177 amino acids in TYR are associated with OCA1, including the frequent human albino substitution (c. C1118A; p. Thr373Lys) in codon 373, which leads to a putative amino acid change from threonine (ACA) to lysine (AAA) in exon 3 of the TYR gene. Previous research has shown that the T373K mutation influenced melanogenesis in vitro experiment. Tyrosinase has two conserved sequence motifs to bind two copper ions, termed CuA and CuB, and also has six N-glycosylation sequences sites. Interestingly, the T373K mutation was located on CuB and interfered the sixth potential N-glycosylation site (Fig. 1A). Previous study has confirmed that the CuA and CuB domains of human tyrosinase are important for copper-binding and catalytic activity, and mutations at glycosylation sites critical to the operation of the quality control mechanism lead to a reduction in the activity of the expressed protein. However, information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the frequent T373 K mutation is limited. Thus, biochemical functional assays and elucidation of the genetic mechanism at the animal level are required to confirm the association between the T373K SNP and OCA1.\n\n    To date, most of the preliminary functional validation of albinism-associated tyrosinase mutations has been carried out in albino mice, which are widely used animal models for pathogenesis and pre-clinical studies. However, mice with the TYR (C85S) mutation have been frequently used for albinism studies, and no genetic evidence for the T373K mutation has been reported to date. Interestingly, the identical mutation (T373K) was identified in both albino rabbits and humans OCA1. Furthermore, rabbits are phylogenetically closer to primates than mice and are physically large enough to permit non-lethal monitoring of physiological changes.\n\n    The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been shown to be an efficient gene-targeting technology in mammalian cells and animals. In addition, the combination of CRISPR/Cas9 with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors has been developed as an efficient genome engineering tool to introduce site-directed point mutations. To date, several gene knockout (KO) rabbit models have been generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to study human hereditary diseases; however, the rate of site-directed point mutation using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) remains to be further improved.\n\n    In this study, we analysed the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of T373K, a frequent SNP associated with OCA1, demonstrating that reduction of tyrosinase activity by the T373K mutation is responsible for reduced pigmentation and inhibits melanogenesis in OCA1. Moreover, we achieved base replacement (A-C) by microinjecting synthesized RNAs with ssODN donors, leading to rescued melanin production in the skin and irises of TYR-K373T rabbits.",
        "Methods": "    The New Zealand white rabbits and Lianshan black rabbits used in this study were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Jilin University. All animal studies were conducted according to experimental practices and standards approved by the Animal Welfare and Research Ethics Committee at Jilin University.\n\n    The coding sequences (CDSs) of TYR-WT and TYR-T373K were amplified by RT-PCR from the Lianshan black rabbit and New Zealand white rabbit cDNAs, respectively. The purified PCR products were cut with EcoR I and Nhe I and then cloned into the backbone of the PIRES-CMV vector to obtain the PIRES-TYR-WT and PIRES-TYR-T373K vectors, which were verified by Sanger sequencing. The primers used are listed in Table S1.\n\n    Human kidney epithelial cells (HEK293T) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (HyClone), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37  C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 120,000 per well and transfected using Turbofect TM in vitro transfection reagent (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PIRES-TYR-T373K and the PIRES-TYR-WT vectors were transiently transfected into the HEK293T cells, and melanin formation was determined by fluorescence microscopy (NikonTS100, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n    Transfected cells were seeded at a density of 2 x 105 in 60-mm dishes. After overnight incubation, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of arenarol for 72 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by treatment with 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA. Then, the cell pellets were dissolved in 1 N NaOH, followed by incubation at 60  C for 2 h. The amount of melanin in the solution was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. The melanin content was expressed as delta absorbance (405 nm)/lg protein.\n\n    For the mRNA stability assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with the PIRES-TYR-WT and PIRES-TYR-T373K vectors in 6-cm dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, actinomycin D (ActD; 10 mg/ml) was added to the culture medium to block mRNA transcription, and then, the cells were harvested at selected time points. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol.\n\n    Total RNA concentrations for the WT and mutant were quantified by spectrophotometry. The cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription with the PrimeScriptTM RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) from 500 ng of total RNA. Total mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH expression. All samples were analysed in triplicate, and each mRNA quantification represents an average of at least three measurements. All the data are expressed as the mean +- SEM.\n\n    Intracellular tyrosinase activity was determined as previously described. Briefly, the cells were washed twice with PBS and homogenized with 50 mM PBS (pH 7.5) containing 1.0% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mM phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cellular extracts (100 mul) were mixed with freshly prepared L-DOPA solution (5.0 mM in 50 mM PBS, pH 6.8) and incubated at 37  C for 30 min. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a Gen5  microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA) to measure the production of dopachrome.\n\n    The method for the design of targeted sgRNAs has been described previously (http://crispr.mit.edu/). The sgRNAs were transcribed using the T7 RNA Synthesis Kit (Ambion) and purified using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The concentration and quality of the synthesized mRNAs were determined by a NanoDrop 2000 and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The Cas9 expression construct, namely, 3xFLAG-NLS-SpCas9-NLS, was synthesized and cloned into the pCS2-vector. The construct was linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion, USA) and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).\n\n    The protocol for microinjection of pronuclear-stage rabbit zygotes has been described in detail in our previous publication. Briefly, mixtures of in vitro-transcribed mRNA derived from the gRNAs (25 ng/mul), Cas9 (100 ng/mul) and ssODN (5 ng/mul) were injected into the cytoplasm of pronuclear stage embryos. Then, the injected embryos were transferred to embryo culture medium for 30-60 min, followed by transfer into the oviduct of the recipient mother (approximately 30-50 embryos).\n\n    Each injected zygote was collected at the blastocyst stage and incubated in embryo lysis buffer at 50  C for 20 min and 90  C for 5 min in a Bio-Rad PCR machine. Genomic DNA from the mutant and WT rabbits was isolated using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR primers used for mutation detection are listed in Table S1. The PCR conditions were as follows: 98  C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 98  C for 10 s, 60  C for 20 s, and 72  C for 10 s; and extension at 72  C for 5 min, after which the reaction was held at 12  C. The PCR products were gel purified and cloned into the pGM-T vector (Tiangen, Beijing, China). Ten positive plasmid clones were sequenced, and DNAman was used for sequence analysis.\n\n    Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed as previously described. Briefly, the skin and irises from WT and T373K knock-in (KI) rabbits were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned, mounted on slides, stained with HE and analysed by microscopy (Nikon ts100).\n\n    Silver staining was performed as previously described. The skin was fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde and routinely processed. Paraffin sections (4 mum) were stained with potassium permanganate and silver solutions and analysed by microscopy (Nikon ts100).\n\n    For western blotting, the skin from WT and T373K mutant rabbits were homogenized in 150 ml of lysis buffer, and protein concentrations were measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). Anti-TYR polyclonal antibody (1:2000; Abcam) was used as the primary antibody, and anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Beyotime) was used as an internal control. The image was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH), and all the data are expressed as the mean +- SEM.\n\n    Potential off-target sites (POTSs) of the sgRNAs were predicted using the CRISPR online design tool (http://tools.genomeengineering.org). The top 10 POTSs that were most likely to produce off-target mutations were selected and subjected to PCR and sequence analysis. Vector NTI and DNAman were used for sequence analysis. The primers used are shown in Table S2.\n\n    A T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assay was performed as described previously. Briefly, the genomic DNA of each Cas9/gRNA-injected blastocyst and new-born pups was extracted as described above. The PCR products were denatured and annealed under the following conditions: 95  C for 5 min, 95  C for 5 min, 95 to 85  C at -2  C/s, 85 to 25  C at -0.1  C/s, hold at 4  C. The annealed samples were digested with T7EI (NEB M0302 L), separated and measured on an ethidium bromide-stained 10% polyacrylamide TAE gel.\n\n    Data are expressed as the mean +- SD, with at least three individual measurements in all experiments. The data were analysed with one-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. A probability of p < .05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    A previous study showed that the T373K SNP is associated with OCA1 and is one of the most frequently observed mutations in the clinical. To elucidate the effect of the TYR-T373K SNP on melanin formation, the TYR-WT and TYR-T373K vectors were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. After 48 h, a marked increase in melanin production was observed in the TYR-WT-transfected cells but not in the MOCK- and TYR-T373K-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Functional integrity was confirmed by comparison of the colours of the collected cell pellets (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the reduced melanin levels due to the T373K SNP was caused by variations in mRNA stability, the transfected cells were treated with ActD and subjected to an mRNA stability assay. Unexpectedly, no significant difference in mRNA stability was observed between the TYR-WT- and TYR-T373K-transfected cells (Fig. 1D), which was also confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1E).\n\n    Absence of tyrosinase activity is associated with OCA in clinical studies. We next examined whether the genetic mutations affected tyrosinase activity. The melanin content (Fig. 1F) and tyrosinase activity (Fig. 1G) were determined. In contrast to the high activity of the TYR-WT-transfected cells, the TYR-T373K-transfected cells exhibited significantly low melanin content and tyrosinase activity, similar to the MOCK-transfected cells. Thus, these results showed that the T373 K mutation could reduce tyrosinase activity, leading to OCA1 in humans, which is characterized by inactive tyrosinase and the total absence of pigmentation.\n\n    In previous studies and our cell-based experiments, the TYR mutation virtually abolished tyrosinase activity and melanin production, so we asked whether repair of the mutation site could restore melanin production. Next, we tested our hypothesis regarding the association of the T373K mutation with OCA1 at the animal level. While no T373K mutation was found in the natural black and white mice, as confirmed by Sanger Sequence analysis (Fig. 2A), we verified the genotype-to -phenotype model using New Zealand white rabbits, which have an inherent T373K SNP and albinism phenotype (white hair and red eyes). Hence, C1118A (K373T) rabbits were generated by ssDNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (HDR).\n\n    To explore the feasibility of generating point mutants of TYR C1118A (K373 T), a 90-nt ssDNA donor with nucleotide C instead of A at position 1118 (K373 T) was designed for HDR-mediated genome mutation (Fig. 2B). To reduce the possibility of cutting the sequences successfully knocked-in by the redundant sgRNA, two synonymous nucleotide changes near the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) were added to the ssDNA donor. A pair of primers was designed and used for the detection of mutations via PCR (Table S1). A mixture of 200 ng/mul Cas9 RNA, 20 ng/mul sgRNA and 50 mM ssODN was co-microinjected into rabbit pronuclear-stage zygotes. Out of 18 injected embryos, 14 developed to the blastocyst stage and were then sequenced to determine mutation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 2C-D and S1, TYR mutations were found in all the blastocysts, and 3 of the 14 blastocysts carried the desired TYR-K373T mutation (B5, B8 and B11), demonstrating that the TYR-K373T mutation can be achieved via this method in zygotes.\n\n    To generate TYR-K373T mutant rabbits, 158 injected rabbit zygotes were transferred into four pseudo-pregnant recipient females, who gave birth to 22 live pups (Table 1). As expected, the gene mutation was detected in 20 rabbits (91%) (Fig. S2), and 5 of the rabbits had the base substitution (K373T), as determined by the T7E1 assay and Sanger sequencing, with efficiencies of 20% (Fig. 3A-D). Notably, one of the K373T rabbits was a homozygous mutant (#403, K373T-Hom), and the other were monoallelic mutants (#204 and #307, K373 T-Het). Interestingly, chimaeric mutations were found in two K373T rabbits with multiple genotypes (#104 and #106, K373T-Chi), indicating that K373T mutations of the TYR gene can be achieved via the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR system with high efficiency in rabbits. GUIDE-seq results confirmed the complexity of base change or mutation on the ssODN-targeted site in TYR-K373T mutant rabbits (Figs. 3E and S3).\n\n    Furthermore, Sanger sequencing and the T7E1 assay showed that no off-target mutations were present at these potential sites in the TYR-K373T rabbits, indicating that the sgRNAs used in this study were locus specific (Fig. S4).\n\n    To verify the effect of the K373T mutation on melanogenesis, melanin deposition in the skin and iris was monitored. As shown in Fig. 4A, the K373T rabbits, including the K373T-Hom and K373T-Het rabbits, exhibited completely black hair and eyes, in contrast to the typical symptoms of albinism observed in WT-T373K rabbits. Interestingly, mosaic coat pigmentation (black and white) was observed in two K373T-Chi rabbits with dark eyes. Furthermore, histological HE and silver staining confirmed a significant increase in melanin levels in the hair follicles and irises of K373T-Hom and K373T-Chi rabbits (Fig. 4B), indicating the occurrence of melanogenesis in K373T rabbits.\n\n    We further examined whether the gene mutations caused an increase in gene expression. Consistent with the results of the cell-based study, no significant difference in gene expression in the back skin of the WT-T373K and K373T rabbits was observed by RT-PCR (Fig. 4C) and western blotting (Fig. 4D-E). Thus, the results showed the first functional validation of the albinism-associated tyrosinase T373K SNP in rabbits, suggesting that the K373T mutation can rescue melanin production in albinism.\n\n    To determine whether the genotype and phenotype of the K373T precision mutation could be stably transmitted to offspring, male K373T-Het rabbits (#307) were mated with female New Zealand white rabbits, which carried a natural T373K mutation (WT-T373K). One F1 rabbit exhibited typical dark pigmentation of the skin and eyes (Fig. 5A). T-cloning and PCR sequencing results confirmed that the K373T mutation of TYR was present in pup #01. Furthermore, similar results were also observed in the offspring of K373T-Chi (#106) rabbits mated with WT-T373K rabbits, and the K373T mutation was detected in pup #05.\n\n    In addition, histological HE staining showed an increase in melanin levels in the hair follicles and irises of K373T-F1 rabbits but not the WT-T373K littermates (Fig. 5C), demonstrating that the K373T mutation and melanogenesis phenotype are heritable and that genome modifications induced by CRISPR/Cas9 are transmitted to the germ line.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Pigmentation is critically dependent on the functional integrity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis. The genotype-to-phenotype association between OCA1 and TYR mutations, including mutation of the CDS, 3'UTR and 5' region, was reported in a recent study; however, studies on point mutations, which are the most frequently reported mutations in OCA1 patients, have been limited. Here, we propose a strategy to functionally validate the association between T373K and OCA1. The data show that reduced melanin synthesis in TYR-T373K -mutated cells rescued melanin production in TYR-K373T rabbits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the biochemical function of the albinism-associated TYR SNP (T373K) at both the cell and animal levels.\n\n    Recently, CRISPR-based editing systems that directly perform nucleotide conversion without the introduction of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) have been developed; these systems, named cytosine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs), enable C G to T A or A T to G C base pair conversion in organisms with high efficiency. However, neither CBEs nor ABEs are suitable for editing bases outside the narrow range, and these systems are limited to inducing base transversion (purine-pyrimidine and pyrimidine-purine) mutations. Therefore, although targeted mutation by BEs is highly efficient, these systems were not suitable for our study (A1118C). Therefore, ssDNA and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR was used in this study. In mice, high efficiency of HDR has been reported with ssODN donors and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. It has been suggested that the larger a DNA fragment is, the more difficult it is to integrate the fragment into target sites via HDR, although the exact repair mechanisms remain unknown.\n\n    In this study, 90-bp ssODN donors with substitution mutations were identified, suggesting that CRISPR/Cas system-mediated HDR could be used for SNP exchange and site-specific insertion with high efficiency in rabbits. Interestingly, two chimaeric TYR-KI rabbits with mosaic coat patterns (black and white) were generated in this study, confirming that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated zygote gene mutation could result in genetically mosaic individuals, as observed in zebrafish, mice and Drosophila. Thus, microinjection of the Cas9 protein instead of RNA may reduce mosaicism and the frequency of undesired mutagenic repair in future studies.\n\n    Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyses several reactions in the biosynthesis of melanin pigments and is absent in patients with OCA1. tyrosinase is thought to bind two copper ions, one at each of two conserved sequence motifs, termed CuA and CuB (Fig. 1A), each containing three histidine residues that coordinate the binding of Cu(II) ions and are structurally juxtaposed to form the binuclear Cu catalytic site. Moreover, the tyrosinase enzyme also has six N-glycosylation sites, which are conserved in human and mouse tyrosinases, suggesting that glycosylation may be functionally relevant. A previous study showed that mutations at glycosylation sites that are critical for the quality control mechanism lead to reduction in the activity of the expressed protein. Notably, the T373K mutation, which occurs at a conserved glutamate residue near CuB (Fig. 1A), also leads to elimination of the sixth potential N-glycosylation site. In our study, tyrosinase activity and melanin production were found to have been virtually abolished in TYR-T373K-transfected cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that the destruction of the sixth potential N-glycosylation site by the T373K mutation virtually abolishes the ability of tyrosinase to bind copper and similarly destroys the catalytic activity of tyrosinase. Furthermore, decreased tyrosinase activity has been targeted for the prevention of skin hyperpigmentation, such as melasma and age spots. Therefore, the T373K locus could be a potential therapeutic target for further research, and restoration of tyrosinase production and inhibition of tyrosinase could be used to treat skin disorders.\n\n    In summary, this study provides the first genotype-to-phenotype model of the biochemical function of the albinism-associated tyrosinase T373K SNP. Moreover, functional analysis of T373K, in both cell and animal models, provided insights into the mechanisms of albinism pathogenesis as well as strategies for diagnosis or pre-clinical treatment.",

        "Title": "    Determining mutations in G6PC and SLC37A4 genes in a sample of Brazilian patients with glycogen storage disease types Ia and Ib",
        "Abstract": "    Glycogen storage disease (GSD) comprises a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by deficiency of the enzymes that regulate the synthesis or degradation of glycogen. Types Ia and Ib are the most prevalent; while the former is caused by deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the latter is associated with impaired glucose-6-phosphate transporter, where the catalytic unit of G6Pase is located. Over 85 mutations have been reported since the cloning of G6PC and SLC37A4 genes. In this study, twelve unrelated patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of GSDIa and Ib were investigated by using genetic sequencing of G6PC and SLC37A4 genes, being three confirmed as having GSD Ia, and two with GSD Ib. In seven of these patients no mutations were detected in any of the genes. Five changes were detected in G6PC, including three known point mutations (p.G68R, p.R83C and p.Q347X) and two neutral mutations (c.432G > A and c.1176T > C). Four changes were found in SLC37A4: a known point mutation (p.G149E), a novel frameshift insertion (c.1338_1339insT), and two neutral mutations (c.1287G > A and c.1076-28C > T). The frequency of mutations in our population was similar to that observed in the literature, in which the mutation p.R83C is also the most frequent one. Analysis of both genes should be considered in the investigation of this condition. An alternative explanation to the negative results in this molecular study is the possibility of a misdiagnosis. Even with a careful evaluation based on laboratory and clinical findings, overlap with other types of GSD is possible, and further molecular studies should be indicated.",
        "Introduction": "    The transformation of glucose into glycogen occurs by chemical reactions carried out by specific enzymes, and a deficiency in one of these leads to the accumulation of glycogen, resulting in hereditary disorders known as glycogen storage diseases (GSD) or glycogenosis. There are currently 12 types of GSD, presenting differences in age of onset of symptoms, affected organs, specific enzyme defect, and clinical severity, and each GSD is named after specific enzyme defect and organ impairment.\n\n    Deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase, EC 3.1.3.9) activity causes GSD type I (GSD1), which is responsible for more than 90% of the cases, affecting mainly the liver and the kidneys. In addition to being a key enzyme in the regulation of blood glucose homeostasis, catalyzing the final steps of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, it is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions as a multicomponent system.\n\n    The catalytic subunit of the system is located inside the ER and its defect causes subtype Ia (GSD Ia; OMIM 232200). Additionally, there are transporters for the entry of substrate glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into the ER and for the exit of the products, phosphate and glucose. Defects in these transporters cause subtype Ib (GSD Ib, OMIM 232220). The mechanism of ER membrane glucose transport remains unknown.\n\n    The disease follows autosomal recessive inheritance and has an incidence of 1/100,000 to 1/400,000 live births, with up to 80% of the cases represented by subtype Ia. Patients with GSD Ia and Ib manifest a nearly identical metabolic phenotype, including hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hyperuricemia, lactic acidemia and hyperlipidemia, but GSD Ib patients also present neutropenia and myeloid dysfunction, and these individuals are susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections, aphthous stomatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Nonetheless, neutropenia is not manifested by all GSD Ib patients. It is seen in only 20% of cases, and it has been proposed that it could be due to SLC37A4 mutations with residual transport activity. Clinical differentiation between GSD types 1a, 1b and 3 may not always be possible.\n\n    A biochemical essay for GSDI is useful to confirm the diagnosis and to recommend treatment; routine tests, however, do not allow the determination of the disease subtype. Furthermore, since the enzyme is not expressed in tissues such as fibroblasts or lymphocytes, their measurement is only possible by liver biopsy, an invasive procedure considered stressful by many families. cDNA cloning of G6PC and SLC37A4 allowed the screening of mutations responsible for subtypes Ia and Ib, which enabled establishing an alternative, less invasive diagnosis based on molecular biology techniques using blood samples. A diagnostic flowchart for this procedure was created based on mutation analysis combined with clinical and biochemical abnormalities.\n\n    In the present study, we aimed to identify mutations in G6PC and SLC37A4 genes in patients clinically suspected of having GSD Ia and Ib, and to compare the molecular findings with clinical diagnosis in these individuals and classify their disease types and subtypes.\n\n    Twelve unrelated subjects with clinical features suggestive of GSD Ia or Ib were studied. Inclusion criteria were based on typical clinical and laboratory findings, consisting of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia associated with hepatomegaly, \"doll face\", and biochemical changes including hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperuricemia, with or without neutropenia. Patients were of diverse ethnicities, including Iberian, Italian, Afro-Brazilian, and Amerindian background. An Ashkenazi origin was not referred. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all patients or their legal guardians gave informed consent before inclusion.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by using the standard phenol/chloroform method. Exons of the G6PC (five exons and 357 amino acids) and SLC37A4 (eleven exons and 450 aminoacids) genes and their flanking intron/exon junctions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using previously described primers.\n\n    The PCR fragments were directly sequenced using a MegaBACE1000  DYEnamic ET(Amersham Biosciences) apparatus. Sequencing was performed on both strands, and the analysis was done twice for each fragment, aiming to incresase confidence of the result. The obtained sequences were compared with the sequences of the G6PC (ENST00000253801) and SLC37A4 (ENST0000330775) always available in the Ensembl genome browser.\n\n    The present study confirmed the diagnosis of GSD Ia in three patients, and of GSD Ib in two others.\n\n    Four known changes were detected in G6PC, consisting of one missense, one nonsense and two neutral mutations: c.432G > A (rs161628) and c.1176T > C (rs2229611). Three individuals presented the p.R83C (c.326C > T) mutation (located in exon 2), two of them being homozygous and the other one compound heterozygous. A neutral mutation in exon five was found in the remaining allele of this last patient (p.Q347X; c.1118C > T).\n\n    Concerning the SLC37A4 gene, four changes were found, corresponding to a known missense mutation, a novel insertion (frameshift) and two neutral mutations: c.1287G > A (rs8192696) and c.1076-28C > T (rs201063857). The p.G149E (c.654G > A) mutation in exon four was found in one homozygous patient. In another homozygous individual, the insertion of a T base between nucleotides 1338 and 1339 was detected in exon eleven. This change results in a reading frame modification and creates a premature stop codon (Figure 1).\n\n    In addition to these mutations, some SNPs were also identified in this sample. In the remaining seven individuals, no disease causative mutation was found. Clinical and molecular data are summarized in Table 1.\n\n    The above results show that GSD1a was more prevalent than GSDIb in our case series. Considering the G6PC gene, p.R83C alters the amino acid that contributes to the active center of the enzyme. It is considered one of the most frequent mutations, seen both worldwide and in Brazil. The present results corroborate these findings identify this as the most prevalent one among the mutant alleles. This being the case, the evaluation of this mutation by RFLP may allow the disease diagnosis without the need for automated sequencing, reducing cost and time of examination, since the restriction site mutation alters the enzyme HgaI cleavage pattern.\n\n    The remaining change (p.Q347X), already described in the literature, leads to truncation of the carboxy-terminal 11 amino acid residues in human G6Pase and inactivates its activity. It is also frequently observed in individuals with impaired G6Pase, being common among Caucasian patients in the United States and Europe (north and south), representing 70% of all mutant alleles in these regions. Nevertheless, in the present sample, it was detected only in one allele of one patient, this being compound heterozygous for p.R83C.\n\n    In the SLC37A4 gene, a missense mutation p.G149E and an insertion c.1338_1339insT were found, each one in an individual, both homozygous. In addition to these, SNP c.1076-28C > T (rs201063857) was recently reported and shown to be present at a low frequency of heterozygosity (0.004%) in 570 participants of European descent. Our sample showed a high frequency, probably representing difference in ethnic background.\n\n    The amino acid glycine at position 149 is located in the transmembrane domain of the enzyme glucose 6-phosphate translocase, and the substitution of glycine to glutamic acid (p.G149E) changes the conformation of this enzyme. It is a rare change that has been reported only once in a Chinese family.\n\n    Finally, the present study allowed the identification of a new mutation, c.1338_1339insT, in individual 8. This patient is the fourth child of a consanguineous couple (first cousins) of Italian origin, whose third child died at the age of seven months with similar clinical symptoms. Pregnancy was complicated by maternal hypertension, and delivery was at 38 weeks of gestational age, weighting 3,590 g and measuring 51 cm. The child had hyperbilirubinemia after 48 h requiring exchange transfusion, and was released at the 5th day after birth. At 10 days, a single convulsion was documented and at the age of three months hepatomegaly was denoted. During investigation, glycemia after fasting was 2 mg, total cholesterol was 251 mg%, and triglyceride 814 mg% (both with a reference value: < 200), alkaline phosphatase was 477 IU/L (reference value: < 400), and CK 144 IU/L (reference value: < 190). Liver biopsy was performed for a histological study, which was compatible with GSD. After starting treatment with frequent meals, cornstarch, and dietary restriction of lipids and sugars (fructose, lactose, galactose, and sucrose), he presented normal neuromotor and somatic development, reaching a final height of 189 cm. Nevertheless, biochemical follow-up revealed variable degrees of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and he also developed hyperuricemia at the age of nine years, which was treated with 200 mg allopurinol twice a day. Renal function was always normal and neutropenia was never seen during routine exams, but at the age of 23 he presented an acute episode of sepsis and died after two days in another hospital with no further information available.\n\n    Although functional studies could not be performed to confirm that this mutation causes the disease, some aspects support the hypothesis. First, the insertion of the T base changed the reading frame, resulting in a different amino acid sequence and a premature stop codon. Second, no other causative mutation was found in this individual. Finally, the presence of parental consanguinity is compatible with the finding of this mutation in homozygosity.\n\n    In seven patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of GSDla and GSDIb no mutation was found in coding regions (exons) or adjacent introns. Mutations in other parts of the gene, including introns, were not studied, but it seems unlikely that they may cause an abnormal phenotype in these individuals. An alternative explanation to the negative results in this molecular study is the possibility of a misdiagnosis, since even with a careful evaluation based on laboratory and clinical findings, overlap with other types of GSD is possible. Thus further molecular studies would be indicated.\n\n    The molecular analysis of the two genes enabled diagnosis confirmation of GSDIa and Ib in four patients, without the need for liver biopsy. In addition, the identification of the mutation provided an additional tool for genetic counseling. Despite the limited number of subjects, our results showing that p.R83C was the most frequent mutation in G6PC in the present sample is compatible with international and previous Brazilian studies. Thus, in every patient with GSD Ia or Ib, we propose to start with an investigation of this mutation and then to sequence the G6PC gene. For patients without identifiable genetic mutations, enzymatic essay or a further molecular study of other GSD genes remain diagnostic tools. Finally, in this study a new mutation was found and described.\n\n    Associate Editor: Carlos F.M. Menck",

        "Title": "    Retrospective analysis in oculocutaneous albinism patients for the 2.7 kb deletion in the OCA2 gene revealed a co-segregation of the controversial variant, p.R305W",
        "Abstract": "    Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder. A significant portion of OCA patients has been found with a single pathogenic variant either in the TYR or the OCA2 gene. Diagnostic sequencing of the TYR and OCA2 genes is routinely used for molecular diagnosis of OCA subtypes. To study the possibility that genomic abnormalities with single or multiple exon involvement may account for a portion of the potential missing pathogenic variants (the second), we retrospectively analyzed the TYR gene by long range PCR and analyzed the target 2.7 kb deletion in the OCA2 gene spanning exon 7 in OCA patients with a single pathogenic variant in the target genes.\n\n    In the 108 patients analyzed, we found that one patient was heterozygous for the 2.7 kb OCA2 gene deletion and this patient was positive with one pathogenic variant and one possibly pathogenic variant [c.1103C>T (p.Ala368Val) + c.913C>T (p.R305W)]. Further analysis of maternal DNA, and two additional OCA DNA homozygous for the 2.7 kb deletion, revealed that the phenotypically normal mother is heterozygous of the 2.7 kb deletion and homozygous of the p.R305W. The two previously reported patients with homozygous of the 2.7 kb deletion are also homozygous of p.R305W.\n\n    Among the reported pathogenic variants, the pathogenicity of the p.R305W has been discussed intensively in literature. Our results indicate that p.R305W is unlikely a pathogenic variant. The possibility of linkage disequilibrium between p.R305W with the 2.7 kb deletion in OCA2 gene is also suggested.\n\n    The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13578-017-0149-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Introduction": "    Albinism is a disease caused by a lack of or reduction in the production of melanin pigment. There are many genes involved in the complex production of melanin, known as melanogenesis. Albinism affects about 1 in 17,000 individuals worldwide, with varied subtypes and prevalence among different ethnic populations. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is associated with a hypo-pigmented state of melanin in skin, hair, and eyes. In addition, OCA may manifest with eye symptoms such as photophobia, strabismus, nystagmus, and reduced visual acuity. Nonsyndromic OCA describes the disorders in which the manifestations are apparently limited to skin and eye functions. Nonsyndromic OCA is an autosomal recessive condition with genetic heterogeneity. Six genes and one additional locus have been identified as responsible for seven nonsyndromic OCA subtypes. They are OCA1 (TYR gene), OCA2 (OCA2 gene), OCA3 (TYRP1 gene), OCA4 (SLC45A2 gene), OCA6 (SLC24A5 gene), and OCA7 (C10orf11 gene). OCA5 was identified by linkage analysis to a genomic locus at 4q24. OCA1 is the most common subtype found in Caucasians and accounts for approximately 50% of cases worldwide. OCA-2 accounts for 30% of cases worldwide and is most prevalent among African and African-American populations. OCA2 is estimated to affect one in 10,000 individuals of African background, while it affects 1 in 36,000 individuals of Caucasian background.\n\n    The OCA2 gene (also known as Pink-Eyed Dilution, P gene) codes for a membrane protein localized at melanosomes in the melanocytes. Its function may involve transport of tyrosine and some other small molecules. The OCA2 protein may also play a role in stabilizing some melanosomal proteins such as tyrosinase and initiating melanin synthesis in melanocytes. Mutations in the OCA2 gene (cause the OCA2 phenotype (MIM 203200). The OCA2 gene consists of 24 exons (23 coding), spanning almost 345 kb of genomic DNA in the region of 15q11.2-q12. The OCA2 genomic location is also highly polymorphic.\n\n    In this study, we evaluated 108 clinically diagnosed OCA patients by sequencing their TYR and OCA2 genes. Then, we retrospectively analyzed the previously reported 2.7 kb OCA2 gene deletion using long-range PCR. We also confirmed the co-segregation of the deletion and the known controversial variant, p.R305W. We suggested that the p.R305W was the more ancestral allele and the 2.7 kb deletion was introduced into this allele more recently. This association will have a clinical impact on the pathogenicity assessment of the p.R305W variant and genetic consultation.",
        "Methods": "    Patients: OCA patients were clinically diagnosed in the United States. Peripheral blood was collected from each patient and DNA was extracted in the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview in Minneapolis, Minnesota from 2003 to 2008 and in the NEI DNA Diagnostic Lab at the National Eye Institute (NEI) in Bethesda, Maryland from 2009 to 2016. DNA samples were sequenced for TYR and OCA2 gene pathogenic variants in the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview or sequenced in the NEI DNA Diagnostic Laboratory at the National Eye Institute (NEI) in Bethesda, Maryland. This study was reviewed and approved by the University of Minnesota University IRB and the Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes of Health. Informed consent was obtained from each participant as adhering to tenets of the Declarations of Helsinki.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted using the Puregene genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen), and quantified with the ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Genomic DNA samples from patients were sequenced using protocol described previously.\n\n    Long range PCR was performed using the LA PCR kit 2.1 from Takara (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). PCR primers for the TYR gene intron regions were designed using GeneRunner 3.01 software and PCR condition were optimized by annealing temperatures, magnesium concentrations, and DMSO concentrations (Additional file 1: Table S1). PCR primers for the OCA2 2.7 kb deletion and PCR conditions were adapted from Durham-Pierre et al.. For this modified PCR protocol, we used a 2 primer set (MHB51F + MHB71R in a 1:1 ratio) or a 3 primer set (MHB51F + MHB72F + MHB71R in a 4:1:2 ratio) combinations (Fig. 1). The PCR condition was modified as: Denaturation at 94  C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94  C for 30 s and annealing at 69  C for 4 min, followed by final elongation at 72  C for 10 min. All PCR products were analyzed using 0.8 or 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.",
        "Results": "    In our past clinical genetic tests, OCA patients were sequenced for pathogenic variants in the TYR gene at the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview (Table 1). In the 68 OCA patients tested for the TYR gene mutations, single pathogenic variant was found in 23 patients and 2 pathogenic variants were found in 45 patients. Long range PCR was performed on these patients with a series of overlapped primer sets and with OCA patients with two pathogenic variants including one equivocal mutation of the single mutation samples as PCR controls (Additional file 1: Table S1). No abnormal PCR fragment was identified (data not shown). OCA2 gene sequencing test was developed later and used as a reflex clinical test for the patients without two pathogenic variants in the TYR gene sequencing at the National Eye Institute (Table 2). For the patients without pathogenic variant or with single pathogenic variant or variants with unknown significance in either TYR gene or OCA2 gene, we analyzed the OCA2 gene 2.7 kb exon 7 deletion. We found that none of these patients had the common exon 7 deletion. We then extended our exon 7 deletion analysis to the rest of the samples in the Tables 1 and 2. We discovered that one patient (NE27) was indeed heterozygous for the exon 7 deletion (Fig. 2). Interestingly, this patient NE27 was also positive for one known OCA2 gene pathogenic variant, c.1103C>T, p.Ala368Val, and one variant with uncertain significance but likely pathogenic, c.913C>T, p.R305W, as we interpreted based on our previous analysis and literature search. Moreover, the patient NE27's mother was phenotypically normal. We found that this mother was homozygous for the p.R305W variant (data not shown) and heterozygous for the exon 7 deletion (Fig. 2), suggesting the variant of p.R305W is likely to be a benign variant. In addition, the ExAC reported 383 homozygous of p.R305W in 119616 alleles worldwide (ExAC, 3/12/2017). This is strongly support the variant is polymorphism not a pathogenic mutation.\n\n    We sequenced the 2.7 kb deletion junction fragment isolated from patient NE27 and determined the exact genomic abnormality for this deletion (Fig. 1) as reported previously. Our study identified the deletion of 2958 bases at g.28,017,720_28,020,677 (GRCh38) and followed by replacement with triple A (c.646+1823_c.807+678delinsAAA, p.?), which deleted the exon 7 of OCA2 gene, leading to an exon skip and potential frameshift (because the exon 7 contains 161 bp which is not in-frame if deleted). This deletion generated an 802 bp PCR fragment by the MHR51F and MHR72R primers. We further analyzed two previously reported homozygotes of the 2.7 kb deletion for the p.R305W variant and found that they were all homozygous for p.R305W too. One additional patient who was heterozygous for the deletion was also heterozygous for the p.R305W variant. It clearly indicated the phase that the 2.7 kb deletion spanning the exon 7 of OCA2 gene was indeed in cis with the p.R305W variant in the exon 9 of OCA2 gene.",
        "Conclusion": "    In summary, we herein evaluated 108 clinically diagnosed OCA patients by sequencing their TYR and OCA2 genes, and alkalized the 2.7 kb OCA2 gene deletion using long-range PCR. We confirmed the co-segregation of the deletion and the known controversial variant, p.R305W. Our results suggest that the p.R305W is the more ancestral allele and the 2.7 kb deletion is introduced into this allele more recently. These results provided evidence that do not support a pathogenic classification for the p.R305W variant. This association will have a clinical impact genetic consultation for OCA patients.",
        "Discussion": "    In our study, we sequenced DNA samples from 108 OCA patients for TYR or OCA2 gene pathogenic variants. Our results consistently supported the published allele distributions. We also performed long range PCR to search for potential large genomic rearrangements such as deletion or duplication in the TYR locus and for the 2.7 kB deletion in OCA2 gene. We did not identify any abnormality at the TYR intronic regions using the long range PCR methodology, suggesting that other mechanisms, such as splicing error variants, might be involved. We cannot rule out that this approach was not sensitive enough for smaller sizes of deletions/insertion or even larger massive genomic rearrangements. In addition, we also noticed high frequent of the Alu repetitive sequences in the TYR intronic regions.\n\n    The three primer PCR assay system that we adapted from Durham et al. enabled us to determine the genotype of the individuals in a single multiplex PCR with an internal wild type intron sequence control. Observation of the 802 bp deletion-specific junction fragment, the 3.5 kb fragment for the intact genomic region, and the 237 bp fragment spanning one of the breaking points in OCA2 heterozygotes provided a convenient carrier status confirmation analysis for routine clinical diagnostics (Fig. 2).\n\n    In a comparison of gender, ethnic background, genotypes from sequencing results and the deletion status in five samples that were positive for the p.R305W variant (Table 3), besides the patient NE27, we found that the OCA2 gene in patient NE12 contains two heterozygous pathogenic variants: an A-G change at nucleotide 1465 (c.1465A>G) in exon 14, and a T-G change at nucleotide 2310 (c.2310T>G) in exon 22. These pathogenic variants change the amino acid Asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D) at residue 489 (p.N489D) and amino acid Tyrosine (Y) to a termination codon (*) at residue 770 (p.Y770*), respectively, in the P protein. The pathogenic variant p.N489D has been identified in unrelated patients diagnosed with Oculocutaneous Albinism Type 2. The pathogenic variant p.Y770* has not been identified in patients diagnosed with Oculocutaneous Albinism Type 2 to our knowledge. However, this nonsense variant is predicted to cause a premature termination in translation and lead to protein product truncation and expected to be pathogenic. The p.R305W was also present in this patient with unknown phase. In three other patients (NE21, NE22, NE30), it was interesting to note that they were all positive for a single pathogenic variant in the TYR gene. It was more likely that there would be an unknown secondary pathogenic variant at their TYR locus on the other chromosome.\n\n    The OCA2 (P) gene consists of 24 exons (23 coding), spanning almost 345 kb of genomic DNA in the region of 15q11.2-q12. The 2.7 kb deletion was expected to result in a frameshift in the first luminal loop, predicting a truncation of the polypeptide and a non-functional gene product. Regarding the protein structure and predicted function, the p.R305 locates in the first luminal loop. Kamaraj and Purohit provided a computational model to depict the functional consequence of p.R305W change. It was predicted that the p.R305W leads to more flexible in conformation, which might alter the catalytic function in melanin biosynthesis. We propose that such functional alteration is not sufficient to lead to OCA. Therefore, homozygous genotype itself would not present OCA and it is demonstrated by unaffected individuals in the population. But in a subpopulation of p.R305W, co-segregated 2.7 kb exon 7 deletion was the real disease-causing mutation. Our previously identified exon 7 deletion positive samples in homozygous and heterozygous status were consistently associated with the p.R305W variant. It suggests that the p.R305W variant was more likely an associated variant as a more ancient allele in linkage disequilibrium. The pathogenicity of the p.R305W has been discussed intensively in literature. Until this study, we were still interpreting that the p.R305W was a VUS with likely pathogenic. Based on the analysis on allele origination, our results are not consistent with the p.R305W variant functioning as a pathogenic variant in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. We speculate that the dispute for the pathogenicity of p.R305W was due to lack of analysis on this exon 7 related deletion in the past, which presented as disease associated marker. It should be brought to an attention for our clinical molecular diagnosis on OCA2. More attention should be given to the patient ethnic background and the possibility of a 2.7 kb exon 7 deletion associated with the p.R305W variant in sequencing tests. The p.R305W variant itself is likely benign variant in cis with the exon 7 deletion and likely misleading for OCA accurate molecular diagnosis.",

        "Title": "    Testotoxicosis: Report of Two Cases, One with a Novel Mutation in LHCGR Gene",
        "Abstract": "    Testotoxicosis is a rare disorder which presents as isosexual peripheral precocious puberty in males. Despite the pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance, sporadic cases also may occur. Due to activating mutation in luteinizing hormone (LH))/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) gene, early virilization and advancement in bone age are common with increased serum testosterone levels above adult ranges, despite low LH and follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. There are different treatment regimens, such as combination of bicalutamide (antiandrogen agent) and a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, that are reported to be well-tolerated and successful in slowing bone age advancement and preventing progression of virilization. We report here two patients who presented with peripheral precocious puberty and an activating mutation in the LHCGR gene: one with a family history and previously determined mutation and the other without family history and with a novel mutation (c.830G>T). Combination of bicalutamide+anastrozole was ineffective in slowing pubertal progression and bone age. Short-term results were better with ketoconazole.",
        "Introduction": "    First described by Schedewei et al, familial male-limited precocious puberty is a rare, autosomal dominant form of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males. Sporadic cases were also reported. In this condition, due to activating mutations in luteinizing hormone (LH)/choriogonadotropin receptor gene (LHCGR), testicular steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis are stimulated.\n\n    This disorder was also called \"testotoxicosis\" by Rosenthal et al The age of onset is usually 2-4 years. Unilateral or bilateral testicular growth is observed. Nodular Leydig cell hyperplasia can be observed and seminiferous tubular development is usually sufficient to allow spermatogenesis. Due to activating mutation in the LHCGR gene, an extremely muscular body build, accelerated growth and advanced bone age are commonly observed. Testosterone levels are in or above the adult male range with low LH and follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Central precocious puberty typically follows over time. After the maturation of hypothalamo-pituitary-testicular axis, normal adult function appears to range from normal paternity to reduced testicular volume or oligospermia.\n\n    Although the reported mutations in familial and sporadic cases had a genetic heterogeneity, they were usually sited in exon 11. However, further studies revealed that there were a considerable number of cases, especially sporadic forms, whose mutations were sited in exons other than 11. In order to reduce the synthesis and action of androgens, several agents such as medroxiprogesterone, ketoconazole, cyproterone have been used for treatment. Aromatase inhibitors are also included in treatment regimens for slowing of bone age advancement. In recent studies, different combinations of new generation aromatase inhibitors and anti-androgen agents such as bicalutamide have been reported and recommended for the treatment of difficult cases.\n\n    We report here two patients who presented with an activating mutation in the LHCGR gene: one familial with a previously reported mutation and one sporadic with a novel mutation (c.830G>T), in whom combination of bicalutamide+anastrozole treatment was ineffective.",
        "Methods": "",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Testotoxicosis becomes usually symptomatic by 2-4 years of age; however, in some cases, the clinical signs and laboratory findings of puberty appear earlier. Teles et al reported a healthy 10-month-old boy investigated because of an older brother with familial testotoxicosis. The same heterozygous mutation Thr577Ile was determined and the bone age was found to be advanced. In this patient, despite lack of virilization signs, cyproterone acetate was started at the age of 1.3 years in order to decrease testosterone levels and growth velocity. In our first patient, pubic hair development and penile enlargement had started at the age of six months and, to our knowledge, he is the youngest patient with virilization symptoms. We can speculate that this early and severe clinical aspect was related to the novel c.830G>T (p.S277I) mutation in the LHCGR gene.\n\n    In patients with testotoxicosis, in addition to clinical and laboratory investigations, genetic analyses are beneficial for diagnosis and follow-up. Several mutations were reported in Caucasian, Afro-American and Brazilian populations. There has been genetic heterogeneity, but mutations were usually sited in exon 11. However, further studies revealed that there were a considerable number of cases, especially sporadic forms, in which mutations were commonly sited in exons other than 11. In patient 1, a novel mutation c.830G>T (p.S277I) (heterozygous) was determined in exon 9 of LHCGR gene and he is a sporadic case. According to his family history, patient 2 probably had familial testotoxicosis, but unfortunately, the other family members with probable testotoxicosis did not give permission for investigation. Our second patient and his mother had the mutation c.1118C>T (p.A373V) (heterozygous) previously reported by Gromoll et al in 11 exon of LHCGR gene. Some studies have attempted to establish an association between phenotype and genotype. Signs of precocious puberty appeared at age 17 months in our patient 2, while the patient who had the same mutation and was reported by Gromoll et al had signs at the age of 5 years. Although presentation ages were different, ketoconazole treatment was effective in both cases in the short term.\n\n    Independently from treatment, testotoxicosis can cause testicular changes. In biopsy specimens from patients with testotoxicosis, Gondos et al observed that the morphologic changes indicated premature differentiation of all of the major testicular cell types. Leydig cells demonstrated nuclear and cytoplasmic features characteristic of fully differentiated steroidogenic cells; germ cells at all stages of spermatogenesis were present, but their maturation was disorganized and spermatids had structural abnormalities. In 1998, Martin et al (24) reported testicular seminoma in an adult patient. He was diagnosed at the age of 27 months and had the A578G mutation in LHCGR gene. However, seminoma is not the only cause of solid mass in testes of affected patients. Leschek et al reported nodular Leydig cell hyperplasia in a patient with testotoxicosis who had A564G mutation. Thus, our first patient is the second reported case with nodular cell hyperplasia which might be due to overstimulation of Leydig cells. Testicular microlithiasis determined in patient 2 is an uncommon condition characterized by calcium deposits in the lumina of seminiferous tubules. These intratesticular calcifications appear as bright, 2- to 3-mm echogenic foci on testicular ultrasound. It might be a benign condition with a potential for malignancy. It is reported that this ultrasonographic sign can occur in many conditions such as germ cell tumors, epididymitis, cryptorchidism, retractile testis and hypotrophic testis (25,26,27). While observed in some cases, hydrocele is not a common cause of testicular microlithiasis. Microlithiasis has also not been reported in patients with LH-activating mutations; Gougoudi et al reported that testicular microlithiasis co-existed with Leydig cell hyperplasia in Wistar rats. Thus, whether Leydig cell hyperstimulation in our patient is the cause of microlithiasis or not is not known.\n\n    In testotoxicosis, there is no consensus for treatment modality and, as shown in Table 3, different regimens have been proposed. Rosenthal et al used oral medroxyprogesterone in two boys and observed distinct decrease in serum total testosterone level and height velocity. One agent which has been widely used is ketoconazole which inhibits adrenal and testicular androgen biosynthesis. Holland et al reported that ketoconazole (3x200 mg/dose) led to a reduced testosterone levels in three affected patients, but after 1-3 months of treatment, a marked pubertal response to GnRH stimulation test was found to occur. This phenomenon could question the use of ketoconazole alone. Bertelloni et al treated two patients with cyproterone acetate and 2 patients with ketoconazole. Cyproterone acetate was ineffective in clinical progression. Although ketoconazole reduced testosterone secretion and improved the final height in one patient, the second patient had a short adult height of -2 SDS which was below his target height. Conversely, Soriano-Guillen et al observed that final heights of five patients treated with ketoconazole (16.2 mg/kg/day) were in concordance with their target heights and were significantly higher than their pretreatment predicted heights. Total testosterone levels with treatment were less than 0.5 ng/mL and none of the patients had early activation of the pituitary-gonadal axis. Ketoconazole was well-tolerated; only one patient had a transient and modest increase in serum transaminases. The main side effect of ketoconazole is hepatic injury that may lead to cirrhosis. Other side effects such as interstitial pneumonitis have been also reported. Cyproterone acetate which antagonizes androgen action at the receptor level is another agent administered in testotoxicosis. Almeida et al reported a multicentric, retrospective, long-term treatment study in which 10 patients were evaluated. Cyproterone acetate was administered to five patients and ketoconazole to five others. Age of onset of disease and duration of treatment were similar. The authors concluded that long-term treatment with cyproterone acetate or ketoconazole resulted in similar outcomes without serious side effect. However, both agents had limited effectiveness on height.\n\n    Further studies revealed that new combinations of aromatase inhibitors+anti-androgen agents such as anastrozole+cyproterone acetate and anastrozole+bicalutamide were effective in reducing virilization and in decreasing testosterone synthesis without important complications. Lenz et al reported two boys treated with anastrozole+bicalutamide. This combination was well-tolerated, effective in preventing progression of virilization and in slowing bone-age advancement with no decrease in linear growth. The weakness of all these studies was the small number of patients or short-term outcomes.\n\n    Testotoxicosis may be difficult to treat in some cases. Although bicalutamide treatment has been reported as well-tolerated and effective, in the presented 2 patients, it was not successful in reducing serum testosterone levels, bone age advancement and pubertal progression. Short-term laboratory and clinical results of ketoconazole treatment seemed to be more efficacious in these two patients. Long-term studies with large numbers of patients are necessary for evaluation of these agents regarding prognosis, treatment efficacy and long-term effects on adult height, fertility and metabolic parameters.",

        "Title": "    Comprehensive mismatch repair gene panel identifies variants in patients with Lynch-like syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Lynch-like syndrome (LLS) represents around 50% of the patients fulfilling the Amsterdam Criteria II/revised Bethesda Guidelines, characterized by a strong family history of Lynch Syndrome (LS) associated cancer, where a causative variant was not identified during genetic testing for LS.\n\n    Using data extracted from a larger gene panel, we have analyzed next-generation sequencing data from 22 mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MSH3, PMS1, MLH3, EXO1, POLD1, POLD3 RFC1, RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, RFC5, PCNA, LIG1, RPA1, RPA2, RPA3, POLD2, POLD4, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) in 274 LLS patients. Detected variants were annotated and filtered using ANNOVAR and FILTUS software.\n\n    Thirteen variants were revealed in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, all genes previously linked to LS. Five additional genes (EXO1, POLD1, RFC1, RPA1, and MLH3) were found to harbor 11 variants of unknown significance in our sample cohort, two of them being frameshift variants.\n\n    We have shown that other genes associated with the process of DNA MMR have a high probability of being associated with LLS families. These findings indicate that the spectrum of genes that should be tested when considering an entity like Lynch-like syndrome should be expanded so that a more inclusive definition of this entity can be developed.",
        "Introduction": "    Lynch Syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC) and other epithelial malignancies and accounts for approximately 2%-3% of all CRC patients diagnosed annually (de la Chapelle, 2004; Hampel et al., 2005). LS, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is defined by the presence of germline mutations in one of four genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (MMR); MLH1 (OMIM: 120436), MSH2 (OMIM: 609309), MSH6 (OMIM: 600678), and PMS2 (OMIM: 600259) (Lynch & de la Chapelle, 1999). Deletions in EPCAM are also implicated in LS that are associated with epigenetic silencing of MSH2 (Kuiper et al., 2011). It is important to identify LS mutation carriers, in order to offer them regular surveillance programs like colonoscopy to improve early detection of cancer.\n\n    LS tumor spectrum is quite wide, involving in most cases CRC and, for women, a high risk of endometrial cancer (Lek et al., 2016). In addition, MMR mutations in LS causes an increased risk of ovarian, gastric, urologic tract, kidney, ureter, small bowel, and hepatobiliary tract tumors (Samadder et al., 2017; Watson & Riley, 2005).\n\n    LS is an entity that has been diagnosed using the Amsterdam criteria (AC) and Bethesda guidelines (BG), or variants of it (the AC II or revised BG) using the patient's pedigree and family history of cancer (Rodriguez-Bigas et al., 1997; Umar et al., 2004; Vasen, Mecklin, Khan, & Lynch, 1991; Vasen, Watson, Mecklin, & Lynch, 1999). Genetic screening by Sanger sequencing to identify causative variants in MMR genes has been the gold standard to diagnose patients at risk of LS. Individuals fulfilling the AC II or revised BG without a molecular diagnosis are now termed Lynch-like syndrome (LLS) families (Carethers, 2014; Giardiello et al., 2014).\n\n    Families that fulfill the AC, where probands have tumors displaying microsatellite instability (MSI) or a loss of MMR genes expression (as judged by immunohistochemistry), are offered screening for pathogenic variants in MMR genes (usually by DNA sequencing) to identify a causative genetic variant. Using this approach, approximately 50% of LS patients remain without a molecular diagnosis after screening the common MMR genes (Bonis et al., 2007; Lindor et al., 2005; Steinke et al., 2014). Early detection and management provide the best likelihood of survival, thus identifying high-risk individuals who could benefit from early detection is a priority. The 50% of patients where pathogenic variants cannot be detected are commonly termed LLS families or familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX) as disease segregation is suggestive of an inherited disease but in the absence of any identifiable causative variant. This group appears to have a later age of disease onset compared to LS, suggesting that these families have lower levels of disease penetrance (Lipkin & Afrasiabi, 2007). While the definitions of LLS and FCCTX mostly overlap, LLS is defined by patients with MSI-High tumors but no loss of MMR immunohistochemistry staining (for the four main MMR genes) (Carethers, 2014). On the other hand, FCCTX describes patients fulfilling the AC I but no causative pathogenic variants has been found, and are mostly microsatellite-stable (MSS) (Lipkin & Afrasiabi, 2007).\n\n    DNA MMR involves the coordinated response of at least 22 proteins (KEGG pathways (Kanehisa, Furumichi, Tanabe, Sato, & Morishima, 2017), Figure 1) that are involved in mismatch recognition, protein recruitment to the lesion, removal of the mismatch and replacement of the incorrect base with the correct one (Fishel, 2015). Thus, the possibility exists that other defects in the DNA MMR pathway may be associated with cancer risk, which manifests as an entity similar to LS. Evidence to support this comes from studies that have examined MLH3 where it has been proposed to be a candidate gene implicated in LS (Liu et al., 2003). This is supported by evidence that demonstrates MSH3 variants appear to confer a low risk of disease (associated with various phenotypes (Carethers, Koi, & Tseng-Rogenski, 2015) including a phenotype of polyposis (Adam et al., 2016)) and have a synergistic effect when accompanied by MSH2 variants (Duraturo et al., 2011). Previously, POLD1 variants have shown to be associated with an increased risk of CRC that results in a phenotypic disease spectrum, which includes phenotypes, observed in both LS and a polyposis (Buchanan et al., 2017).\n\n    To assess the involvement of other MMR genes in LS, we investigated the presence of potentially pathogenic variants in 22 MMR genes (MSH3, PMS1, MLH3 (OMIM: 604395), EXO1 (OMIM: 606063), POLD1 (OMIM: 174761), POLD3, RFC1 (OMIM: 102579), RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, RFC5, PCNA, LIG1, RPA1 (OMIM: 179835), RPA2, RPA3, POLD2, POLD4, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2), using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in patients with a clinical diagnosis of LS. All of whom fulfilled the ACII or the revised BG but lacked a causative variant for the standard MMR gene(s) after genetic testing.",
        "Methods": "    Ethics approval was obtained from the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (04/03/10/3.11) and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (H-2008-0337).\n\n    This study used DNA obtained from 82 Norwegian and 192 Australian LLS patients (n = 274, see Table 1) previously described (Hansen et al., 2017). In brief, all patients fulfilled the AC II criteria or revised BG and had no pathogenic variant detected during routine genetic screening for the MMR gene(s) tested (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and/or PMS2). All patients were previously screened for one or more MMR genes as per their practician recommendations.\n\n    The sample cohort consisted of unrelated (Australian) and unrelated/related (Norwegian) individuals; eight families with two to three individuals per family were present in the Norwegian cohort (Hansen et al., 2017).\n\n    DNA samples from all patients were sequenced as part of the health-care system and all patients have given written informed consent for their samples to be used for research. Ethics approval was obtained from relevant committees.\n\n    Sequencing data were generated (See Figure S1) from a 124 multigene panel study described in (Hansen et al., 2017), which contained 22 MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MSH3, PMS1, MLH3, EXO1, POLD1, POLD3, RFC1, RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, FRC5, PCNA, LIG1, RPA1, RPA2, RPA3, POLD2, and POLD4).\n\n    A custom Haloplex design (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used for library preparation. Description of both the Haloplex design and the sequencing protocols (HiSeq 2500 and NextSeq, Illumina) have been reported previously (Hansen et al., 2017).\n\n    The previous (Hansen et al., 2017) study analyzed only 10 MMR genes, (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MSH3, PMS1, MLH3, EXO1, POLD1, and POLD3). In this current study, we included data from those genes as well as data from the remaining 12 MMR genes (RFC1, RFC2, RFC3, RFC4, FRC5, PCNA, LIG1, RPA1, RPA2, RPA3, POLD2, and POLD4) to create a complete MMR gene panel (See Figure S1 for a full flowchart of the study's design).\n\n    Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li & Durbin, 2009) was utilized to align the paired end reads to the human genome (hg19, UCSC assembly, February 2009). BAM files were converted with SAMtools (Li et al., 2009). Variant calling was performed according to GATK Best Practice recommendations using GATK version 3.1 (McKenna et al., 2010) including local realignment around insertion/deletions (indels) and recalibration of quality scores. The variant caller HaplotypeCaller was utilized. Quality control of the called variants was performed using GATK variant filtration with parameter settings according to the recommendations in SEQanswers exome sequencing analysis guide (Van der Auwera et al., 2013). In short, variant quality score recalibration (VQSR) was applied using the recommended set of known variants for both indels and SNP. The tranche threshold of 99.0 was used to select variants. ANNOVAR (Wang, Li, & Hakonarson, 2010) was used to annotate detected variants and filtering of variants was done using the filtering tool FILTUS version 1.0.4 (Vigeland, Gjotterud, & Selmer, 2016).\n\n    FILTUS, a desktop software for fast and efficient detection of disease-causing variants was used on the annotated files (Vigeland et al., 2016). The 10 MMR genes belonging to the gene panel previously analyzed by Hansen et al. (2017 were also included in the current study due to different filtering strategies and for comparative purposes.\n\n    Variants were filtered in the 22 MMR genes individually (gene lookup in FILTUS), with function collapse = lists all samples that have same variant together and saved as individual files on gene name, before being combined into one file. Variants with a frequency of more than 0.05 in public databases (ExaC or gNomad (Lek et al., 2016)) were first excluded. Then variants were excluded if detected in more than five unrelated individuals in our cohort (not likely to be pathogenic due to their high frequency) and intronic variants were ignored if they had no variant prediction. Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indel variants were included in further filtering.\n\n    After in silico filtering, using FILTUS, we performed some manual filtering and variant interpretation to remove artifacts and only selecting variants most likely to be causative. We checked detected variants against results reported by Hansen et al. (2017. Further, variant interpretation was performed utilizing Alamut software (Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) and evaluating available literature.\n\n    After the initial filtering step of each gene individually using FILTUS, we identified 29 potential pathogenic exonic indels and 170 exonic nonsynonymous SNVs. We applied the following nonsynonymous variant categorical predictions: AVSIFT score <0.05 = deleterious, LJB PhyloP prediction = conserved (>0.95), LJB SIFT = damaging (>0.99), LJB PolyPhen2 = damaging (>0.85), LJB LRT = deleterious (>0.99), MutationTaster = damaging (>0.59), GERP++ (>3.0 - except one with a score of 1.84) which resulted in 50 exonic nonsynonymous SNVs being identified that were predicted to be deleterious/damaging by in silico analysis. All of the variants identified in this study were heterozygous. After additional manual filtering, 25 possible causative variants remained in our list (see Table 2).\n\n    Sanger sequencing was used to confirm possible pathogenic variants remaining after applying filtering steps described above. The fragments were amplified using AmpliTaq Gold  360 MasterMix and 360 GC Enhancer (Life Technologies). Cycle sequencing reaction was performed with BigDye  Terminator v3.1 (Life Technologies) and subsequent capillary electrophoresis was performed on the ABI 3130xl or ABI 3730 (Life Technologies). Sanger sequencing data were analyzed using SeqScape Software v3.0 (Life Technologies).",
        "Results": "    After the final filtering, 25 possible causative variants remained (see Table 2). Of these 25 variants, six were predicted to be pathogenic (24%), all located in either MLH1 or MSH6.\n\n    We identified 13 variants in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, seven previously reported by Hansen et al. (2017 will not be discussed further. Two nonsynonymous variants were identified in MLH1; c.1130A > C and an intronic ATA deletion (rs778381149) upstream of exon 12 in a highly variable region of DNA. Two unrelated individuals were identified with the c.1130A > C variant.\n\n    In MSH6, four separate variants were found (each in different individuals); c.1054C > T, c.431G > T, c.1118C > G, and c.892A > G. The c.1054C > T variant is a nonsense variant resulting in a truncated protein p.R352X previously described as pathogenic (ClinVar variation ID: 89194). The c.431G > T and c.1118C > G variants are classified as benign and likely benign respectively, while c.892A > G is of unknown significance.\n\n    Of the 13 variants in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, four are considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic; two of the samples had not been tested for the gene where we found the variant previously (one due to IHC results indicating MLH1/PMS2 when the variant found is in MSH2). The other two were tested in late 1990s or early 2000.\n\n    Five additional MMR genes were found to harbor 12 variants in our cohort (see Table 2). A frameshift variant in MLH3 will not be discussed further as it has been previously described (Hansen et al., 2017). EXO1, POLD1, RFC1, and RPA1 were all found to harbor variants, one benign and the remaining variants of unknown significance (VUSs). Moreover, the variants (except RFC1 c.2276A > G and POLD1 c.2510G > C) were nonconservative, suggesting the resultant amino acid is significantly different from the original.\n\n    EXO1 harbored three different variants; c.2009A > G is a missense variant leading to a change of amino acid from glutamic acid to glycine, p.(Glu670Gly), the variant affects the interaction domain between MSH2 and EXO1 but is predicted to be benign. Two nonsense variants were also identified in two different patients; c.1928T > A and c.2485G > T both predicted to result in a truncated protein p.L643X and p.E829X. The p.L643X variant misses both MLH1 and MSH2 interaction domains and the p.E829X misses only the MLH1 interaction domain. Failing to recruit the EXO1 protein with the recognition complex would lead to a defective MMR pathway, the accumulation of pathogenic variant and MSI.\n\n    POLD1 encodes for the catalytic subunit of the polymerase delta. Three different VUSs were detected in this gene. The c.1558insG is a frameshift variant that would most likely affect POLD1 mRNA, leading to RNA degradation and no protein expression. Two other missense variants were identified; c.1592A > G and c2510G > C both located between protein domains.\n\n    RFC1 codes for the subunit 1 of the Replication Factor C. Two different variants were identified; c.2017G > A and c.2276A > G. The two variants of RFC1 are both located on the ATPase functional domain of the protein subunit. RFC acts as a clamp loader for PCNA during DNA replication and damage repair. DNA resynthesis is significantly impaired by the loss of function of both RFC1 and PCNA.\n\n    Three variants were found in RPA1, namely c.856G > T, c.1165C > T and c.1160G > A. Two of these, c.1165C > T and c.1160G > A, were located in the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain (OB) domain. The OB domain allows RPA1 protein to bind ssDNA in a nonsequence-specific manner and to stabilize the single strand after the damaged strand is excised (Bochkareva, Korolev, Lees-Miller, & Bochkarev, 2002). The remaining variant c.856G > T did not appear to alter the functional domain of the protein.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The presence of potentially pathogenic variants in patients diagnosed with LLS shows that there is a clear need to create an exhaustive list of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic genes for inherited CRC in order to identify individuals with a high risk of developing CRC and genes/variants appropriate for functional analysis. MMR genes are good candidates given that they are predicted to be causative in 8% of patients in the current study, a yield comparable to similar studies (Dong et al., 2018; Paulo et al., 2018). In addition, our results suggest that re-screening the four known LS genes in previously variant-negative LS patients with the more sensitive approach of NGS should be undertaken to ensure no pathogenic variants have been missed using less sensitive screening methods.\n\n    From the 274 patients enrolled in this study and not previously described we revealed 22 potentially causative variants in nine different MMR genes. Included in the study were the four known LS MMR genes (MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2) as it is well accepted that older variant detection methods were not as sensitive as approaches that are more contemporary. The number of variants identified in MLH1 and MSH6 reflects the sensitivity of older screening methodologies that may not have revealed the presence of these causative variants. We detected additional variants in MLH1 and MSH6 compared to Hansen et al. (2017 due to less stringent filtering strategies in FILTUS.\n\n    The identification of 11 potentially pathogenic variants through in silico analysis in the extended MMR gene panel does reveal the extent to which the DNA MMR pathway might be associated with the risk of cancer development in families classified as LLS. We show here that families categorized as LLS harbor potentially pathogenic variants in other MMR genes than those already associated with LS. The genes EXO1, POLD1, RFC1, and RPA1 harbor that variants that were predicted to be pathogenic. None of the variants identified in this study have previously been associated with a cancer phenotype, which is probably due to their extremely low frequency in the general population. However, disrupting the MMR pathway could be a possible cause of cancer development. It is known that RFC1, RPA1, and POLD1 are involved in DNA damage repair mechanisms other than MMR and DNA synthesis during replication (see KEGG orthology: K10754, K02999 and K02327). EXO1 is involved with other DNA repair and maintenance mechanisms (Keijzers, Liu, & Rasmussen, 2016). Interestingly, the two nonsense EXO1 variants identified in our study are predicted to affect the binding to MSH2/MLH1, suggesting that the loss of function would specifically affect EXO1 MMR-related functions. Moreover, RPA1 and POLD1 have been previously described as deleterious when mutated in cancer (Nicolas, Golemis, & Arora, 2016; Wang et al., 2005). Variants in POLD1 are described in patients presenting a polyposis phenotype termed polymerase-proofreading associated polyposis (PPAP) (Palles et al., 2013). The pathogenic variants identified in POLD1 in the current study support the notion that the phenotypes of LS and PPAP might overlap, both with a multitumor phenotype.\n\n    RPA1 variants have previously been implicated in cancers that are associated with chromosome instability (Hass, Gakhar, & Wold, 2010; Wang et al., 2005). However, a comprehensive genetic study did not show a clear association with CRC (Jokic et al., 2011).\n\n    A meta-analysis supports a significant association between RFC1 p.G80A and plasma cell malignancies (Huang et al., 2016). Moreover, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA data) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research et al., 2013) shows that somatic RFC1 variants occur in 10.2% of uterine cancers and 5.5% of CRCs, which is consistent with tumors identified in LS. RFC1 has been previously described as a member of the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC) (Wang et al., 2000). This complex is involved in DNA damage and abnormal structure detection and more generally in the maintenance of genomic integrity making it a good candidate gene for LLS.\n\n    Pathogenic variants in EXO1 were also found in the current study but its exact role remains to be determined. A previous study suggests that the gene is either associated with low-disease penetrance or influencing a polygenic risk score (Talseth-Palmer et al., 2016). Other reports indicate that even in healthy patients, EXO1 variants are present, including those that result in a truncated protein (Jagmohan-Changur et al., 2003) and consequently loss of function. Notwithstanding, in our study, both EXO1 c.1928T > A and c.2485G > T leads to a truncated protein. The variant c.1928T > A has lost the MLH2 and MLH1 interaction domain, whereas the c.2485G > T variant truncates only the MLH1 interaction domain. Lack of either of these domains could affect EXO1 recruitment at the site of the mismatch or DNA damage, impairing the MMR process (Goellner, Putnam, & Kolodner, 2015).\n\n    To assess the link between the variants identified in the current study and the development of CRC in LLS families, larger sample cohorts are needed with detailed analysis of the tumor phenotypes to establish if indeed many of the downstream MMR functions are associated with MSI tumors. Furthermore, detailed segregation analysis is required to determine if the variant segregates with disease. Finally, functional analysis would significantly aid in characterizing their respective pathogenic effects.\n\n    Limitations of the current study include the relatively small number of patients tested. A larger sample cohort and functional studies of the identified variants are required to confirm the results of this study. Segregation analysis would provide insights into the pathogenicity of these variants but could not be performed as part of this study.\n\n    In conclusion, we have shown that other genes associated with the process of DNA MMR have a high probability of being associated with LLS families. In addition, approximately 8% of families that fulfill the ACII or RB criteria in our sample cohort appear to be accounted for by genes involved in the MMR pathway. These findings indicate that these variants are important as they will guide future research focused on the functional impact of newly discovered variants.",

        "Title": "    The Molecular Basis of Retinal Dystrophies in Pakistan",
        "Abstract": "    The customary consanguineous nuptials in Pakistan underlie the frequent occurrence of autosomal recessive inherited disorders, including retinal dystrophy (RD). In many studies, homozygosity mapping has been shown to be successful in mapping susceptibility loci for autosomal recessive inherited disease. RDs are the most frequent cause of inherited blindness worldwide. To date there is no comprehensive genetic overview of different RDs in Pakistan. In this review, genetic data of syndromic and non-syndromic RD families from Pakistan has been collected. Out of the 132 genes known to be involved in non-syndromic RD, 35 different genes have been reported to be mutated in families of Pakistani origin. In the Pakistani RD families 90% of the mutations causing non-syndromic RD and all mutations causing syndromic forms of the disease have not been reported in other populations. Based on the current inventory of all Pakistani RD-associated gene defects, a cost-efficient allele-specific analysis of 11 RD-associated variants is proposed, which may capture up to 35% of the genetic causes of retinal dystrophy in Pakistan.",
        "Introduction": "    Inherited retinal dystrophies (RD) belong to a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders. The clinical sub-classification of this group of diseases is based on the nature of the disease (stationary or progressive), the inheritance pattern, and the dysfunctional part of the retina. The disease is either congenital, occurring early in life, such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA; MIM# 204000), and congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB; MIM# 310500), or might have a later onset, such as in retinitis pigmentosa (RP; MIM# 268000), cone-rod dystrophy (CRD; MIM# 604116), and cone dystrophy (CD; MIM# 602093). In addition to disorders confined to the eye, there are syndromic forms of the disease in which retinal dystrophy is either among the primary clinical symptoms or might manifest at an advanced stage. The most common syndromic form of RD is Usher syndrome (USH; MIM# 276900), in which RP is associated with variable degrees of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Other types of syndromic RD include Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS; MIM# 209900), Senior-Loken syndrome (SLSN; MIM# 266900), Joubert syndrome (JBTS; MIM# 213300), and Meckel syndrome (MKS; MIM# 249000). All these syndromes exhibit severe clinical features in addition to retinal degeneration.\n\n    The estimated worldwide prevalence of RD is 1 in 3000 individuals. RP is the most frequent phenotype among the RDs, affecting 1 in 4000 individuals. In Pakistan the frequency of RD is not very well defined, but a hospital-based study estimated autosomal recessive RP to be the most prevalent. In several developing countries, as opposed to Western countries, consanguinity has always been a major contributing factor in the high prevalence of autosomal recessive disorders. In Pakistan more than 60% of marriages are consanguineous and among them about 80% are between first cousins. Such consanguineous families are ideal for homozygosity based genetic mapping studies aimed at the identification of the underlying genetic defect.\n\n    As a result of several technological advances, 201 genes implicated in different forms of RD have been identified to date. Among these genes, 132 are linked to non-syndromic forms of the disease with some genetic overlap between different classes. In the developed countries, genetic testing using medium-to-high throughput genotyping methods are now being routinely used for proper disease diagnosis. This has resulted in the establishment of many genotype-phenotype correlations. In the last two decades, several studies have described the genetic causes of different retinal dystrophies in consanguineous Pakistani families. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive ophthalmogenetic overview of all forms of RD that have been identified in Pakistan. Therefore, this literature review provides an overview of all published genetic data of syndromic and non-syndromic RD that have been described for Pakistani families.",
        "Methods": "    A comprehensive literature review was performed for mutations and loci, which have been described previously for Pakistani individuals with syndromic and non-syndromic retinal diseases. The Retinal Network (RetNet), National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), and published literature were used to search for the causative genes. In order to predict the pathogenicity of the reported missense mutations, in silico analysis including, polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen-2), and sorting tolerant from intolerant (SIFT) were performed. The frequency of these variants in the healthy population was checked via the exome variant server (EVS).",
        "Results": "    Thus far, fifty-six studies have reported on the genetic causes of non-syndromic RD including arCRD, arCSNB, arLCA, and arRP in Pakistani persons, most of which belong to consanguineous families. The genetic data of a total of 466 Pakistani RD patients from 103 families (Table 1 and Table 2), have been described in the current review. Among these retinal phenotypes, arRP was found to be the most frequently occurring RD (59%), followed by arLCA (19%), arCRD (10%), and arCSNB (9%) (Table 1 and Table 2; Figure 1). Autosomal recessive inheritance seems to predominate in the RD families (96%) and only two autosomal dominant RP (adRP) families have been described (Table 1 and Table 2). Of these, one adRP family carries a mutation in RHO (MIM# 180380), while in one family a frequent variant (c.2138G>A) in SEMA4A (MIM# 607292) has been described to cause adRP, however in silico prediction and exome variant server (EVS) frequency do not support the pathogenicity of the latter variant (Table 2). The compiled data demonstrate that out of the 132 genes known to be involved in non-syndromic RD, mutations in 36 different genes are causing disease in patients of Pakistani origin (Table 1; Figure 2), reflecting the genetic heterogeneity of the disease in this population. The most frequently mutated genes were AIPL1 (MIM# 604392), CRB1 (MIM# 604210), TULP1 (MIM# 602280), RPGRIP1 (MIM# 605446), RP1 (MIM# 180100), SEMA4A, LCA5 (MIM# 611408), and PDE6A (MIM# 180071) (Figure 2). Most of the reported mutations, and those identified in the current cohort, were novel to this population except for mutations in ABCA4 (MIM# 601691), CRB1, CERKL (MIM# 608381), RPE65 (MIM# 180069), RPGR (MIM# 312610), and SPATA7 (MIM# 609868), which were initially identified in persons of different ethnicity (Table 1). As expected, all the reported disease associated alleles are rare variants and in silico analysis predicted these variants to have a deleterious effect on protein function (Table S1).\n\n    Out of the 47 non-synonymous variants identified in Pakistani non-syndromic RD families (Table 1) three variants (SEMA4A, c.2138G>A; RP1, c.1118C>T; RPGRIP1, c.1639G>T), are reported as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with high frequencies in the EVS (Table 2). In addition, SIFT also predicts these changes to be tolerated while except for the RPGRIP1 variant, the other two are considered to be benign by PolyPhen-2 (Table 2). Therefore, these variants could be segregating with the disease in the family by chance and the causative mutation may reside in another gene.\n\n    In addition to the non-syndromic families, data of 52 syndromic RD families with a total of 139 affected individuals were collected from 22 studies. Usher syndrome represented about 36% of the families in this group, whereas BBS (33%), MKS (13%), JBTS (10%), and SLSN (8%), accounted for the other families (Table 3; Figure 3). The most commonly mutated gene associated with syndromic RD in the Pakistani population was cadherin 23 (CDH23; MIM# 605516), which has been reported to be mutated in persons with Usher type 1, followed by TMEM67 (MIM# 609884), the gene mutated in persons with autosomal recessive MKS (Table 3; Figure 4). As expected for the syndromic mutations, all the reported disease associated alleles are rare variants and in silico analysis predicted these variants to have a deleterious effect on protein function (Table S2).",
        "Conclusion": "    This review provides a comprehensive overview of genetic causes of non-syndromic and syndromic retinal diseases in Pakistan, the results of which can be used to design a cost-effective screening platform for future genetic testing in Pakistan. For genetically unsolved non-syndromic RD cases, we propose a sequencing-based pre-screening genetic test in which 10 different amplicons capture the most frequent mutations described for Pakistani RD patients. In consanguineous families, homozygosity directed sequence analysis has demonstrated its potential to unravel genetic defect underlying recessive diseases.",
        "Discussion": "    The Pakistani population is known for its high rate of consanguinity (>60%), but it is still remarkable that 97% of the families with inherited RDs had an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is, therefore, not surprising that Pakistani families have been instrumental in pinpointing a number of the underlying gene defects through homozygosity mapping. Genetic studies of Pakistani families with RD have previously facilitated the identification of eleven novel RD genes, i.e., AIPL1, BEST1, CC2D2A (MIM# 612013), CDH23 (MIM# 605516), IMPG2 (MIM# 607056), LCA5 (MIM# 611408), NMNAT1 (MIM:608700), ZNF513 (MIM# 613598), PCDH15 (MIM# 605514), SEMA4A, and SLC24A1 (MIM# 603617). In addition, mutations in CLRN1 (MIM# 606397) and TTC8 (MIM# 608132), which had been previously implicated in the syndromic retinal phenotypes USH3 (MIM# 276902), and BBS (MIM# 209900), respectively, were found to cause non-syndromic arRP. Mutations in RP1, which had previously been shown to be involved in adRP, were found to segregate in a recessive manner in 3 Pakistani families. In addition to the novel genes identified in the affected Pakistani families, five novel RD loci including three non-syndromic, i.e., CORD8 (MIM# 605549),, RP29 (MIM# 612165),, and RP32, and two syndromic, i.e., USH1H (MIM# 612632),, and USH1K, have also been identified in Pakistani families.\n\n    In the 103 non-syndromic Pakistani RD families described so far, mutations were most frequently found in AIPL1, CRB1, TULP1, RPGRIP1, RP1, SEMA4A, LCA5, and PDE6A (Table 1; Figure 2). A direct comparison with other RD populations is difficult as comprehensive studies of this kind are rare. In a recent study of Abu-Safieh et al. (2012) comprising 150 Saudi Arabian RD families, similar results were observed as RP1, TULP1, RPGRIP1, and CRB1 were found to be the most frequently mutated genes.\n\n    A worldwide general literature study revealed arRP-associated mutations distributed in USH2A (12%; MIM# 276901), ABCA4 (8%), PDE6B (7%; MIM# 180072), CNGB1 (6%), and PDE6A (5%; MIM# 180071). In a more recent study of 230 Dutch persons with isolated or arRP, the most frequently mutated genes were EYS (11%; MIM# 602772), and CRB1 (11%) followed by USH2A (10%), ABCA4 (9%), and PDE6B (7%). As opposed to these studies the absence of USH2A variants in individuals of Pakistani origin is probably due to the fact that the most frequent arRP-associated variant, c.2299del;p.(E767fs), is almost invariably found in compound heterozygous states with second mutations that are considered to be mild, precluding their detection in a homozygosity mapping approach. Other differences can only be attributed to divergent genetic backgrounds of these populations.\n\n    Although 113/118 variants listed in Table 1 and Table 3 have only been identified in Pakistani patients, seven variants (SEMA4A, p.(Asp345His) and p.(Phe350Cys); TULP1, p.(Thr380Ala); LCA5, p.(Pro384Glnfs*17); RPGRIP1, p.(Arg827Leu); TMEM67, c.1575+1G>A and p.(Gln37Pro)), are more frequent than others, and therefore they seem to be population-specific. The six most frequent variants, p.(Trp278*) in AIPL1, p.(Lys489Arg) and p.(Thr380Ala) in TULP1, p.(Asp345His) and p.(Phe350Cys) in SEMA4A, p.(Pro384Glnfs*17) in LCA5 (Table 1), explain about 25% of the non-syndromic Pakistani RD families. The p.Trp278* variant has been identified as the most frequent AIPL1 variant worldwide in many LCA studies, suggesting that this variant is relatively old. The six frequent variants mentioned above, together with five other variants in RDH12 (MIM# 608830), p.(Arg169Gln); RHO, p.(Glu150Lys); RP1, p.(Glu488*), RPGRIP1, p.(Arg827Leu), and SPATA7, p.(Arg85*), account for approximately 34% (35/103) of all non-syndromic RD families from Pakistan. A cost-effective initial genetic screening of Pakistani persons with RD therefore could be to analyze these variants using Sanger sequencing. For example, 10 amplicons covers the most frequent variants mentioned above. Alternatively, a larger subset of variants can be captured by arrayed primer extension (APEX) analysis or other allele-specific genotyping methods.\n\n    Three of the 47 missense mutations (RP1: c.1118C>T, RPGRIP1: c.1639G>T, SEMA4A: c.2138G>A) reported to be associated with RD in Pakistani families are found at higher frequencies in EVS. In silico analysis also predict them likely to be non-pathogenic, therefore they should be considered as non-causative (Table 2). As these variants on their own are not sufficient to explain the phenotype in these six families (two, three and one with RP1, RPGRIP1 and SEMA4A mutations, respectively) they must still be considered genetically unresolved.\n\n    Of all the non-syndromic and syndromic arRD families (n = 146), which are genetically resolved, compound heterozygous mutations were identified in only four non-syndromic RD families (4/146 = 2.7%). These compound heterozygous mutations were identified in SEMA4A. This finding on one hand favors the utility of homozygosity based gene identification strategies for Pakistani RD families. While on the other hand it also indicates that in a small but significant proportion of the families (~2/100), compound heterozygous mutations might be able to explain the phenotype. These mutations will certainly be overlooked if one only considers homozygosity mapping based approaches to pinpoint causative genetic defects.",

        "Title": "    Exposing the Causal Effect of C-Reactive Protein on the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Mendelian Randomization Study",
        "Abstract": "    As a biomarker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) has attracted much attention due to its role in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Prospective studies have observed a positive correlation between the level of serum CRP and the incidence of T2DM. Recently, studies have reported that drugs for curing T2DM can also decrease the level of serum CRP. However, it is not yet clear whether high CRP levels cause T2DM. To evaluate this, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genetic variations as instrumental variables (IVs). Significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CRP were obtained from a genome-wide study and a replication study. Therein, 17,967 participants were utilized for the genome-wide association study (GWAS), and another 14,747 participants were utilized for the replication of identifying SNPs associated with CRP levels. The associations between SNPs and T2DM were from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) consortium. After removing SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and T2DM-related SNPs, the four remaining CRP-related SNPs were deemed as IVs. To evaluate the pooled influence of these IVs on the risk of developing T2DM through CRP, the penalized robust inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was carried out. The combined result (OR 1.114048; 95% CI 1.058656 to 1.172338; P = 0.024) showed that high levels of CRP significantly increase the risk of T2DM. In the subsequent analysis of the relationship between CRP and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the pooled result (OR 1.017145; 95% CI 0.9066489 to 1.14225; P = 0.909) supported that CRP levels cannot determine the risk of developing T1DM.",
        "Introduction": "    According to the 8th edition of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, the number of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients has continued to increase across the globe. DM includes a group of chronic metabolic diseases involving hyperglycemia, which, over prolonged periods, leads to injury in various tissues of the body. The corresponding abundant fatal complications occur for patients suffering from DM for over 10 years. The IDF Diabetes Atlas reported that 425 million DM patients are adults, two-thirds (327 million) of whom are of working age. Over 90% of these patients are type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. Thus, it is urgent for us to explore a way to reduce the number of individuals with T2DM.\n\n    Accumulated evidence shows that intermediate phenotypes, such as body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, circulating uric acid, etc., are responsible for the onset of this type of DM. To prevent T2DM, it would be valuable to influence these intermediate phenotypes. Although there have been recent successes, a large number of potential intermediate phenotypes causing T2DM need to be identified.\n\n    Since chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with T2DM, one of its markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), is frequently investigated as an intermediate phenotype that increases the risk of T2DM. conducted an observational study for a mean of 9.0 years on 1,759 Japanese patients without diabetes. They observed that elevated CRP concentration is a significant predictor of diabetes, independent of obesity and insulin resistance. Analogous conclusions were also observed in American and European individuals. On the other hand, after adjusting for sex, adiposity, and insulin resistance, no association between CRP and the risk of T2DM was shown in other studies.\n\n    A recent prospective analysis and meta-analysis study aimed to elucidate the role of CRP in T2DM. The high association (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.03-2.15, p = 0.03) between serum CRP and the risk of diabetes was observed in a Norfolk cohort including 293 diabetes cases and 708 controls. A consistent result (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.54-1.92) was shown in the further meta-analysis of 16 published studies involving 3,920 diabetes cases and 24,914 controls. However, no significant association (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.66-1.51, p = 1.0) was obtained after adjustment for Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR), serum gamma-glutamyltransferase and adiponectin. In addition, the heterogeneity of these publications (I2 = 52.8%) limited the conclusion in the meta-analysis.\n\n    The main challenge for current prospective studies is that the potential confounding factors have a great effect on the observations. This lack of clarity has hindered researchers in determining the association between CRP and T2DM. In addition, without evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is hard to be sure of the role of CRP in the risk of T2DM. To this end, the Mendelian randomization (MR) method, revealing the role of a risk factor in disease etiology, is utilized here. MR is an instrumental variable (IV)-based method to infer the causality between intermediate phenotypes and disease. Genetic variants that are associated with intermediate phenotypes are introduced as IVs in MR to estimate the effect of phenotypic exposures on disease outcome (Figure 1). Due to random distribution of gene variants during gametogenesis, the confounding effect can be extremely low.",
        "Methods": "    Here, we introduced MR analysis for analyzing the causal effect of CRP on the risk of T2DM, where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are deemed as IVs. The Mendelian randomization method is a method for testing whether a changeable exposure has a causal effect on the development of a disease. In this study, we applied a two-sample MR method. Through the explanation of the larger proportion of the exposure variance by general instrumental variables (IVs), this method can lead to more accurate causal effect estimation. The basic principle of MR analysis for this purpose is shown in Figure 1. According to MR analysis, SNPs influence T2DM outcome through intermediate phenotypes of CRP. Therefore, the SNPs should be significantly associated with CRP but not with T2DM. At the same time, in the population of genes associated with the phenotype, there may be a linkage disequilibrium (LD) effect. Due to the non-random linkage of alleles among different loci in a given population, loci are thought to be in LD when the frequency of association of their different alleles is higher or lower than what would be expected if the loci were independent and associated randomly. Thus, a notable issue is that the assessment would be biased for those SNPs in LD, since their effects would be expanded when combining all of those SNPs.\n\n    Figure 2 shows the basic idea of dissecting the causal effect of CRP on the risk of T2DM. First, SNP-CRP, and SNP-T2DM association information were extracted from two types of samples, including major and minor alleles for each SNP, minor allele frequency (MAF), standard error (SE), and beta coefficients for each effect allele, both in the T2DM and CRP GWAS databases. Then, suitable SNPs were selected as IVs based on the following principles: (1) SNPs should be significantly associated with CRP but not with T2DM; (2) SNPs with LD should be removed. Finally, a pooled analysis for those IVs based on MR analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of CRP on T2DM. To assess the effect of a single SNP on the result, a sensitivity analysis was carried out using the leave-one-out method. Pleiotropy in a MR study occurs when the effect of a SNP of IVs on T2DM (the outcome) could be independent of CRP (the intermediate phenotype). Here MR-Egger regression was used to explore the possibility of pleiotropy.\n\n    Significantly associated SNPs of CRP were sourced from. They carried out a genome-wide study and a replication study to identify loci associated with plasma CRP concentrations. Their data collection took place from 1989 to 2008, and genotyping occurred from 2003 to 2008. In total, 17,967 participants from five studies were collected for the genome-wide association study (GWAS), and another 14,747 participants who were not included in the GWAS were collected for the replication study of SNPs associated with CRP. The participants were from West London in the United Kingdom, the Northern Finnish Birth Cohort, the northernmost provinces of Finland, the Lausanne Cohort, and France. All of these participants were 30-75 years of age. Genetic loci associated with CRP were identified from GWAS. The single most closely associated SNP of CRP for each genetic locus was further replicated.\n\n    Associations between SNPs and T2DM were obtained from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) consortium, which is a grouping of researchers with shared interest in performing large-scale studies to characterize the genetic basis of T2DM in individuals of European descent. The initial instance of DIAGRAM (DIAGRAM v1) combined data from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative, the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics, and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. An incremental meta-analysis (DIAGRAM v2) added another five GWAS studies of European-descent samples. The recent meta-analysis (DIAGRAM v3) collected 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls.\n\n    We extracted the significantly associated SNPs (P-value < 5 x 10-8) of CRP from. Then, we extracted the association between these SNPs and T2DM to remove T2DM-associated SNPs (P-value < 5 x 10-2). The remaining SNPs were further assessed using the web tool SNAP1 to remove SNPs in LD. The remaining SNPs were selected as IVs for further analysis.\n\n    Figure 2 shows the process of pooled analysis based on the selected SNPs (IVs), which includes MR analysis, sensitivity analysis, and pleiotropy analysis.\n\n    We first calculated the influence of individual SNPs on T2DM through CRP as individual-level data and then calculated the pooled influence of these individual-level data using the penalized robust inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. Assuming X, Y, and Z are CRP, T2DM, and selected SNPs (IVs), respectively, the Wald ratio (betaXY) of CRP to T2DM for a specified SNP is defined as the following.\n\n    where betaZY represents the per-allele log(OR) of T2DM based on study. betaZX is the per-allele log(OR) of CRP based on study. In addition, the SE of the BMI-T2DM association of each Wald ratio is defined as the following.\n\n    where SEZY and SEZX represent the SE of the variant-T2DM and variant-CRP associations from corresponding studies, respectively. Based on Equations 1 and 2, the individual-level data of the influence of each SNP (IV) on T2DM through CRP was obtained. These data were then analyzed using the penalized robust IVW method. The IVW estimate is the same as the two-stage least squares estimate using individual-level data. The penalization of weights from candidate instruments produces heterogeneity in causal estimates, which generates the penalized IVW method, robust IVW method, and penalized robust IVW methods; these methods have been demonstrated to improve the robustness of the findings.\n\n    We conducted a leave-one-out validation to test the sensitivity of the selected SNPs (IVs). First, a SNP among the IVs was removed from the IVs to carry out a penalized robust IVW estimate. Then, the fluctuation of the results before and after removing the SNP was observed as the sensitivity. This process was repeated for each of the IVs.\n\n    MR-Egger regression, an adaption of Egger regression, was utilized here to detect the directional pleiotropy of IVs. This regression permits variants to show their pleiotropy and assumes that each variant is valid. Only when every variant used for IVs is independent of the alternative path affecting the disease (i.e., horizontal pleiotropy) can yield a consistent estimate via MR-Egger regression. The pleiotropy bias of MR analysis is regarded as analogous to small-study bias. Additionally, the average pleiotropic effect across the genetic variants was captured by the estimated value of the intercept in Egger regression. Thus, an intercept that differs from zero is indicative of overall directional pleiotropy.\n\n    All the statistical tests for the pooled analysis were undertaken using the R Packages of meta-analysis2 and Mendelian Randomization3.",
        "Results": "    Five SNPs of five genetic loci were significantly associated with CRP (P-value < 5 x 10-8) based on the previous genome-wide study and the replication study. One of them (rs4420638) was associated with T2DM and so was removed. Since the remaining four SNPs were assessed without LD, these SNPs were eventually selected for the pooled analysis in Table 1. Each line of the table documents 13 items involving the SNP, EA and its frequencies, the beta coefficients of the SNP on the risk of BMI and T2DM, and SEs.\n\n    Figure 3 shows the effect of each SNP and the combined effect of all four SNPs on T2DM through CRP using the penalized robust IVW method. The pooled result (OR 1.114048; 95% CI 1.058656 to 1.172338; P = 0.024) showed that high CRP significantly increases the risk of T2DM.\n\n    Figure 4 shows the sensitivity analysis result of SNPs based on leave-one-out validation. The ORs undergo substantial change after removing rs4537545 or rs7553007. In comparison, the ORs undergo a smaller change after removing rs6700896 or rs1183910. These results demonstrated that rs4537545 or rs7553007 drive the penalized robust IVW estimate.\n\n    The further estimate of the horizontal pleiotropic effect of these SNPs (IVs) was conducted via MR-Egger analysis. As a result, we got an intercept of 0.017 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.033, P = 0.039). This means a potential horizontal pleiotropic effect could bias our estimates.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we conducted a MR analysis to explore the causal effect of CRP on the risk of T2DM. To reduce the confounding effects, genetic variants were selected as IVs for MR analysis. Five SNPs associated significantly with CRP were extracted from study. One of them (rs4420638) was associated with T2DM and was removed. As a result, the remaining four SNPs without LD were deemed as IVs. The combined effect of the four SNPs on T2DM through CRP (OR 1.114048; 95% CI 1.058656 to 1.172338; P = 0.024) was determined using the penalized robust IVW method. This showed that high CRP significantly increases the risk of T2DM.\n\n    utilized MR analysis for an analogous purpose. They reached the conclusion that associations between CRP and diabetes are likely to be noncausal. In that study, three SNPs were utilized as IVs for MR analysis. The associations between SNPs and CRP were measured on 5,274 men and women, and the associations between SNPs and diabetes were observed among 1,923 patients and 2,932 controls. In comparison, our study included more samples (17,967 and 69,033 participants for measuring SNPs-CRP and SNPs-diabetes associations, respectively). In addition, the diabetes cases in study include type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), T2DM, and others. In contrast, our study focused on T2DM patients. Overall, our study is more specific, and the corresponding conclusion should be more reliable.\n\n    To further validate that the different conclusion of may be caused by their use of multiple types of diabetes samples, we conducted a MR analysis to evaluate the causal effect of CRP on the risk of T1DM. Associations between SNPs and T1DM were sourced from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies with 5,913 T1DM cases and 8,828 reference samples of European ancestry, which identified three SNPs (rs6700896, rs7553007, rs1183910) of the five CRP-associated SNPs identified in our study. The associations between these three SNPs and T1DM were then extracted in Table 2 as IVs. The pooled result (OR 1.017145; 95% CI 0.9066489 to 1.14225; P = 0.909) did not support a causal role of CRP in the onset of T1DM using the penalized robust IVW method. Therefore, the T1DM samples in study may be responsible for confusing the causality of CRP in T2DM.\n\n    The advantage of MR analysis is that no confounding factor should be considered when using genetic variants as IVs, since the genetic variants are free and unaffected by confounding factors. In comparison, confounding factors can heavily affect the results of observational studies. Therefore, most of these observational studies should be adjusted for potential confounding factors. However, abundant phenotypes of T2DM make it hard to do so. This issue occurs in prospective study about whether adiponectin is a confounder. In their study, observed that CRP was associated with T2DM after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), etc. However, the association was completely attenuated after further adjustment for serum adiponectin. The recent evidence suggests that CRP inhibits adiponectin gene expression in adipocytes. If so, adjustment for adiponectin would be over-adjustment.\n\n    Current studies on the treatment of T2DM have also reflected the potential causal effect of CRP on the risk of T2DM. During the treatment of T2DM patients with Metformin and Silymarin, researchers observed a significant decrease of CRP levels. They even used these decreased serum levels of CRP as a sensitive predictor in T2DM patients being treated with drugs. To explore effective curative options for T2DM, some researchers mainly refer to the effect of treatment on the serum CRP levels of T2DM patients. observed that training modes can help to decrease the serum CRP level of T2DM patients. Rutten et al. conducted intensive care and routine care on 235 and 189 T2DM patients, respectively. A significant decrease of CRP levels based on intensified multifactorial treatment was observed in T2DM patients after six years.\n\n    The incidence of T2DM can be associated with multiple phenotypic factors. The potential linkages among these factors can help us to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of T2DM. The role of CRP on the risk of T2DM necessitates a measurable effect for us to mine these linkages. To the best of our knowledge, CRP is an annular, pentameric protein in blood plasma, the levels of which rise in response to inflammation. Thus, long-term inflammation can also increase the risk of T2DM through CRP. In the previous MR analysis, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) are two immediate phenotypes of T2DM. Stronger associations between these two phenotypes and CRP were observed in a recent study. This means that either CRP affects T2DM through BMI and WC, or BMI and WC affect T2DM through CRP.\n\n    Although our samples were restricted to those of European ancestry and IVs with LD were removed to reduce bias, our analysis also has limitations worth consideration. First, IV-CRP and IV-T2DM associations were sourced from two different samples. In theory, a single sample source may be more reliable than multiple sample sources. Fortunately, the increase of the number of samples reduces this type of bias. Next, horizontal pleiotropy of IVs may influence the conclusion of MR method. Here we evaluated the relevance between genes that IVs were located in (Table 1) with T2DM using an enrichment tool BLAT2DOLite. No associations were detected, which means that these IVs cannot impact T2DM directly. Nevertheless, they could take effect in other immediate phenotypes of T2DM, such as BMI, WC, etc. The lack of associations between IVs and other phenotypes limits our further validation. Finally, without a specified indication, these results are ill-suited for clinical application.\n\n    In summary, we validated that the increase of CRP levels enhances the risk of T2DM and has no effect on T1DM using MR analysis. Here, genetic variations are deemed as IVs to reduce the potential confounding effect. The further validation relies on RCTs. The result has a very positive guiding role in finding new therapeutic strategies and therapeutic targets. This is related to the early prevention of T2DM, which has the potential to indirectly, from the intervention phenotype, regulate the development of disease. In the future, we will construct a dataset including the relationships between genetic variations and the phenotypes of DM. The data set may be beneficial in designing computational tools for phenotype interaction and function association prediction.",

        "Title": "    Impaired 8-Hydroxyguanine Repair Activity of MUTYH Variant p.Arg109Trp Found in a Japanese Patient with Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Purpose. The biallelic inactivation of the 8-hydroxyguanine repair gene MUTYH leads to MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), which is characterized by colorectal multiple polyps and carcinoma(s). However, only limited information regarding MAP in the Japanese population is presently available. Since early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) is a characteristic of MAP and might be caused by the inactivation of another 8-hydroxyguanine repair gene, OGG1, we investigated whether germline MUTYH and OGG1 mutations are involved in early-onset CRC in Japanese patients. Methods. Thirty-four Japanese patients with early-onset CRC were examined for germline MUTYH and OGG1 mutations using sequencing. Results. Biallelic pathogenic mutations were not found in any of the patients; however, a heterozygous p.Arg19*  MUTYH variant and a heterozygous p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variant were detected in one patient each. The p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp corresponded to p.Arg5* and p.Arg81Trp, respectively, in the type 2 nuclear-form protein. The defective DNA repair activity of p.Arg5* is apparent, while that of p.Arg81Trp has been demonstrated using DNA cleavage and supF forward mutation assays. Conclusion. These results suggest that biallelic MUTYH or OGG1 pathogenic mutations are rare in Japanese patients with early-onset CRC; however, the p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variants are associated with functional impairments.",
        "Introduction": "    8-Hydroxyguanine (8OHG) is an oxidized form of guanine, and the formation of 8OHG in DNA causes a G:C to T:A mutation, since 8OHG can pair with adenine as well as cytosine. To prevent such mutations in human cells, MUTYH (MIM #604933) and OGG1 (MIM #601982) proteins are involved in DNA glycosylase-initiating base excision repair, which is a component of the human DNA repair system. MUTYH catalyzes the removal of adenine mispaired with 8OHG in double-stranded DNA, and OGG1 catalyzes the removal of 8OHG at the 8OHG:C site. Regarding MUTYH, multiple forms, including two major forms (type 1 mitochondrial form and type 2 nuclear form), are expressed in human cells.\n\n    Clinically, biallelic germline inactivating MUTYH mutations are known to predispose an individual to MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP: MIM #608456), a hereditary disorder characterized by multiple colorectal polyps and carcinoma(s). Various pathogenic MUTYH mutations, including two major mutations (p.Tyr179Cys and p.Gly396Asp), have been detected in MAP patients in several ethnic populations; however, neither the p.Tyr179Cys nor the p.Gly396Asp mutation has been found in the Japanese population, and which MUTYH variations are the major pathogenic mutations in the Japanese population remains unclear. In accordance with the notion that early-onset cancer is likely to be associated with the germline abnormality of certain gene(s), early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the characteristics of MAP, and early-onset CRC is thought to occur in patients with biallelic-inactivating mutations of another 8OHG repair gene, OGG1. Therefore, we hypothesized that biallelic inactivating mutations of MUTYH or OGG1 might lead to early-onset CRC in Japanese patients. To test this hypothesis, we examined 34 Japanese patients with early-onset CRC for germline MUTYH and OGG1 mutations. Then, we investigated whether the detected variants were associated with defective 8OHG repair activity.",
        "Methods": "    Blood specimens from 685 CRC cases and 778 controls were collected in a previous study. Written informed consent was obtained from each individual patient. The characteristics of the cases and the controls have been described previously. Briefly, the cases were composed of a consecutive series of patients with histologically confirmed incident colorectal adenocarcinomas, and the controls were composed of individuals that had no diagnosis of CRC. Additionally, the cases had no prior history of removal of the colorectum, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP: MIM #175100), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). All the cases and the controls had been previously genotyped for c.36+11C>T, c.504+35A>G, c.934-2A>G, and c.1014G>C MUTYH polymorphisms, but none had been sequenced for the whole coding exons of the MUTYH and OGG1 genes. A human cancer cell line, H1299, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The H1299 cells and their derivatives were maintained at 37 C in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Equitech-Bio, Kerrville, TX) and penicillin/streptomycin under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The study design was approved by the institutional review boards.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously. All the coding exons of the MUTYH and OGG1 genes and their boundary regions were amplified using PCR with HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCR primer sequences of MUTYH and OGG1 are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/617351, respectively. The PCR-amplified products were directly sequenced with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) and an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    Genotyping of the c.55C>T and c.325C>T variants was performed using a PCR-CTPP analysis, as described previously. The PCR primer sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table S3. The PCR products were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 2.0% agarose gel and were stained with ethidium bromide.\n\n    Plasmid vectors for the expression of human wild-type (WT) MUTYH type 2 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and human cells were previously constructed by inserting the cDNA into a pET25b(+) vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and a piggyBac cumate switch inducible vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA), respectively. Expression vectors for the MUTYH variants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis with a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).\n\n    E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP competent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the MUTYH-pET25b vector and cultured at 37 C until an A600 of 0.6. After incubation with 0.1 mM IPTG at 15 C for 12 h, MUTYH-His6 protein was purified with TALON metal affinity resins (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and a TALON 2 mL disposable gravity column (Clontech). The protein was then dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 mug/mL pepstatin, 2 mug/mL leupeptin, 50 muM chymostatin, and 10% glycerol. The quality and concentration of MUTYH proteins were determined by resolving the proteins with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and staining them with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB); Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was then used for quantification.\n\n    A Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-MUTYH monoclonal antibody (4D10; Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan) or an anti-beta-tubulin monoclonal antibody (clone 2-28-33; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was performed as described previously.\n\n    First, 30-mer oligonucleotides containing or not containing a single 8OHG (5'-CTG GTG GCC TGA C[8OHG or T]C ATT CCC CAA CTA GTG-3') were chemically synthesized and purified using PAGE (Japan Bio Services, Saitama, Japan). Complementary oligonucleotides containing an adenine opposite the 8OHG or T were 32P-labeled at the 5' terminus with a MEGALABEL kit (Takara, Osaka, Japan) and [gamma-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer, Tokyo, Japan), and these oligonucleotides were then annealed to oligonucleotides containing a single 8OHG or T. A reaction mixture containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 muM ZnCl2, 1.5% glycerol, 2.5 nM labeled oligonucleotide, 50 mug/mL BSA, and 90 fmoles of MUTYH protein was then incubated at 37 C for 15 min, and the mixture was treated with 0.1 M NaOH. After the mixture was denatured, it was subjected to 20% PAGE. A 32P-labeled marker oligonucleotide was used as a size marker for the cleavage products. The radioactivities of the intact and cleaved oligonucleotides were quantified using an FLA-3000 fluoroimage analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) and ImageGauge software (Fuji Film).\n\n    H1299 cells were transfected with the piggyBac cumate switch inducible vector for MUTYH expression together with the piggyBac transposase vector (System Biosciences). To establish stable inducible cell lines, positively transposed cells were selected using puromycin (1 mug/mL). Since the inducible piggyBac vector features a tight cumate switch combined with an EF1-CymR repressor-T2A-Puro cassette to establish stable cell lines, the addition of cumate solution (System Biosciences) to the puromycin-selected cells leads to the induction of MUTYH expression.\n\n    Cells were fixed with 10% formalin at room temperature, permeabilized with 1% Nonidet P-40, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and probed with mouse anti-MUTYH monoclonal antibody (4D10; Abnova). Indirect immunofluorescence labeling was performed by exposure to an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich). The slides were promptly examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-51-FL; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with epifluorescence filters and a photometric CCD camera (Sensicam; PCO Company, Kelheim, Germany). The images captured were digitized and stored in the image analysis program (MetaMorph; Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA).\n\n    A single 8OHG:C mispair was introduced at nucleotide position 159 of the bacterial suppressor tRNA (supF) gene of the shuttle vector plasmid pMY189, as described previously. A supF forward mutation assay for H1299-derived cells was performed using the 8OHG-containing pMY189 plasmid and the KS40/pKY241 indicator E. coli strain, as described previously. The mutation frequencies were calculated as the number of E. coli supF mutants per total number of E. coli transformants. The mutations in the supF gene were then analyzed as described previously.\n\n    The functional effects of nonsynonymous variants were predicted by the online software tools PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and PROVEAN. The allele frequencies of variants in a large number of Japanese individuals were examined using a reference database of genetic variations in the Japanese population (http://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SnpDB/).\n\n    The statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired t-test, Dunnett test, or Fisher exact test. JMP version 9 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all the statistical analyses. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    To investigate whether germline mutations of the DNA glycosylase genes MUTYH and OGG1 are involved in early-onset CRC in Japanese patients, we attempted to utilize a population of 685 Japanese CRC patients. Among them, we selected 34 CRC patients with the lowest ages of onset (corresponding to 5% of the total patient population) (Table 1). All 34 CRC patients were less than 43 years old and had no history of FAP or IBD. We then examined the 34 CRC patients for germline MUTYH and OGG1 mutations by sequencing every coding exon of both genes. As a result, 9 MUTYH variants and 7 OGG1 variants were found (Table 2, Figure 1(a)), and the genotype and allele frequencies of the nucleotide variations are summarized in Table 2 and the characteristics of the variations are summarized in Table 3. Genotypes of the variations in the coding region and splice-site region in 34 patients are also summarized in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. Among the 9 MUTYH variants, although c.36+11C>T, c.504+35A>G, c.934-2A>G, c.1014G>C (p.Gln338His), c.1118C>T (p.Ala373Val), c.1431G>C (p.Thr477Thr), and c.1477-40C>G are not considered to be MAP pathogenic alleles, the remaining two variants of c.55C >T (p.Arg19*) and c.325C>T (p.Arg109Trp) were identical to variants previously found in one patient each with colorectal multiple adenomas and a carcinoma. In our study, the p.Arg19* variant was detected in one patient as a heterozygous status for the wild-type and variant alleles, and the p.Arg109Trp variant was also detected heterozygously in one patient. Moreover, the p.Arg19* variant encodes a truncating protein, and the p.Arg109Trp variant encodes a protein with the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid, p.Arg109 (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) (Figure 1(b)); the missense protein was predicted to be functionally damaged by the PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and PROVEAN software programs (Table 3). Therefore, we considered the two variants to be candidate MAP pathogenic alleles. Regarding the 7 OGG1 variants, c.949-89G>T and c.966C>T (p.Asp322Asp) were novel (Supplementary Figure S1); however, since the former exists in an intron and the latter is a synonymous variation, these variants were not considered to be pathogenic mutations. Among the other 5 OGG1 variants, c.-18G>T and c.977C>G (p.Ser326Cys) have been reported as low-penetrance cancer susceptibility variants, while the remaining three were untranslated, synonymous, or intronic variations, meaning that all of them are not highly pathogenic mutations. Therefore, none of the patients were thought to have biallelic pathogenic MUTYH or OGG1 mutations in the presently studied early-onset CRC group. However, we decided to further investigate the p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variants as candidate pathogenic alleles.\n\n    To determine the frequency of the p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variants in Japanese individuals without CRC, we genotyped both nucleotide variations using PCR-CTPP in as many as 100 individuals randomly selected from the control group (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). Since the above-described cases with a p.Arg19* or p.Arg109Trp variant exhibited a heterozygous pattern of the WT and variant alleles, these cases were used as positive controls in the PCR-CTPP analysis. The results showed that none of the controls exhibited p.Arg19* or p.Arg109Trp variants, suggesting that p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp are rare variants in the Japanese population.\n\n    To conclude whether a MUTYH variant allele is pathogenic, an impairment in the repair activity of the protein based on the nucleotide variant must be evident. p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp correspond to p.Arg5* and p.Arg81Trp, respectively, in the type 2 nuclear-form protein, which is the major MUTYH form in human cells. Since p.Arg5* has a length of only 5 amino acids, compared with 521 amino acids in the full-length type 2 protein, the DNA repair activity of p.Arg5* is most likely defective. On the other hand, p.Arg81Trp yields a missense form, and the repair activity of the mutant protein has not yet been analyzed. Thus, we planned to evaluate the DNA glycosylase activity of the p.Arg81Trp protein by comparing the cleavage activity of the mutant with that of the WT protein in the presence of an A:8OHG mismatch-containing DNA substrate. We also planned to utilize the p.Asp208Asn mutant as a negative control in the comparison. First, the WT, p.Arg81Trp, and p.Asp208Asn recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and were purified to a high level of homogeneity (Figure 2(a)). Their molecular size of approximately 61 kDa was determined using SDS-PAGE/CBB staining and Western blot analysis, and this size corresponded to the size calculated from the cDNA sequence (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Then, the DNA glycosylase activity of the MUTYH proteins was examined by determining its capacity to cleave a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an adenine mispaired with 8OHG (Figure 2(c)). No clear cleavage products were detected when an oligonucleotide containing an unmodified A:T base pair was exposed to any of the MUTYH proteins, but cleavage products with the same mobility as the marker oligonucleotide were detected when WT MUTYH protein, but not a p.Asp208Asn negative control protein, was allowed to react with an oligonucleotide containing an A:8OHG base pair (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)). Importantly, a significantly smaller amount of cleavage products was detected in the reaction with p.Arg81Trp than in the reaction with WT (% incision: 1.8% versus 29.3%) (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)). These results indicate that the DNA glycosylase activity of p.Arg81Trp was severely decreased.\n\n    To investigate the ability of MUTYH p.Arg81Trp variant to suppress mutations caused by 8OHG in human cells, we planned to use the piggyBac transposon vector system to establish human cells capable of inducibly expressing MUTYH protein and to perform a supF forward mutation assay using the shuttle plasmid pMY189, which contains a single 8OHG in the supF gene. First, we established human H1299 cell lines capable of inducibly expressing WT, p.Arg81Trp, or p.Asp208Asn MUTYH using the piggyBac transposon vector system. The expression of MUTYH protein after cumate induction was examined using a Western blot analysis with an anti-MUTYH monoclonal antibody (Figure 3(a)). MUTYH protein was abundantly expressed in cells in which a WT, p.Arg81Trp, or p.Asp208Asn MUTYH expression vector, but not an empty vector, was transposed. An immunofluorescence analysis also showed abundant MUTYH protein expression in cells in which a WT, p.Arg81Trp, or p.Asp208Asn MUTYH expression vector, but not an empty vector, was transposed (Figure 3(b)). The p.Arg81Trp variant, as well as the WT MUTYH protein, was localized in the nucleus, suggesting that the amino acid changes in p.Arg81Trp were unlikely to alter the subcellular localization of the protein in human cells.\n\n    Next, the mutation frequencies were compared among the empty vector-transposed human cells and the cumate-inducible stable cells expressing WT or a variant MUTYH using a supF forward mutation assay with the shuttle plasmid pMY189. In this assay, we introduced a single 8OHG residue at position 159 of the supF gene in pMY189. The mutation frequency of supF was 3.2 x 10-2 in the 8OHG-containing pMY189 plasmid and 2.3 x 10-4 in the WT pMY189 in empty vector-transposed cells (Figure 3(c)), representing a 139-fold increase in the mutation frequency with the introduction of 8OHG. The mutation frequency of supF in the 8OHG-containing pMY189 plasmid in the WT MUTYH-transposed and p.Arg81Trp variant-transposed, but not p.Asp208Asn-transposed, cells was significantly lower than that in the empty vector-transposed cells (Figure 3(c)). Importantly, the supF mutation frequency in the p.Arg81Trp-transposed cells was significantly higher than that in the WT MUTYH-transposed cells (1.6 x 10-2 versus 3.3 x 10-3), meaning that the suppressive activity of the p.Arg109Trp variant against mutations caused by 8OHG in human cells was severely decreased when compared with that of WT MUTYH.\n\n    We further investigated what kind of mutation is contained in the supF mutant colony in the supF forward mutation assay. PCR and gel electrophoresis for the supF region of the mutants revealed that the percentage of mutant clones with the same mobility as a WT clone was significantly lower in the WT MUTYH-transposed cells (52%) than the empty vector-transposed cells and the p.Arg81Trp-transposed or p.Asp208Asn-transposed cells (>92%), meaning that the activity to decrease supF alterations of the base substitutions or small insertions/deletions caused by 8OHG is lower in the p.Arg81Trp variant than in WT MUTYH (Table 4). Further sequencing analysis of the mutants revealed that a G:C to T:A transversion at position 159 of supF among the 8OHG-containing pMY189 was predominant (>91%) in empty vector-transposed cells and p.Arg81Trp-transposed or p.Asp208Asn-transposed cells, while the proportion of the G:C to T:A transversion was significantly reduced in the WT MUTYH-transposed cells (46%) (Table 4, Figure 3(d), Supplementary Figure S2). These results suggest that the suppressive activity of the p.Arg81Trp variant against G:C to T:A mutations caused by 8OHG in human cells was severely reduced, compared with that of WT MUTYH.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, no biallelic pathogenic mutations were found in 34 Japanese patients with early-onset CRC, although a total of 9 MUTYH variants and 7 OGG1 variants were detected. Among them, the p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variants were identical to variants previously reported by Vogt et al. in non-Japanese patients with multiple colorectal adenomas and a carcinoma. According to Vogt's report, both the p.Arg19* and p.Ala385Profsx25 mutations were detected in one male patient with multiple (60-70) colorectal adenomas and a carcinoma, and both the p.Arg109Trp and p.Gly396Asp mutations were detected in another male patient with multiple (50-100) colorectal adenomas and a carcinoma. Since both patients had the clinical symptoms of MAP and p.Ala385Profsx25 and p.Gly396Asp are pathogenic mutations frequently found in non-Asian MAP patients, p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp were speculated to be pathogenic mutations. The p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp variants correspond to p.Arg5* and p.Arg81Trp, respectively, in the type 2 form. p.Arg5* is strongly suspected to have a defective DNA repair activity because of its extremely short structure, but the p.Arg81Trp missense variant has not been functionally characterized. Therefore, we investigated type 2 p.Arg81Trp MUTYH using a DNA cleavage assay and a supF forward mutation assay and found that the abilities of p.Arg81Trp to cleave A:8OHG-containing DNA and to suppress mutations caused by 8OHG were severely reduced. These results suggest that biallelic MUTYH or OGG1 pathogenic mutations are very rare or nonexistent in Japanese patients with early-onset CRC; however, they also suggest that the MUTYH alleles of p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp detected in our patient series are associated with functional impairment. This information would be of great help in diagnosing MAP worldwide, judging from the existence of alleles in both Japanese and other ethnicities.\n\n    p.Tyr179Cys and p.Gly396Asp are major pathogenic MUTYH mutations for MAP in many ethnicities other than Asian, and some ethnic-specific MUTYH mutations, for example, p.Glu480del (Southern Europe), p.Tyr104* (Pakistan), and p.Glu480* (India), have been reported. Regarding pathogenic MUTYH mutations in the Japanese population, p.Gly286Glu is the only MUTYH mutation for which the resulting protein was experimentally shown to be defective in DNA repair activity and to be found in the Japanese population. The p.Gly286Glu mutation was found as a homozygous mutation in a Japanese patient with colorectal multiple polyps and a carcinoma by Yanaru-Fujisawa et al., and in the paper, mouse MUTYH mutant protein corresponding to the human p.Gly286Glu was shown to have an impaired repair activity. However, this mutation has not been detected in other MUTYH mutation screenings performed in Japanese CRC patients, including the current study, and whether the p.Gly286Glu pathogenic mutation is common in the Japanese population remains unclear. The p.Arg19* detected in our analysis was previously found as a heterozygous mutation in one Japanese patient with CRC reported by Kuno et al., suggesting that it could be relatively common impaired MUTYH mutation in the Japanese population. On the other hand, the p.Arg109Trp also detected in our analysis is the first demonstration of such a variant in the Japanese population. Since neither the p.Arg19* nor the p.Arg109Trp variation was observed in our screening of 100 Japanese control individuals, these variants are considered to be relatively rare among the general Japanese population. In addition to the fact that the two major pathogenic MUTYH mutations of p.Tyr179Cys and p.Gly396Asp have not been seen in Japanese individuals in previous studies or the present study, the p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp variations as well as the p.Gly286Glu variation, rather than the p.Tyr179Cys and p.Gly396Asp variations, are thought to account for functionally impaired MUTYH alleles in the Japanese population. A combination of these MUTYH variations would cause an even higher susceptibility to MAP.\n\n    The type 2 MUTYH protein is a nuclear form of MUTYH, and somatic APC (MIM #611731) and KRAS (MIM #190070) mutations occur in the nuclear DNA of MAP tumors; therefore, we believed that it would be more appropriate to use type 2, rather than type 1, in a comparative study of MUTYH variants, and we analyzed the DNA repair function of the variant type 2 form in vitro and in vivo in this study. As a result, an impaired cleavage activity of type 2 p.Arg81Trp towards A:8OHG-containing DNA was clearly demonstrated using a DNA cleavage assay, and a severely reduced activity of the protein to suppress mutations caused by 8OHG in human cells was also clearly revealed using a supF forward mutation assay. A combination of the results of two distinct analyses, that is, in vitro and in vivo analyses, would provide more definitive proof of the pathogenicity of the p.Arg109Trp (type 2 p.Arg81Trp) MUTYH variant. The existence of a patient with multiple colorectal adenomas and a carcinoma, who carried both the p.Arg109Trp variant and the p.Gly396Asp pathogenic mutation, in the report by Vogt et al. also supports the pathogenicity of the p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variant. Because the diagnosis of MAP depends on whether (1) the clinical phenotypic characteristics of MAP are present in a candidate patient; and (2) the repair activities of the MUTYH variant proteins encoded by the two MUTYH alleles of the patient are severely reduced, when MUTYH gene variations are found in the patient by mutation screening, information on the levels of the repair activities of the MUTYH variant proteins is indispensable for the proper diagnosis of MAP. Thus, our evaluation of the repair activity of the p.Arg109Trp (type 2 p.Arg81Trp) MUTYH variant is clinically useful.\n\n    So far, no analyses of the crystal structure of the full-length human MUTYH polypeptide have been reported; therefore, it is difficult to explain fully why an amino acid substitution in p.Arg109Trp leads to a functional impairment. However, p.Arg109 in human MUTYH protein is conserved among Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Figure 1(b)). Furthermore, mutations resulting in an amino acid exchange from Arg to Trp in codon 185 or 241 have been previously revealed to be pathogenic mutations by functional analyses. In addition, the PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and PROVEAN programs predicted that an amino acid substitution in p.Arg109Trp would alter its protein function (Table 3). Moreover, the screening for nonacceptable polymorphisms (SNAP) program, which predicts the effect of single amino acid substitutions on protein function (http://www.rostlab.org/services/SNAP), also predicted that the MUTYH type 2 p.Arg81Trp variation was nonneutral. In conjunction with the fact that other various single missense MUTYH mutations also exist as pathogenic mutations, the notion that p.Arg109Trp is a functionally impaired allele is thought to be acceptable. In the future, a crystal structure analysis of the full-length MUTYH protein and its covalent complex with DNA, in conjunction with the present findings regarding the p.Arg109Trp variant, should contribute to establishing further correlations between the structure and repair function of the MUTYH protein.\n\n    The p.Arg19* MUTYH variant was detected heterozygously in a patient diagnosed with CRC at 43 years of age and a pathological stage of IIIa, while the p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variant was detected heterozygously in a patient diagnosed with CRC at 43 years of age and a pathological stage of I, as summarized in Table 1. The histological classification of CRCs of both patients was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Regarding their colorectal polyp status, both patients were recorded as non-FAP, and no other information was available. Therefore, we concluded that the two patients were unlikely to have exhibited any specific clinicopathological characteristics other than early-onset CRC.\n\n    In this paper, no biallelic pathogenic mutations in the MUTYH and OGG1 genes were found in 34 Japanese patients with early-onset CRC. Since the sample size was relatively small, we could not make a robust conclusion; however, this result suggests that biallelic MUTYH or OGG1 pathogenic mutations are very rare or possibly nonexistent in Japanese patients with early-onset CRC. A future study with a large number of Japanese patients with early-onset CRC is needed to obtain a robust conclusion regarding this issue.\n\n    In conclusion, our results suggested that biallelic MUTYH or OGG1 pathogenic mutations are rare among Japanese patients with early-onset CRC; however, they also suggested that the p.Arg19* and p.Arg109Trp MUTYH variants that were detected in our Japanese patient group are functionally impaired alleles. This information is likely to be very useful in the diagnosis of MAP worldwide. Additionally, since recent technological progress in genome sequencing analysis has contributed to efficient and rapid genome screening, an increase in the number of novel MUTYH variants can be expected in the future. Our analysis system for determining the repair abilities of MUTYH variants, as successfully performed in this study, might be useful for characterizing such newly detected variants.",

        "Title": "    Genetic analysis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease within a Caribbean-Hispanic population",
        "Abstract": "    We explored potential genetic risk factors implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) within a Caribbean-Hispanic population in New York City. A total of 316 individuals including 40 subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD, 24 ethnically matched non-NAFLD controls, and a 252 ethnically mixed random sampling of Bronx County, New York were analyzed. Genotype analysis was performed to determine allelic frequencies of 74 known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with NAFLD risk based on previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) and candidate gene studies. Additionally, the entire coding region of PNPLA3, a gene showing the strongest association to NAFLD was subjected to Sanger sequencing. Results suggest that both rare and common DNA variations in PNPLA3 and SAMM50 may be correlated with NAFLD in this small population study, while common DNA variations in CHUK and ERLIN1, may have a protective interaction. Common SNPs in ENPP1 and ABCC2 have suggestive association with fatty liver, but with less compelling significance. In conclusion, Hispanic patients of Caribbean ancestry may have different interactions with NAFLD genetic modifiers; therefore, further investigation with a larger sample size, into this Caribbean-Hispanic population is warranted.",
        "Introduction": "    Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in western countries, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in the United States (Lazo et al. 2011). It is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, or hepatic steatosis. The clinical significance of steatosis is correlated with its histological severity. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to a more severe disorder. The disease can range from simple steatosis to steatosis with inflammation (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis (Adams et al. 2005). A total of 2.9-20% of NAFLD patients will develop NASH dependent on the disease lead-time (Charlton et al. 2001; Lebovics and Rubin 2011). Once NASH develops, an estimated 17-49% of cases progress to cirrhosis and, once present, patients are at risk for liver decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (Bugianesi et al. 2002; Ratziu et al. 2002; Argo et al. 2009). Overall, a small percentage of individuals with NAFLD progress to end-stage cirrhosis or liver cancer. However, given the total number of cases of NAFLD, this still amounts to a large number of patients suffering from these significant morbidities.\n\n    Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is frequently associated with several coexisting conditions including obesity, visceral fat, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes (Angulo 2002). Diabetes is not only a risk factor for NAFLD independent of obesity (Gupte et al. 2004), its presence also seems to compound the risk of histopathologic progression of steatosis among obese patients (Silverman et al. 1990). This logically follows as NAFLD is closely associated with insulin resistance, although the direction of this association has not been established (Marchesini et al. 1999; Angulo 2002; Paschos and Paletas 2009; Fabbrini et al. 2010).\n\n    In addition to environmental risk factors, NAFLD may have genetic risk factors. Specifically, there appears to be differences in risk depending on ethnic background. Based on recent population-based studies in the United States, the prevalence of NAFLD was 30-32% overall, with rates of 39-45% among Hispanics, 30-33% among non-Hispanic Whites, and 23-24% among non-Hispanic Blacks (Browning et al. 2004; Smits et al. 2013). Multiple studies have indeed illustrated the lower disease burden and decreased histologic severity in the African-American population (Giday et al. 2006; Kallwitz et al. 2009; Mohanty et al. 2009). Interestingly, although individuals of Asian ancestry tend to have lower rates of obesity, they have high rates of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD (prevalence ranging from 15 to 45%) (Farrell et al. 2013; Wong and Ahmed 2014). Asians may even demonstrate a higher disease severity than whites (Mohanty et al. 2009). A number of studies have demonstrated that Hispanics in the United States have both a higher disease burden and an increased disease severity than their counterparts of African-American and European ancestry (Clark et al. 2003; Neuschwander-Tetri and Caldwell 2003; Weston et al. 2005; Kallwitz et al. 2009; Sharp et al. 2009; Wagenknecht et al. 2009; Pan et al. 2011; Schneider et al. 2013). These studies investigated primarily Mexican Americans, but not Hispanics from other locations (Browning et al. 2004; Mohanty et al. 2009). This presents a complication when attempting to apply genetic and clinical principles derived from research in different Hispanic subpopulations. In the Bronx, for instance, 53.5% of the county is of Hispanic ethnicity, but over 80% are of Caribbean (Dominican and Puerto Rican) ancestry (2008-2012 American Community Survey). One study recently acknowledged the shortcoming of these NAFLD-Hispanic investigations and analyzed rates of \"suspected\" NAFLD among different Hispanic populations. They discovered that rates of the condition differed between ancestries, with Hispanics of Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Dominican backgrounds with lower prevalence of NAFLD when compared with those of Mexican heritage (Kallwitz et al. 2015).\n\n    Here, we performed a new study to investigate the potential genetic risk implicated in NAFLD within a population composed of Hispanics of mostly Caribbean ancestry in Bronx County. We compared the allele frequencies of genetic variations in candidate genes found for NAFLD to those in our local population.",
        "Methods": "    Blood or saliva samples were obtained from 40 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, with their informed consent (IRB # 11-06-247E). The 12 males and 28 females are all of self-identified Hispanic descent and are over the age of 18. Control samples (n = 24) were obtained from patients visiting various primary care, dermatology, and gastroenterology clinics at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York. Subjects included 12 females and 12 males self-identified as Hispanic. Patients were excluded if they had any evidence of liver disease (abnormal abdominal imaging, AST/ALT levels, or clinical history), BMI >30, or other evidence of metabolic syndrome. If patients had isolated HTN, hypercholesterolemia, or controlled DM, they were included based on clinical judgment.\n\n    Blood samples were obtained from healthy parents of children seen at the Pediatric Genetics Clinic at Montefiore Medical Center for developmental delay, autism, or multiple congenital malformations (mostly sporadic). Their DNA was used as a proxy for a random sample of our Bronx population. Their ethnic makeup was selected to be reflective of that of Bronx County, NY:-43% Hispanic, 31% White, 15.9% Black, 5% Asian. Subjects were not screened for NAFLD or other exclusion criteria. Deidentified samples were also obtained with their informed consent (IRB #1999-201).\n\n    The Gentra Puregene Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN) was used to purify DNA in the Molecular Cytogenetics Core, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY, according to standard protocols. Specimens were derived from blood (purple top EDTA tubes) or saliva (collected in Oragene OR-250 kits). Quality of DNA was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by nanodrop analysis, Qubit, and/or PicoGreen.\n\n    Based on prior GWAS and candidate gene studies, we compiled a list of 87 target SNPs in 52 genes associated with the development NAFLD or disease severity. Seventy-four SNPs (Table 1) were included in the study design. The other SNPs were rejected if there was a nearby SNP within 20 bases of the target SNP or the nearby SNP blocked the design of an extension primer. We subsequently performed SNP-based genotyping with SNPs using Sequenom MassArray technology.\n\n    Additionally, we sequenced the PNPLA3 (OMIM # 609567) gene including SNP rs738409 (NM_025225.2:c.444C>G) in exon 3, which is the most consistently and significantly associated variation with the development of NAFLD (Anstee and Day 2013). To detect sequence variations, we amplified the nine coding exons of PNPLA3 using PCR followed by Sanger DNA sequencing. Primers were designed specifically for each exon, based on GenBank reference sequence (Table S1). PCR amplified products were purified using the AmpPure Purification System processed by Beckman Coulter BioMan and carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Purified PCR products were sequenced on the Applied Biosystems 3730 Sequencer (Genomics Core, Einstein, NY). All sequence data were compiled using Sequencher 4.0.1 software and compared to reference sequence NM_025225.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI).\n\n    Allele frequencies of the variations were estimated by the gene-counting method. Agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested by the chi-square test. Allele frequencies between each group were also compared using the chi-square test. PLINK software was used to evaluate all Sequenom results. All other analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel.",
        "Results": "    Sequenom genotyping and PNPLA3 sequencing were used to identify allele frequencies of the target SNPs within NAFLD cases, controls, and our sample Bronx population. Additional minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were determined through 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 report of the total population as well as subpopulation of Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico. Complete results are included in Table S2. Nine variations are listed in Table 2 based on significant P-values (<=0.05) across multiple avenues of comparison.\n\n    The SNPs in PNPLA3 and SAMM50 (OMIM # 612058) (rs738409, rs2896019; NM_025225.2:c.979+542T>G, rs3761472; NM_015380.4:c.329A>G) were previously identified in GWAS studies and generally had increased frequencies in the NAFLD population compared with our controls, the sample Bronx population, and expected population frequencies. Increased MAF of the alternative allele of SNPs rs738409 and rs2896019 in PNPLA3 was found in our Bronx population sample as compared to the MAF recorded for the Puerto Rican population. Similarly, the MAF of the alternative allele was increased significantly in disease-related SNPs, rs1044498 ((NM_006208.2:c.517A>C) and rs17222723 (NM_000392.4:c.3563T>A), in ENPP1 (OMIM # 173335) and ABCC2 (OMIM # 601107). The MAF of the alternative allele of rs17222723 and rs1044498 were statistically significant (P < 0.05) in both the NAFLD cases and Bronx population than the expected based on population data, but were not significant when comparing NAFLD cases versus Bronx population. The SNP rs1044498 (ENPP1) was most significant (P = 0.02) when comparing the Bronx population with the Puerto Rican population.\n\n    Common SNP variations in an intron of CHUK (OMIM # 600664) (rs11597086; (NM_001278.3:c.1974+36T>G)) and exon of ERLIN1 (OMIM # 611604) (rs2862954; (NM_001100626.1:c.871A>G)) occurred less frequently in both the NAFLD cases and the sample Bronx population than would be expected in a random Puerto Rican population. The intronic CHUK, SNP variant, rs11591741, also occurred less frequently in our Bronx population than would be expected in a random Puerto Rican population (31 vs. 43%, P = 0.03); however, it occurred more often than would be expected in the general population (31 vs. 23%, P = 0.004).\n\n    Sixteen common and six rare DNA variations were uncovered upon sequencing of PNPLA3 (Table 3). Two SNPs, rs738409 and rs6006460 (NM_025225.2:c.1358G>T), have known associations with NAFLD genes from previous GWAS studies and were also included in our Sequenom assay; three other SNPs are associated with hepatic steatosis as suggested in the literature (rs738408; NM_025225.2:c.447C>T (Speliotes 2011), rs4823173; NM_025225.2:c.487-28G>A (DiStefano et al. 2014), rs139051; NM_025225.2:c.421-28A>G (Peng et al. 2012)). The remaining 17 SNP variations have no known disease or phenotypic associations based on literature review or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). Six variants with a MAF of <=1% in the general, Hispanic, and Puerto Rican populations were discovered and included in Table 3. Of note, four of these variations occurred more often in our NAFLD cases than in controls (rs144730517; NM_025225.2:c.1184C>G, rs192841252; NM_025225.2:c.420+23C>T, rs41278871; NM_025225.2:c.*393G>C, rs144821153 NM_025225.2:c.-40C>G).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    NAFLD is a highly prevalent disease that is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide. With its connection to obesity and metabolic syndrome, NAFLD and its more severe form, NASH, are projected to continually increase as a public health burden. Although NAFLD occurs with increased incidence and severity in the Mexican Hispanic population, the principal aim of this study was to explore previously discovered NAFLD variants in our largely Caribbean-Hispanic population. The NAFLD patients seen at Montefiore Medical Center are of mostly Dominican or Puerto Rican ancestry, populations highly affected with fatty liver disease and to our knowledge never studied in this context. We performed liver biopsies as part of the clinical evaluation of these patients. Additionally, our analysis benefits from the inclusion of previously discovered and/or validated genes and variants related to fatty liver disease by providing more power. This may enhance any implications made in the context of our limited number of samples. Indeed, the greatest weakness in our study is the relatively small number of patients when examining a common disease. Therefore, the purpose of our discussion is to provide a framework for future analyses. All results of our experiments are suggestive, but not intended to be conclusive.\n\n    As discussed previously, NAFLD is a complex disease with a multifactorial etiology associated with diet, obesity, and a variety of comorbidities related to insulin resistance (Marchesini et al. 1999). Although environmental factors are important in determining risk for the disease, evidence from familial and twin studies support the assumption that genetics provide an important modulator of NAFLD development and disease progression (Brouwers et al. 2006; Makkonen et al. 2009; Schwimmer et al. 2009). The most studied and replicated variant is rs738409 (NM_025225.2:c.444C>G) in PNPLA3. This common missense variant has demonstrated increased risk for the development of NAFLD independent of diabetes or obesity and is also significantly associated with degree of histological severity (Rotman et al. 2010; Speliotes et al. 2010; Valenti et al. 2010a,b). The strongest effect of the variant appears to exist within the Hispanic population versus African-American or European-American individuals (Romeo et al. 2008). The overall strength of the association between this polymorphism and NAFLD has recently been confirmed in a genetic meta-analysis (Sookoian and Pirola 2011).\n\n    Although the missense SNP, rs738409, has been repeatedly evaluated and tested, to our knowledge the entire coding region of PNPLA3 had never been sequenced in the Hispanic population with respect to NAFLD. Our study demonstrated that the minor, G allele is more common in our Caribbean-Hispanic patients with NAFLD than in any other group analyzed. This included ethnically matched controls (OR 2.95, P = 0.003), the sample Bronx population (OR 3.01, P = 4.4E-7), the general population (OR 1.97, P = 0.0001), and even the average Puerto Rican population (OR 1.56, P = 0.05).\n\n    Mutations in PNPLA3 provide a possible genetic basis for the underlying mechanisms in the genesis of NAFLD. The PNPLA3 gene is located on chromosome 22q13.3 and encodes for a membrane-bound protein mediating triacylglycerol hydrolysis in adipocytes. Its expression is highest in human liver tissue (Huang et al. 2010) and is induced during feeding and insulin resistance by fatty acids and other regulators of lipogenesis (Huang et al. 2010; Dongiovanni et al. 2013). The rs738409 missense variation specifically is assumed to promote triglyceride accumulation through relative inhibition of triglyceride hydrolysis (He et al. 2010). An understanding of the theoretical pathophysiology behind NAFLD illustrates how PNPLA3's function is consistent with a theoretical role in the progression of the disease.\n\n    Although the exact pathogenesis of NAFLD is still under debate, there are a number of mechanisms that are clearly involved. These include insulin resistance, free fatty acid flux, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and inflammation (Yoon and Cha 2014). Simplistically, steatosis in the liver develops when supply of fatty acids to the liver exceed the demand in requirements for mitochondrial oxidation and synthesis of phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol (Lall et al. 2008). Triglyceride accumulation results from either lipid uptake in the liver or de novo synthesis in the setting of excess carbohydrates (Kawano and Cohen 2013). Insulin resistance has repeatedly been implicated as an important cause of lipid accumulation in the liver (Marchesini et al. 1999; Sanyal et al. 2001; Chitturi et al. 2002; Pagano et al. 2002). Once the liver is overrun with lipid accumulation, the mitochondria attempt to remove the fatty acids through oxidation. However, this process can inadvertently cause oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction through excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Rolo et al. 2012; Yoon and Cha 2014). This hepatocellular injury is further exacerbated by the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-6, and NO) that are induced through the presence of adipose tissue in the liver and basal insulin resistance (Carter-Kent et al. 2008; Hijona et al. 2010; Odegaard and Chawla 2011; Yoon and Cha 2014). This proinflammatory state and resultant fibrosis/necrosis define the histopathological spectrum of NAFLD.\n\n    Many of the genes identified in our study as having variations with multiple significant results have functions that fit in with the pathogenesis of NAFLD and may logically influence disease susceptibility or progression. These particularly include SAMM50, ENPP1, and ABCC2. ENPP1's function can be directly linked to hepatic steatosis as it codes for a membrane glycoprotein functioning to inhibit insulin signaling. The rs1044498, SNP variation causes a gain-of-function mutation that causes overexpression in peripheral insulin target tissues and is associated with human insulin resistance (Prudente and Trischitta 2006). If SAMM50 is involved in NAFLD, it is likely related to its role in mitochondrial function. SAMM50 encodes a component of the SAM assembly complex, which helps integrate beta-barrel proteins into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Any mitochondrial dysfunction and resultant decrease in removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of mutations in SAMM50 is consistent with biochemical rationale for the importance of SAMM50 in NAFLD (Kitamoto et al. 2013). ABCC2 has a function that is more removed from a direct correlation with NAFLD. It encodes a protein expressed in the apical area of the hepatocyte and functions in biliary transport, likely critical to the elimination of conjugates of many toxins from hepatocytes into bile (Nies and Keppler 2007) and likely predisposing liver toward injury from excessive adipose tissue (Sookoian et al. 2009).\n\n    There is one gene cluster, ERLIN1-CHUK-CWF19L1, which revealed associations with SNPs that appear to confer protection in our study. The relation of these genes to NAFLD is theoretically logical as ERLIN1 comprises a component of lipid rafts (Browman et al. 2006) and CHUK proteins modulate NF-kB activation of several genes involved in insulin resistance (Yuan et al. 2008). For the SNPs rs11597086 and rs2862954, the rate of polymorphism in our sample Bronx population was lower than in the average Puerto Rican population (OR 0.54, P = 0.003; OR 0.54, P = 1.5E-3). In our study, these variations also occur less frequently in NAFLD cases than would be expected in a random Puerto Rican population (OR 0.61, P = 0.09, OR 0.60, P = 0.07). The fact that these polymorphisms only seem to confer protection when compared with the Puerto Rican community suggest that there is some other genetic modifier in the Hispanic subpopulation that interacts with these genes to protect patients from the development of hepatic steatosis. This phenomenon is interesting and warrants further investigation.\n\n    In conclusion, this study implies significant interactions of variants from PNPLA3, ERLIN1- CHUK, SAMM50, ENPP1, and ABCC2 with NAFLD in Hispanics from a majority Caribbean ancestry. An interaction of these genes with NAFLD is pathophysiologically plausible and the extent of impact of these variations in NAFLD generally and in sub-Hispanic populations deserves further analysis.",

        "Title": "    Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in a German Shorthaired Pointer associated with a previously reported CLN8 nonsense variant",
        "Abstract": "    Two littermate German Shorthaired Pointers, a male and a female, were adopted as puppies from an animal shelter. Both puppies developed normally until approximately 11 months of age when the male began to exhibit neurological signs including ataxia, vision loss, and behavioral changes indicative of cognitive decline. These signs increased in severity over time. The female remained neurologically normal and healthy. The affected dog was euthanized at approximately 21 months of age. Autofluorescent cytoplasmic storage bodies were detected in neurons in unstained tissue sections from the cerebellum, the cerebrum, and the retina. Electron micrographs of these storage bodies showed that they were membrane bound and that most contained tightly packed aggregates of membranous whorls along with a variety of other ultrastructural features. This ultrastructure, along with the autofluorescence and the clinical signs supported a diagnosis of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Unlike earlier investigated forms of canine NCL with causal alleles in ATP13A2, TPP1, MFSD8 and CLN5 that had autofluorescent cytoplasmic storage bodies in cardiac muscle, no autofluorescence was detected in cardiac muscle from the affected German Shorthaired Pointer. A 39-fold average coverage whole genome sequence indicated that the affected German Shorthaired Pointer was homozygous for the A allele of a G > A transversion at position 30,895,648 chromosome 37. This 37:30895648G > A mutation created a CLN8 termination codon that had been previously reported to cause NCL in a mixed breed dog with Australian Shepherd and Australian Cattle Dog ancestry. This nonsense allele was heterozygous in the clinically normal female sibling, while archived DNA samples from 512 other German Shorthaired Pointers were all homozygous for the reference allele. The affected German Shorthaired Pointer and the previously diagnosed mixed breed dog with the same nonsense mutation shaired an identical homozygous haplotype that extended for 4.41 Mb at the telomeric end of chromosome 37, indicating the both dogs inherited the nonsense mutation from a common ancestor.",
        "Introduction": "    Lysosomal storage diseases associated with pathogenic alleles in at least 13 genes have been classified as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) based on similarities in clinical and pathological disease phenotypes. In affected human subjects, apparently normal early development is followed by progressive neurological decline characterized by signs that include impaired motor and cognitive functions, loss of vision, seizures, and impairments in respiration and swallowing. Most forms of NCL culminate in premature death. The age of onset and rate of disease progression vary depending on the gene involved and the specific causal allele within that gene. A characteristic feature of the NCLs is massive accumulation of autofluorescent lysosomal storage bodies in the central nervous system and other organs and tissues. The clinical signs are usually accompanied by progressive brain atrophy and retinal degeneration. The NCLs are classified as forms CLN1 through CLN14 based on the gene in which the pathologic sequence variant occurs. Clinical subtypes within many of the different CLN forms have been described.\n\n    Naturally occurring NCLs resulting from causal alleles in the canine orthologs of 8 of the CLN genes have been identified in purebred and mixed breed dogs. The onset of clinical signs in the canine NCLs ranges from a few months to 7 years of age depending on the responsible gene and the causal allele it harbors. In one dog breed a complex sequence variant in the gene associated with the CLN1 form of NCL was associated with progressive retinal atrophy without any of the other signs that are typical of this disease. Nonsyndromic sequence variants associated retinal pathology alone have been reported for CLN3 and CLN7 (MFSD8) in human subjects.\n\n    We have identified the majority of the sequence variants that underlie the forms of canine NCL that have been described to date. The process by which these discoveries have been made starts when a dog owner or veterinarian reports to us a dog that is exhibiting behavioral signs suggestive of NCL. We request veterinary medical histories from the referring veterinarians and information about behavioral abnormalities from the dogs' owners. We also request blood samples for DNA isolation and pedigree information, if available. When the dogs are euthanized, we request that brains, retinas, and other tissues be collected and that samples from each type of tissue be fixed in separate fixatives for both light and electron microscopic examinations. If a tentative diagnosis of NCL is supported by the presence of storage bodies that autofluoresce in unstained tissue and exhibit characteristic ultrastructural features in brain and retina, we either screen for known canine NCL-associated sequence variants or generate whole genome sequences to identify the causal sequence variants. In this study we performed these analyses for NCL identification using samples from an unregistered German Shorthaired Pointer that was euthanized after exhibiting progressive neurological signs that are typical of canine NCL. To our knowledge, NCL has not been reported previously in this dog breed.",
        "Methods": "    These studies were conducted with the informed consent of the dogs' owner and were approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Two littermate German Shorthaired Pointer puppies, one male and the other female, were adopted as pets by the same person from an animal shelter. The dogs were spayed or neutered prior to adoption. Both dogs had the typical appearance of purebred German Shorthaired Pointers (Fig. 1).\n\n    At approximately 11 months of age the male began to exhibit a loss of coordination that grew progressively worse over time. The dog became clumsy, ataxic, and bumped into stationary objects, walls, and people in a familiar environment. By 15 months of age he exhibited compulsive circling and tongue movements, jaw chattering, and was confused by familiar sounds. From that time forward there was of a progressive decline in the ability to understand and respond to previously learned commands and other behavioral cues and the dog began to regress in previously learned housetraining. At 17 months of age the dog exhibited obvious visual impairment in both bright and dim light, and by 18 months the dog was hesitant to attempt to climb up or down stairs. No seizure activity or trance-like behavior was observed by the dog's owner and the dog never become aggressive. The dog became progressively anxious between 18 and 21 months of age and was videotaped during this period. Video recordings illustrating the affected dog's abnormal behaviours are included in the supplemental material. At approximately 21 months of age, the dog was humanely euthanized due to the progression of behavioral signs. The affected dog's female littermate has exhibited no significant behavioral abnormalities at over two years of age.\n\n    The affected dog was examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist at approximately 18 months of age. The dog exhibited bilateral absences of visual tracking and menace responses. Direct and indirect pupillary light reflexes and dazzle reflexes were present when stimulated by a bright light source. No abnormalities were noted by fundic examinations. The dog was diagnosed with central blindness with undetermined cause and was referred for a neurological examination. At 18 months age the dog had obtunded mentation and severe proprioceptive ataxia in all limbs. No other neurological abnormalities were observed. No significant abnormalities were detected with standard complete blood count and blood chemistry analyses. Upon re-examination at 21 months of age, no direct or indirect pupillary light reflexes could be elicited.\n\n    The dog was humanely euthanized at 21 months of age following the final neurological examination. Immediately after euthanasia, the eyes were enucleated and the corneas were removed. One eye was immersed in a fixative solution consisting of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. The other eye was immersed in a fixative consisting of 3.5% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, 0.12 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4 (Immuno fix). The entire brain was then removed and bisected longitudinally. One half was frozen for potential future biochemical analyses. From the other half of the brain, one slice each of the parietal cerebral cortex and of the cerebellum were immersed in Immuno fix. Adjacent slices from each region were immersed in a fixative consisting of 2.0% glutaraldehyde, 1.12% paraformaldehyde, 0.13 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4 (EM fix). The remainder of this half of the brain was immersed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Chemical, Cat. no. SF93-4). Slices of the heart ventricular wall were obtained and preserved with the same fixatives as were used for brain tissue preservation. Each tissue slice was approximately 3 mm thick. All fixed tissues were maintained at ambient temperature until processed for microscopic examination. All samples were shipped from the neurologist in Florida to the University of Missouri via express overnight delivery.\n\n    The eyes were dissected and areas from the central posterior region of each eye adjacent to the optic nerve head were prepared and examined with fluorescence, light and electron microscopy as described previously. Portions of the brain regions, retina and heart ventricle that were preserved in Immuno fix were embedded in paraffin and unstained sections of the paraffin blocks were examined with fluorescence microscopy.\n\n    Small areas of the central posterior retina fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and of the cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex preserved in EM fix were processed and sectioned for electron microscopic examination. The samples were washed in cacodyate buffer, post-fixed with osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Sections of each sample were cut to thicknesses of 70 to 90 nm and were mounted on thin-bar copper grids. The sections were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and were subsequently examined and imaged using a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan digital camera.\n\n    The canine DNA samples used in this study were purified from EDTA anti-coagulated blood as previously described. DNA from the affected dog was submitted to the McDonnell Genome Institute for PCR-free library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq platform. A previously described modified best-practices GATK pipeline was used for alignment of the resulting paired-end sequence data to the reference genome (CanFam3.1) and for calling variants. Ensembl annotation (version 89) and commercial software (Golden Helix, SVS version 8.8.3) were used for producing variant reports. Rare variants were identified by comparison to 146 other whole genome sequences of dogs with a variety of diseases including 6 dogs with suspected or confirmed NCL. Prior to whole genome sequencing, a previously described TaqMan allelic discrimination assay was used to genotype the affected dog for the 22:30,574,637C > T transition in CLN5 responsible for NCL in a variety of breeds. A different TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, for a G-to-A transition at 37:30883950 in CLN8, was used to genotype the sibling of the affected dog and archived DNA samples from German Shorthaired Pointers.",
        "Results": "    Brain, retina and heart samples from the affected dog were examined for the presence of autofluorescent lysosomal storage material that is characteristic of the NCLs. Substantial amounts of autofluorscent storage material were present in cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as in other cells within the Purkinje cell layer (Fig. 2A). In addition, cells with large amounts the autofluorescent material were present in the granule cell layer, with fewer cells containing this material in the molecular layer (Fig. 2A). Cells with substantial accumulations of disease-specific autofluorescent granules were abundant throughout the cerebral cortex and appeared to occur in the majority of cortical neurons (Fig. 2B). In the retina, accumulation of these autofluorescent granules was restricted primarily to the ganglion cells (Fig. 2C). The cardiac muscle was devoid of the autofluorescent storage material observed in other forms of canine NCL.\n\n    The ultrastructural appearances of the disease-specific storage bodies in the cerebellum of the affected dog were similar in the Purkinje cells (Fig. 3A and B) and in cells in the granule cell layer (Fig. 3C and D). There was some variability in the shapes and substructures of the storage bodies, even within the same cell type (compare Fig. 3A and B). The storage bodies were membrane-bounded and their contents consisted primarily of tightly packed aggregates of membranous whorls and vesicles. The diameters of most storage body profiles ranged from 1.5 to 6 mum. However, in some cells in the granule cell layer, a large proportion of the entire cell body was occupied by a single large storage body that could be as large as 20 mum in diameter (Fig. 3D).\n\n    As with the cerebellum, the storage body contents in the cerebral cortex and the retinal ganglion cells consisted primarily of aggregates of membrane-like structures (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). However, in these tissues there was much more variability in the appearance and organization of the storage bodies (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In the cerebral cortex, the sizes and appearances of the storage bodies varied greatly between cells, but within individual cells, each of the storage bodies were similar in appearance (Fig. 4C). The sizes and appearances of the storage bodies within the retinal ganglion cells was even more variable. Stacks of membrane-like structures arranged in parallel arrays were only found within the storage bodies of the retinal ganglion cells (arrow in Fig. 5), although these comprised only a fraction of the material within the storage bodies of this cell type.\n\n    Because a CLN5 nonsense mutation at 22:30,574,637 has been found to be responsible for NCL in a variety of breeds, we first genotyped the affected German Shorthaired Pointer for this CLN5 variant and determined that the dog was homozygous for the reference allele. To identify the molecular genetic cause for the NCL in the current case, we used DNA from the affected dog to generate a whole genome sequence with 39.4-fold average coverage. Golden Helix SVS software and Ensembl annotation were used to produce a variant report with data from the whole genome sequence of the affected dog and also from the whole genome sequences of 146 other dogs with a variety of diseases that served as controls. Relative to the reference sequence, the whole genome sequence of the affected dog contained 20,638 variant alleles predicted to alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptides. Only 20 of these variant alleles, harbored by 18 different genes, were homozygous in the affected German Shorthaired Pointer and absent from the other 146 whole genome sequence in our data set (Supplementary Material, Table 1). None of these 20 alleles have been previously associated with NCL-like disorders and, based on their known biological functions, none were considered candidates for causality. We therefore relaxed our selection criteria to find variant alleles that were homozygous in the affected dog and rare, but not absent, in the control whole genome sequences. The variant allele of a G-to-A transition at 37:30883950 was homozygous in the affected German Shorthaired Pointer and also homozygous in the whole genome sequence of a mixed breed dog, but absent from the other 145 whole genome sequences in our reference data set. The mixed breed dog was previously reported by us to have NCL caused by the homozygous 37:30883950A allele which predicts a nonsense mutation in CLN8 (p.Trp195*). The clinically normal sibling of the affected German Shorthaired Pointer was an A/G heterozygote at 37:30883950. Archived DNA samples from 512 German Shorthaired Pointers all tested homozygous for the 37:30883950G allele.\n\n    To determine whether or not the 37:30883950A alleles in the affected German Shorthaired Pointer and in the affected mixed breed dog stemmed from the same founding event, we generated a Golden Helix SVS variant report that contained all chromosome 37 variants that occurred in either or both of the canine whole genome sequences of these dogs. These two dogs were homozygous for an identical haplotype that started at position 37:26491131 extended for 4.4 Mb to the telomeric end of chromosome 37. This indicates that both dogs inherited their CLN8 nonsense mutation from a common ancester.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    To date 13 sequence variants have been associated with different forms of NCL in dogs (Table 1). In almost all cases, the variants have been restricted to a single dog breed or to two similar breeds. The one exception has been a c.619C > T transition in CLN5 that converts a glutamine codon to a termination codon (p.Gln207Ter). This variant was first reported in Border Collies and was subsequently also found in the similar Australian Cattle Dog breed. At the time of the latter discovery, it was assumed that the existence of the same variant in both breeds was due to cross breeding between Border Collies and Australian Cattle dogs, both of which are often kept by the same or neighboring owners who use them for herding. More recently this CLN5 variant was found to be homozygous in a mixed breed dog with no apparent Border Collie or Australian Cattle Dog ancestry. Haplotype analysis indicated that there was a single founding mutation event which may have predated the establishment of the modern dog breed registries. Thus, the CLN5 disease allele may be segregating in as yet unidentified breeds and was considered a candidate for the cause of the disorder in the affected German Shorthaired Pointer. After the known CLN5 NCL variant was ruled out, whole genome sequence analysis was elected as the most efficient means of identifying the disease variant in the affected dog.\n\n    Four different CLN8 variants have been reported to cause canine NCL (Table 1). Previously, three of these variants had each been associated with a single breed: English Setter, Alpenlandische Dachsbracke, and Saluki. This breed-restricted distribution of causal alleles would be expected if the founding mutations occurred in members of already established breeds. The other causal CLN8 variant was found in a cross-breed dog that resulted from the mating of an Australian Shepherd with an Australian Cattle Dog. Because members of both of the parental breeds are similar herding dogs, interbreed matings are likely to be common. Thus, it appeared that the homozygous CLN8 variant responsible for the NCL in this mixed breed dog could have originated in a member of either of the parental breeds. We here report that the identical CLN8 variant in the homozygous state was responsible for NCL in a member of a very different breed, the German Shorthaired Pointer.\n\n    As expected, the German Shorthaired Pointer and the mixed breed dog with the same homozygous causal variant in CLN8 exhibited a very similar patterns of clinical signs. One exception to this was that the mixed-breed dog exhibited generalized seizures near end-stage disease when 21 months of age. Generalized seizures were not observed in the affected German Shorthaired Pointer who was euthanized at the same age. Since the seizures started in the mixed-breed dog just prior to euthanasia, it possible that seizures would have occurred in the affected German Shorthaired Pointer had the dog been allowed to survive longer.\n\n    The contents of the storage bodies in all cell types examined in both 37:30883950A homozygous dogs consisted primarily of similar aggregates of membrane-like material. Thus, breed background does not appear to have a noticeable effect on storage-body ultrastructure. Although the clinical signs of the NCLs are primarily neurological, the association of these diseases with impaired lysosomal function suggests that disease pathology is likely to occur in extra-neuronal tissues because almost all cell types have lysosomes. Since our observation that progressive cardiac pathology occurs in Dachshunds with the CLN2 form of NCL, we have been examining the cardiac muscles obtained at necropsy from dogs suspected of suffering from NCL. We have found substantial accumulations of autofluorsecent storage material in the cardiac muscles from dogs suffering from NCL due to disease alleles in ATP13A2, TPP1 (CLN2), MFSD8, and CLN5. Whether this is the case for other forms of NCL remains to be determined. The German Shorthaired Pointer evaluated in this study gave us our first opportunity to examine heart muscle from a CLN8-deficient dog for autofluorescent storage body accumulation. Somewhat surprisingly, no disease-related autofluorescence was detected in the cardiac ventricular muscle of this dog. This suggests that the pattern of extra-neural tissues and organs that exhibit autofluorescence varies according to the gene harbouring the disease-causing sequence variant.\n\n    The causal homozygous CLN8 nonsense alleles in the affected German Shorthaired Pointer and in the previously reported mixed-breed dog with Australian Shepherd and Australian Cattle Dog ancestry are imbedded in a shared homozygous haplotype that extends for over 4.4 Mb at the telomeric end of chromosome 37. This indicates that the causal alleles in both affected dogs stem from a common ancester and that there was a single founding mutation event. The nonsense allele appears to be rare in all three of the above mentioned breeds. Archived DNA samples from 512 German Shorthaired Pointers all tested homozygous for the reference allele. As reported earlier, 144 Australian Cattle Dogs all tested homozygous for the reference allele and only 3 of 1484 NCL-free Australian Shepherds were heterozygotes (nonsense allele frequency equals 0.001). Thus, for most purposes, screening heathy dogs of these breeds or other breeds for the nonsense allele would not be cost effective. Nonetheless, in the future we plan to screen canine NCL suspects from any breed background for the CLN8 37:30883950A allele and also for the CLN5 22:30,574,637 T allele before we invest in whole genome sequencing to identify novel causes for canine NCL. We can provide these tests without charge to investigators, veterinarians, and dog owners with access to dogs with an NCL-like clinical histories of unknown cause.\n\n    The following are the supplementary data related to this article.",

        "Title": "    The genetic basis of familial adenomatous polyposis and its implications for clinical practice and risk management",
        "Abstract": "    Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited disorder that represents the most common gastrointestinal polyposis syndrome. Germline mutations in the APC gene were initially identified as responsible for FAP, and later, several studies have also implicated the MUTYH gene as responsible for this disease, usually referred to as MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP). FAP and MAP are characterized by the early onset of multiple adenomatous colorectal polyps, a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), and in some patients the development of extracolonic manifestations. The goal of colorectal management in these patients is to prevent CRC mortality through endoscopic and surgical approaches. Individuals with FAP and their relatives should receive appropriate genetic counseling and join surveillance programs when indicated. This review is focused on the description of the main clinical and genetic aspects of FAP associated with germline APC mutations and MAP.",
        "Introduction": "    Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) refers to an inherited syndrome characterized by the development of multiple adenomas in the colorectum, a high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), and the existence of extracolonic manifestations. Germline adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations were firstly described in 1991 as causing FAP with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Since then, a great body of evidence has been generated, including pathophysiology, genetics, clinical phenotype, and prevention. In 2002, another polyposis gene was identified, the mutY homolog (MUTYH) gene, in which biallelic mutations cause an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, usually referred to as MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP). This review is focused on the description of the key clinical and genetics aspects of FAP associated with germline APC mutations and MAP.\n\n    APC-FAP (OMIM #175100) is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease characterized by the development of multiple adenomas throughout the colorectum. It represents less than 1% of all CRC cases, and is the most common gastrointestinal polyposis syndrome, with an incidence of one case per 10,000 subjects.\n\n    APC is a tumor-suppressor gene that is located on chromosome 5q21-q22. The gene has 15 exons, with exon 15 individually representing >75% of the coding sequence and the most common target of both germline and somatic mutations. The APC gene encodes a protein of 2,843 aminoacids (310 kDa) that plays an outright role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This multifunctional protein occurs in several isoforms within cells, containing several aminoacid motifs and domains allowing it to oligomerize, as well as interact with numerous other molecules (Figure 1A). The APC protein functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the beta-catenin oncoprotein. The APC protein leads to ubiquitination and degradation of beta-catenin; so in the absence of it, beta-catenin accumulates in the nucleus and interacts with factors that up-regulate the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle entry, proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and progression. In addition, APC stabilizes microtubules, leading to chromosomal stability. Inactivation of APC can lead to defective chromosome segregation and aberrant mitosis.\n\n    Germline mutations in the APC gene are responsible for most cases of FAP. Individuals with a germline APC mutation develop multiple adenomas as a result of inactivation of the remaining allele in the colorectum by additional somatic APC mutations or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at this locus.\n\n    In a recent large cross-sectional study, APC mutations were found in 80% (95% CI 71%-87%) of individuals with more than 1,000 adenomas, 56% (95% CI 54%-59%) in those with 100-999 adenomas, 10% (95% CI 9%-11%) in those with 20-99 adenomas, and 5% (95% CI 4%-7%) in those with 10-19 adenomas. Inheritance of FAP is autosomal dominant although up to 25% of FAP patients carry de novo germline mutations.\n\n    Truncation mutations: As mentioned earlier, the great majority of FAP-associated APC mutations lead to a truncated protein, mainly due to a frameshift or nonsense variant. The most common nonsense changes are C>T mutations, and the majority of germline mutations in APC occur in the 5' half of the gene, leading to the elimination of most, if not all, of the 20-aminoacid repeats involved in regulating beta-catenin levels and SAMP repeats involved in axin binding (Figure 1A).\n\n    Missense mutations: Although rare, more than 60 different missense variants of APC have been described in the literature as potentially pathogenic. The two missense variants most frequently reported are I1307K and E1317Q. The I1307K variant, present in 6% of all individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, does not lead to a polyposis phenotype, but it carries an increased (10%-20%) lifetime risk of developing CRC. The E1317Q missense variant has also been associated with a moderate risk for colorectal adenomas and CRC.\n\n    Splicing mutations and gross alterations: Splice altering mutations and large deletions/duplications have also been described, and recent data suggest that especially gross alterations affecting the promoter of coding regions may have been underreported, accounting for up to 20% of FAP families.\n\n    De novo mutations and germline mosaicism: Most of the APC germline mutations are inherited, but can also occur de novo in a patient with no family history of the disease, representing between 11% and 25% of all FAP cases. The estimated rate of APC new mutations is between 4 and 9x106 mutations/gametes/generation, and equal susceptibility for mutagenesis during spermatogenesis and oogenesis has been described. A significant percentage of the de novo cases arise in the mosaic form, affecting only a subset of cells in the affected individual (it is estimated that one-fifth of the de novo cases of FAP are mosaic).\n\n    Mutational hotspots: The mutational hotspots in the APC gene are located in the 5' part of exon 15 at codons 1,309 and 1,061, accounting for approximately 17% and 11% of all germline APC mutations, respectively. Because of the accumulation of mutations from codon 1,250 to 1,464, this region is termed the mutation cluster region (MCR) (Figure 1A).\n\n    Since the identification of the APC gene, more than 1,100 unique likely pathogenic germline mutations have been reported (http://www.lovd.nl/apc). The majority of them represent truncating mutations, being nonsense mutations (28%), small insertions (10%) or small deletions (46%) that lead to a truncated protein. Although infrequent, there are also missense mutations (3%) and gross alterations (ie, single or multiexon deletions and duplications) (13%).\n\n    The type of germline mutation in the APC gene determines the nature of the second hit. If the germline mutation occurs between codons 1,194 and 1,392, then there is a strong association with allelic loss of APC as the second hit. If the germline mutation occurs outside this region, the second hit is most likely to induce a truncating mutation in the MCR.\n\n    Classic FAP: It is characterized by the presence of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps throughout the colon and the rectum. At the time of adolescence, the polyps are usually identified in the recto-sigmoid as small polyps, and thereafter, increase in size and number. About half of FAP patients develop adenomas by 15 years of age and 95% by 35 years. CRC inevitably occurs at an earlier age than sporadic CRC (average age of 35 years), but only rarely before the age of 20 years.\n\n    AFAP: It is a variant of FAP with a mild disease course, characterized by a reduced number of polyps (10-100), later age of onset, frequently right-sided distribution of polyps, and lower CRC risk (up to 70%). The clinical definition of AFAP is controversial and should be considered in any patient with 10-99 adenomas, although a precise diagnosis is often difficult in a single patient. APC-associated AFAP can mimic MAP or even sporadic polyp development. Examination of multiple family members can often determine the phenotype.\n\n    According to the number of polyps and the age of onset, two major phenotypes have been described for FAP (Table 1):\n\n    In many FAP patients, extracolonic manifestations are present, including gastric and duodenal polyps, desmoid tumors (DT) thyroidal and brain tumors, osteomas, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium, supernumerary teeth, and epidermoid cysts.\n\n    The most common extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients are upper gastrointestinal polyps. They are located in the stomach, duodenum, and the periampullary region. Gastric polyps are usually benign fundic gland polyps (FGP), and occur in 20%-84% of FAP patients. Although FAP-associated FGPs have been traditionally thought of as nonneoplastic and usually do not require intervention, cases of high-grade dysplasia and gastric carcinoma arising from FGPs in FAP have been reported. Gastric adenomatous polyps represent around 10% of gastric polyps, and when they occur, they are most commonly located in the antrum. Despite the malignant potential of gastric dysplastic FGP and adenomas, gastric carcinoma is very rare in FAP patients (incidence <1%).\n\n    After the colorectum, the duodenum is the second most common site of polyps in FAP patients. Duodenal adenomas arise in most patients with FAP with a lifetime risk of almost 100%. These polyps have a predilection for the second and third portion of the duodenum, especially the periampullary region. This pattern probably reflects the exposure of duodenal mucosa to bile acids, suggesting a role for these compounds in duodenal carcinogenesis. Duodenal cancer is the second cause of cancer death in FAP patients, with a cumulative lifetime risk of 5%.\n\n    Both benign and malignant extracolonic manifestations are common in FAP patients. Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) is the most common extracolonic manifestation of FAP (70%-80%). It appears as gray-brown to black round or oval lesions in the retina, and is not known to cause any clinical problems. Epidermoid cysts (50%) and fibromas (25%-50%) are considered subcutaneous lesions, and may cause cosmetic problems. Other benign manifestations include dental abnormalities (79%-90%), osteomas (50%-90%), and desmoid tumors (DT) (10%-15%).\n\n    DTs are slow-growing mesenchymal neoplasms characterized by the lack of metastatic potential but an aggressive local behavior due to their infiltrative growth and a high local recurrence rate following complete resection. Compared to the general population, FAP patients are at approximately 1,000-fold increased risk of developing DT. Most DTs in FAP patients arise in the abdomen, most frequently in the abdominal wall or intra-abdominal. Risk factors for DT development include abdominal surgery, a positive family history for desmoids, and as explained below, the site of the mutation in the APC gene. Although benign histologically, they represent one of the main causes of death in patients with FAP.\n\n    Extracolonic malignancies include thyroid cancer (2%-3%), pancreatic mucinous adenocarcinomas (1%), hepatoblastoma (1%), and brain tumors (ie, medulloblastoma; <1%).\n\n    Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the third most common malignancy associated with FAP (after CRC and duodenal cancer). The lifetime risk of developing thyroid cancer is low, and estimated to be 2%-3% with a rate of approximately 160 times that of the general population. There is a remarkable female preponderance (female to male ratio 17:1), and the average age at diagnosis is 27 years. Although thyroid cancer in FAP patients can be multifocal and regional lymph node involvement may occur, prognosis is usually very favorable.\n\n    Hepatoblastoma is an embryonal neoplasm that predominantly occurs in children between 6 months and 3 years of age, but the age at diagnosis can range from prenatal stages to 16 years. Although the combination of chemotherapy and surgery is very successful, an estimated 25% of all patients do not survive this disease.\n\n    The combination of colorectal and extracolonic manifestations is known as Gardner's syndrome, whereas the association between colorectal polyposis and brain tumors corresponds to Turcot's syndrome.\n\n    The existence of a spectrum of polyposis caused by mutations located in different regions of the APC gene was suggested by Leppert et al in 1990. Since then, several studies have observed an association between the clinical manifestation and the location of the germline mutation. Broadly, the classic phenotype of more than 100 adenomas is associated with mutations between codons 178 and 309, and between codons 409 and 1,580, corresponding to exons 5-8, 9-14 and the first half of the large final exon 15. Based upon the genotype-phenotype correlation, FAP can be classified into three categories. Profuse or aggressive polyposis (characterized by an earlier onset and greater number of polyps) has been associated with mutations from codons 1,250 to 1,464, mainly in codon 1,309. AFAP is usually associated with mutations at the extreme 5' (before codon 157) and 3' (after codon 1,595) ends of the APC gene, and in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9 (codons 213-412). Finally, in classic FAP, the intermediate phenotype, mutations are located in the remainder of the APC gene, in particular the 5' end between codon 157 and 1,595 excluding codon 1,309. (Figure 2).\n\n    Extracolonic manifestations have been also associated with specific APC mutations, especially those located beyond codon 1,400. CHRPE is linked to mutations located between codon 311 and codon 1,465, and the presence of DTs is related to mutations at the 3' end of the APC gene, in general downstream codon 1,400 (1,445-2,011). The presence of gastric and duodenal polyps have been related to mutations at the 3' end, before codon 1,395, but also exon 4 and codons 564-1,493. Other genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed with limited evidence. Almost 95% of the mutations in hepatoblastoma patients are located on the 5' to mid region of the APC gene between codons 141 and 1,751. Thyroid tumors have been related to mutations between codons 140 and 1,309 (Figure 2).\n\n    Although genotype-phenotype association is observed, there is a considerable variability among individuals, even among family members, suggesting the influence of environmental factors and/or the effect of modifier genes.\n\n    Prior to gene testing, affected individuals must receive genetic counseling, so that they understand the pros and cons of cancer genetic testing. Patients must be able to determine whether such testing is acceptable emotionally and take into account other potential issues (such as confidentiality). Once genetic counseling is properly done, if the causative mutation is detected, then presymptomatic diagnosis can be offered to at-risk relatives of the index case. Mid-adolescence is the right time to perform genetic testing, when the diagnosis begins to gain clinical importance in terms of cancer prevention. If germline pathogenic mutation is not found, gene testing cannot be offered to family members, and clinical diagnosis and surveillance is mandatory for all first-degree relatives.\n\n    Several methods for APC gene testing have been used. Direct sequencing of all 15 coding exons of the APC gene is considered the gold standard for mutation detection. However, other approaches have been used. In the past, several clinical laboratories used the RNA-based protein truncation test (PTT). The method is based on the size analysis of products resulting from in vitro transcription and translation, which has a sensitivity ranging from 70% to 90%. However, the PTT approach has disadvantages, including assay artifacts and an inability to detect nontruncating mutations. Other methods include scanning methods (such as conformation strand gel electrophoresis), followed by sequencing of aberrant fragments. However, none of these methods has the detection sensitivity of direct sequencing, which is a standard method in most clinical laboratories for detecting point mutations and small insertions or deletions, which account for >85% of the APC mutations. The remaining 10%-15% of mutations are gross deletions and duplications, which can be detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), Southern blot, or real-time quantitative PCR analysis.\n\n    Current guidelines recommend that FAP testing should be performed using full sequencing of the APC gene, and if no mutation is detected, then testing for large gene rearrangements should be completed.\n\n    The goal of colorectal neoplasia management in FAP patients is to prevent CRC. This management includes both endoscopic polypectomy and surgery. In families with classic FAP, flexible sigmoidoscopy is an adequate technique because of the almost universal distribution of adenomas, including the rectum. The age at which screening should start depends on the risk of malignant transformation of the colorectal adenomas. In FAP patients, the risk of developing CRC before age 20 is very low; however, up to 1.5% of CRC occur between 11 and 20 years of age. Accordingly, sigmoidoscopy screening should be carried out every 2 years, starting at age 12-14 years, and be continued lifelong in mutations carriers. Once adenomas are detected, total colonoscopy should be carried out annually until colectomy is planned (Table 2).\n\n    In AFAP cases, since adenomas can be localized in the right colon, colonoscopy is recommended instead of sigmoidoscopy. In this setting, screening should be carried out every 2 years until polyposis is diagnosed, starting at the age of 18-20 years. Once adenomas are detected, colonoscopy should be carried out annually.\n\n    Surgical removal of the colon at a premalignant stage is a key to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with advanced CRC. In classic FAP, prophylactic colectomy is usually recommended, when polyposis is profuse or \"worrisome\" polyps are identified (ie, >1 cm, ulcerated, high grade dysplasia). Most patients with classic FAP undergo surgery between the age of 15 and 25 years. The treatment of AFAP is commonly endoscopic, and only if this is not possible, surgery is performed in a similar manner as in classical FAP.\n\n    Surgical options include both proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). Compared with IPAA, IRA is relatively simple, with a lower complication rate and usually good bowel function after surgery. For IPAA, more extensive surgery is needed (including pelvic dissection), causing reduction of fertility and worse bowel function. The choice of the surgical technique mainly depends on the age at diagnosis, desmoids, fertility, and the severity of rectal polyposis (>15-20 polyps), as well as patient decision after receiving comprehensive information on the benefits and risks of each approach. Some authors have proposed to use the evidence of genotype-phenotype association in guiding the surgical treatment of patients with a relatively spared rectum. An IPAA may be recommended in patients with a severe genotype because such patients are at increased risk of developing severe rectal polyposis that will require a secondary proctectomy if IRA is performed.\n\n    After surgery, endoscopic follow-up is recommended for those patients with rectal remnant, due to the risk of developing rectal cancer (up to 30% of the cases). Many studies have shown that adenomas and occasionally even adenocarcinomas have been found in the ileo-anal pouch after restorative proctocolectomy. Therefore, the surveillance of the pouch and the transitional anal zone is essential.\n\n    In general, screening for extracolonic manifestations should start when colorectal polyposis is diagnosed or at the age of 25-30 years. Gastroduodenal endoscopy using both front and side-view scopes (in order to correctly visualize the Vater's ampulla) should be performed every 5 years until adenomas are detected.\n\n    In current practice, given the relative rarity of gastric adenocarcinoma, upper gastrointestinal endoscopic surveillance is driven by the greater risk of duodenal cancer. The stomach is visualized as part of this surveillance, but biopsy or polypectomy is undertaken only for large or unusual looking lesions, especially in the antrum.\n\n    To standardize the management of duodenal polyps in FAP, Spigelman et al developed a classification system based on four prognostic variables (Table 3): number of polyps, size, histology, and degree of dysplasia. Stage I (4 points) indicates mild disease, whereas stages III-IV (>6 points) imply severe duodenal polyposis, with a significant risk of duodenal cancer (7%-36%). Approximately 80% of the patients have stage I-III disease, and 10%-20% have stage IV disease. Current evidence indicates that duodenal inspection with chromoendoscopy or narrow-band imaging increase the detection of duodenal adenomas but without a considerable change in Spigelman stages.\n\n    The management of patients with multiple larger adenomas (Spigelman stage III or greater) is challenging, and should be centralized in expert centers. The recurrence rate of adenoma development after endoscopic treatment is high (>50%), and treatment is associated with a high complication rate (perforation, hemorrhage, and pancreatitis). Because it is not feasible to remove all adenomas, the usual approach is to remove only large adenomas (>1 cm) or adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, with the aim of delaying/avoiding surgery. In Spigelman IV cases, surgery is often necessary, including duodenotomy with polypectomy, pancreas-sparing duodenectomy, and duodenal-pancreatectomy.\n\n    Given the increased risk for thyroid cancer, there is expert consensus that thyroid palpation and/or annual cervical ultrasonography should be performed, starting at the age of 25-30 years.\n\n    The development of DT is mainly related to a positive family history, abdominal surgery, and the site of the mutation, and can occur inside the abdomen or in the abdominal wall. DT can be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The options for treatment include pharmacological treatment (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and/or antiestrogens), chemotherapy, surgical excision, or radiotherapy. The evidence for the efficacy of these treatments is poor and is based on small studies. However, because of the high recurrence rate of DT, surgical resection of intra-abdominal tumors should be delayed unless complications appear. Experts recommend as the first line of treatment in patients with large or growing DT sulindac with tamoxifen, and when patients with intra-abdominal tumors do not respond to this treatment, chemotherapy or radiation is indicated. Abdominal wall DT and mesenteric DT should be considered differently. For the treatment for abdominal wall DT, surgery is usually used as a first-line treatment. However, for mesenteric DT, the optimal management strategy should be individualized, taking into consideration the extent of disease, morbidity, and potential benefit versus risk of the different treatment modalities.\n\n    The incidence of other less common extraintestinal malignancies (pancreatic, brain, adrenal, among others) is so low that the use of additional costly imaging studies is not currently recommended. However, surveillance tests should be considered in patients with a strong family history of any of these specific extraintestinal manifestations and in those presenting with symptoms that could be attributed to these tumors.\n\n    Chemoprevention using NSAIDs has been proposed in FAP patients. The first drug that was shown to be effective in FAP was sulindac. Long-term use of this drug reduced the number of colorectal adenomas by >50% in the colon as well as in the rectum of patients after colectomy, but not in duodenal polyposis. However, sulindac does not prevent the development of adenomas in FAP. Selective COX-2 inhibitor (cyclooxygenase-2) celecoxib, associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than sulindac, was found to reduce the number of colorectal adenomas by 28%, and also reduced the number of duodenal adenomas. However, cardiovascular effects (myocardial infarction or stroke) have been described in long-term users of another selective COX-2 inhibitor (rofecoxib), and therefore the role of these drugs remain controversial, and should be considered only in selected patients without cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n    Although NSAIDs (sulindac, celecoxib) do not replace surgical treatment for colonic FAP, they may play a role in postponing surgery in patients with colonic polyposis or patients with rectal polyposis after colectomy. Regarding duodenal polyposis, the use of celecoxib might be justifiable for patients with severe duodenal polyposis (Spigelman stage III or IV), because the endoscopic and surgical treatment options in such cases are associated with significant complications. Though celecoxib is registered for the treatment of FAP in several countries, some specialists are reluctant to prescribe it because of the cardiovascular effects, and hence this drug is rarely used.\n\n    MAP (OMIM #608456) is an autosomal-recessive inherited disorder caused by biallelic germline mutations in the MUTYH gene. It was first described in 2002 by Al-Tassan et al in a British family with three affected members and recessive inheritance of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma. Patients with MAP show a great variability in clinical features, but usually present with an attenuated polyposis phenotype, showing fewer than 100 adenomas. Some patients develop extracolonic manifestations indistinguishable from that of FAP patients.\n\n    The MUTYH gene is located on chromosome 1p34.3-1p32.1, and contains 16 exons that encode a 535 aminoacid protein (Figure 1B). The MUTYH gene encodes a member of the base excision repair (BER) system. This system is composed of three enzymes (MUTYH, OGG1, and MTH1) that contribute to protect cells against the mutagenic effects of aerobic metabolism, specifically the oxidation of a guanine, leading to the formation of 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG). MUTYH acts together with MTH1 and OGG1 to prevent somatic mutations induced by 8-oxoG and its high affinity for adenine (A) instead of cytosine. Specifically, MUTYH is responsible for the removal of adenines mispaired with 8-oxoG. In the absence of a functional copy of MUTYH due to biallelic mutations, when an oxo-G:A mismatch is present in the DNA template, a G:C to T:A transversion occurs in the subsequent round of replication. For this reason, somatic G:C to T:A transversions in genes such as APC or KRAS frequently occur in MUTYH-associated adenomas and tumors. One such transversion in the KRAS gene (c.34G>T in codon 12) is frequently encountered (64%) in patients with MAP CRC. Therefore, the analysis of somatic KRAS has been recommended as a pre-screening test to identify CRC patients eligible for MUTYH germline molecular genetic testing. Since MAP patients can present with conventional adenomas as well as serrated polyps (hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas), the existence of two distinct pathways has been suggested, one leading to conventional adenomas with APC and/or KRAS mutations, and one separate non-APC route leading to hyperplastic polyps and sessile serrated adenomas with KRAS mutations.\n\n    More than 300 unique sequence variants have been identified in this gene, including more than 80 pathogenic mutations (http://www.lovd.nl/mutyh). The majority of them are missense substitutions followed by a minority of splice site or truncation mutations. Although infrequent, gross genomic deletions, frameshift, and nonsense mutations have also been reported. Mutations have been described in almost all exons (except exons 1 and 2). The predominance of missense mutations is based mainly on the two hotspot mutations, p.Y179C (c.536A>G;p.Tyr179Cys, previously known as p.Y165C) in exon 7 and p.G396D (c.1187G>A;p. Gly396Asp, previously known as p.G382D) in exon 13, that represent around 70%-80% of all mutations in populations of European origin (Table 4).\n\n    An increasing number of publications on MUTYH have unraveled the ethnic and geographic differences in the mutation frequency of this gene. As mentioned earlier, among European populations, the two missense mutations p.Y179C and p.G396D are by far the most common disease-causing variants. Moreover, different variants have a larger role in other populations, pointing to ethnic and geographic differences, such as p.Y104X in Pakistani patients and p.E480X in Indian patients. Other specific mutations have been reported in the Japanese and Southern Europe populations (Table 4).\n\n    Several studies have examined the frequency of the two common missense mutations (p.Y179C and p.G396D), and approximately 1%-2% of the general population (of European origin) is predicted to be a carrier.\n\n    The clinical spectrum of MUTYH germline mutations is heterogeneous and can include a wide range of phenotypes (Table 1).\n\n    Most biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers have between ten and a few hundred polyps, and very few patients develop more than 500 polyps. Biallelic mutations were initially identified in nearly one-third of cases with APC-negative AFAP with more than 15 adenomas and in about 10% of cases with APC-negative classical FAP, especially in those cases where there is an evident recessive pattern of inheritance. A recent study found biallelic MUTYH mutations in 2/119 (2%, 95% CI 0.2%-6%) patients with >1,000 adenomas, 94/1,338 (7%, 95% CI 6%-8%) patients with 100-999 adenomas, 233/3,253 (7%, 95% CI 6%-8%) patients with 20-99 adenomas, and 37/970 (4%, 95% CI 3%-5%) patients with 10-19 adenomas.\n\n    Serrated polyps and adenomas are a common finding in patients with MAP. A minority of MAP patients fulfill the WHO criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome (defined when a patient fulfills at least one of the following criteria: 1) at least five serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon, two of which are greater than 10 mm in diameter; 2) any number of serrated polyps occurring proximal to the sigmoid colon in an individual who has a first-degree relative with serrated polyposis; and 3) more than 20 serrated polyps of any size distributed throughout the colon), usually in the setting of a synchronous adenomatous polyposis. In a recent study centered on patients diagnosed with at least ten polyps of any histology (including adenomatous and serrated polyps), 6.7% (27/405) patients were found to be MUTYH biallelic carriers.\n\n    In population-based CRC studies, where patients were recruited on the basis of the diagnosis of CRC, biallelic MUTYH mutations were found in 0.3%-2.0% of the population. In several population-based studies, up to a third of proven biallelic MUTYH mutation carriers did not have a polyposis phenotype. Accordingly, biallelic MUTYH mutations are not always associated with a polyposis phenotype; therefore, biallelic MUTYH mutations should be considered also in early onset CRC patients (<=50 years old), especially if the Lynch syndrome has been ruled out. However, atypical phenotypes have been described. In a recent study that analyzed the MUTYH gene in 85 cases with suspected Lynch syndrome with tumors showing mismatch repair deficiency without detectable germline mutation, one biallelic (p.Y179C) carrier was identified that developed CRC, urothelial carcinoma, and a sebaceous gland carcinoma. In this particular patient, sequencing of the tumor revealed two somatic mutations in the mismatch repair system, thus explaining the phenotype.\n\n    The risk of CRC in individuals with monoallelic (heterozygous) mutations has been the focus of an intense debate. Several meta-analyses have been performed, with ORs (odds ratios) or RRs (relative ratios) between 1.11 and 1.27, most of them showing no statistical differences. The most recent systematic review has shown that monoallelic mutation carrier frequency was greater for cases ascertained due to a family history (3.3%) than for controls (1.4%; P=0.02), suggesting that monoallelic carriers with a family history of CRC may be at a greater risk.\n\n    Since oxidative stress is present in different tissues, it can be expected that a defective MUTYH gene leads to neoplasms in other organs. Vogt et al recently described the spectrum of extracolonic features of a large cohort of MAP patients (276 patients with MAP). In this study, duodenal polyposis occurs in 17% of cases with a lifetime risk of duodenal cancer of 4% and a 38% lifetime risk of any extraintestinal cancer. The incidence of extraintestinal malignancies among cases was almost twice that of the general population with a significant increase in the incidence of ovarian, bladder, and skin cancers and a trend of increased risk of breast cancer. The median age at diagnosis for the different extraintestinal malignancies varied between 51 and 61 years.\n\n    Other manifestations also seen in FAP patients have been reported in a small number of MAP patients: gastric FGP, lipomas, CHRPE, epidermoid cyst, DT, and thyroid carcinoma. Overall, the incidence of FAP-related manifestations in MAP patients is lower than in FAP patients.\n\n    As in the APC gene, genotype-phenotype associations have been described for the common MUTYH mutations. Some studies have observed that in accordance with the functionality assays that show a greater reduction in MUTYH glycosylase activity for p.Y179C as compared to p.G396D, patients with biallelic Y179C mutations are associated with a more aggressive phenotype (ie, earlier onset and a greater number of polyps) compared to biallelic G396D mutations. A recent study reported that the p.G396D variant is associated with the development of serrated polyps in MAP patients.\n\n    Biallelic MUTYH mutations should be suspected in patients with an attenuated form of adenomatous polyposis or classical FAP with a recessive pattern of inheritance. It should also be considered in CRC patients diagnosed before the age of 50 years, and in patients with multiple colonic polyps (>10, including both adenomatous and serrated ones) (Table 1).\n\n    Once an individual is found to carry biallelic MUTYH mutations, presymptomatic testing can be offered to first-degree relatives, especially to siblings, who have a 25% risk of carrying biallelic mutations. The risk of MAP in the children of MAP patients depends on the status of their reproductive partner.\n\n    Germline analysis usually comprises the two most common mutations (p.G396D and p.Y179C). Full-gene sequencing is recommended in: 1) individuals who are found to carry one of the two common mutations; 2) individuals whose ethnic ancestry is not Caucasian; and 3) individuals with Caucasian ancestry with a suggestive clinical presentation and a family history found to be negative for the common mutations. Since large deletions or duplications have been exceptionally reported in the MUTYH gene, there is no need for applying methods to analyze these mutations.\n\n    The suggested surveillance protocol for MAP patients is similar to that for patients with AFAP (Table 2). Individuals should undergo total colonoscopy every 2 years, starting at age 18-20 years and continuing lifelong. Colorectal polyps management is similar to that proposed for patients with AFAP. Because of the usual attenuated phenotype, in some patients it is possible to remove these polyps endoscopically. If surgery is required, decisions should be made as in AFAP.\n\n    Upper endoscopy starting at age of 25-30 years is recommended, following the same strategy described for AFAP. There is no evidence of the usefulness of any chemopreventive measure in this condition.\n\n    Currently, there is no evidence that justifies the screening for extraintestinal manifestations in patients with MAP.\n\n    Although still under debate, CRC screening in monoallelic mutation carriers is recommended for first-degree relatives of a patient with sporadic CRC.\n\n    Disclosure\n\n    The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.",

        "Title": "    Whole-genome sequencing expands diagnostic utility and improves clinical management in paediatric medicine",
        "Abstract": "    The standard of care for first-tier clinical investigation of the aetiology of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders is chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) for copy-number variations (CNVs), often followed by gene(s)-specific sequencing searching for smaller insertion-deletions (indels) and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to capture all classes of genetic variation in one experiment; however, the diagnostic yield for mutation detection of WGS compared to CMA, and other tests, needs to be established. In a prospective study we utilised WGS and comprehensive medical annotation to assess 100 patients referred to a paediatric genetics service and compared the diagnostic yield versus standard genetic testing. WGS identified genetic variants meeting clinical diagnostic criteria in 34% of cases, representing a fourfold increase in diagnostic rate over CMA (8%; P value=1.42E-05) alone and more than twofold increase in CMA plus targeted gene sequencing (13%; P value=0.0009). WGS identified all rare clinically significant CNVs that were detected by CMA. In 26 patients, WGS revealed indel and missense mutations presenting in a dominant (63%) or a recessive (37%) manner. We found four subjects with mutations in at least two genes associated with distinct genetic disorders, including two cases harbouring a pathogenic CNV and SNV. When considering medically actionable secondary findings in addition to primary WGS findings, 38% of patients would benefit from genetic counselling. Clinical implementation of WGS as a primary test will provide a higher diagnostic yield than conventional genetic testing and potentially reduce the time required to reach a genetic diagnosis.",
        "Introduction": "    Congenital anomalies are a leading cause of infant mortality, and developmental disabilities have profound adverse effects on children, their families, health care systems and societies. Collectively, children with these disorders comprise 5-10% of the general population and encompass the largest group referred for genetic evaluation. These numbers are significant given that 50-80% of the resources used to manage diseases in full-service paediatric inpatient facilities have a recognised genetic component.\n\n    The ability to provide optimal clinical management for these individuals is dependent on identifying the underlying genetic cause in order to determine prognosis, guide treatment and institute appropriate surveillance and prevention programmes. However, it is often difficult to achieve a definitive genetic diagnosis, for example, in children with developmental delay, autism and/or congenital anomalies because their phenotypic features are often nonspecific and the differential diagnosis can include hundreds of rare genetic disorders.\n\n    The development of chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) revealed that copy-number variation (CNV) is a major aetiology for congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental delay. CMA has now become the first-line diagnostic test for these disorders, achieving greater than a twofold increase in diagnostic yield compared with G-band karyotype analysis. Despite these successes, 80-85% of patients do not reach a diagnosis by CMA. Consequently, physicians often supplement CMA with targeted testing by sequence analysis of known disease-associated genes or gene panels. This hypothesis-driven approach, which relies on the ability to recognise the most likely disorder associated with the presenting symptoms, often fails to reach a diagnosis.\n\n    Recent improvement in cost and accuracy of whole-exome sequencing (WES) has made it feasible to investigate all known coding genes for sequence-level mutations. Current estimates show clinical WES provides a diagnostic yield of ~25% for patients affected with neurological disorders and/or congenital anomalies. Although larger clinically relevant CNVs may be detected through WES, the lack of sensitivity and reliability to detect smaller CNVs (<100 kb) and insertion-deletions (indels), as well as complex structural variations (SVs) has precluded its implementation as a single clinical test able to capture all potential disease-causing genetic variants. As such, sequential testing using CMA, WES or targeted gene-based testing often occurs.\n\n    Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to identify nearly all forms of genetic variation. Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of WGS for mutation detection and WGS analyses of paediatric populations has shown identification of clinically relevant variants in ~40% of those with autism and ~60% of those with intellectual disability. These observations indicate that WGS is poised to have tremendous impact for paediatric patients where CMA is currently a standard first-line diagnostic evaluation. However, challenges such as cost, processing, clinical interpretation and storage of vast amounts of data exist and evidence is required to demonstrate the diagnostic utility of WGS. Here we performed WGS on 100 consecutive children referred for CMA by clinical geneticists and examined the diagnostic yield of WGS compared with conventional molecular testing.",
        "Methods": "    We developed a workflow to recruit patients and test the diagnostic utility of WGS in the routine clinical care of children and their families (Figure 1). Patients were recruited in a prospective manner from the Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics at Hospital for Sick Children over a 9-month period (September 2013 to May 2014). Patients and their parents were eligible to participate in the study if the patient met standard clinical criteria for CMA analysis. This included children with two or more structural malformations (major or minor); or unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability with or without additional clinical features. We also required both parents be available for testing and due to the complexity of the tests, that both parents were fluent in English. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children and informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n    We used PhenoTips (www.phenotips.org) to capture and record phenotypic data after thorough examination by a clinical geneticist. PhenoTips is an open source software program for collecting and analysing phenotypic information for patients with genetic disorders. The software combines an easy-to-use web browser interface with a standardized database back end. Phenotypic information is collected and represented using the Human Phenotype Ontology. Collected data include demographics, medical history, family history, physical and laboratory measurements, physical findings, and additional notes. Importantly, phenotypic data for each patient were accessible in a standardized format by laboratory geneticists and clinical geneticists performing variant interpretation.\n\n    All cases underwent chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) using the 4x180 K Cytosure ISCA v2 oligonucleotide microarray platform (Oxford Gene Technology, Oxford, UK) as part of diagnostic service in the CLIA certified laboratory at The Hospital for Sick Children. Microarray experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, DNA from the proband and pooled same-sex reference DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were labelled with Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP, respectively, and were hybridised to the array slide. The arrays were then scanned using the Agilent G2505B microarray scanner and resulting data analysed using the CytoSure Interpret Software version 3.4.3 from Oxford Gene Technology (Begbroke, Oxfordshire, UK). CNVs on chromosome Y were removed from the analysis. Identified CNVs were classified according to ACMG guidelines and pathogenic and variant-of-unknown-significance:likely pathogenic were considered as clinically significant.\n\n    Genomic DNA was sent to Complete Genomics (Mountain View, CA, USA) for WGS as described previously. Raw sequence reads were reassembled against a reference genome (GRCh37) and variant calling was completed using Complete Genomics assembly pipeline 2.4 as previously described. This method generates a fragment of ~400 bp that is covered by a set of 8 reads totalling 70 bp sequenced. All samples passed internal Complete Genomics sample checks. Sequence results were received on hard drives and consisted of raw data plus variant calls in the form of (i) SNV and small indels, (ii) structural variants (based on abnormal junction and discordant mate-pair clusters, with size typically 50-75,000 bp), (iii) CNVs (based on normalised sequencing coverage, with size typically >2,000 bp).\n\n    Complete Genomics (Mountain View, CA, USA) masterVar files were annotated using a custom pipeline based on Annovar, RefSeq gene models (downloaded from UCSC 2013 February 12), and publicly available as well as internal databases for allele frequency (1000 Genomes, NHLBI-ESP, ExAC browser (Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), Cambridge, MA, USA (URL: http://exac.broadinstitute.org) January 2015), Internal Complete Genomics control databases public genomes and Wellderly population, genomic conservation (UCSC PhyloP and phastCons for placental mammals and 100 vertebrates) and variant impact predictors (SIFT, PolyPhen2, Mutation Assessor, CADD). We also expanded the annotation of non-coding regulatory sequence through implementation of splicing exon inclusion/exclusion predictions. Finally we annotated variants with those reported previously in disease (ClinVar, HGMD) and genes reported to have abnormal mouse and human phenotype association, MGI (http://www.informatics.jax.org/). Data set and software versions are listed in the Supplementary Information.\n\n    We developed a pipeline to systematically prioritise clinically significant variants (see Supplementary Figure 1). We first defined a list of high quality, rare variants (<5% population frequency) that were exonic (genes or ncRNA) or predicted to impact splicing. To aid in prioritisation variants were categorized into ordered tiers based on: (i) sequence quality; (ii) allele frequency; (iii) conservation and predicted impact on coding and non-coding sequence; and (iv) human disease and mouse abnormal phenotype association. Variants were further sorted based on: (v) their zygosity and gene mode of inheritance; and (vi) HGMD and ClinVar pathogenicity classification, reflecting implication in human genetic disorders documented in the literature (see Supplementary Information for detailed definitions). The ACMG recommendations for clinical interpretation of sequence variants were used to classify variants as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Candidate diagnostic variants were selected based on their likely pathogenicity and explanatory power. Variants deemed diagnostic by both the assessment team and the referring physician were confirmed in the proband, and followed up in parental samples by Sanger sequencing.\n\n    The pipeline described above allowed for the identification of clinically relevant variants not related to the primary indication. The analysis was the same as for primary variants except that we focused on variants with the highest predicted impact ('LoF', criterion iii) and those reported to be pathogenic by HGMD or ClinVar (criterion vi). This included UTR, intronic and intergenic variants, for which impact prediction is more difficult. Finally we limited reporting of secondary variants to the 56 genes named in the 2013 ACMG guidelines on return of incidental findings.\n\n    Analysts (molecular or clinical geneticists) examined variant files and prioritized clinically relevant variants using sequence quality, allele frequency, conservation and predicted impact on coding and non-coding sequence, presence in Clinvar or HGMD, zygosity and genic mode of inheritance, and relevance to clinical phenotype provided. Candidate pathogenic variants that were interpreted to be clinically relevant to the primary or secondary phenotype were discussed with the referring clinician and designated diagnostic by consensus.\n\n    Variants that were deemed to be potentially diagnostic after consultation with the clinician were confirmed with Sanger sequencing in a CLIA/CAP laboratory and a clinical report was generated. Sanger sequencing attempted for 58 variants, of which 51 of high quality (tier 2 analytic quality) had 100% confirmation rate. Parents and siblings were tested to confirm segregation for the reported pathogenic changes, or rule variants out if they did not segregate.\n\n    CNVs from Complete Genomics are detected through both read depth and paired-end sequencing and provided in cnvSegmentsDiploidBeta and highConfidenceSVEventsBeta files, respectively. The read depth method is based on deviation from a diploid baseline reference genome and uses 2 kb, GC-corrected windows with a hidden Markov model caller. The paired-end method by Complete Genomics employs junction detections on uniquely mapped discordant mate-pairs and can detect CNVs below 2 kb. CNVs were extracted from the cnvSegmentsDiploidBeta by parsing out segments not equal to diploid of 2 and by excluding the hypervariable regions. From the highConfidenceSVEventsBeta file we only extracted deletions and tandem duplications supported by at least 20 mate-pair reads based on previous sensitivity and specificity calculations). CNVs from Chromosome Y were removed. We annotated and analysed the CNV and SV files separately. Copy number gains and losses from WGS were annotated for frequency based on 50% reciprocal overlap with CNVs called in WGS control samples, and overlap with CNVs from the Database of Genomic Variants (November 2010 and March 2013 versions); CNVs were also annotated for overlapping gene transcripts and exons (RefSeq, downloaded March 2013). Rare CNVs from either file were examined in the context of case phenotype and classified using standard criteria.\n\n    The advantage of WGS over CMA for detecting CNVs is the ability to detect small CNVs, offer precise breakpoint resolution, determine the location and orientation of duplicated sequences, and find allele specific copy-number changes. Although WGS detects a significantly larger number of unbalanced changes compared to CMA, one of the most important questions regarding replacement of CMA with WGS in the diagnostic setting is that of accuracy. Our previous work has shown high reproducibility of CNV detection using the WGS read depth method (94%) with lower reproducibility with the paired-end method (73%). As the CNV generated from the WGS read depth method is more comparable to CMA in terms of the size detection range we determined the concordance for these methods. Previous studies and our own experience have shown that CMA lacks specificity and sensitivity in polymorphic regions overlapping with segmental duplications and affect CNV concordance between different platforms. To minimise these, we excluded CNVs showing at least 70% overlap with segmental duplications or having a frequency of least 3% in either data set. These criteria yielded 165 rare CNVs from the CMA, with 84% detected by the read depth method of WGS. Further analysis of the 26 CNVs not detected by WGS showed that the majority were in regions overlapped by segmental duplications and were labelled as 'hypervariable' in the WGS data. Importantly, none of these variants were identified as being clinically relevant. We examined the breakpoint concordance by comparing the difference between the CMA proximal and distal breakpoint (within probe error) to the WGS. Breakpoint analyses of the 139 concordant CNVs showed ~78% fall between the minimum and maximum boundaries of breakpoints defined by the clinical microarray, and 87% are within 10 kb of these boundaries (Supplementary Figure 9).\n\n    We compared the diagnostic yield of WGS to both CMA and CMA combined with targeted gene testing. Statistical differences were calculated using a chi 2 proportion test.\n\n    Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on the npj Genomic Medicine website (http://www.nature.com/npjgenmed)\n\n    SB, DJS, PNR and MSM are scientific advisors for Gene42, which provides support services for the free (open source) PhenoTips software.

        "Results": "    We recruited 100 consecutive paediatric patients (57% males) <18 years of age (mean 5.5 years; Supplementary Table 1) who met criteria for CMA, and WGS was offered in parallel with clinical CMA testing. These 100 cases came from 201 families that were approached (95 declining participation and 6 undecided). Eight percent of families reported consanguinity. Of those families that enroled, 26% opted out of receiving information about secondary findings related to medically actionable adult onset disorders. Patients displayed a wide array of symptoms described by 453 unique HPO terms across the cohort, with 57% having at least one term associated with developmental delay (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). The most commonly observed phenotypes were abnormalities of the nervous system (77%), skeletal system (68%), growth (44%), eye (34%), cardiovascular (32%) and musculature (27%; Supplementary Table 3). Aside from CMA, an average of two additional genetic diagnostic tests were ordered at the time of WGS analysis (Range 1-13 tests; Supplementary Table 4).\n\n    WGS yielded an average depth coverage of 51.8x with 99% of the mapped sequence at >10-fold representation (Supplementary Table 5). Different WGS technologies will vary in the number of variants identified. The WGS platform used in this study generated a total of 3.3 to 4.3 million high-quality variants per sample. On average, WGS identified >3.5 million SNVs, 248 CNVs using read depth method and 1,604 structural variations (tandem duplications and deletions) using abnormal junction and discordant mate-pair clusters (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Filtering for coding variants, we detected an average of 20,014 exonic and splicing variants per individual. As expected, CNVs identified by read depth (median size 10 kb) were larger than the SVs detected by split read or mate-pair mapping (median size 495 bp). Approximately 28% of the CNVs and 2.0% of the SVs impacted gene coding exons. WGS data are deposited in the European Genome-phenome Archive (www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/) under accession number EGAS00001001623.\n\n    We developed a pipeline to prioritise WGS variants (SNVs and Indels) of clinical significance, interrogating on average 498 rare damaging events per genome parsed into categories based on mode of inheritance (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure 1). Rare CNVs and SVs were analysed for pathogenicity according to established methods and candidates were discussed with the referring clinician to assess whether the variant(s) were pathogenic or related to the phenotype and therefore considered to be clinically relevant.\n\n    Overall, we identified and returned 38 variants that were related to the primary indication providing a molecular diagnosis for 34 individuals (34%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 25-44%) (Table 1). Of the positive diagnoses, 8 (8%) individuals harboured a pathogenic CNV (Table 2), whereas 28 (28%) carried sequence-level variants that were diagnostic (Table 3). The majority of sequence-level variants were autosomal dominant (63%) compared to recessive (37%) with no X-linked forms found. All pathogenic CNVs detected by WGS were confirmed with CMA and all diagnostic sequence-level variants were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. The diagnostic rate for those with developmental delay was higher than average 38.6% (22/57) and was lowest (15.3%) in those presenting with connective tissue disorders (Supplementary Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 5). Combining CNVs and SNVs, we confirmed de novo disease-causing variants in 15% of this case cohort.\n\n    We observed that 4% of cases had pathogenic variants at two distinct disease loci leading to a composite phenotype. This is likely an underestimate given that in several patients the diagnostic findings only explained part of the clinical features (see patients (1006, 1040, 1062, 1070, 1090 in Tables 2 and 3). Interestingly, two of our patients harboured a pathogenic CNV and SNV (1066 and 1102 in Table 2). For several cases, the genomic diagnosis impacted clinical management and the identification of at-risk relatives (see Table 3 and Supplementary Table 8 for patient case examples).\n\n    Although our focus was the investigation of the diagnostic yield of WGS for the primary presenting clinical symptoms, we also examined the 56 genes listed in the 2013 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published guidelines for incidental findings and identified 7 variants as potentially medically actionable and appropriate for return (Table 4). Three of these seven patients (1027, 1040, and 1078) also had primary diagnostic variants.\n\n    An important consideration in the evaluation of WGS as a clinical test is the sensitivity in detecting clinically relevant CNVs. We examined the characteristics of CNVs detected by WGS and CMA (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figure 7). CMA identified an average of six CNVs per patient including nine pathogenic CNVs in eight individuals (ranging in size from 337 kb to 92 Mb). All of the reported pathogenic changes were detected by WGS (Table 2). We evaluated concordance of the results obtained from the clinical microarray analysis with CNVs obtained from the WGS. CMA detected a total of 578 variants, of which 52% were detected by WGS consistent with published findings.\n\n    The WGS data afforded several advantages over CMA for CNV detection. First, the resolution of WGS is greater than CMA, typically detecting >1,500 unbalanced changes that cannot be found using CMA. The majority of these are small and intergenic but many impact exons and may therefore be medically relevant. Although we did not find a plausible diagnosis from one of the variants beyond the resolution of CMA, we did detect carriers with clinically relevant exonic deletions in genes associated with autosomal recessive disorders (e.g., deletion of exons 7-8 of CLN3; neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-3; Supplementary Table 9). An additional advantage of WGS is demonstrated by using paired-end sequencing to obtain breakpoint resolution and allele specific CNVs. For example, both the WGS read depth and CMA detected a 300-kb duplication of uncertain significance (VUS) at 9p24.3 in one patient, but split read mapping revealed it to be a 503,479-bp tandem duplication on one allele overlapping a 235,071-bp deletion on the other allele (data not shown).\n\n    The total diagnostic rate from standard testing (CMA plus targeted gene sequencing) was less than half of WGS (13% vs. 34%; P value=0.0009; Table 1). Of the targeted sequence tests ordered, 17 cases were negative for a diagnosis found through WGS, including 11 panel tests, highlighting the limitation of using a hypothesis-driven approach for this cohort. In the majority of these cases, the causative gene was not included in the panel testing; however, in one case, clinical panel testing failed to detect a large 25-bp pathogenic indel in CBL that was detected through WGS (Supplementary Figure 6 and Case 1050 in Supplementary Table 8). In two cases, targeted genetic tests led to a clinical diagnosis that could not be detected by WGS in the current study design, including microsatellite analysis of parents and offspring for UPD14 (heterodisomy) and a methylation test for Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Here we provide data that show WGS exceeds other technology platforms in ability to detect genetic variants involved in childhood disease. Specifically, in our design we achieved a diagnostic yield of 34% when testing an unselected paediatric population that was undergoing CMA as the current standard first-tier genetic test followed by traditional gene/panel testing protocols. These results indicate WGS provides a fourfold increase in molecular diagnosis over CMA alone (8%) and a greater than twofold increase when all genetic testing protocols (>10 tests in some cases) are considered (13%).\n\n    The cohort we investigated was clinically heterogeneous with ~57% presenting with developmental delay as a primary clinical feature. Consistent with previous data, the majority (63%) of our sequence-level diagnoses were autosomal dominant. Combining CNVs and SNVs, just under half (14/34) of the diagnoses were de novo mutations giving a minimum overall spontaneous mutation rate of 14%. For autosomal recessive transmission, we confirmed molecular diagnoses from compound heterozygous variants in only 2/100 patients, which is less than reported previously and may be reflective of our study design in only sequencing the proband. The majority of our AR diagnoses arose from homozygous variants from consanguineous unions (reported in 8% of cases in this cohort). Similar to other studies, 4% of cases had more than one locus involved, contributing to a complex phenotype including two individuals with a pathogenic CNV and SNV. In an additional five cases, a pathogenic variant was found that only accounted for part of the phenotype, indicating that upwards of 9% of individuals in this cohort may have more than one genetic disorder (see Tables 2 and 3).\n\n    Our results demonstrate that the increased diagnostic utility of WGS can have a significant impact on clinical care and management that goes beyond genetic counselling (Tables 2 and 3). Specifically, the rapid diagnosis of mutations in the CBL gene in patient 1050 has important implications for the surveillance of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, which is critical for patient management and survival. In the case of patient 1049, the clinical phenotype was suggestive of a connective tissue disorder with additional features suggestive of NF1. However, WGS revealed a diagnosis of Sotos syndrome, which subsequently changed clinical management of the patient as the disease trajectory and requirements for surveillance are inherently different for this disorder. Similarly, detection and confirmation of mutations in genes such as PIK3R1, EXT2, PIK3R2, NGLY1, KAT6B and COL4A1 provides indications for monitoring of disease-specific secondary complications that ultimately lead to improvement of the patients' quality of life, and at times can have a critical impact on survival.\n\n    One of the current challenges facing health care providers is determining the most effective utilisation of CMA versus sequencing gene panels versus WES in patients with developmental disorders and/or congenital anomalies. A recent study using a comprehensive genotype-driven approach in children with developmental delay achieved a diagnostic yield of 31% using WES and CMA. The physicians in our study ordered an average of three genetic tests (CMA plus two targeted genetic tests) per patient guided by clinical features, which yielded a diagnostic rate half of that achieved by WGS. Importantly, hypothesis-free WGS significantly outperformed targeted testing of candidate genes in our cohort: in 17/22 cases, the diagnostic sequence-level variant found by WGS was not in a gene targeted by hypothesis-driven testing. The number of prior genetic investigations for the illustrative cases (Supplementary Table 8) ranged between three and six tests at a total cost of $3,325-5,280 and would be largely representative of this type of cohort seen at our hospital. Estimates of others have shown even higher costs of negative testing ($19,100) in similar cohorts and have demonstrated the cost of using genomic sequencing to be ~$3,000 per individual. Although full economic evaluations are required, our data align with previous studies where WGS enabled the use of a single diagnostic test in a heterogeneous clinical cohort. In turn, this approach is likely to reduce the number of genetic investigations and potentially the time to diagnosis, ultimately acting as a more cost effective approach.\n\n    Although our study design was prospective, there are several factors that may have influenced our estimation of the diagnostic yield of WGS. The diagnostic laboratory at The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, ON, Canada) receives ~600 CMA requests from clinical genetics per year and typically achieves a diagnostic yield of 12% (95% CI 9.6-14.9%). The yield of CMA in the current study was slightly lower (8%) than typically observed, but was similar in those individuals that were approached and declined WGS. For the 101 families who were approached and declined participation there were two predominant reasons. First, ~35% of families were uncomfortable with secondary findings as it pertains to obtaining life or employment insurance as Canada does not currently have a nondiscrimination law. Second, 35% of individuals declined since they felt overwhelmed with the current medical complexity of their child with most of these patients stemming from the NICU population. Although there is a chance that our cohort had an ascertainment bias, enrolment demographics indicate that this cohort is typical of those submitted for CMA through clinical genetics over the same timeframe.\n\n    One of the unique aspects in our study was the direct interaction with the referring clinician to adjudicate whether prioritised variants were medically relevant. This type of iterative genotype-phenotype comparison is valuable in the interpretation of a genome but is not amenable to large-scale implementation of WGS diagnostic testing that would be done at a reference laboratory. However, the phenotypic description submitted by the referring physician via PhenoTips (www.phenotips.org) was sufficient to confidently identify the clinically significant variants in the vast majority of diagnoses, without the need for further consultation with the physician. We estimate that approximately two diagnostic variants benefited from direct clinician consultation after the genomic data were analysed.\n\n    In addition, our design did not allow the prioritisation of de novo variants since we did not perform WGS on parents. WES-based studies have shown that the diagnostic yield is higher using a trio design. Similarly, although WGS allows the detection of large stretches of homozygosity due to uniparental isodisomy, we would need parental genotypes to detect heterodisomy (e.g., UPD14 in case 1068). Moreover, our analysis was restricted mainly to exonic variants due to the inability to clinically interpret the majority of intronic and intergenic variants. The impact of common risk variants will also need to be considered as methods for complex statistical modelling improve. Finally, we did not detect any pathogenic CNVs beyond the resolution of CMA that led to a diagnosis in our cohort, but did find some individuals to be carriers of deletions affecting genes associated with autosomal recessive disorders (Supplementary Table 9).\n\n    Genetics have long been known to have a major role in child health. McCandless et al.  found that, taken together, rare genetic variants and common genetic factors significantly contributed to the illnesses of 71% of hospitalised children. However, our ability to achieve molecular diagnoses for children with genetic disorders has historically been quite limited. Our results indicate that WGS can now be deployed advantageously as a first-tier molecular test in those individuals with developmental delay and/or congenital abnormalities, as we identified medically actionable diagnostic variants and secondary variants in 38% of children undergoing clinical CMA, and achieved a diagnosis in one-third of the children. As comparison datasets increase in size and methods for annotating the vast non-genic segment (99%) of the genome improve, so will the utility of WGS in diagnosis, management and surveillance of paediatric genetic conditions.",

        "Title": "    Differential pattern of RP1 mutations in retinitis pigmentosa",
        "Abstract": "    Retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1) is a major gene responsible for both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). We have previously identified three disease-causing mutations out of 174 RP patients. In this study, we investigated a new cohort of Chinese RP patients to further evaluate the contribution of RP1 mutations to cause RP.\n\n    A group of 55 nonsyndromic RP patients, the majority of them isolated cases or without information on family history, were screened for mutations in the entire coding sequences of RP1, using direct DNA sequencing. All detected variants were genotyped in 190 controls, while the three putative mutations were additionally genotyped in 362 controls subjects. Web-based programs, including PolyPhen, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT), Prediction of Pathological Mutations (PMUT), Single Amino Acid Polymorphism Disease-Association Predictor (SAP), ScanProsite, and ClustalW2, were used to predict the potential functional and structural impacts of the missense variants on RP1.\n\n    A total of 14 sequence changes were identified. Among them, five were novel and found only in the RP patients. Two missense variants (p.K1370E and p.R1652L), which are conserved in primates, were predicted to have functional and structural impacts on the RP1 protein. The other three variants (c.787+34T>C, p.I408L and p.L2015L) were considered benign.\n\n    If these two novel missense variants are in fact pathogenic, then RP1 mutations account for approximately 2.18% (5/229) of RP cases in our Chinese cohort; this is similar to other ethnic groups. However, a relatively higher frequency of missense mutations found in the Chinese patients may suggest an ethnic diversity in the RP1 mutation patterns.",
        "Introduction": "    Retinitis pigmentosa (RP; OMIM 268000; Mendelian Inheritance in Man; National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) refers to a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal dystrophies characterized by night blindness and progressive loss of visual field due to the degeneration of rod photoreceptors in the retina. In the late stage, the central vision will be affected, resulting in irreversible blindness. Prevalence of RP is between 1/4,000 and 1/6,000 in western countries. Among Chinese, the prevalence was 1/3,784 in a dispersed region of China. In the Peking eye study, the estimated prevalence was as high as 1/1,000 among people aged over 40 in northern China.\n\n    RP can present as autosomal recessive (arRP, 10%-45%), autosomal dominant (adRP, 10%-30%), or X-linked (xlRP, 0%-15%). Around 35%-50% of RP cases have been denoted as simplex RP (sRP) because of the absence of known family history of RP or segregation pattern. More than 40 genes have been identified to cause RP, of which 20, 26, and two genes were responsible for adRP, arRP, and xlRP, respectively (RetNet, the Retinal Information Network, provided in the public domain by the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center, Houston, TX, accessed March 7, 2010). The RP1 locus was mapped by linkage testing in a large adRP family in southeastern Kentucky. The gene subsequently linked to adRP was named retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1, OMIM 603937). Later studies revealed that mutations in RP1 cause both dominant and recessive forms of RP. Most RP1 mutations are single nucleotide substitutions that produce a premature stop codon or insertion/deletion changes, resulting in a truncated protein in Caucasian populations. These mutations were predicted to truncate the RP1 protein by approximately 50% to 70% of the full length. Only a few missense variants, such as p.T373I, p.K663N, p.A669T, p.D984G, and p.L1808P, have been found to be disease causing. RP1 is expressed prominently, if not only, in the photoreceptor cells of the retina and is involved in the correct orientation and higher order stacking of outer segment discs. RP1 is a microtubule-associated protein forming part of the photoreceptor axoneme and thus plays an important role in photoreceptor function.\n\n    We previously evaluated the mutation profiles of RP1 in Chinese RP patients by studying unrelated RP patients with mixed phenotypes. We found that RP1 mutations (p.R677X and p.D984G) accounted for about 1.2% of overall RP, apparently lower than that in other populations. Recently, we identified two truncation mutations causing arRP in a Chinese family. In this study, we screened for additional RP patients and control subjects to complement the mutation profile of RP1 in Chinese patients.",
        "Methods": "    All study subjects recruited were of Chinese ethnicity and were given complete ocular examinations, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography, and fundus photography. Diagnosis of nonsyndromic RP was based on ophthalmic investigations and absence of systemic signs associated with syndromic RP. Subjects were confirmed to be free of any other major eye diseases, except mild senile cataract in some elderly subjects. In total, 55 unrelated RP patients were recruited, including 32 females and 23 males, with ages ranging from 19 to 84 years. Inheritance patterns of the disease were defined according to the family history of the subjects. In some cases, however, there was no information about the family structure for heredity classification. The control subjects were all unrelated, older than 60 years, and had no family history of RP from which 190 of them (53 males and 137 females) were from Hong Kong and had been described in our previous studies. We also added another 362 controls for validation of the putative mutations: 35 subjects from Hong Kong (11 males and 24 females, age range 70 to 90 years), 180 from Beijing in northern China (88 males and 92 females, age range 60 to 89 years), and 147 from Shantou in southern China (53 males and 94 females, age range 63 to 96 years). All controls received routine follow-up and complete ophthalmic examination to ensure that they remained free of RP or other major eye diseases except mild senile cataract. Written informed consents were obtained from all study subjects after explanation of the nature of the study. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the respective review board on human subject research at each participating academic institution. Peripheral venous whole blood, 5 ml, was collected from each patient in EDTA tubes and stored at -80  C before genetic analysis.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using a commercial kit (QIAamp DNA Blood kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief the frozen whole blood samples were thawed and blood cells lysed in QIAGEN Protease and Buffer AL in the kit. The DNA was obtained by precipitation. Twenty-six amplicons covering all three coding exons and the exon-intron boundaries of RP1, as previously described, were amplified in all patients and the 190 Hong Kong controls by PCR and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing using dye-termination chemistry (Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit; ver. 3.1; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) on a DNA sequencer (3130XL; Applied Biosystems), according to the supplier's protocol. The DNA sequences were compared with the human RP1 (ENSG00000104237) sequence in the Ensembl database. Any rare variants detected were double confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. The novel putative mutations were further genotyped in the additional 362 control subjects.\n\n    We defined a variant as \"novel\" if it had not been reported in the literature or registered in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) database (provided in the public domain by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). A variant was regarded as potentially disease causing if it was (1) expected to alter the amino acid sequence of the protein, (2) exclusively observed in patients with RP, while completely absent from the control subjects, and (3) predicted to alter the protein structure or function through in silico analysis.\n\n    For the common RP1 sequence variants with minor allele frequency >5% detected in both patients and controls, genotype frequencies were compared between the two groups in a dominant genetic model using the chi2 test in SPSS (ver.15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A Bonferroni method was used to correct the p values in multiple comparisons. For the rare missense variants detected exclusively in the RP patients, we used four web-based programs to evaluate possible biologic effects of the amino acid substitution on the structure and function of the RP1 protein, including (1) Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen provided by the Bork Group and the Sunyaev Lab, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), (2) Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT, provided in the public domain by the J. Craig Venter Institute, Rockville, MD), (3) Prediction of Pathological Mutations (PMUT, provided by the Molecular Recognition and Bioinformatics Group, Institute for Research in Biomedicine-Barcelona Science Park and University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain), and (4) the Single Amino Acid Polymorphism Disease-Association Predictor (SAP disease-association predictor, provided by the Sapred Team, Center for Bioinformatics, Peking University, Beijing, China). Possible alterations of protein motifs and functional sites were assessed by scanning through the PROSITE database (ScanProsite, provided by the Swiss-Prot group, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland). We further examined evolutionary conservation of the amino acid residues in these variants by multiple sequence alignment using the ClustalW2 program (provided by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK).",
        "Results": "    Based on family information, the 55 nonsyndromic RP patients presented with mixed inheritance patterns, with five (9.09%) being classified as adRP, five (9.09%) as arRP, two (3.6%) as xlRP, and 23 (41.8%) as sRP. The remaining 20 patients had an unknown inheritance pattern due to the lack of familial data.\n\n    A total of 14 RP1 variants were identified (Table 1). Among them, six (p.R872H, p.N985Y, p.A1670T, p.S1691P, p.Q1725Q, and p.C2033Y) were common SNPs registered in the SNP database. These six SNPs were found at high frequencies among the control subjects. Association analyses showed that none of them was significantly associated with RP (pcorr>0.05). Therefore, they were not considered disease-causing mutations.\n\n    We also identified eight rare variants, three of which (p.G706R, p.Q1008Q, and c.6542C>T) occurred in both the case and control subjects. The remaining five were novel and not detected in the 552 control subjects from different areas of China. Two of them (p.L2015L and intronic c.787+34T>C) did not lead to amino acid change, while the other three (p.I408L, p.K1370E, and p.R1652L) were missense changes.\n\n    The impact of variant p.I408L was predicted to be \"Borderline\" by PolyPhen, \"Tolerated\" by SIFT, and \"Neutral\" by PMUT, with a maximum reliability index of 9 (Table 2). The Grantham score was 5. Based on these assessments, p.I408L is less likely to be a disease-causing mutation. The variant p.K1370E was predicted as \"Potentially damaging\" and \"Potentially Intolerant\" by PolyPhen and SIFT, respectively. Although predicted to be \"Pathological\" by PMUT (reliability index of 0). The Grantham score for this substitution was 56, being moderately conservative. Therefore, p.K1370E is potentially disease causing. For the p.R1652L variant, the predictions were \"Possibly damaging\" by PolyPhen, \"Potentially Intolerant\" by SIFT, and \"Pathological\" (reliability index of 7) by PMUT. With a Grantham score of 102, p.R1652L should be moderately radical and highly likely to be a functional mutation. PROSITE scanning showed that no structural or functional domain was present at or around these two residues. However, the variant p.R1652L was predicted to abolish one possible protein kinase C phosphorylation site on the RP1 protein (Table 3). Determination of the evolutionary conservation of p.K1370E and p.R1652L by multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the human RP1 with the protein sequences derived from chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, dog, horse, murine, and cattle showed that both residues 1370 and 1652 in RP1 were conserved among the primates (Figure 1).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In the present study, we sequenced the RP1 gene in 55 newly recruited Chinese RP patients and identified five novel variants, providing new information about the variation pattern of the gene. Of the five variants, three missense variants were exclusively found in RP patients and absent in the 552 control subjects. Therefore, they are considered excellent candidate disease-causing mutations. Unfortunately, as the family members of these three patients did not provide consent to join our study, we were not able to perform segregation analysis for the putative mutations. We therefore used in silico analysis to provide some insights into their impacts. The three programs, i.e., PolyPhen, SIFT, and the Grantham score, are frequently used algorithms in the prediction of the functionality of missense SNPs. However, their predictions may sometimes be inconsistent, although strong concordances have been observed. We therefore applied the PMUT program to provide additional assessment. By using these tools we would expect that p.I408L is less likely to be a functional mutation (Table 2), although a segregation study would be of great interest to confirm its role. This variant occurred in a patient with adRP. Ocular and electroretinography examinations revealed a typical sign of RP (data not shown). By mutational analyses of rhodopsin (RHO, OMIM 180380), photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (NR2E3, OMIM 604485), and neural retina leucine zipper (NRL, OMIM 162080), we did not find any variants in this subject (data not shown). Therefore, the adRP in this patient is likely to be caused by another yet-to-be-identified mutation. In contrast, the variant p.R1652L was likely to be a deleterious substitution with consistent predictions by PolyPhen, SIFT, PMUT, and Grantham score. Variant p.K1370E was also predicted to be deleterious by the four programs, although with a lower reliability index (Table 2). Meanwhile p.R1652 and p.K1370 were conserved among primates (Figure 1). They are located in the region of the RP1 polypeptide where many mutations occur. Furthermore, p.R1652L was predicted to abolish one possible protein kinase C phosphorylation site on the protein (Table 3). Protein phosphorylation is an important posttranslational modification process that can alter the conformation and thus function and localization of the protein. The predicted abolishment of the phosphorylation site can affect the normal functioning of RP1. As a whole, our results are consistent for pathologic roles of p.R1652L and p.K1370E in RP. The patients with these postulated mutations had typical clinical presentations of RP (Figure 2), although the clinical presentations appear less severe than the truncation mutation carrier. Notably, the p.R1652L and p.K1370E carriers were classified as sRP because their parents did not have the disease. Thus, these two variants could be de novo mutations causing adRP or could cause arRP in a digenic pattern co-dominantly with another yet-to-identify mutation, which is worth further investigation.\n\n    In our previous studies, we identified two RP1 mutations, p.R677X and p.D984G, in two out of 173 Hong Kong Chinese RP patients. Recently we identified two truncation mutations (c.5_6delGT and c.4941_4942insT) causing arRP in a Chinese pedigree. Combining these findings with the two missense mutations detected in the current study, the total contribution of RP1 mutations is approximately 2.18% (5/229, 95% confidence interval 0.93%-5.0%) in our Chinese cohort. So far, studies evaluating the RP1 in other Chinese RP cohorts are limited. Recently, Sheng et al. identified the p.N985Y variant as the disease-causing mutation for adRP, being co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree and absent in 105 controls. Interestingly, the p.N985Y variant was found to be very common in our study cohort, presenting in 14.2% (27/190) of control subjects. We do not know whether the pedigree is of Han Chinese ethnicity due to the lack of data in the Sheng et al. report. We would expect, however, that ethnic diversity of the RP1 mutation pattern also exists within Chinese populations. In the study of Sheng et al., another three missense variants (p.P63I, p.G79E, and p.P903L) were also found to occur at high frequencies and exclusively in the patient group, although the disease-causative properties remained inconclusive. In contrast, no truncation mutation was found in their cohort. In light of their findings and ours, missense RP1 mutations may be playing a prominent role in the genetic epidemiology of RP in Chinese populations. Further studies in other Chinese cohorts with a larger sample size are warranted to confirm this.\n\n    To date, at least 41 RP1 mutations that are causative for RP have been reported, most of which are truncation mutations. It is noteworthy that, at least one-half of the known missense mutations occur in Chinese RP patients (Table 4), while only three out of 33 (9%) known truncations have been identified in all the published Chinese RP1 mutations (Figure 3). In contrast, most known truncation mutations were detected in other populations, with the most frequent mutation, p.R677X, presenting in approximately 3% of adRP patients in the United States; it has also presented at relatively high frequencies in the UK and Italian populations. Hence, there are distinctly differential RP1 mutation patterns existing, if not globally, at least between the Chinese and Caucasian populations.\n\n    So far, most confirmed pathologic mutations in RP1 among different populations are nonsense or frameshift mutations located in exon 4. These mutant transcripts are predicted to be insensitive to the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, leading to the production of truncated proteins lacking one-half to two-thirds of the C-terminal portion. As it has been suggested that haploinsufficiency of RP1 is not causative for RP, these truncated proteins may exert their role in the pathogenesis of RP through a dominant negative effect. Likewise, the missense mutations may also play a role in RP etiology through a similar mechanism, which has yet to be elucidated by functional assays.\n\n    In summary, we have identified two novel missense mutations (p.R1652L and p.K1370E). These mutations were predicted to have functional impacts on RP1 and are likely to be pathogenic. In light of these findings along with the findings of our previous studies, both RP1 truncation and missense mutations may contribute to the etiology of RP, accounting for approximately 2.18% of RP cases in our Chinese cohort, similar to other populations. Nevertheless, the Chinese population has a disproportionally high frequency of missense mutations, providing further insights into the ethnic diversity of the genetic epidemiology of RP.",

        "Title": "    DNA repair genes are selectively mutated in diffuse large B cell lymphomas",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations in DNA damage response and repair genes correlate with genomic instability in diffuse large B cell lymphomas.\n\n    DNA repair mechanisms are fundamental for B cell development, which relies on the somatic diversification of the immunoglobulin genes by V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation, and class switch recombination. Their failure is postulated to promote genomic instability and malignant transformation in B cells. By performing targeted sequencing of 73 key DNA repair genes in 29 B cell lymphoma samples, somatic and germline mutations were identified in various DNA repair pathways, mainly in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Mutations in mismatch repair genes (EXO1, MSH2, and MSH6) were associated with microsatellite instability, increased number of somatic insertions/deletions, and altered mutation signatures in tumors. Somatic mutations in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes (DCLRE1C/ARTEMIS, PRKDC/DNA-PKcs, XRCC5/KU80, and XRCC6/KU70) were identified in four DLBCL tumors and cytogenetic analyses revealed that translocations involving the immunoglobulin-heavy chain locus occurred exclusively in NHEJ-mutated samples. The novel mutation targets, CHEK2 and PARP1, were further screened in expanded DLBCL cohorts, and somatic as well as novel and rare germline mutations were identified in 8 and 5% of analyzed tumors, respectively. By correlating defects in a subset of DNA damage response and repair genes with genomic instability events in tumors, we propose that these genes play a role in DLBCL lymphomagenesis.",
        "Introduction": "    Normal lymphocyte development and function relies on the successful rearrangement and modification of antigen receptor genes. Diversity of the B cell receptor is largely provided by V(D)J recombination where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments of the immunoglobulin (IG) loci are joined in a combinatorial manner. After antigen experience, the IG loci are further modified by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). The recombination-activating proteins 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2) introduce double-strand breaks (DSBs) at recombination signal sequences located around the V, D, and J genes during V(D)J recombination, whereas activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates SHM and CSR by deaminating cytosines to uracils at the V and switch (S) regions of the IG loci.\n\n    A myriad of DNA damage response (DDR) and repair proteins mediate and regulate IG diversification processes. AID activity provokes guanosine/uracil mismatches that are processed by proteins of the base-excision repair (BER) pathway (UNG, APEX1) and mismatch repair (MMR) pathway (MSH2/MSH6, MLH1/PMS2, and EXO1). While in the context of CSR such mismatches lead to the generation of DNA DSBs, during SHM, AID activity preferentially results in the establishment of point mutations, although small duplications and deletions may also occur. The resolution of DSBs in V(D)J recombination and CSR is primarily mediated by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway that becomes activated by DDR proteins such as ATM and Nibrin (NBN). The x-ray repair cross-complementing proteins 4 (XRCC4), XRCC5 (Ku80), and XRCC6 (Ku70) and DNA ligase 4, Artemis, DNA-PKcs, and Cernunnos (XLF) proteins are considered to be the core members of NHEJ.\n\n    Most B cell neoplasms are thought to originate from antigen-experienced B cells, as tumor cells display SHM at the IG V genes. Furthermore, a role for IG diversification mechanisms in the propagation of genomic instability in mature B cell lymphomas is supported by numerous observations. Non-IG genes, including proto-oncogenes such as MYC, BCL6, PIM1, RHOH, or PAX5 are often targeted by SHM, especially in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), one of the most common and aggressive mature B cell lymphoma subtypes. Chromosomal translocations involving the IG loci, with breakpoints in S regions and SHM targets, are also a hallmark of mature B cell lymphomas. Furthermore, AID has been shown to be essential for the occurrence of c-myc/IgH translocations and oncogene-driven induction of germinal center-derived lymphomas in mice. Of note, the t(14;18) translocation, involving the IGH and the BCL2 loci, characteristic of follicular lymphomas (FLs), is considered to be derived from defective V(D)J recombination processes.\n\n    Despite the crucial role of DDR and repair proteins during antibody diversification processes, there is lack of evidence that supports their direct involvement in the propagation of genomic instability in human B cell lymphomas. In contrast, individuals with biallelic germline mutations in some of the DNA repair genes that encode proteins involved in IG diversification processes often display an increased risk for development of lymphoid malignancies in addition to immunodeficiency. In this study, we systematically analyzed the coding regions of key DDR and repair genes that have been associated, or could potentially be associated, with IG gene diversification processes in a set of mature B cell lymphomas, with a focus on DLBCL. The defects in a subset of DDR and repair genes identified here, and their association with genomic instability phenotypes, support their role in the tumorigenesis of DLBCL.",
        "Methods": "    DNA was extracted from 29 mature B cell lymphoma frozen biopsies and the respective paired blood samples, collected at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China), to undergo targeted next-generation sequencing of DNA repair genes. This collection included 22 DLBCL, of which 19 were primary and 3 relapsed (derived from different patients), 5 primary FL, and 2 primary BL, all derived from Chinese patients. None of the patients underwent chemotherapy before biopsy collection, except for the relapsed cases where patients had been treated with R-CHOP. The median age of the DLBCL patients at diagnosis was 65 yr, and the cohort comprised 13 females and 9 males. Seven DLBCL samples were classified as germinal center B cell-like (GCB), whereas 15 DLBCL samples were classified as non-GCB, according to the Hans algorithm. The tumor content of the DLBCL tumors was estimated to be at least 80% in all cases by histological evaluation. DNA was also extracted from frozen biopsies from an additional 250 DLBCL, collected in biobanks at Uppsala's University Hospital (171 DLBCL from Swedish patients) and Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center (79 DLBCL from Chinese patients) for cohort expansion studies. 10 additional paired blood samples were available for the extended cohort of Chinese DLBCL. Furthermore, DNA isolated from the peripheral blood from 67 Chinese DLBCL patients and 429 Chinese and 1,030 Swedish blood donors was used for assessing population frequencies of a selected set of genetic variants. DNA processed by Selector technology and SOLiD sequencing was isolated by the DNeasy Tissue and Blood kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA from subsets of samples composing the expanded cohort was extracted by different methodologies. RNA was extracted from 61 DLBCL cases and 8 normal lymph nodes with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The institutional review boards at the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center and Uppsala University approved the study.\n\n    58 genomic DNAs were enriched for the coding regions of 73 DNA repair genes, as well as TNFAIP3, a known DLBCL tumor suppressor (Table S1). The Selector method (an earlier version of the current HaloPlex from Agilent) was applied in the enrichment step. It makes use of biotin-labeled Selector probes designed to contain two sequences complementary to both ends of a DNA target. Upon hybridization, probe binding induces circularization of target sequences that can be amplified selectively. 800 ng of genomic DNA was fragmented through a combination of eight different restriction enzymatic reactions (100 ng of DNA each). After probe hybridization and circularization of the target sequences, this complex was separated from nontarget DNA by making use of streptavidin magnetic beads. After ligation of the circularized DNA molecules, specific amplification of the target sequences was achieved by a multiple displacement amplification reaction performed by a Phi29 DNA polymerase (TempliPhi; GE Healthcare).\n\n    To amplify the 1,158 exons that constituted the ROI, two different Selector designs were attempted. Target nucleotides were covered by more than one selector probe to minimize the risk of hybridization failure provoked by nucleotide variations. In design 1, each targeted base was covered on average by 2.2 selector amplicons, whereas design 2 produced shorter fragments and allowed targeted bases to be covered on average by 3.3 selector amplicons (Table S2). Noncovered sequences in the ROI were mostly composed of repeat regions as identified by the RepeatMasker database (http://www.repeatmasker.org). In design 2, repetitive sequences were further avoided to improve sequencing efficiency at the cost of a slight reduction in the coverage of the ROI (Table S2). Five DLBCL and respective normal pairs were enriched by design 1, and the remaining samples were enriched by design 2. Success of enrichment of target sequences was monitored by quantitative PCR to measure the relative levels of several on- and off-target amplicons.\n\n    300 ng of each enrichment product was fragmented using the Covaris S2 system, after which the standard library construction kit for SOLiD v3 (Applied Biosystems), for design 1, and SOLiD v4, for design 2, were used to barcode and prepare the samples for sequencing. Barcoded samples were pooled and sequenced at the Uppsala Genome Center (Uppsala, Sweden). Samples from design 1 were sequenced in two separate runs, each making use of a quarter of a sequencing slide, whereas samples derived from design 2 were sequenced on three quarters of sequencing slide. The SOLiD libraries from 16 samples from design 2 were further sequenced in an additional run to increase coverage and depth. A HapMap sample NA19240 was subjected to the same enrichment (design 1) and sequencing procedures to evaluate the method's specificity and reproducibility. Design of selector probes and sequence library preparation were performed at Halo Genomics (Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n    SOLiD short reads were aligned with MosaikAligner version 1.1.0018; -hs 15, -mm 6, -ms 6, -mhp 100, and -act 20 (Mosaik; The MarthLab) against the human reference genome (hg18). Alignments from samples that were sequenced twice were merged using MosaikMerge. The combined alignments were then exported to SAM/BAM format and reanalyzed by in-house software to deal with artificial insertions/deletions provoked by \"forced\" alignments. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) detection were performed with SNPmania (in-house software). Somatic alterations were determined by comparing the MAF between tumor and normal at specific base positions. A minimum of 10 and 5 reads in either normal and tumor samples was required as well as the representation of the minor allele by at least 5% of the reads in the tumor sample. Additionally, variant detection against the human reference genome (hg18) was also performed by flagging base positions in which the reference allele was represented at a frequency of 0-0.8 in positions covered by at least 10 reads. To maximize mutation discovery, SOLiD short reads were also aligned to the hg18 reference using BFAST. SAMtools was used to extract base counts for each position. Allelic imbalance events were detected by comparing the allelic ratios at germline heterozygous single nucleotide variants between tumor and normal samples. The presence of allelic imbalance at a gene had to be supported by at least two heterozygous positions where the allelic ratios diverged significantly from the heterozygous state. Fischer's exact test was used for the comparison of single nucleotide positions between tumor and normal samples. Functional prediction of missense mutations was performed in silico with SIFT and Polyphen-2. Visual inspection of reads at relevant base positions was performed with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) software. SNP concordance analysis for the HapMap sample NA19240 was performed with the Genome Analysis Toolkit.\n\n    Validation of variants discovered by next-generation sequencing, and sequencing of the CHEK2, MSH2, and PARP1 genes in the cohort expansion studies, were performed by Sanger sequencing. Specific primers were designed with Primer 3 (http://fokker.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). PCR reactions were run in a total volume of 25 microl containing 1 U GoTaq polymerase (Promega), 0.4 microM of forward and reverse primers, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 microM dNTPs, and 10 ng DNA. PCR products were purified and sequenced at Macrogen Inc. or Eurofins MWG Operon.\n\n    Screening of DCLRE1C, DDB1, MLH3, XRCC4, and XRCC5 in an expanded cohort was performed by means of amplicon deep sequencing. Microfluidic PCR reactions were run in a 48 x 48 Access array system (Fluidigm) with FastStart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific primers containing universal tails (CS1 and CS2) were designed to produce amplicons between 300 and 350 bp at the coding regions of the genes of interest. Molecularly barcoded 454 FLX Titanium (Roche) sequencing primers (Lib-A emPCR kit design), containing sequences complementary to the CS1 and CS2 primer tails, were added to the Access array together with 50 ng of each DNA sample (48 in total) so that all amplicons derived from the same DNA sample shared the same barcode. Indexed libraries were recovered for each sample in a single well of the Access array and analyzed with Agilent's 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Thereafter, samples were pooled and purified by gel extraction. After emulsion, PCR (Lib-A) samples were sequenced by the GS FLX+ System in a full PicoTiter Plate at Macrogen Inc. Analysis was performed with the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer and potential variants validated by Sanger sequencing.\n\n    A proportion of the germline variants discovered by next-generation sequencing, together with all of the CHEK2 variants, were genotyped in Swedish and Chinese control samples using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Sequenom Inc.) as previously described. PCR assays and associated extension reactions were designed using the MassArray assay design 3.1 software (Sequenom Inc.). Primers were acquired from Metabion GmbH (Planegg-Martinsried). The extension products were analyzed by the MassArray Compact MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Sequenom Inc.). The MassARRAY Typer 4.0 software (Sequenom Inc.) was used to analyze the resulting mass spectra for peak identification. Two independent scorers confirmed all genotypes. For the c.1100delC, p.H371Y and p.D438Y CHEK2 variants control typing was performed with Sanger sequencing because of the inability to produce a specific assay for MALDI-TOF. As the population-specific MAFs determined by typing were highly concordant with the ones derived from the 1000 Genomes (http://www.1000genomes.org/) sequencing data, the latter were subsequently used for determining the MAFs of all germline variants discovered by next generation sequencing. MAFs were extracted from 1000 Genomes with the aid of VCFtools.\n\n    Polymorphic sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were used to determine the zygosity status of the EXO1, MDC1, PARP1, RPA1, and TP53BP1 loci. STS markers and respective primer sequences were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) or the Ensembl genome browser (http://www.ensembl.org/) and, when necessary, primers were redesigned with Primer 3. The mononucleotide microsatellite markers BAT-25 and BAT-26 and the dinucleotide markers D2S123 and D10S197 were used for the detection of MSI. Forward primers were fluorescently labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) at their 5'-end and purified by HPLC. PCR reactions were run in a total of 15 microl, containing 0.5 U GoTaqDNA polymerase (Promega), 0.66 microM of each primer, 330 microM dNTPs, 10 ng DNA, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. PCR products were diluted appropriately and mixed in a formamide solution containing GeneScan 500 LIZ Size Standard (Applied Biosystems). Thereafter, samples were loaded in a 48-capillary 3730 DNA Analyzer and analyzed with Peak Scanner software version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems). For the MSH2-mutated samples, MSI testing was also performed using a commercial kit (Microsatellite Instability Multiplex System kit; Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, genomic DNA prepared from tumor tissue was amplified by PCR in a multiplex PCR, amplifying the selected microsatellite markers. Microsatellite analysis was performed using an ABI3500xl (Applied Biosystems) with the GeneMapper 4.1 software (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    The relative expression of the EXO1, MDC1, PARP1, RPA1, and TP53BP1 genes was assessed by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Furthermore, the expression levels of the housekeeping genes ACTB, GAPDH, and HRPT1 were determined to perform inter-sample normalization. Intron-spanning assays were designed with Primer 3. RNAs were processed with the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare) and 10-microl reactions were prepared with the KAPA SYBR FAST ABI Prism qPCR reagent (Kapa Biosystems). Samples and standard curves were run in duplicate in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Analysis was performed with the 7500 System SDS Software, version 1.4 (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    Exome sequencing was performed in 19 DLBCL tumors, including 17 tumors that underwent targeted sequencing of DNA repair genes and 2 additional tumors that displayed MSI. In brief, genomic DNA was processed into fragments between 150 and 200 bp and Illumina sequencing adapters were ligated to both ends of the resulting fragments. The adapter-ligated templates were purified by AgencourtAMPure SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) and fragments with insert size of ~200 bp were excised. Extracted DNA was amplified by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR), purified, and hybridized to the SureSelectBiotinylated RNA Library (BAITS; Agilent Technologies) for enrichment. Hybridized fragments were bound to streptavidin beads, whereas nonhybridized fragments were washed out after 24 h of incubation. Captured LM-PCR products were then subjected to the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) to estimate the magnitude of enrichment. Each captured library was loaded on a Hiseq2000 platform (Illumina), and high-throughput sequencing was performed for each captured library independently to ensure that each sample met the desired mean fold coverage (>50x). Raw image files were processed by base calling software (1.7; Illumina) for base calling with default parameters and the sequences of each individual were generated as 90-bp paired-end reads. During bioinformatic analysis, the adapter sequences in the raw data were removed, and low-quality reads were discarded. Sequences were aligned to the genome with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) from which BAM files were obtained. Somatic indels were detected with GATK, whereas SNVs were detected using Varscan. All variants underwent visual inspection. Sequencing and data analysis was performed at BGI (Shenzhen, China).\n\n    Vysis LSI IGH/BCL2 dual-color, dual-fusion translocation probe, Vysis LSI BCL6 dual-color, break-apart rearrangement probe, Vysis LSI MYC dual-color, break-apart rearrangement probe, and Vysis LSI IGH break-apart rearrangement probe were purchased from Abbott Molecular Inc. Sample processing and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction and, as described previously,. Slides were counterstained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and fluorescent images were sequentially captured with a Cohu 4900 charge-coupled device camera coupled to an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss).\n\n    Statistical tests and graph construction was performed with Prism (version 4.00; GraphPad Software).\n\n    Table S1 shows the genes sequenced by Selector and SOLiD. Table S2 summarizes the Selector capture and SOLiD sequencing performances. Table S3 shows all somatic and germline (novel and rare) mutations identified by Selector/SOLiD sequencing. Fig. S1 summarizes the SNV detection process from the Selector/SOLiD sequencing data. Online supplemental material is available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20122842/DC1.",
        "Results": "    73 DDR and repair genes (from this point forward referred to as DNA repair genes), belonging to the DDR, BER, nucleotide excision repair (NER), MMR, NHEJ, Fanconi anemia (FA), and homologous recombination (HR) pathways (Table S1), were selectively sequenced in 29 mature B cell lymphomas, including 22 DLBCLs, 5 FLs, 2 Burkitt lymphomas (BLs), and their respective paired blood samples. As a positive control, the TNFAIP3 gene, encoding a known tumor suppressor (A20) in DLBCL, was also analyzed in these samples. Target enrichment was accomplished by the Selector technology and samples were sequenced with the SOLiD platform. More than 106 SOLiD short-reads were generated per sample with >90% of reads being specific for the defined regions of interest (ROI; Table S2). Mean sequencing depth was >200x, with >84 and 90% of the ROI being covered by at least 10 and 5 SOLiD sequencing reads, respectively (Table S2). Validation of the sequencing procedure and variant calling methods were performed by processing a HapMap sample (NA19240) in parallel with the clinical samples. A concordance of 99.6% was achieved in the 499 heterozygous positions covered by our Selector design in the HapMap sample.\n\n    To detect germline as well as somatic mutations, sequences from both normal and tumor samples were compared with the human genome reference (hg18), and subsequently, minor allele frequencies (MAFs) at heterozygous positions were compared between tumor and normal pairs. Filtering of known polymorphisms was performed against dbSNP132 and variant novelty verified with dbSNP137. By combining both analysis and removing overlapping results, 442 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified across all samples. Approximately half of these variants passed visual inspection, which allowed the elimination of false positive results derived from library preparation, sequencing, and/or alignment artifacts (Fig. S1). Such artifacts were normally located toward the end of the sequencing reads or were variants supported by identical sequencing reads. 124 heterozygous SNVs resulted in nonsynonymous amino acid changes that included novel germline and somatic mutations as well as rare germline variants with an MAF below 0.01 (Fig. S1). All novel germline and somatic mutations and rare variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and are presented in Table S3. Detection of indels proved to be difficult, and an alternative alignment of SOLiD short-reads was produced with BFAST that allowed the identification of four somatic deletions in four different genes across three independent tumors. All nonsynonymous somatic mutations were detected exclusively in DLBCL cases (Table S3). No somatic mutations were found in FL and BL samples despite comparable sequencing performances.\n\n    19 somatic mutations were discovered by SOLiD sequencing, distributed in 10 DLBCL tumors (Table 1 and Table S3). These were more frequent in DDR factors, including the classical tumor suppressor genes ATM and TP53, and the CHEK2 and PARP1 genes that are novel mutation targets in DLBCL. Recurrent alterations in MMR genes (EXO1, MSH2, and MSH6) and members of the NHEJ pathway (DCLRE1C/ARTEMIS, PRKDC/DNA-PKcs, XRCC5/KU80, and XRCC6/KU70) were also observed (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Additionally, two somatic mutations were found in BRCA2 (HR pathway) and one mutation in the DDB1 (NER pathway) and TNFAIP3 genes (Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, and as observed for CHEK2 and PARP1, nonsynonymous somatic mutations in DCLRE1C, EXO1, and XRCC5 have not been previously reported in DLBCL. The somatic mutations discovered in the DCLRE1C, PARP1, XRCC6, and TNFAIP3 genes were frameshift deletions, whereas the remaining somatic mutations led to amino acid substitutions (Table 1). The SIFT and Polyphen-2 prediction tools provided a discordant functional prediction for five missense mutations (Table 1), which may be due to the use of different algorithms and sequence alignments.\n\n    Based on the percentage of sequencing reads, the majority of somatic mutations were considered to be present in dominant tumor cell clones, except for the ones targeting ATM and EXO1 which were represented by <20% of sequencing reads (Table 1). The low percentage of sequencing reads that supported the deletions at the DCLRE1C and PARP1 genes probably resulted from the problematic alignment of SOLiD reads with deletions of five or more nucleotides. Nevertheless, these deletions were readily validated by Sanger sequencing and are likely to be present in dominant tumor cell clones in a heterozygous state.\n\n    The mean frequency of nonsynonymous, somatic mutations in DNA repair genes was 4.16 mutations/Mb of target sequence (protein coding). To compare the mutation frequencies in DNA repair genes with the ones found in the entire coding genome (exome), we performed exome sequencing in 17 out of the 22 DLBCL cases that underwent Selector/SOLiD sequencing. Although biases could arise from the use of different techniques, the somatic mutations in DNA repair genes discovered by exome sequencing largely overlapped with the ones detected by Selector/SOLiD and translated into a mutation frequency of 4.21 mutations/Mb. This frequency was similar to the ones determined for the entire coding genome (3.15 mutations/Mb, 20,930 genes) and for specific groups of genes such as kinases (3.71 mutations/Mb, 507 genes) or transcription factor genes (3.44 mutations/Mb, 1,645 genes). Of note, the latter gene groups encompass frequent mutation targets in DLBCL such as PIM1 (kinase) or BCL6 and TP53 (transcription factors). After excluding mutations in the classical tumor suppressor TP53, the somatic mutation frequency in DNA repair genes detected by exome was reduced (3.01 mutations/Mb) but remained comparable to the ones derived from the entire coding genome and other gene groups.\n\n    19 mature B cell lymphoma patients carried novel nonsynonymous germline mutations in different DNA repair genes (Table S3). These were more frequent in members of the MMR pathway (Fig. 1). Three mutations were identified in the MSH3 gene, whereas two mutations were detected in the MLH3 gene in four DLBCL patients (Table S3). Furthermore, nonsynonymous germline mutations in MSH6, PMS1, and PMS2 were also identified in DLBCL patients, whereas one FL patient carried a novel mutation in MSH2. Although somatic mutations were rare in HR and FA proteins, several germline mutations were identified in these pathways. Alterations in genes functionally related to the DDR pathway were also common. One DLBCL and two FL patients carried novel germline mutations in the MDC1 gene that encodes a core DDR protein. 21 rare variants (with MAF < 0.01) were identified in 17 mature B cell lymphoma patients. Of note, four patients (three DLBCL and one FL) carried rare nonsynonymous substitutions in the gene encoding TP53BP1, another essential DDR protein (Table S3).\n\n    Six mutated genes discovered by SOLiD sequencing were selected for further investigation in an extended cohort of DLBCL tumors. These include CHEK2, PARP1, DDB1, and XRCC5, which were novel mutation targets for DLBCL, and MSH2 and MLH3, which were recurrently affected by somatic and/or germline mutations, respectively.\n\n    The CHEK2 gene was Sanger sequenced in a total of 235 DLBCL samples, including the 22 DLBCL samples that underwent targeted SOLiD sequencing. In addition to the p.Q336L somatic mutation and the p.E528K germline variant, identified by SOLiD, 11 novel mutations and previously reported rare variants were detected, distributed in 17 tumors that did not undergo SOLID sequencing (Table 2). The novel mutations identified in CHEK2 included a somatic frameshift insertion (p.D293X), a splice-site mutation (c.319+2T>A), and a missense mutation (p.I364T) located in the kinase domain of CHEK2 (Table 2). Five rare variants, including p.E528K, were specific for the patient cohort, as they were not identified in large groups of controls (Table 2). Of these, the c.444+1G>A splice site mutation has been previously reported to lead to aberrant splicing of CHEK2 transcripts, whereas the p.R117G and p.D438Y substitutions were shown to have deleterious effects on the function of CHEK2. Four other rare variants were found in both tumor and control samples, including a c.1100delC deletion and a p.I157T substitution (Table 2) that was previously shown to have a damaging effect on protein function. Sequencing of the entire coding regions of the CHEK2 gene was also performed in 90 samples derived from healthy blood donors, where the p.R180C and p.I157T substitutions, previously identified by genotyping, were the only variants found in one and two samples, respectively. Thus, the discovery of novel mutations or certain rare variations was restricted to the DLBCL patient group, further suggesting their association with the disease.\n\n    Sanger sequencing of the PARP1 gene in 130 DLBCL samples, including the tumors that underwent SOLiD sequencing, allowed the discovery of two additional novel nonsynonymous mutations: a STOP-gain mutation located upstream of the catalytic domain of the PARP1 protein (p.K633X) and a p.I919T substitution located in the catalytic domain of PARP1 (Table 3). Two rare variants (p.Y930C and p.L1013M) were also identified in two different tumors. Overall, variations in the PARP1 gene were identified in 5% of samples analyzed.\n\n    The MSH2 gene was also Sanger sequenced in 94 DLBCL tumors, including the samples that underwent SOLiD sequencing. In addition to the two somatic mutations (p.S540G and p.L833V) discovered by the latter approach, another two nonsynonymous variants were found in two tumor samples: a novel missense mutation (p.P439L) and a rare variant (p.I169V; Table 3).\n\n    The screening of DCLRE1C, DDB1, MLH3, and XRCC5 genes in 48 DLBCL samples that did not undergo SOLiD sequencing was performed in a high-throughput manner by combining all PCR reactions in a microfluidic PCR array followed by 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencing. Two novel mutations were identified in the DDB1 gene, in two different tumors, including a frameshift, truncating mutation in DDB1 (Table 3). The MLH3 and XRCC5 genes also presented one novel mutation each in two additional samples (Table 3). Finally, rare missense variants were identified in DCLRE1C, MLH3, and XRCC5 in three tumors, respectively. The MLH3 missense rare variant (p.V741I) was previously shown to segregate with disease in an endometrial cancer family.\n\n    Chromosomal alterations could be detected from the data generated by the targeted deep sequencing of DNA repair genes. For that purpose we compared allelic ratios at germline heterozygous SNVs, between tumor and normal samples. The EXO1 locus was found to be affected by allelic imbalance in six DLBCL tumors, whereas allelic imbalance at the PARP1 and RPA1 loci was detected in three DLBCL samples. The TP53BP1, ERCC6, and ATR genes were affected in two samples each and other loci were affected in single DLBCL samples, including the MDC1 locus.\n\n    The allelic imbalance results obtained from SOLiD sequencing were validated by making use of polymorphic markers located around the EXO1, PARP1, MDC1, and RPA1 loci, and the analysis was extended to a total of 28 DLBCL samples. The majority of results obtained from SOLiD could be confirmed by the employment of polymorphic markers except for one case: EXO1 in DL-40 (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, this approach allowed the identification of additional samples affected by allelic imbalance that were not detected by SOLiD data analysis (Fig. 2 A). This can be explained by the fact that the detection of allelic imbalance by the latter required the presence of at least two germline heterozygous SNVs at different loci, which was not always observed. In total, allelic imbalance at RPA1, EXO1, MDC1, and PARP1 was detected in 25, 21, 18, and 14% of samples, respectively. We subsequently assessed the expression of RPA1, EXO1, MDC1, and PARP1 and found that the expression of the latter was significantly lower in tumors presenting allelic imbalance (Fig. 2 B). This association might reflect the loss of PARP1 copy number in samples with allelic imbalance. No significant differences in terms of gene expression were observed for the other loci, indicating that allelic imbalance did not correlate with gene copy numbers or that the loss of one allele could be compensated at the transcriptional level.\n\n    To investigate whether defects in MMR genes translated into a particular form of genetic instability, MSI analysis was performed in 28 DLBCL cases for which paired normal samples were available, including the 22 DLBCL cases that underwent targeted sequencing. Two mononucleotide (BAT-25 and BAT-26) and two dinucleotide (D10S197 and D2S123) microsatellite markers were used (Fig. 3 A). Instability in one or two markers was detected in five DLBCL samples and was almost exclusively restricted to dinucleotide markers. Notably, all samples that displayed instability of microsatellites possessed at least one alteration in an MMR gene (Fig. 3 B). They included the tumor samples DL-30 and DL-48, where somatic mutations in MSH6, MSH2, and EXO1 genes were discovered by SOLiD sequencing, and one sample (DL-42) derived from a DLBCL patient that carried a novel germline mutation in MSH3. Two additional samples (DL-29 and DL-57) that displayed instability at microsatellites markers did not undergo the current sequencing approach, but have been analyzed by whole-exome sequencing-presented somatic mutations in PMS1 (p.R847K) and MLH1 (p.A223D), respectively. The DLBCL sample with a p.P439L mutation in MSH2 was analyzed with Promega's MSI analysis system due to the lack of paired normal DNA and presented instability of one (NR-21) out of the five mononucleotide markers.\n\n    To investigate whether defects in MMR genes were associated to the mutational load or mutation signatures in DLBCL, whole exome sequencing data were analyzed in the five DLBCL cases in which MSI was detected, in fourteen microsatellite stable (MSS) DLBCL tumors, and in the respective paired blood samples. The total number of somatic mutations detected by exome sequencing was higher in MMR-mutated cases displaying instability of microsatellite markers than in MSS tumors, not reaching but rather close to statistical significance (Mann-Whitney P = 0.05, Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, the number of indels was significantly higher in cases with MSI than in MSS tumors (Mann-Whitney P = 0.02, Fig. 3 D). This observation suggests that MMR defects in these tumors not only translate into MSI in noncoding regions but also in the occurrence of insertions and deletions within protein-coding exons. Notably, three out of the four deletions identified by targeted sequencing of DNA repair genes occurred in MMR-mutated DLBCL samples displaying MSI. We further investigated whether MMR deficiency was associated with different mutation signatures by comparing the type of mutations observed in MMR-mutated cases displaying MSI with the ones in MSS tumors. Although C:G T:A transitions were dominant in both groups (Fig. 3 E), MSI-positive DLBCL tumors were significantly enriched with C:G A:T transversions (Fig. 3 F).\n\n    Somatic mutations in NHEJ genes were detected in 4 out of the 22 DLBCL cases that underwent targeted sequencing of DNA repair genes. We further investigated whether mutations in NHEJ genes were associated with genomic instability affecting the IGH locus. To this end, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with IGH and BCL6 dual-color break-apart probes in 13 DLBCL cases for which tissue sections were available, including 3 NHEJ mutants (DL-43, XRCC5; DL-48, DCLRE1C; DL-53, XRCC6). A split signal affecting one of the IGH loci was detected in 2 out of the 13 DLBCL cases that were investigated by FISH (Fig. 4 A). This abnormality was found in approximately half of the nuclei analyzed in each tumor. Remarkably, the two cases where the IGH locus was rearranged carried somatic mutations in NHEJ genes: DL-43 (XRCC5 mutant) and DL-48 (DCLRE1C mutant). No chromosomal breakage at the IGH locus was detected in the 10 DLBCL samples that contained unmutated NHEJ genes. In spite of the small sample size, the occurrence of IGH translocations was significantly different between NHEJ mutants and nonmutants as determined by Fisher's exact test (P = 0.04). The DL-43 and DL-48 samples also displayed chromosomal breakage at the BCL6 locus (Fig. 4 B) but no rearrangement of IGH together with BCL2 or rearrangement of the MYC locus (Fig. 4, C and D). We therefore concluded that BCL6 was the most likely translocation partner of IGH in these tumors. Disruption of the BCL6 locus, without concurrent rearrangement of the IGH locus, was detected in the microsatellite unstable DLBCL DL-42 that carried a somatic mutation in TP53 and a novel germline mutation in MSH3.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    By performing targeted screening of 73 DNA repair genes in a cohort of mature B cell lymphomas, we discovered somatic alterations in several novel and/or potentially functional important mutation targets in DLBCL, including CHEK2, PARP1, DDB1, and several NHEJ genes (DLRE1C, PRKDC, XRCC5, and XRCC6), as well as MMR genes (MSH2, MSH6, and EXO1). Although the somatic mutation frequency in the 73 DNA repair gene group was not significantly higher than the ones derived from the entire coding genome or from other cancer gene-containing gene sets, such as kinases and transcription factors, altogether, somatic mutations in DNA repair genes affected approximately half of DLBCL cases analyzed. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that mutations in subsets of these genes, especially those belonging to the MMR and NHEJ pathways, indeed associated with different forms of genetic instability in the tumors.\n\n    Mutations in MMR genes were associated with an MSI phenotype in DLBCL, which is a characteristic form of genetic instability in MMR-deficient tumors. Furthermore, these tumors displayed an overall increase of somatic mutations throughout the coding genome and of small insertions and deletions in particular. In the context of B cell development, the MMR system is involved in the mutagenic processing of mismatches introduced by AID during SHM and CSR. Outside the IG locus, the MMR proteins assure a high-fidelity postreplicative DNA repair but also protect the genome from the off-target activity of AID. The distinct roles of the MMR system in SHM and postreplicative repair are largely unknown but might be explained, at least partially, by the involvement of different polymerases during these processes. The MSI and mutator phenotypes of the MMR-mutated DLBCL cases presented here might derive from both postreplicative MMR deficiency and inefficient repair of off-target AID activity. Higher mutation loads in MMR-mutated tumors, as well as the specific increase of small insertions and deletions, have been previously described in human cancers such as colorectal or gastric cancers but never in DLBCL. The increased observation of small insertions and deletions is particularly relevant as a result of the deleterious consequences of these mutations. Similarly, to the best of our knowledge, MSI phenotypes were not previously associated with somatic mutations in MMR in DLBCL. Interestingly, we discovered that C:G A:T transversions were relatively more frequent in MMR-mutated DLBCLs with MSI. The relative increase in C:G A:T transversions, in the context of MMR deficiency, has been previously reported for mutL and mutS E. coli mutants and in Msh2 heterozygous mutant mice exposed to PhIP, a food-borne carcinogen which induces a C:G A:T mutation signature. The fact that MMR defects correlated with characteristic mutagenic signatures supports a role for MMR in DLBCL lymphomagenesis.\n\n    In the current work, translocations affecting the IGH locus were encountered in DLBCL cases that harbored somatic mutations in NHEJ genes. NHEJ defects, in Trp53-deficient mice, strongly predispose to the development of pro-B cell lymphomas that harbor interchromosomal translocations involving the IgH locus. The role of C-NHEJ as a suppressor of interchromosomal translocations might relate to the fact that it preferentially joins DSBs arising within the same chromosome. The joining of interchromosomal breaks is thought to be instead mediated by a microhomology-based alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathway. Somatic defects in C-NHEJ components, which would provide a genetic basis for the occurrence of IG-associated translocations, have been rarely reported in human lymphomas. We previously described a somatic heterozygous mutation in the NHEJ1 gene, encoding the Cernunnos/XLF protein in a DLBCL tumor. This tumor sample presented concurrent translocations of BCL2 and MYC with both IGH alleles, suggesting a relation between an NHEJ defect and the occurrence of IGH-associated genomic instability. We provide here further support for an association between somatic alterations in NHEJ genes (DCLRE1C and XRCC5) and the occurrence of genomic instability events involving the IGH locus.\n\n    The NHEJ pathway, in response to DNA DSB, is highly dependent on general damage response mechanisms. DDR proteins such as ATM, TP53BP1, and NBN are known to cooperate with NHEJ factors during V(D)J recombination and CSR. In the current work, we discovered several novel mutations and rare variants in DDR genes, including CHEK2 and PARP1, which are novel mutation targets in DLBCL. Certain germline variants in CHEK2 are known to confer susceptibility to cancer, particularly of breast and prostate origin, whereas somatic alterations are rarely observed in this gene. CHEK2 is a downstream effector of ATM and responsible for conveying DDR signals to substrates involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis such as the TP53 tumor suppressor and the CDC25 phosphatase family. Therefore, CHEK2 defects might foster the accumulation of DNA damage during lymphomagenesis by impairing cell cycle checkpoints and apoptotic responses. Interestingly, CHEK2 was previously shown to be activated by the DNA-PKcs and to be associated with the XRCC5/Ku80 and XRCC6/Ku70 proteins. Its potential role during the damage response to DNA DSBs during V(D)J recombination and CSR requires further investigation.\n\n    We found the PARP1 gene to be targeted by different mechanisms that included mutations and allelic imbalance. PARP1 is involved the initial phases of DDR by accumulating at sites of damage, inducing chromatin remodeling and attracting DNA repair factors through the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) groups. It has also been suggested to be a component of the A-EJ pathway, particularly during CSR. High PARP1 activity, in response to severe DNA damage, was shown to induce cell death, most likely through energy depletion. The targeting of PARP1 by some DLBCL tumors might, thus, constitute a survival adaptation to high degrees of genomic instability in B cells. The essential role of PARP1 in HR-deficient (BRCA2 deficient) cells has, however, stimulated the development of PARP-targeted therapies. Several clinical trials, which include B cell lymphoma patients, are currently ongoing to test the efficacy of PARP inhibitors as therapeutic agents. The finding that a subset of DLBCL samples presents potentially loss-of-function mutations in PARP1, and/or lower expression levels of this gene supports the stratification of patients before the application of PARP-targeted therapies.\n\n    In addition to somatic mutations, several novel germline mutations were encountered in different DNA repair pathways, and we propose that the affected genes, especially the MMR genes, are good candidates for cancer susceptibility genes in mature B cell lymphomas. Heterozygous carriers of pathogenic mutations in certain MMR genes are strongly predisposed to colorectal but also to a variety of extracolonic neoplasias. Although lymphomas are currently not considered to be part of the Lynch syndrome cancer spectrum, patients with biallelic mutations in certain MMR genes are predisposed to lymphomas and were sometimes shown to carry CSR defects. Additionally, murine models carrying germline inactivation of MMR genes are strongly predisposed to the development of both B and T cell lymphomas. Screening of germline variations in a larger cohort of patients and functional characterization of these variants will be required to support our hypothesis.\n\n    Deregulation of proto-oncogene expression through mutation or translocation of the BCL6, BCL2, or MYC genes, constitutional activation of the NF-kappaB pathway through genetic lesions in TNFAIP3, CARD11, CD79A/B, and MYD88 genes, and epigenetic reprogramming, triggered by mutations in genes such as MLL2, EZH2, MEF2B, and CREBBP, account for some of the most frequent events in DLBCL. These alterations constitute cancer driver events, as they provide tumor cells with constitutive survival and proliferative signals, escape from apoptosis, and gene expression plasticity. Theoretically, as they all result from alterations at the DNA level, they might be a product of inefficient DNA repair mechanisms in combination with an extremely high load of DNA damage in germinal center B cells, derived from high proliferation rates and from SHM and CSR processes. Previous next-generation sequencing studies on DLBCL have not focused on DNA repair genes, possibly because of the rare observation of recurrent mutations in genes other than TP53. We report here alterations in a variety of DNA repair genes in DLBCL tumors and provide evidence for a driver effect of alterations in the MMR and NHEJ pathways. Furthermore, most of the somatic mutations found derived from dominant tumor clones, suggesting that defects in DNA repair mechanisms are important and may constitute early driver events in lymphomagenesis.\n\n    As tumor cells acquire deficiencies in DNA repair pathways they may compensate such defects by relying on other pathways that display, at least partially, functional redundancy. The targeting of compensatory pathways by therapeutic intervention, according to a principle of synthetic lethality, is one of the major cancer drug research focuses and requires the comprehensive characterization of DNA repair defects in tumors. Our work has provided a basis for developing similar therapeutic strategies for DLBCLs. The impact of mutations in DNA repair genes on response to treatment and patient prognosis should be further assessed in larger cohorts of patients.",

        "Title": "    Loss of function mutations in RP1 are responsible for retinitis pigmentosa in consanguineous familial cases",
        "Abstract": "    This study was undertaken to identify causal mutations responsible for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) in consanguineous families.\n\n    Large consanguineous families were ascertained from the Punjab province of Pakistan. An ophthalmic examination consisting of a fundus evaluation and electroretinography (ERG) was completed, and small aliquots of blood were collected from all participating individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells, and a genome-wide linkage or a locus-specific exclusion analysis was completed with polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs). Two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated, and all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of RP1 were sequenced to identify the causal mutation.\n\n    The ophthalmic examination showed that affected individuals in all families manifest cardinal symptoms of RP. Genome-wide scans localized the disease phenotype to chromosome 8q, a region harboring RP1, a gene previously implicated in the pathogenesis of RP. Sanger sequencing identified a homozygous single base deletion in exon 4: c.3697delT (p.S1233Pfs22*), a single base substitution in intron 3: c.787+1G>A (p.I263Nfs8*), a 2 bp duplication in exon 2: c.551_552dupTA (p.Q185Yfs4*) and an 11,117 bp deletion that removes all three coding exons of RP1. These variations segregated with the disease phenotype within the respective families and were not present in ethnically matched control samples.\n\n    These results strongly suggest that these mutations in RP1 are responsible for the retinal phenotype in affected individuals of all four consanguineous families.",
        "Introduction": "    Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide. RP primarily affects the rod photoreceptors, while the cone cells are compromised as the disease progresses. Affected individuals exhibit night blindness in the initial stages of the disease followed by a progressive reduction in the visual field. Ocular findings include atrophic changes in the photoreceptors and the RPE followed by the appearance of melanin-containing structures in the retinal vascular layer. The fundus changes include a pale optic nerve, attenuation of the retinal vessels, and bone spicule-like pigmentation in the mid-peripheral retina. Electroretinography (ERG) recordings show severely diminished or completely extinguished rod response while the cone response is somewhat normal in early stages but is undetectable as the disease progresses.\n\n    RP is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that manifests as an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked trait. To date, 73 genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RP. Of these genes, 27 have been associated with autosomal dominant RP (adRP) while mutations in 50 genes have been identified in patients with autosomal recessive RP (arRP; RetNet). Interestingly, mutations in RHO (Gene ID: 6010; OMIM: 180380), RP1 (Gene ID: 6101; OMIM: 603937), NRL (Gene ID: 4901; OMIM: 162080), RPE65 (Gene ID: 6121; OMIM: 180069), BEST1 (Gene ID: 7439; OMIM: 607854), NR2E3 (Gene ID: 10002; OMIM: 604485), IMPDH1 (Gene ID: 3614; OMIM: 146690) have been identified in familial cases of both adRP and arRP. Likewise, causal mutations in OFD1 (Gene ID: 8481; OMIM: 300170), RP2 (Gene ID: 6102; OMIM: 300757), and RPGR (Gene ID: 6103; OMIM: 312610) have been identified in RP cases with an X-linked inheritance pattern.\n\n    RP1 was localized to chromosome 8q and consists of four exons that encode for a 2,156 amino acid protein. Pierce and colleagues first identified mutations in RP1 responsible for adRP, and subsequently, they estimated that the nonsense mutation at codon 677 (p.R677*) is present in approximately 3% of the dominant RP cases in North America. The RP1 protein localizes to the connecting cilia of the rod and cone cells in the ocular retina and is required for correct stacking of the outer segment disc.\n\n    Here, we report four consanguineous familial cases with multiple members who manifest cardinal symptoms of RP. Genome-wide linkage analyses localized the disease phenotype to chromosome 8q, harboring RP1, while bidirectional Sanger sequencing identified causal mutations in RP1 that segregated with the disease phenotype in their respective families and were absent in the ethnically matched controls and the genome-variant databases.",
        "Methods": "    More than 300 consanguineous Pakistani families with non-syndromic retinal dystrophies were recruited to identify new disease loci responsible for inherited visual diseases. The institutional review boards (IRBs) of the National Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (Lahore, Pakistan), the National Eye Institute (Bethesda, MD) and the Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) approved the study. All participating family members provided informed written consent that was endorsed by the respective IRBs and is consistent with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    A detailed clinical and medical history was obtained from the individual families. Funduscopy was performed at Layton Rehmatulla Benevolent Trust (LRBT) Hospital (Lahore, Pakistan). ERG measurements were recorded by using equipment manufactured by LKC (Gaithersburg, MD). Dark-adapted rod responses were determined through incident flash attenuated by -25 dB, whereas rod-cone responses were measured at 0 dB. The 30 Hz flicker responses were recorded at 0 dB to a background illumination of 17 to 34 cd/m2.\n\n    All participating members voluntarily provided an approximately 10 ml blood sample that was stored in 50 ml Sterilin  Falcon (Sarstedt, Inc. Newton, NC) tubes containing 400 mul of 0.5 M EDTA. Blood samples were stored at -20  C for long-term storage.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells using a non-organic modified procedure as described previously. The concentration of the extracted genomic DNA was estimated with a SmartSpec plus Bio-Rad Spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\n\n    The Applied Biosystems MD-10 linkage mapping panels (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to complete a genome-wide scan for family PKRP117. PCR was completed in a 5 mul reaction volume containing 40 ng of genomic DNA, various combinations of 10 muM fluorescently labeled primer pairs, 10X PCR buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.4, 400 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM Spermidine), 2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) mix, and 0.2 U OneTaq DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs Inc, Ipswich, MA). Initial denaturation was performed for 5 minutes (min) at 95  C, followed by 10 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94  C for 15 s, annealing at 55  C for 15 s and elongating at 72  C for 30 s, and then 20 cycles consisting of denaturation at 89  C for 15 s, annealing at 55  C for 15 s, and elongation at 72  C for 30 s. The final extension was performed for 10 min at 72  C, followed by a final hold at 16  C. PCR products were mixed with a loading cocktail containing HD-400 size standards (Applied Biosystems) and resolved in an Applied Biosystems 3100 DNA Analyzer. Genotypes were assigned using the Gene Mapper software from Applied Biosystems. Exclusion analyses were completed for PKRP262, PKRP344, and PKRP358 using closely spaced short tandem repeat (STR) markers.\n\n    Linkage analysis was performed with alleles of PKRP117 obtained through the genome-wide scan and the alleles of PKRP262, PKRP344, and PKRP358 obtained through exclusion analysis using the FASTLINK version of MLINK from the LINKAGE Program Package. Maximum LOD scores were calculated using ILINK from the LINKAGE Program Package. Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa was investigated as a fully penetrant disorder that has an affected allele frequency of 0.001.\n\n    The sequences of primer pairs used to amplify RP1 exons were designed using the Primer3 software. The sequences of the primer pairs used for sequencing are shown in Appendix 1. PCR reactions were completed in 10 mul volume containing 20 ng of genomic DNA. PCR amplification consisted of a denaturation step at 95  C for 5 min followed by a two-step touchdown procedure. The first step of ten cycles consisted of denaturation at 95  C for 30 s, followed by a primer set-specific annealing for 30 s (annealing temperature decreases by 1  C per cycle) and elongation at 72  C for 45 s. The second step of 30 cycles consisted of denaturation at 95  C for 30 s followed by annealing (annealing temperature -10  C) for 30 s and elongation at 72  C for 45 s, followed by a final elongation at 72  C for 5 min.\n\n    The PCR primers for each exon were used for bidirectional sequencing using the BigDye Terminator Ready reaction mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequencing products were resolved on an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and results were analyzed with Applied Biosystems SeqScape software.\n\n    The degree of evolutionary conservation of the splice donor site (c.787+1G) in other RP1 orthologs was examined using the UCSC Genome Browser (Genome). The effect of the c.787+1G>A mutation on RP1 mRNA splicing was predicted with an online bioinformatics tool, the Human Splicing Finder 2.4.1 (HSF).",
        "Results": "    In an ongoing effort to investigate the genetic load of retinal dystrophies in the Pakistani population, we recruited a large cohort of familial cases with multiple members in these families manifesting cardinal symptoms of early onset RP. Among these families, PKRP117, PKRP262, PKRP344, and PKRP358 were recruited from the Punjab province of Pakistan. In PKRP117, we were able to enroll a total of 19 family members, including nine affected individuals (Figure 1A). A detailed medical history, including the onset and progression of the ocular disease, was obtained by interviewing family elders, especially the parents of the affected individuals, which revealed that all affected individuals complained of night blindness during the early years of their life. Exclusion analysis with closely spaced STR markers spanning known RP loci suggested linkage to chromosome 8q harboring RP1. Maximum two-point LOD scores of 3.21, 6.95, and 5.95 at theta = 0 were obtained with markers D8S1737, D8S509, and D8S2332, respectively (Table 1).\n\n    In parallel, we enrolled three affected and nine unaffected members of PKRP262, four affected and three unaffected members of PKRP344, and four affected and three unaffected members of PKRP358 (Figure 1B-D). Fundus photographs of the affected individuals revealed typical symptoms of RP, including attenuated retinal arteries, waxy, pale optic disc, and bone spicule-like pigment deposits in the lateral and mid-periphery of the retina (Figure 2). Likewise, scotopic ERG recordings measured at -25 dB and photopic responses at 0 dB (30 Hz flicker) were undetectable in the affected individuals, suggestive of compromised rod photoreceptor and cone cells, while unaffected individuals exhibited rod and cone responses in the normal range (Figure 3).\n\n    Exclusion analysis localized all three familial cases (PKRP262, PKRP344, and PKRP358) to a region of chromosome 8q harboring RP1. Alleles for markers D8S1737, D8S509, and D8S2332 yielded 2-point LOD scores of 2.54, 2.51, and 2.51 at theta = 0 and 1.42, 2.13, and 2.52 at theta = 0 for families PKRP262 and PKRP358, respectively, while the alleles for markers D8S1737 and D8S509 yielded 2-point LOD scores of 1.62 and 1.15 at theta = 0 for PKRP344 (Table 1). Although these LOD scores are less than a 2-point LOD score of 3.0, which is traditionally considered sufficient for linkage, they are the maximum two-point LOD scores attainable by PKRP262, PKRP344, and PKRP358 and were considered worthy of further investigation because the known RP locus, RP1, was included in the region.\n\n    To identify the causal mutation responsible for the RP phenotype in these four families, we sequenced all coding exons and the exon-intron boundaries of RP1. In PKRP117, we identified a 1-bp homozygous deletion in exon 4, c.3697delT, that is predicted to result in a frameshift p.S1233Pfs22* (Figure 4A-C). Likewise, we identified a homozygous variation in intron 3, c.787+1G>A (p.I263Nfs8*), in PKRP262 that affects the conserved splice donor site (Figure 4D-F) and a 2 bp duplication in exon 2, c.551_552dupTA (p.Q185Yfs4*), in PKRP344 (Figure 4G-I).\n\n    In PKRP358, PCR of all three coding exons of RP1 did not yield any amplification products for the affected individuals while the genomic DNA of the unaffected individuals produced amplified products of the appropriate size. One plausible explanation is that the affected individuals of PKRP358 harbor a homozygous deletion that removes the coding region of RP1. We designed six primer pairs between exons 1 and 2 of RP1 and another six primer pairs downstream of RP1 using Primer3 software. The sequences are available upon request. Briefly, each primer pair was PCR-amplified in a 10 mul reaction volume containing 20 ng of genomic DNA, 1 mul of 10X PCR buffer, 2 mM dNTP mix, 1 mul of 10 muM forward and reverse primer, 500 mM Betaine, 700 mM Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 0.2 U OneTaq DNA polymerase. The initial denaturation step was at 95  C for 5 min followed by a two-step touchdown procedure. The first step of 10 cycles consisted of denaturation at 95  C for 30 s, followed by a 66  C annealing for 30 s (annealing temperature decreased by 1  C after every cycle) and elongation at 72  C for 45 s. The second step of 25 cycles consisted of denaturation at 95  C for 30 s followed by 56  C annealing for 30 s and elongation at 72  C for 45 s, followed by a final elongation at 72  C for 5 min. The amplification pattern of these 12 primer pairs helped us identify a 11,117 bp deletion (chr8:55,531,690-55, 542, 807) that removes all three coding exons of RP1 (Figure 5A-C).\n\n    All four mutations segregated with the disease phenotype in their respective families. All affected individuals were homozygous for the mutant allele while unaffected individuals were either heterozygous carriers or homozygous for the wild-type allele. These mutations were absent in ethnically matched control chromosomes and were not found in the 1000 Genomes, the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, and the dbSNP databases.\n\n    The mutation identified in PKRP117, c.3697delT (p.S1233Pfs22*), is expected to produce a truncated protein lacking 903 amino acids of the C-terminal, while the transcript harboring the mutation identified in PKRP344, c.551_552dupTA (p.Q185Yfs4*), is expected to degrade through nonsense-mediated decay. Moreover, affected individuals in PKRP358 are believed to have no expression of RP1 due to the large deletion that removes all coding exons of RP1. Therefore, the respective mutations in PKRP117, PKRP344, and PKRP358 are likely to have caused the RP phenotype in these families. However, we sought additional evidence to strengthen the candidacy of the splice donor variation identified in PKRP262.\n\n    First, we examined the evolutionary conservation of c.787+1G and found that the +1G of the splice donor site is completely conserved in RP1 orthologs in general and mammals in particular (Appendix 2). Second, we evaluated the effect of the c.787+1G>A variation on RP1 mRNA splicing using Human Splice Finder 2 (HSF2). The HSF2 generated consensus values of 80.96 and 48.29 for the wild-type (c.787+1G) and mutant (c.787+1A) nucleotides, respectively. The predicted consensus value deviation of -32.67 for c.787+1G>A suggests that the loss of the wild-type splice site will result in the retention of intron 3 of RP1 (Figure 5D), resulting in a frame shift and eventually a premature stop codon (p.I263Nfs8*).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We previously reported homozygous mutations responsible for arRP in three consanguineous familial cases that implicated RP1 in the pathogenesis of arRP. Here, we report four consanguineous families recruited from the Punjab province of Pakistan with multiple members who manifest cardinal symptoms of RP. Linkage analyses with closely spaced STR markers localized the linkage interval in all four families to chromosome 8q12.1, harboring RP1, while Sanger sequencing of RP1 identified mutations that segregate with the disease phenotype in their respective families and are predicted to produce truncated RP1 proteins.\n\n    A total of 55 mutations have been identified in RP1 associated with RP in multiple ethnic populations. 37 result in adRP while 17 mutations are responsible for arRP and one mutation responsible for sporadic case. The majority of the mutations identified in RP1 are either nonsense codons or lead to premature termination of RP1. Nonsense mutations in mammalian genes generally lead to unstable mRNAs that are degraded by nonsense-mediated decay. However, nonsense-mediated decay does not occur if the mutation is present in the last exon, and therefore, most of the reported mutations are expected to produce stable transcripts translated into truncated proteins.\n\n    The precise mechanism that dictates whether a single allele would be sufficient or whether a homozygous mutation would be required for manifestation of the disease phenotype is not yet completely understood and probably varies among different examples. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that variations resulting in a mutant protein with a deleterious effect would manifest as an autosomal dominant trait while functionally null alleles would manifest as an autosomal recessive disease. We previously speculated that disruption of RP1 within or immediately after the bifocal gene product (BIF) domain might result in a protein with a deleterious effect whereas truncation of RP1 before the BIF motif or within the terminal portion of the protein would result in a loss of RP1 function.\n\n    More than 50 causal mutations have been identified in patients with adRP and arRP within the past decade, including our earlier observation (Table 2). As shown in Figure 6, pathogenic mutations in the heterozygous state in RP1 responsible for adRP seem to reside between amino acid residues 617-1551. In contrast, the homozygous mutations responsible for arRP cluster in two regions: first, between amino acids 193-736 and, second, between amino acids 1243-1890 (Figure 6). Taken together, these data support our earlier speculation: Truncation mutations especially in the central region (800-1,200) of RP1 that is structurally not well defined, produce mutant proteins with a deleterious effect while mutations close to the N- and C-terminals of RP1 (>600 or <1,600) produce loss of function of the mutant proteins.\n\n    Moreover, the regions that include amino acid residues 600-750 and 1,250-1,550 include mutations that have been associated with both adRP and arRP, although no single mutation has been associated with both adRP and arRP. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that \"zones\" exist in RP1 in which the nature of the mutation instead of its location in the polypeptide dictates the inheritance pattern. Additional functional investigations are required to define these zones and elucidate mechanistic details of mutations leading to the particular genetic trait.",

        "Title": "    A short guide to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is the only known predisposition syndrome dominated by carcinoma of the stomach and with a recognised genetic cause. Germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) co-segregate with the disease in about half of the families with multiple diffuse gastric cancer. In these families, identification of the CDH1 mutation allows for clinical measures to be taken. Importantly, clinical intervention is likely to be therapeutic and associated with tolerable morbidity. This review is thus aimed at providing a current overview of the clinical management and the underlying biology of HDGC.",
        "Introduction": "    Among the familial forms of gastric carcinoma, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is the only known cancer predisposition syndrome where an underlying genetic cause has been defined. Based on linkage and mutational analysis, germline mutations affecting the gene coding for the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin (CDH1) were shown in 1998 to be responsible for the high incidence of multi-generational diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) in a large New Zealand Maori family. Subsequently, CDH1 germline mutations have been found in over 90 families of diverse ethnicity but sharing a history of DGC (Table 1).\n\n    To date, 81 different germline mutations have been identified throughout the entire CDH1 coding region including intronic splice site sequences (Table 1; refs). No major hot spots are apparent, though the 1137G>A and 1901C>T mutations have been detected in six and five different families, respectively (Table 1). The first founder mutation surrounded by an ancestral CDH1 haplotype has recently been reported in four families from Newfoundland. So far, no genotype-phenotype correlations are evident; however, available data support the possibility that different mutations may impact disease spectrum and penetrance.\n\n    In contrast to other cancer predisposition syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis, only about 50% of CDH1 germline mutations are completely inactivating (frameshift or nonsense, Table 1). Splice-site and missense mutations contribute the remaining 20 and 30%, respectively, to the mutational spectrum, suggesting that reduced rather than lost E-cadherin activity may be sufficient for disease initiation. Since the functional consequences of amino acid substitutions are not straightforward, aggregation and invasion assays are being used to assess the impact of missense mutations on E-cadherin function in vitro .\n\n    CDH1 germline mutations are rare and are estimated to account for ~1% of all gastric cancer cases. However, this appears to be the case only for populations with a low gastric cancer incidence. CDH1 germline mutations are detected at an even lower frequency in high incidence countries such as Japan, Korea, Italy and Portugal, possibly because HDGC families are masked by chance clusters of sporadic cases. Alternatively, the presence of other susceptibility factors such as functional CDH1 polymorphisms in high-risk areas may reduce the viability of embryos carrying CDH1 germline mutations.\n\n    The Lauren classification distinguishes two main histological forms of stomach cancer, the intestinal and the diffuse type (DGC). CDH1 germline mutations are specifically associated with diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma but not with other types of stomach cancer in the absence of a diffuse component. DGC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner among HDGC families. Initial penetrance figures were derived from 11 families and estimate a lifetime cumulative DGC risk of 67 and 83% for male and female mutation carriers, respectively. A more recent estimate based on Newfoundland families sharing a founder CDH1 mutation puts these numbers at 40% for men and 63% for women. It thus is probable that the type/location of the CDH1 mutation does impact on the actual penetrance. For example, certain missense mutations seem to be associated with a much lower DGC risk. Similarly, the mean age at diagnosis may vary with genotype, being 33 years in the largest known HDGC kindred (with 28 affected members), 40 years in the initial penetrance estimates by Pharoah, and over 50 years in families with specific missense mutations. Cases of gastric cancer have been described as young as 14 years and at 82 years in HDGC (Table 1). Varying genetic/epigenetic backgrounds and environmental exposures are likely to be important additional parameters modulating the consequences of inherited CDH1 mutations.\n\n    The only other cancer that is known to occur at an elevated frequency in HDGC families is lobular breast cancer (LBC). Estimates for the LBC penetrance in female mutation carriers range from 39 to 54%, but these figures are derived from small numbers of cases and have to be interpreted with caution. However, the susceptibility towards both DGC and LBC makes sense, as the sporadic forms of both cancers are characterised by E-cadherin deficiency and a dis-cohesive growth pattern. It appears probable that cancers at other sites will be part of the clinical HDGC phenotype. CDH1 germline mutations have been detected in HDGC family patients with tumours of the colorectum, lung, and salivary glands. Another example may be prostate cancer (Table 1). In support of this, functional CDH1 polymorphisms have been shown to increase susceptibility to this malignancy. However, present numbers on cancers other than LBC are too small to allow for any significant association with HDGC.\n\n    Clinical management of HDGC families is based on presymptomatic identification of mutation carriers, followed by prophylactic gastrectomy at the appropriate age, or by gastroscopic surveillance and therapeutic gastrectomy when cancer has been detected. Clinical guidelines have been published and are recommended for a more comprehensive overview of patient management.\n\n    The first step is the identification of a deleterious CDH1 germline mutation in a suspected HDGC family. Clinical criteria have been developed that select for families likely to harbour a CDH1 mutation. The original criteria as proposed by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) are being presently used in a more relaxed version which requires two gastric cancer cases in 1st/2nd degree relatives with at least one documented tumour of diffuse histology and diagnosed before the age of 50 years. CDH1 germline mutations are identified in about 50% of families meeting the above criteria. Brooks-Wilson et al. have proposed a more extended set of criteria to include families that have a smaller chance of carrying mutations. Even when applying these criteria, unusual families with a germline mutation can be missed. In addition, the chance of finding a mutation in an isolated case with early onset DGC is still 10%. Therefore, comprehensive CDH1 mutation screening requires inclusion of borderline families and cases into the search.\n\n    Diagnostic testing for the presence of a known mutation is usually offered to family members from 16 years on (the lower age limit to give informed consent). At this age, the risk of developing symptomatic DGC is < 1%. However, testing should also be offered to younger HDGC family members, if there is a clear benefit to the child and the family. Such families should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, considering the child's maturity, the anxiety within the family, the severity of the family history, and the potential for the family to adjust to future risks associated with a positive test result.\n\n    Prophylactic gastrectomy is the only option to prevent the development and/or spread of HDGC. However, not every mutation carrier is willing to undergo prophylactic surgery. This is particularly relevant in young/adolescent patients and is influenced by concern about the long-term impact on physical and psychological health, an issue not well understood. Gastroscopic surveillance is essential if prophylactic gastrectomy is declined; however, it must be performed by a gastroenterologist with experience in HDGC endoscopy (New Zealand HDGC group, pers. comm.).\n\n    Gastroscopic surveillance poses a special problem for DGC because of its tendency to progress underneath a normal appearing gastric mucosa (see section 3.5). Even advanced stages that involve invasion of extragastric tissue may not cause a visible distortion of the normal surface epithelium. Nonetheless, early HDGC stages that are still restricted to the gastric mucosa can be seen as pale or sometimes white lesions by the experienced eye. The lesion pallor can be enhanced by the use of Congo red and methylene blue during endoscopy. While this approach has been successful in detecting early HDGC, the suspected role of Congo red as a carcinogen limits its routine use. Other potential surveillance techniques include confocal microscopy and positron emission tomography, but these remain experimental.\n\n    In summary, gastroscopic surveillance with standard white-light endoscopy can detect suspicious lesions when performed by an experienced gastroenterologist. However, surveillance is not without risk; therefore prophylactic gastrectomy is the recommended strategy. The decision whether a patient should undergo surveillance or not has to be made in conjunction with genetic counselling, giving clear advice about the unquantifiable risk that a cancer may be missed on endoscopy. Should the patient opt for surveillance, counselling also needs to include instruction to minimise exposure to common gastric cancer risk factors such as salted, cured, preserved foods or smoking, to consume more fruit and vegetables, and to increase general fitness. Likewise, mutation carriers need treatment against H. pylori if infected.\n\n    Total gastrectomy has a perioperative mortality risk which necessitates careful consideration. Given the young age of HDGC patients, modern surgical procedures and improved post-operative care, the operative risk has been estimated at about 1%. Based on the penetrance estimates calculated by Pharoah et al., this risk is matched by the risk of developing symptomatic DGC at the age of 20 years in a mutation carrier. Therefore, the cancer risk outweighs the surgery-associated mortality risk when delaying prophylactic gastrectomy after the age of 20 years. Under age 20 years, on the other hand, the mortality risk from prophylactic gastrectomy is larger than the risk of developing disease. In addition, total gastrectomy results in lifelong vitamin B12 deficiency and malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, K, folate, calcium and iron. Elevated levels of osteoporosis, osteomalacia and malnutrition resulting in weight loss are frequent post-gastrectomy among gastric cancer patients usually aged 60-70 years. Data on young and adolescent patients are not available, but gastrectomies are likely to have a significant impact on the growth and development in teenage years. Therefore, in New Zealand prophylactic gastrectomy is usually not offered to CDH1 mutation carriers under 18 years of age and not encouraged in those below 20 years.\n\n    A meticulous total gastrectomy is mandatory to ensure all gastric mucosa is removed, which requires particular care at the esophagogastric junction. The standard gastrectomy procedure for both asymptomatic patients and patients with early HDGC detected by surveillance is D2 dissection with preservation of the spleen and pancreas, followed by Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy reconstruction without a jejunal pouch reservoir. A Roux-en-Y reconstruction means food bypasses the duodenum and a variable length of the proximal jejunum. The unavailability of intestinal regions, a reduced intestinal transit time and the absence of a stomach contribute to the potential nutritional deficiencies in these patients (see section 3.3). A more detailed description of surgical issues is given in refs. and.\n\n    Despite the absence of symptoms, microscopic examination of stomachs prophylactically removed from CDH1 mutation carriers has revealed the presence of multiple foci of signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) underneath an intact surface epithelium. SRCC and poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC) are the two main subtypes of DGC and are both part of the HDGC disease phenotype. A variable number (a few to several hundred) of SRCC foci have been found in almost every HDGC stomach regardless of the patient's age. These foci are always confined to the superficial gastric mucosa without any nodal involvement (TNM stage T1a), are usually small (<= 1 mm in diameter) and consist predominately of signet-ring cells (SRCs) with a few smaller and less differentiated cells in the deeper part. Foci that are bigger (>= 3 mm) can contain a significant proportion of poorly differentiated carcinoma cells deep to the SRCs. It is these larger lesions that can be detected as pale areas upon endoscopy. Because these intramucosal SRCC foci seem to be a universal finding in mutation carriers, they are referred to as early HDGC (eHDGC).\n\n    In contrast to the early HDGC stage, the predominant histology in advanced HDGC (stage >= T3, involvement of serosa and beyond) is that of poorly differentiated carcinoma. It thus appears that SRCs are typical of early stage HDGC. In support of this, the only stage T2 HDGC cancer (with invasion of the muscularis propria) that has been examined in detail shows the morphologic spectrum of HDGC, with SRCs in the superficial mucosa and poorly differentiated cancer cells deeper down and invading into the muscle layers underneath. These morphological features suggest that, in HDGC, progression beyond the gastric mucosa correlates with the acquisition of a poorly differentiated cancer cell phenotype. Notably, SRC histology is also significantly more frequent in early sporadic DGC compared to advanced stages. Figure 1 summarises the early histopathological changes in HDGC.\n\n    Long-term survival data in HDGC patients post-gastrectomy are not yet available, but can be estimated based on survival data in sporadic DGC case series. As described in the previous section, HDGC patients who have undergone screening or elected to have a prophylactic gastrectomy will have eHDGC. A frequent clinical belief is that diffuse-type carcinoma has a worse outcome than intestinal-type stomach cancer. Such a perception may result from the often delayed diagnosis of DGC, due to the younger age of onset in DGC patients and because of the difficulties in detecting early stage DGC. However, stage-by-stage comparison of intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer suggests their outcome is similar. Another widely held belief is that SRCC has a particularly bad prognosis. Again, this is not supported by survival data from sporadic DGC series. Indeed, the majority of studies have found a significantly better outcome for early SRCC compared to other early stage histotypes. This is not surprising when considering molecular data on SRCs (see section 4.3). In general, the 5-year survival of patients with early stage SRCC is > 90%. Given that these data also include patients with nodal involvement, the post-operative prognosis for eHDGC (in the absence of nodal metastasis) is likely to be excellent. However, it is important to keep in mind that the risk of CDH1 mutation carriers developing non-gastric cancers later in their lives is not known.\n\n    Surveillance should be offered to female CDH1 mutation carriers for lobular breast cancer (LBC), the only other HDGC-associated non-gastric cancer where penetrance estimates are available (see section 2). Of the two major forms of breast cancer, ductal and lobular, the lobular type is more difficult to detect by virtue of its diffuse growth pattern and relative lack of microcalcification. Ultrasound and particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been shown to be better than mammography at detecting invasive LBC. Surveillance protocols for female CDH1 mutation carriers are based on experience with BRCA mutation family screening, where bi-annual clinical examination and annual mammography combined with ultrasound/MRI from the age of 35 years onwards is recommended.\n\n    The E-cadherin protein encoded by CDH1 is the key component of the epithelial adherens junction and as such is essential for proper intercellular adhesion within epithelial tissues. Loss of E-cadherin has been documented in many epithelial cancers and is usually associated with disease progression. In HDGC, however, E-cadherin deficiency is very likely an initiator of disease. The protein is consistently downregulated in the earliest apparent HDGC disease stage, the minute intramucosal SRCCs (see section 3.5). Given that up to several hundred eHDGC foci can exist in the stomach of a mutation carrier, it is very improbable that a gene other than CDH1 is consistently affected. The uniform downregulation of E-cadherin further indicates that CDH1 acts as a classic tumour suppressor, requiring two hits for disease initiation. Potential mechanisms behind this 2nd hit include missense mutations, deletions and epigenetic silencing by promoter hypermethylation. Of those, the latter appears the most frequent and has been shown to be present in the earliest disease stage (B.H. unpublished results). Notably, each eHDGC focus appears to have a unique CDH1 methylation pattern (the sequence of methylated and unmethylated CpG-islands), suggesting that each focus has arisen independently from a single gastric cell (B.H., unpublished results). Of interest, the nature of the 2nd hit does not seem to be stochastic; genetic events that necessarily lead to complete inactivation of both CDH1 alleles have not been demonstrated for HDGC so far, suggesting the 2nd hit may be selected in a way that allows some residual CDH1 activity, possibly to prevent elimination by anoikis. Indeed, downregulation of E-cadherin below a certain threshold seems sufficient to abrogate its function.\n\n    The loss of adhesion to the epithelial layer that follows E-cadherin downregulation is thought to be one of the requirements for the progression to invasive disease. How E-cadherin deficiency may initiate tumour growth is not well understood. However, adhesive loss has additional, profound consequences at the cellular level. The attachment within epithelial planes enables locality cues required for proper differentiation, is needed for apical-basal polarity, a distinguishing feature of epithelial cells, and provides anchor points for the mitotic spindle apparatus essential for controlled cell division. In Drosophila, reduced levels of E-cadherin and the concomitant loss of polarity have been shown to affect the orientation of the mitotic spindle and with that the division plane and the placement of the daughter cell relative to the epithelial sheet. Similarly, deficient adherens junctions result in randomisation of spindle alignment and mis-orientated cell division in the developing mouse embryo. Cell polarity further dictates the distribution of cell fate determinants (i.e. inducers of a specific differentiation pathway) towards one cell pole. The orientation of the mitotic spindle may then determine whether the cell fate factors will be unequally distributed between the daughter cells (i.e. asymmetric division, where the axis of division dissects the cell fate gradient), or whether division gives rise to two equal daughter cells (i.e. symmetric division, where the divisional axis would be parallel to the cell fate gradient). Cell fate determination is particularly important in the context of stem cell biology. Stem cells can regenerate complete organs due to their unique ability to produce two daughter stem cells (by symmetric division) or to produce one daughter stem cell and one committed progenitor cell (by asymmetric division) that will give rise to differentiated, organ-specific progeny. A disturbed balance between symmetric and asymmetric division may be dangerous and is now thought to lie at the heart of many malignancies. Several epithelial cancers have been shown to harbour a subpopulation of so-called cancer stem cells that are the only cells able to initiate and maintain successful tumour growth. Similar to normal stem cells, undifferentiated cancer stem cells can produce differentiating cancer cells (asymmetric division) or increase their own pool (symmetric division) for an unlimited time. The proportion of such cancer stem cells within a tumour is believed to determine its aggressiveness. Given that E-cadherin is essential for cell-cell adhesion, establishment of polarity, and proper mitotic spindle orientation, a tempting hypothesis would be that CDH1 downregulation has a direct effect on the control of stem cell divisions, providing a basic mechanism sufficient to drive the development of a tumour.\n\n    Consistent with the hypothesis of a stem cell defect, the early HDGC foci have an apparent origin at the upper isthmus, a part of the proliferative zone (the neck region) of the gastric gland and the presumed location of the gastric stem cells. Cancer cells close to the upper isthmus are proliferative, often not well differentiated and give rise to the typical SRCs located in the more superficial mucosa. Typical SRCs, which represent the vast majority of cells in the foci, stain with markers of terminally differentiated gastric cells and are mitotically inactive. Indeed, eHDGC is characterised by its hypoproliferative state, in contrast to early stages of many other carcinomas. Another distinct feature is that eHDGC develops within the lamina propria, meaning the cancer cells have penetrated the basement membrane, which classifies these lesions as malignant. However, the foci do not express invasion-associated proteins that are observed in more advanced HDGC (stage >= T1b, involvement of submucosa and beyond). A simple explanation may relate to the observation that the proliferating cancer cells close to the isthmus initially develop along the gastric mucous neck cell lineage which matures into the pepsinogen-producing chief cells. Pepsinogen is normally secreted into the gastric lumen; however, the early cancer cells have lost polarity and would release pepsinogen in all directions, leading to a partial digestion of the basement membrane and providing a window through which the non-adhesive cells could enter the lamina. Indeed, a significant proportion of SRCs is positive for circumferential (or unpolarised), membranous pepsinogen expression (B.H., unpublished results).\n\n    Together, the early HDGC stage is characterised by its apparent origin from the gastric stem cell region followed by differentiation to non-dividing SRCs with a low invasive potential. This indolent state is consistent with both the long, asymptomatic presence of eHDGC in CDH1 mutation carriers and the significantly better prognosis associated with early SRCC (see section 3.6).\n\n    As described in section 3.5, progression of intramucosal cancer foci to the submucosa correlates with the acquisition of a poorly differentiated phenotype. Significant numbers of poorly differentiated cells can be first observed in larger intramucosal foci and often show a mesenchymal-like morphology. In contrast to the SRCs, poorly differentiated cells express activated c-Src kinase, an established inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) and of an invasive cancer phenotype. Activation of c-Src is maintained in more advanced disease stages, suggesting the kinase is required for disease progression. Consistent with c-Src activation and an EMT, the poorly differentiated cells also express the c-Src downstream targets Fak, Stat3 and the mesenchymal marker fibronectin. Other invasion-associated proteins that can be detected in the poorly differentiated cells but not in the SRCs include Mmp-2 and Mmp-9 (B.H., unpublished results). Thus, clear biological differences exist between poorly differentiated cells and the intramucosal SRCs and support the indolent nature of the latter cells. These findings also illustrate that CDH1 downregulation alone (see section 4.3) does not directly induce an EMT in gastric tissue.\n\n    What leads to activation of c-Src kinase and the induction of an EMT is not known. Data from sporadic disease suggest that an amplification of 20q, the region including the c-Src gene, marks the transition from SRCC to PDC. However, we could not detect amplification of c-Src in advanced HDGC samples (BH, unpublished results). Another possibility may involve progressive DNA methylation that appears to correlate with poor differentiation in gastric cancer and may silence inhibitors of c-Src, as has been shown for caveolin-1 in colorectal cancer. A third alternative comes from the observation that an EMT can be seen in larger intramucosal foci. Large foci appear pale on endoscopy (see section 3.5), suggesting a reduced blood supply and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia can also figure as an inducer of EMTs and could contribute to the progression from intramucosal to submucosal disease.",

        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The current clinical management of HDGC by either endoscopic surveillance or prophylactic gastrectomy has drastically reduced the number of deaths due to gastric cancer in affected families. Neither approach, however, is perfect. Endoscopic surveillance of diffuse-type gastric cancer involves the risk of missing a cancer. Although molecular biology suggests that eHDGC is rather indolent, the potential of these foci to progress remains unpredictable. While prophylactic gastrectomy eliminates this risk, it adds the perioperative risk and may not be the appropriate strategy in some patients.\n\n    Progress is expected with the application of molecular techniques that will help to describe the biology of SRCs, poorly differentiated cancer cells, and their surrounding environment in detail. Such knowledge should enable the development of in vivo imaging markers targeting SRCs to improve the sensitivity of endoscopy. A more sensitive tool for the detection of intramucosal SRCC foci would also greatly aid the diagnosis of sporadic disease. Additional markers specific for invasive, poorly differentiated cells may also be helpful in selecting patients for gastrectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection in sporadic cases.\n\n    Though gastric cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, no chemotherapeutic agents exist which specifically target this malignancy. However, the molecular investigation of HDGC has revealed new potential targets likewise applicable to DGC. c-Src kinase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other malignancies and show a favourable toxicological profile (see and other refs. in the same issue). c-Src kinase inhibitors might slow down the invasion of intramucosal foci into the submucosa and theoretically could permit gastrectomy to be delayed. Moreover, the observation that epigenetic events are very likely to have an aetiological role in HDGC may open the door to the new class of epigenetic drugs such as demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Thus, therapy that is able to revert the neoplastic phenotype to normality may be feasible.",

        "Title": "    Germline mutations in Thai patients with nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Genetic testing is widely recommended for all epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. However, an increased probability of identifying germline mutations has been reported in selected patients with risk factors such as a family history or personal history of cancer and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) subtype. HGSC has been reported to be the most common subtype of EOC worldwide (approximately 70%). However, this subtype is less prevalent in Thai patients (reported as only 20%). The difference in the distribution of various subtypes of EOC may reflect the incidence of germline mutations in Thai EOC patients.\n\n    To evaluate the frequencies of germline mutations in EOC patients and to compare the frequencies in those with and without clinical risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer.\n\n    This cross-sectional study included 112 nonmucinous EOC patients who underwent primary surgery at our tertiary care hospital. Clinical risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer were defined as follows: Age below 40 years, a significant family history of cancer, synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer, and HGSC. Comprehensive germline mutations were detected by next-generation sequencing.\n\n    Of a total of 112 patients, 82 (73.2%) patients had >= 1 risk factor and 30 (26.8%) patients had no risk factors. Germline mutations were detected in 26 patients: 20 (17.8%) patients had BRCA1/2 mutations, but 6 (5.4%) patients had mutations in other genes, including 1 in MLH1, 1 in MSH2, 1 in RAD51C, 2 in ATM and 1 in CDH1. Germline mutations were only detected in patients with risk factors (26 of 82, 31.7%), not in patients without risk factors (P < 0.001). A significant family history of cancer and HGSC were the only two significant risk factors associated with a higher proportion of germline mutations (56.3% vs 10% for those with and without a history of cancer, respectively, 40.8% vs 9.5% for those with and without HGSC). Germline BRCA mutations were detected in 38.8% of patients with HGSC but in only 1.6% of those with non-HGSC. An age below 40 years, personal history of breast cancer, and synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer were not significant factors (14.3% vs 23.5%, 33.3% vs 21%, 22.2% vs 22.3%).\n\n    Approximately one-third of EOC patients with risk factors had germline mutations. Almost all germline BRCA mutations were found in patients with the HGSC subtype. Selected patients with HGSC and a family history of cancer should be initially considered for genetic analysis in Thailand.",
        "Introduction": "    Core tip: Germline mutations could not be detected in any epithelial ovarian cancer patients without risk factors such as age below 40 years, significant family or personal history of cancer, and high-grade serous subtype. Mutations were detected in approximately one-third of patients with these risk factors: 25% had BRCA1/2 mutations, 5% had mutations in other homologous recombination genes, and 2.5% had MMR mutations. Significantly more germline mutations were found in patients with a family history of cancer, especially ovarian cancer. Germline BRCA mutations were detected in 38.8% of patients with the high-grade serous subtype but in only 1.6% of those with a non-high-grade serous subtype. Selected patients with the high-grade serous subtype or a significant family history of cancer should initially be considered for genetic analysis in limited resource settings.\n\n    Although most epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) are sporadic, at least 10% of EOC patients have a genetic predisposition. Risk assessment has been previously used to identify patients at risk for hereditary ovarian cancers and to offer genetic counseling and testing. These risk factors are as follows: Early age of onset, personal history of breast cancer, family history of breast, ovarian cancer, endometrial and colon cancer, and specific histologic subtype such as high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). HGSC has been reported to increase the risk of germline mutations. It has also been reported that approximately 20% of HGSCs harbor BRCA mutations. Recently, the recommendation for genetic testing in EOC patients has changed. Various national professional societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have recommended offering genetic counseling and testing for all women with EOC including fallopian tube cancers and primary peritoneal cancers irrespective of risk factors. Firstly, some patients with germline mutations will be missed if the testing is based on these current risk factors. Secondly, genetic results can predict treatment outcomes. Patients with BRCA-mutated EOC have increased platinum sensitivity response rates and significant improvement in survival rate compared with those with non-BRCA- mutated EOC. Thirdly, novel targeted therapy with Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors has been reported to be a promising targeted therapy for BRCA-mutated cancers including homologous recombination (HR) gene-deficient ovarian cancers.\n\n    The frequency of germline mutations varies across different countries and ethnicities. The incidence of BRCA mutations has been reported to range from 5.8%-24.8%. Our previous study reported that 11.4% of patients with nonmucinous EOC had BRCA mutations. However, that study included a small number of patients, and the mutations were reported only in selected patients with risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancers such as a family history or personal history of cancer and HGSC. Therefore, the incidence of BRCA mutations in unselected EOC patients could be even lower than this number. The incidence of HGSC is a major predictive variable. Although it has been reported as the most common subtype worldwide at approximately 70%, only 20% of Thai patients have serous carcinoma. The difference in the distribution of various subtypes of EOC between Thai patients and others worldwide may reflect the lower incidence of germline mutations in Thai EOC patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of germline mutations in EOC patients and to compare the frequency in those with and without clinical risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer.",
        "Methods": "    This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. This was a cross-sectional study conducted between November 2015 and February 2018.\n\n    Patients with EOC, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who underwent primary surgery and had a pathologically confirmed nonmucinous subtype were enrolled. Clinical risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer are defined as follows: (1) Age at diagnosis below 40 years; (2) Significant family history (>= 1 relative with ovarian cancer at any age, >= 1 relative with breast cancer or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)-associated cancers such as colon cancer or endometrial cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age, >= 2 relatives with breast cancer or HNPCC-associated cancers diagnosed after 50 years of age; (3) Previous diagnosis of breast cancer; (4) Synchronous ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer; and (5) HGSC. All patients who agreed to participate in this study received genetic counseling by a geneticist and provided informed consent.\n\n    Comprehensive germline mutation analysis was performed using peripheral blood DNA samples analyzed by a GeneRead DNAseq Mix-n-Match Panel v2 (27-gene panel including APC, ATM, AXIN2, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM, MLH1, MLH3, MRE11, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11, and TP53) (Qiagen) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) (The Illumina MiSeq System; Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). DNA was extracted from the patients' peripheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality was assessed using GeneRead DNA QuantiMIZE Kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germany). DNA library preparation and NGS were performed as previously described. Variant pathogenicity was classified based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the American Society of Molecular Pathology standard and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. Variant classification was listed as \"Pathogenic\", \"Likely pathogenic\", \"Variant of Uncertain Clinical Significance\", \"Likely benign\" or \"Benign\" in decreasing order of clinical importance. The pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants found in this study were confirmed using bi-directional Sanger sequencing.\n\n    SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) was used for the statistical analysis. Comparisons of the proportions of germline mutations between two groups were analyzed by Chi-square or Fisher's Exact test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    Of the 112 patients, 97 were diagnosed with EOC, 4 with fallopian tube cancer, 2 with primary peritoneal cancer, and 9 with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer. The mean age was 52.8 +- 11.0 years. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Eighty-two patients (73.2%) had at least one clinical risk factor, and 27 patients (24.1%) had more than one risk factor. Of the 82 patients, EOC was diagnosed in 67 patients (81.7%), fallopian tube cancer in 4 patients (4.9%), primary peritoneal cancer in 2 patients (2.4%), and synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer in 9 patients (11.0%). The histologic subtypes in these patients were HGSC in 49 patients (59.8%), low-grade serous carcinoma in 4 patients (4.9%), endometrioid carcinoma in 15 patients (18.3%), clear cell carcinoma in 12 patients (14.6%), mixed endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma in 1 patient (1.2%), and adenocarcinoma in 1 patient (1.2%). Thirty patients (26.8%) had no clinical risk factors of hereditary ovarian cancer, all of whom were diagnosed with EOC. The histologic subtypes in these patients were endometrioid carcinoma in 13 patients (43.3%), clear cell carcinoma in 12 patients (40%), mixed endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma in 3 patients (10%) and low-grade serous carcinoma in 2 patients (6.7%).\n\n    Germline mutations were detected in 26 patients (23.2%), whereas 20 patients (17.8%) had BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, and 6 patients (5.4%) had mutations in other genes (Table 2). Germline mutations could not be detected in any of the 30 patients without risk factors. In contrast, all mutations were detected in 26 of 82 patients with >= 1 risk factor (31.7%, P < 0.001). The frequency of germline mutations according to various risk factors is shown in Table 3. Significantly more germline mutations were observed in patients with a significant family history of cancer compared with patients without a significant family history (56.3% and 10% for with and without a family history of cancer, respectively, P < 0.001). Fourteen of 32 patients who had a family history of cancer had BRCA mutations (43.7%) and 3 patients (9.4%) had other gene mutations. In contrast, 6/80 (7.5%) patients without a family history of cancers had BRCA mutations and 2/80 (2.5%) had other gene mutations (1 ATM and 1 CDH1). Significantly higher frequencies of germline mutations were observed in patients with a family history of ovarian cancer (70% vs 17.6% for those with and without a family history of ovarian cancer, respectively, P = 0.001) and in patients with a family history of breast cancer (40.9% vs 17.8% for patients with and without a family history of breast cancer, respectively, P = 0.04). Patients with a family history of ovarian cancer had a higher frequency of BRCA mutations than those with a family history of breast cancer (60% vs 40.9%). If other genes were included, the frequency of germline mutations was 70% and 40.9%, in those with family history of ovarian and breast cancers, respectively. HGSC was also observed as another factor associated with a higher frequency of germline mutations (40.8% and 9.5%, P < 0.001). Nineteen patients with HGSC (38.8%) had BRCA mutations. Seven of 63 patients (11.1%) who had types other than HGSC had germline mutations; 1.6% had BRCA mutations and 7.9% had other gene mutations. A sub-analysis of 30 patients with HGSC without the other clinical risk factors revealed that the frequency of BRCA mutations was 16.7% (13.3% with BRCA1 mutations and 3.3% with BRCA2 mutations). The frequency of germline mutations in patients with other risk factors such as age below 40 years, personal history of breast cancer, and synchronous cancer was not significantly different (14.3% vs 23.5%, 33.3% vs 21%, 22.2% vs 22.3%; P > 0.05)\n\n    Germline BRCA mutations were found in 20/82 (24.4%) patients with risk factors (14 BRCA1 mutations and 6 BRCA2 mutations). MMR mutations (MLH1 and MSH2) were found in 2 (2.4%) patients who were diagnosed with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer. Other gene mutations such as RAD51C, ATM and CDH1 were detected in 4 (4.9%) patients. The proportion of germline mutations is shown in Figure 1. Among 20 patients with BRCA mutations, 14 patients (70%) had a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, 19 patients (95%) had HGSC, 3 patients (15%) had a personal history of breast cancer, and 7 patients (35%) were older than 60 years at diagnosis.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    At least 10% of EOCs are hereditary, and most germline mutations are associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2. A 10%-15% frequency of germline BRCA mutations has been reported in unselected EOC patients. However, mutations in MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) associated with Lynch or HNPCC syndrome and other genes in HR pathways have been implicated in inherited susceptibility to ovarian cancer. Approximately a quarter of EOC patients carry germline mutations in HR genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, and other HR genes such as ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, FAM175A, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D. Moreover, about 6% of patients carry germline mutations in other HR genes. The frequency of germline mutations in this study has been reported to be 31.7% in selected EOC patients with risk factors. Of these patients, 24.4% carried BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 7.3% had mutations in other genes. Other mutations found in this study include those in the RAD51C, ATM, CDH1, MLH1, and MSH2 genes. The RAD51C and ATM genes are involved in DNA repair mechanisms similar to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These genes have been reported to increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Germline CDH1 mutations are known to cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome, which increases the lifetime risk of gastric, breast, and colon cancer. However, down-regulation of CDH1 gene expression is involved in cancer invasion and metastasis in many cancers, including ovarian cancer. Mutations in MMR genes are associated with Lynch syndrome, which increase the lifetime risk of colorectal, endometrial and ovarian cancer. The frequency of MMR mutations in this study was 1.8% (2/112 patients), which was slightly higher than that reported in previous studies (0.5%). A family history or personal history of Lynch syndrome-associated cancers was considered a risk factor in this study. Furthermore, our previous study reported that endometrioid carcinoma was the most common histological subtype among Thai EOC patients. EOC patients with germline MMR mutations usually have the endometrioid subtype. These different subtypes might affect the different frequency of germline mutations in MMR genes in this study.\n\n    The selection criteria for germline testing in EOC patients included young age, a family or personal history of cancer, HGSC, and specific ethnicity. Using these criteria, 27.5% of patients with germline BRCA mutations might not have been selected for genetic testing. Although germline BRCA mutations are rarely found in patients aged over 60 years, one-third to half of all BRCA mutations are found in this group of women. Furthermore, a significant family history of cancer is absent in 27%-56% of patients with germline BRCA mutations. Our study showed that 35% of patients with germline BRCA mutations were older than 60 years at diagnosis and 30% had no significant family history of cancer. In addition, each patient might have overlapping risk factors. Therefore, other risk factors such as HGSC or a personal history of cancer in these patients might explain the germline BRCA mutations.\n\n    The frequency of germline BRCA mutations in EOC patients with a significant family history of breast/ovarian cancer was 43.7% in this study, which was comparable with that found in previous studies (33%-55%). A family history of ovarian cancer increases the chance of identifying germline BRCA mutations compared with a family history of breast cancer (60% vs 40.9%). This finding is consistent with previous studies in Korea and Australia, which reported incidences of BRCA mutations of 55%-63% and 15%-35% for a family history of ovarian and breast cancers, respectively.\n\n    Germline BRCA mutations are particularly frequent in HGSC and have been reported as 11%-23%. Our study reported a higher frequency of 38.8%. As mentioned previously, it is likely that each patient has overlapping risk factors. The frequency of germline BRCA mutations was 16.7% in patients with HGSC without other risk factors. Most patients (95%) with germline BRCA mutations had HGSC, which is somewhat higher than the 73.2% reported in a previous study. In contrast, only 1.6% of patients with non-HGSC had BRCA mutations, and 7.9% of these patients had germline mutations in other genes. This finding is in agreement with that of a previous study, which reported that germline BRCA mutations were detected in less than 10% of endometrioid carcinomas and had a very low frequency in clear cell carcinoma.\n\n    The incidence rates of EOC differ according to various geographic locations. Rates are highest in Western countries and lowest in Asian countries. The age-standardized incidence rate in Thailand has been reported at approximately 6.2 per 100000 people in 2018. Thus, the incidence of germline mutations in EOC may vary by ethnicity and country. Germline BRCA mutations were identified in 13% of Malaysian, 13% of Japanese and 17% of Taiwanese. A higher frequency has been reported in 23% of Indian patients, and even higher frequencies have been reported in Korean and Chinese patients (up to 26% and 28.5%, respectively). Different proportions of histologic subtypes are also a major variable. HGSC is the most common subtype worldwide with an incidence rate of 70%, but it is much less prevalent in Thai patients (20%-22%). The endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma subtypes are observed more frequently (up to 60%). The reason for the high prevalence of endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma in Thai patients is unknown. Geographic differences may be a possible explanation, as clear cell carcinoma is more prevalent in Asia than in Western countries.\n\n    In this study, the frequency of germline mutations in patients with risk factors was 31.7% overall and 24.4% for BRCA mutations but was 0% in patients without risk factors. According to our previous study, 30% of EOC patients were classified as high-risk for hereditary ovarian cancer. Most of our patients had non-HGSC and did not have other clinical risk factors. Therefore, the weighted estimated overall frequency of germline mutations in unselected patients should be only 9.5% overall and only 7.3% for BRCA mutations. This number is lower than reported in previous studies from Western countries and some countries in Asia. A much higher proportion of EOC patients who had no clinical risk factors, and HGSC, might be a plausible explanation for the lower incidence of germline BRCA mutations in this study. In general, if the estimated probability of harboring germline mutations is more than 10%, genetic testing is considered cost-effective. Nonetheless, genetic testing is rather uncommon in many countries including Thailand because of cost considerations, reimbursement and availability. Since the estimated frequency of germline mutations in unselected patients is below 10%, genetic testing in all EOC patients may not be cost-effective.\n\n    The strength of this study was that reliable and comprehensive NGS techniques were used to analyze BRCA genes and other genes associated with HR pathways. The limitation of this study was that not all EOC patients during the study period were included and not all were offered genetic testing. Selection bias might affect the reversed proportion between patients with and without risk factors in this study (73% vs 27%). The overall frequency of germline mutations in this study was presumed and estimated based on the 30% of patients with risk factors. Moreover, BRCA dysfunction by epigenetic silencing was not analyzed. Further studies with larger numbers of patients and multicenter trials should be conducted to better represent the incidence of germline mutations in the Thai population.\n\n    In conclusion, approximately one-third of EOC patients with risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer had germline mutations (24.4% had BRCA mutations and 7.3% had mutations in other genes). However, patients without risk factors did not have germline mutations. The weighted estimated overall frequency of germline mutations in unselected EOC patients was less than 10% and only 7.3% for BRCA mutations. Selected patients with the high-grade serous subtype or a significant family history of ovarian/breast cancers should be initially considered for further genetic analysis and intervention in countries with limited resources.\n\n    Genetic testing is widely recommended for all patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers. A 10%-15% incidence of germline BRCA mutations has been reported in unselected EOC patients. However, universal genetic testing in all patients may not be cost-effective if the estimated probability of harboring germline mutations is less than 10%. The incidence of germline mutations may vary across different countries and ethnicities. Different common histologic subtypes in various countries may be significant variables. The high-grade serous subtype is the most common subtype worldwide (approximately 70%), whereas it is less common in Thai EOC patients (rate of only 20%). Per this result, the incidence of germline mutations might be lower in unselected Thai EOC patients.\n\n    Different incidences of germline mutations in EOC patients among various countries may guide different recommendations for genetic testing. Universal genetic testing in all EOC patients may not be cost-effective in Thailand. The risk factors associated with the increased likelihood of having germline mutations should be evaluated.\n\n    The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of germline mutations in EOC patients and to compare the frequency in those with and without clinical risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer.\n\n    This cross-sectional study was conducted on 112 nonmucinous EOC patients including those with fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers who underwent primary surgery at our tertiary care hospital between November 2015 and February 2018. Patients were divided into two groups based on clinical risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer as follows: Age below 40 years, significant family history of cancer, synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer, and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). All patients who agreed to participate in this study received genetic counseling by a geneticist and provided informed consent. Comprehensive germline mutations were detected using next-generation sequencing.\n\n    Germline mutations were detected in 26 of 112 patients (23.2%); 20 patients (17.8%) had BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, but 6 patients (5.4%) had mutations in other genes including 1 with an MLH1, 1 with an MSH2, 1 with a RAD51C, 2 with an ATM and 1 with a CDH1 mutation. All mutations were detected in 26 of 82 patients with >= 1 risk factor (31.7%), but none were detected in the 30 patients without risk factors (P < 0.001). A significantly higher frequency of germline mutations was found in patients with a significant family history of cancer (56.3% and 10%, P < 0.001). Patients with a significant family history of ovarian cancer had a higher frequency of BRCA mutations than those with a family history of breast cancer (60% and 40.9%, respectively). HGSC was also associated with a higher frequency of germline mutations (40.8% and 9.5%, P < 0.001). Germline BRCA mutations were detected in 38.8% of patients with HGSC but in only 1.6% of those with non-HGSC. Other risk factors such as age below 40 years, personal history of breast cancer, and synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancer were not significantly different in terms of germline mutations (14.3% vs 23.5%, 33.3% vs 21%, 22.2% vs 22.3%, P > 0.05).\n\n    A significant family history of cancer and HGSC were the only two significant risk factors associated with a higher frequency of germline mutations. Germline BRCA mutations were detected in 38.8% of patients with HGSC but in only 1.6% of those with non-HGSC. According to the reverse proportion of histologic subtypes in Thai patients, the estimated overall frequency of germline mutations in unselected EOC patients should be only 9.5% overall and only 7.3% for BRCA mutations. These findings suggest the consideration of genetic testing in selected EOC patients in Thailand.\n\n    Although universal genetic testing in all EOC patients is recommended by various national professional societies, it may not apply in every country. The narrow availability of genetic testing, the high cost when not reimbursed, and the limited number of geneticists are major obstacles in Thailand. Selected EOC patients should initially be considered for genetic analysis. As the number of patients in this study is still small and since the study was conducted in only one tertiary hospital, it may not fully represent the Thai population. Further prospective studies with multicenter trials should be conducted. The incidence of germline mutations should be studied in unselected EOC Thai patients to identify significant risk factors. Furthermore, BRCA genes should not be the only focus of germline mutation studies, but these studies should also be expanded to include other homologous recombination and MMR genes.\n\n    Institutional review board statement: Institutional Review Board, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University.\n\n    Informed consent statement: All study participants provided informed written consent prior to study enrollment.\n\n    Conflict-of-interest statement: All the authors have no conflict of interest.\n\n    STROBE statement: The authors have read the STROBE Statement-checklist of items, and the manuscript was prepared and revised according to the STROBE Statement-checklist of items.\n\n    Manuscript source: Invited manuscript\n\n    Article in press: November 4, 2019\n\n    Peer-review started: March 4, 2019\n\n    First decision: April 11, 2019\n\n    Specialty type: Oncology\n\n    Country of origin: Thailand\n\n    Peer-review report classification\n\n    Grade A (Excellent): 0\n\n    Grade B (Very good): 0\n\n    Grade C (Good): C\n\n    Grade D (Fair): 0\n\n    Grade E (Poor): 0\n\n    P-Reviewer: Zhang XQ S-Editor: Yan JP L-Editor: A E-Editor: Liu MY",

        "Title": "    Clinical spectrum and pleiotropic nature of CDH1 germline mutations",
        "Abstract": "    CDH1 encodes E-cadherin, a key protein in adherens junctions. Given that E-cadherin is involved in major cellular processes such as embryogenesis and maintenance of tissue architecture, it is no surprise that deleterious effects arise from its loss of function. E-cadherin is recognised as a tumour suppressor gene, and it is well established that CDH1 genetic alterations cause diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer:the foremost manifestations of the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. However, in the last decade, evidence has emerged demonstrating that CDH1 mutations can be associated with lobular breast cancer and/or several congenital abnormalities, without any personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer. To date, no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. Remarkably, there are reports of mutations affecting the same nucleotide but inducing distinct clinical outcomes. In this review, we bring together a comprehensive analysis of CDH1-associated disorders and germline alterations found in each trait, providing important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying E-cadherin's pleiotropic effects. Ultimately, this knowledge will impact genetic counselling and will be relevant to the assessment of risk of cancer development or congenital malformations in CDH1 mutation carriers.",
        "Introduction": "    The human CDH1 gene codes for E-cadherin (ENSG00000039068), a cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein that acts as a critical invasion suppressor. During embryonic development, E-cadherin is the first adhesion molecule expressed at the 8-cell stage and is essential for the compaction of the morula and subsequent organisation of epithelial tissues. Homozygous E-cadherin -/- embryos show severe abnormalities before implantation and do not survive beyond the blastocyst stage. In adult epithelia, E-cadherin is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of tissue architecture and homeostasis. E-cadherin function is primarily achieved by homophilic binding of the extracellular domain of cadherins presented on neighbouring cells, forming adherens junctions. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin is connected to the actin cytoskeleton through various catenins (alpha, beta and p120), providing cell structural properties while mediating cellular signalling. We and others have demonstrated that E-cadherin regulates basic cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, apoptosis and invasion by orchestrating several proteins, namely Hippo and Src family kinase, and signalling pathways involving epidermal growth factor receptor, Notch, Integrin and Laminin.\n\n    Given the key role of E-cadherin in tissue homeostasis, the deleterious effects that can arise from E-cadherin loss are not surprising. Loss-of-function germline mutations in the CDH1 tumour-suppressor gene were first described in 1998 as the cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome (OMIM #137215). Since the initial report by Guilford et al, many studies have emerged supporting those findings and revealing that HDGC is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that encompasses an increased risk of two cancer types: diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC). Although DGC is the dominant tumour type in HDGC, other malignant neoplasms, as well as congenital malformations, have been described in families affected by this syndrome (figure 1). For that reason, LBC and oral facial clefts (OFCs) have been suggested as early indicators for CDH1 screening and early detection of HDGC.\n\n    Interestingly, with the scientific and technological advances of massive parallel sequencing and the availability of genetic panel testing, a growing body of evidence suggests that CDH1 germline mutations are causative of a disease spectrum independent of the HDGC manifestation. Consequently, we propose that CDH1 is a pleiotropic gene responsible for distinct clinical phenotypes.\n\n    In this report, we performed a comprehensive overview of the diseases most frequently associated with CDH1 germline alterations, as well as the type and functional consequences of the mutations found in each setting, which ultimately can provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying this phenomena. For that purpose, data were collected in the PubMed platform, using single or combined search terms such as CDH1, E-cadherin, CDH1/E-cadherin germline mutations, CDH1/E-cadherin variants, gastric cancer, CDH1 susceptibility, familial gastric cancer and HDGC, LBC, colorectal cancer (CRC), cleft lip/palate (CL/P), blepharocheilodontic syndrome (BCDS) and E-cadherin signalling. Available literature from April 1985 to September 2018 was selected and extensively scrutinised.\n\n    Defects in the Ca2+-dependent transmembrane protein E-cadherin are frequently associated with several human cancer types, in particular with gastric cancer. The major inherited form of gastric cancer, HDGC, was first identified in a large indigenous New Zealand Maori kindred with a causative germline mutation in CDH1. It is well established that CDH1 inactivating germline mutations underlie this highly penetrant cancer syndrome and are found in approximately 40% of families meeting the clinical criteria for HDGC. Of relevance, along with a strong aggregation of DGC cases, many HDGC families are also affected by LBC. Accordingly, the cumulative incidence of DGC by 80 years for CDH1 mutation carriers is estimated at 70% for male and 56% for females, and the probability of women developing LBC is 42%. CRC, appendiceal signet ring cell carcinomas (SRCCs) and CL/P have also been described in HDGC kindred. However, of these clinical manifestations, CL/P is the only one considered within the HDGC clinical definition.\n\n    In the HDGC clinical setting, CDH1 germline abnormalities are evenly distributed throughout the gene with no apparent genotype-phenotype correlation established. The great majority of the published germline mutations are expected to lead to truncated proteins or lack of mRNA expression, allowing a straightforward prediction of their pathogenicity. The most common mutation types are small insertions or deletions (38%). Others vary between splice site (21%), nonsense (17%) and large exonic deletions (9%). The missense fraction accounts for 16% of the mutations described so far. The clinical and functional impact of missense mutations still raises controversy among specialists because, in most cases, a full-length protein is preserved, and regular levels of E-cadherin expression are usually produced. As such, the identification of a CDH1 missense variant requires additional studies to determine E-cadherin functional status and, consequently, its putative pathogenicity.\n\n    The type and frequency of germline defects in HDGC families are constantly being re-evaluated. The latest review points to a total of 155 germline CDH1 mutations described across multiple ethnicities. Most are considered pathogenic (126/155), while a small proportion cannot be categorised in terms of their functional relevance (29/155) and are termed variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). Newly revised criteria and new methodological approaches to predict their pathogenic nature are thus needed for an improved classification system.\n\n    As an autosomal-dominant familial disorder, HDGC CDH1 mutations are inherited in only one allele. For initiation of the neoplastic process, somatic inactivation or downregulation of the second copy of the CDH1 gene must occur. Epigenetic causes seem to play an essential role in this process. Promoter hypermethylation is the most common established mechanism leading to biallelic CDH1 inactivation, while mutation or deletion of the second CDH1 allele is less frequently described.\n\n    The disease originates with the development of early gastric lesions characterised by spreading of isolated malignant cells. Precursor lesions of invasive gastric cancer have been identified as in situ SRCC or pagetoid spread of signet ring cells below the preserved epithelium. The pathology of such lesions is unique but not easy to recognise; therefore, their examination and confirmation by experienced pathologists is highly recommended. The presence of in situ lesions, pagetoid spread or multifocal intramucosal signet ring cells in the gastric mucosa provides substantial clues for the diagnosis and management of patients with HDGC, as well as for research. It is feasible that many in situ/early invasive lesions are transient, or remain indolent, and do not progress towards an advanced stage. Unfortunately, progression to invasive or advanced disease is unpredictable, limiting the utility of scheduled patient follow-up and surveillance. In light of the invasive and lethal nature of diffuse gastric carcinomas and the high degree of penetrance of CDH1 mutations, prophylactic total gastrectomy remains the recommended risk-reducing approach for HDGC family mutation carriers.\n\n    Recognition of the need for common terminology and management guidelines for this syndrome led to the establishment of the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium, constituted by a multidisciplinary team of experts in 1999. Over the last 19 years, this collaborative group, which includes gastroenterologists, oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, geneticists, nutritionists and molecular biologists, has been defining and improving the clinical criteria for early diagnosis of the disease and the identification of patients who should undergo germline CDH1 genetic screening. The latest revised criteria indicate that CDH1 testing should be applied in any case fulfilling one of the following criteria: (1) families with two or more documented cases of gastric cancer at any age, one with confirmed DGC; (2) personal history of DGC before the age of 40 years; and (3) personal or family history of DGC and LBC, with one diagnosed before the age of 50 years. Testing could also be considered in: (1) cases of bilateral LBC or family history of two or more cases of LBC, before the age of 50 years; (2) a personal or family history of CL/P in a patient with DGC; and (3) in situ signet ring cells and/or pagetoid spread of signet ring cells, as this feature is rarely seen in sporadic cases. Whenever possible, testing should start in an affected proband. If the affected proband is deceased, frozen-fixed or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (preferably normal, non-malignant tissue) may still be used as an alternative.\n\n    As noted above, carriers of CDH1 pathogenic mutations are advised to undergo a total prophylactic gastrectomy, regardless of the negative endoscopic findings. Some patients delay this decision due to personal, physical or psychological reasons and, in these cases, annual endoscopic surveillance should be employed. Approximately 60% of families that fulfil the current testing criteria for HDGC lack germline CDH1 mutations. These families remain genetically unexplained and may carry pathogenic mutations in other, yet unknown, gastric cancer susceptibility genes. Patients fulfilling the HDGC criteria, who have tested negative for CDH1 germline mutations, are advised to undergo intensive endoscopic screening with gastroenterologists familiar with HDGC. The same protocol should be followed by CDH1 VUS carriers. Importantly, all individuals undergoing endoscopic examination must be aware that it is possible that lesions at early stage will not be detected by random biopsies due to the multifocal nature of the disease. In addition, bilateral MRI of the breast, starting at age of 30 years, is recommended annually in women with a CDH1 mutation.\n\n    The CTNNA1 gene, which encodes for alpha-E-catenin, is a strong candidate to explain a minor portion of CDH1-negative HDGC families. Aside from its crucial role in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion, CTNNA1 has been found to be mutated in five HDGC families (five distinct mutations), corroborating the functional significance of CDH1 mutations and the importance of E-cadherin downstream signalling. Despite all the recent efforts in pursuing new candidate genes, CDH1 genetic alterations remain the central cause of HDGC.\n\n    Most hereditary cancer syndromes display specific organ sites preferentially affected by cancer. In this regard, LBC is the second most frequent cancer type associated with HDGC. In 2013, a study was carried out in 165 unrelated Ile-de-France index cases, selected based on personal and family history of gastric or breast cancers, and it was shown that 18 cases (11%) were CDH1 germline mutation carriers (18 different mutations). Three of the carriers were women with a personal history of bilateral LBC below 50 years of age. None of these cases presented family history of DGC in first-degree and second-degree relatives, and as such, they did not meet the HDGC criteria established at that time. Two of those women were subsequently diagnosed with DGC, while the third woman was subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with multiple biopsies. Despite no cancer foci being found in the biopsies, the patient underwent prophylactic gastrectomy, and an invasive DGC was identified.\n\n    Remarkably, in the last few years, a number of studies have arisen reporting early-onset LBC cases in CDH1 mutation carriers without any personal or family history of DGC, pinpointing CDH1 as a novel LBC-susceptibility gene. Moreover, HLBC was recently proposed to be an independent clinical entity associated with CDH1 germline alterations. According to the HDGC consensus guidelines, women diagnosed with bilateral LBC, with or without family history of LBC before the age of 50 years, or women diagnosed with unilateral LBC with family history of LBC with onset age at less of 45 years, are eligible for CDH1 genetic testing.\n\n    Currently, there are four high-penetrance genes identified to be genetically associated with increased breast cancer susceptibility: BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53 and CDH1. Germline mutations in BRCA1 and TP53 are predominantly associated with invasive ductal carcinoma, BRCA2 mutations are associated with both ductal and lobular tumours, while mutations in CDH1 are exclusively associated with LBC, in particular with the invasive subtype.\n\n    Invasive LBC is the second most common histological type of breast cancer, accounting for 5%-15% of invasive breast cancers, and is one of the few histological subtypes harbouring a distinct genetic alteration that is associated with a specific phenotype. Indeed, around 90% of invasive LBC display E-cadherin loss, either at the DNA, mRNA or protein level and, in the few tumours preserving expression, E-cadherin integrity is nonetheless impaired. In contrast, E-cadherin expression is usually unaffected in ductal breast carcinomas. Thus, E-cadherin decreased expression can be used as a molecular marker to distinguish ductal from lobular carcinomas.\n\n    Loss of E-cadherin expression contributes to the unique histopathological features shared by DGC and LBC. These tumours do not form a well-defined mass and are composed of relatively small, infiltrating and dyshesive epithelial cells, showing a high predisposition to metastasise to the gastrointestinal tract, gynaecological organs, meninges and peritoneal surface, resembling the DGC cells phenotype.\n\n    Common to both cancer types is also the fact that CDH1 germline mutations occur across the entire gene coding sequence. However, the type and frequency of the genetic alterations differ, with missense mutations constituting the most frequent alteration in HLBC. Of the 16 novel germline CDH1 variants that have been identified in families with LBC alone, there were six missense mutations (37.5%), three splice site mutations (18.7%), three deletions (18.7%), two insertions (13%), one nonsense mutation (6.2%) and one premature stop codon (6.2%) (reviewed in ref). Strikingly, five of these mutations have been previously detected in HDGC families, indicating that the same genetic alteration may induce distinct clinical outcomes in different genetic backgrounds and that other factors may have a role in the aetiology of both diseases.\n\n    It has long been speculated that CDH1 mutations could also predispose to other epithelial cancers. Indeed, some studies have reported cases of CRC in CDH1 mutation carriers. However, the inclusion of CRC as part of the HDGC disease spectrum is still controversial mostly due to the fact that only a small number of cases have been identified in HDGC families.\n\n    The proposal of a role for CDH1 in early onset CRC, and as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric cancer and CRC, dates back to 1999, when an early report described a CDH1 mutation carrier (c.49-2A>G) who developed CRC at the age of 30 years (table 1). In 1998, Guilford et al  had also identified two individuals harbouring CDH1 mutations, aged 30 years and 74 years, affected by CRC in a gastric cancer kindred. Furthermore, the retrospective analysis of eight families with inactivating germline CDH1 mutations suggested that CRC screening and counselling should be considered as the risk to develop CRC might be increased. In subsequent years, other studies emerged in which patients with CRC were identified in families with or without history of gastric cancer or E-cadherin germline mutations. Notably, on stratification of patients with CRC, the CDH1 c.1018A>G (p.Thr340Ala) missense variant was detected in two patients with CRC from families lacking gastric cancer cases, reinforcing that E-cadherin dysregulation may contribute to CRC development. In addition, the identification of a CDH1 missense mutation (c.1774G>A/ p.Ala592Thr) in two patients with colon cancer, from a family presenting segregation of this alteration with DGC and CRC, further suggested it could be implicated in CRC. Interestingly, some patients were identified with carcinomas with signet ring cell features, as usually observed in HDGC. An individual with SRCC of the colon was identified in a family with the 1225T>C (p.Trp409Arg) E-cadherin missense mutation, and a primary appendiceal SRCC was described in a CDH1-associated HDGC kindred with synchronous primary DGC. Altogether, at least 12 patients (seven distinct mutations) have already been identified with CDH1-associated CRC from nine families of distinct origins. However, in most cases, the number of patients with CRC identified in these families is not sufficient to include CRC screening in the surveillance of CDH1 mutation carriers.\n\n    The involvement of CDH1 in CRC development has received some support from studies unrelated to HDGC. More specifically, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identified the E-cadherin locus as a new susceptibility factor for developing CRC. In an attempt to identify additional CRC cases with familial predisposition, comprehensive screening for mutations associated with CRC was performed in 152 patients, resulting in the identification of a single CDH1 mutation. In another report, a CDH1 polymorphism was also shown to be a risk factor for CRC development. Noteworthy, a large-scale study identified three new susceptibility loci, including the CDH1 locus, in patients with ulcerative colitis (a common form of inflammatory bowel disease). These data reinforce that disruption of E-cadherin could also lead to distinct alterations in the colon epithelia, from benign to malignant lesions, though this is a rare event.\n\n    Overall, the evidence implicating CDH1 germline mutations in CRC, either dependent or independent of the HDGC cancer spectrum, is still scarce. Accordingly, in current clinical practice, no recommendations are yet approved for CRC screening in CDH1 mutation carriers. Future studies will clarify whether CRC occurs occasionally in HDGC families or if it is a bona fide CDH1-associated disorder.\n\n    OFCs are a heterogeneous group of congenital disorders that result from complex interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors, which affect the lips and oral cavity, causing isolated cleft palate and cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Although variable among populations, the incidence of CL/P is supposed to be in the range of 1 in 700 to 1 in 1000 newborns, ranking among the most prevalent birth defects. Affected individuals display high morbidity, experiencing severe feeding, hearing, speech and psychological problems. Around 70% of CL/P cases are estimated to be non-syndromic, occurring as isolated entities in the absence of other congenital anomalies and, as such, intensive research has focused in trying to identify candidate genes and the underlying molecular pathways.\n\n    The biological implication of E-cadherin dysfunction in the aetiology of non-syndromic OFC comes as no surprise, given its overexpression in the critical stages of lip and palate development, namely in the frontonasal prominence at 4 and 5 weeks of embryogenesis and in the lateral and medial nasal prominences at 6 weeks. The increased incidence of CL/P cases in CDH1 mutation carriers, when compared with that in the general population, further supports the involvement of E-cadherin in the molecular basis of this congenital defect.\n\n    In 2006, it was first reported the association of two different splice site CDH1 mutations, both affecting the E-cadherin extracellular domain, with OFC in two HDGC families. These findings were subsequently corroborated by Kluijt and coworkers, who described three variants associated with seven cases of CL/P in Dutch HDGC families carrying CDH1 germline mutations.\n\n    Ever since, many studies have shed light on the nature of CDH1 mutations associated with CL/P cases, their penetrance and to what extent the types of mutations or mechanisms lead to either cancer, CL/P or both phenotypes. In a cohort of 81 children with non-syndromic OFC, Vogelaar and coworkers identified three CDH1 missense mutations shown to be functionally relevant in four patients with unknown family history of DGC or LBC. Through exome sequencing, Bureau et al  were also able to identify one common damaging CDH1 mutation in three distant relatives affected with non-syndromic OFC, further highlighting the contribution of E-cadherin dysfunction in the genesis of this congenital defect. However, the definite proof came out when 221 Brazilian probands were sequenced and, when compared with that of non-familial controls, an overall increased CDH1 mutational burden among probands from non-syndromic CL/P families was found. Ultimately, this study was able to establish a consistent role of rare, moderately penetrant, loss of function CDH1 variants in OFC. Indeed, the penetrance of CL/P in CDH1 mutation carriers has been correlated with CDH1 promoter methylation arising as a second hit.\n\n    Very recently, a large whole-exome sequencing study in a cohort of 72 multigenerational families with non-syndromic CL/P revealed 10 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in five different genes, CDH1 (2), CTNND1 (5), PLEKHA7 (1), PLEKHA5 (1) and ESRP2 (1), which are functionally linked in the assembly of the epithelial cadherin/catenin complex. These genes were targeted for sequencing in a second non-syndromic CL/P cohort of 497 individuals from 444 families and 10 distinct mutations were identified, providing undisputable evidence for the role of E-cadherin and epithelial adhesion in the molecular mechanism underlying OFC. Notably, the CDH1 variants identified in this study were present in individuals with CL/P alone, with a single exception in a family where one case of gastric cancer was recently diagnosed.\n\n    Other association studies have also described CDH1 polymorphisms associated to non-syndromic CL/P. In a Brazilian study, involving 500 individuals with non-syndromic clefts and an equal number of unrelated controls, an association between two genetic variants in CDH1 and susceptibility to non-syndromic CL/P was found. A couple of years later, Song and Zhang revealed that the specific single nucleotide polymorphism rs16260 (C>A), located upstream of the transcriptional start site of the CDH1 promoter, was associated with an increased risk of cleft palate alone in a Chinese Han population.\n\n    To date, 23 different CDH1 mutations have been reported in the literature associated with CL/P, seven of which were described in families also segregating gastric cancer (table 2). Of note is the fact that among the CDH1 mutational repertoire, some mutations increase the risk of CL/P alone, whereas others increase the risk of gastric cancer too. While it is plausible that CDH1 mutations leading to higher invasiveness (in vitro) could increase the risk of gastric cancer, it has been speculated that haploinsufficiency during critical stages of embryonic development could lead to OFC. The current landscape of CDH1 germline mutations associated with gastric cancer, CL/P or both, does not suggest any preferential type or location of CDH1 germline mutations along the different domains, preventing any sort of differential patient management (figure 2). Moreover, some expert groups:like the Dutch Working Group on Hereditary Gastric Cancer:believe that future parents of CDH1 mutation carriers are not required to be informed regarding the risk of CL/P in their offspring as an integral part of genetic counselling. Nonetheless, occurrence of CL/P abnormalities should be reported in families with HDGC history, so careful counselling can be offered.\n\n    Considering all the evidence provided throughout the past decades, the contribution of CDH1 variants to OFC aetiopathology is unquestionable. However, the incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of non-syndromic CL/P awards this congenital trait with a complexity that needs to be addressed through a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n    Data implicating E-cadherin deregulation in other congenital disorders is growing, further validating the essential role of E-cadherin in human embryological development. BCDS (OMIM #119580), which is a rare birth disorder, was recently added to the set of CDH1-related diseases (figure 3). This syndrome, first described by Elschnig in 1912, usually occurs in sporadic patients but is also reported in large non-consanguinous families, suggesting an autosomal dominant segregation.\n\n    BCDS is characterised by bilateral CL/P, which is its major feature, dental anomalies (such as conical teeth and tooth agenesis), hair defects and eyelid malformations, namely ectropion of the lower eyelids, euryblepharon and lagophthalmia. In addition, other clinical features, such as imperforate anus, neural tube defect, hypothyroidism due to thyroid gland aplasia or hypoplasia and syndactyly have also been reported in a few patients. Despite the clinical burden and the severe impact on patients' lives, the causes of such complex condition are yet to be uncovered.\n\n    In an attempt to understand the molecular basis of this disease, Freitas et al have screened several genes implicated in syndromes with a similar phenotype, namely TP63 and IRF6 (ectodermal dysplasia syndromes), FOXE1 (orofacial clefting associated with thyroid agenesis) and TBX10 and OSR2 (orofacial clefting associated with thyroid agenesis genes). However, they failed to identify a clear causative mutation. Interestingly, in 2016, Nishi et al  identified a CDH1 missense mutation in a patient presenting right choanal atresia and several dysmorphic facial features, such as CL/P. Subsequently, two other independent studies, published in 2017 and 2018, used an exome sequencing approach on patients with BCDS and also found mutations in CDH1 and in one other member of the cadherin-catenin complex, CTNND1. Ghoumid et al  described three deletions and two heterozygous missense mutations in the CDH1 gene, and three CTNND1 truncating mutations, while Kievit's team identified seven CDH1 variants (four missense and three deletions), as well as two truncating mutations and one missense variant in CTNND1 (table 3). The first group also detected two asymptomatic parents carrying either a CDH1 or a CTNND1 mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance of the genotype.\n\n    Of note, all CDH1 mutations described in this context affect the E-cadherin extracellular domain, possibly impairing its ability to homodimerise and, consequently, interfering with its adhesive function. In particular, both studies detected missense mutations at the conserved Asp254-Gln255-Asn-256-Asp257 'linker' region that comprises a calcium ion-binding site between extracellular domains 1 and 2. As a result, the interaction of these residues with calcium ions may be disrupted, perturbing protein conformation. The CDH1 splice site variant c.1320+1G>C disturbs the consensus donor motif AGgt, which is critical for splicing, and induces exon 9 skipping. This leads to the removal of a major portion of the extracellular domain 3 (EC3), impairing its function. Furthermore, the mutation c.1361_1363del (p.Val454del) removes the hydrophobic cluster located at the c-terminal region of a beta-strand of the EC3 domain.\n\n    While Ghoumid et al reported that BCDS CDH1 missense variants behave similarly to HDGC-associated ones, with perinuclear accumulation and accelerated E-cadherin degradation, Kievit et al described a dominant negative effect of BCDS CDH1 variants. The researchers transfected cells with GFP-WT CDH1 and different SNAP-tagged CDH1 variants (including two HDGC-related mutations for comparison) and observed that, in the case of BCDS variants, mutant proteins dimerise with WT proteins and interfere with the formation of adherens junctions, impairing cell-cell adhesion.\n\n    The CTNND1 truncating variants affect p120-catenin isoforms 1-3. These mutations result in premature stop codons, which activate the nonsense-mediated RNA decay mechanism, leading to mRNA degradation and subsequent haploinsufficiency. Kievit et al also identified a missense mutation that affects the highly conserved H3 helix in the fifth armadillo repeat of CTNND1, which is essential for the interaction between p120-catenin and E-cadherin's cytoplasmic tail. The disruption of p120-catenin/E-cadherin binding destabilises E-cadherin at the membrane and makes E-cadherin available for interaction with proteins from the endocytic machinery, like clathrin adapter proteins and Hakai, that target E-cadherin for degradation. Although no genotype-phenotype correlation was found, a general observation from both studies was that patients with CTNND1 mutations have milder symptoms when compared with patients with CDH1 variants. For example, clefting is less frequent, as is hypothyroidism, neural tube defects and imperforate anus. In the cases where neither CDH1 nor CTNND1 mutations were detected, patients have even less severe features.\n\n    Taking these findings into account, it is clear that the function of E-cadherin goes far beyond its invasion and tumour suppressor role. Abnormal E-cadherin expression and signalling can drive the formation of irregular morphological structures, such as defects of palate, lips, eyelids, teeth and neural tube, expanding the clinical spectrum of CDH1-associated diseases to severe congenital malformations.",

        "Conclusion": "    Compelling evidence suggests that CDH1/E-cadherin is involved in multiple tissue processes, and its dysfunction can result in a plethora of clinical manifestations. It is now widely accepted that DGC and LBC, as well as congenital malformations, such as CL/P and BCDS, are part of the CDH1-disease spectrum. Thus, CDH1 is emerging as a pleiotropic gene.\n\n    Pleiotropy is the phenomenon by which the same gene can result in a plethora of effects. In fact, 16.9% of genes and 4.6% of genetic variants have pleiotropic consequences, as shown by the GWAS catalogue. Although the occurrence of pleiotropy is a central phenomena for evolution and has been recognised for over 100 years, the mechanisms by which a single gene can affect multiple traits are still far from being fully understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pleiotropic effect of a gene at the molecular level. One interesting explanation is the presence of different protein domains exerting distinct cellular functions. However, in the case of E-cadherin, this is not a valid explanation as mutations affecting the same nucleotide can induce different disorders. Instead, we propose that CDH1 pleiotropy is related to the specific consequences of each particular mutation. Indeed, we have demonstrated that specific mutations cause E-cadherin to interact differently with its binding partners, activating different signalling pathways and inducing different cell behaviours. Notably, the same mutation can be identified in either DGC families or non-syndromic CL/P cases, suggesting that additional factors such as genetic background may have a role in the development of both diseases.\n\n    Overall, this collected knowledge changes the paradigm of E-cadherin impact that, until recently, was only focused on hereditary cancer-predisposing syndromes. From now on, birth defects and congenital anomalies, which tended to be disregarded by clinicians and many researchers, will draw more attention and will be a significant part of genetic (familial) analysis. It is expected that the development of novel tools will improve genetic testing and reveal the biological mechanisms underlying pleiotropic outcomes. These findings will have implications in management of individuals with CDH1 germline alterations and will be crucial to evaluate their risk of cancer or of having a neonate affected by congenital malformations.\n\n    Contributors: JF was responsible for study concept and design.

        "Title": "    E-Cadherin Destabilization Accounts for the Pathogenicity of Missense Mutations in Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer",
        "Abstract": "    E-cadherin is critical for the maintenance of tissue architecture due to its role in cell-cell adhesion. E-cadherin mutations are the genetic cause of Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) and missense mutations represent a clinical burden, due to the uncertainty of their pathogenic role. In vitro and in vivo, most mutations lead to loss-of-function, although the causal factor is unknown for the majority. We hypothesized that destabilization could account for the pathogenicity of E-cadherin missense mutations in HDGC, and tested our hypothesis using in silico and in vitro tools. FoldX algorithm was used to calculate the impact of each mutation in E-cadherin native-state stability, and the analysis was complemented with evolutionary conservation, by SIFT. Interestingly, HDGC patients harbouring germline E-cadherin destabilizing mutants present a younger age at diagnosis or death, suggesting that the loss of native-state stability of E-cadherin accounts for the disease phenotype. To elucidate the biological relevance of E-cadherin destabilization in HDGC, we investigated a group of newly identified HDGC-associated mutations (E185V, S232C and L583R), of which L583R is predicted to be destabilizing. We show that this mutation is not functional in vitro, exhibits shorter half-life and is unable to mature, due to premature proteasome-dependent degradation, a phenotype reverted by stabilization with the artificial mutation L583I (structurally tolerated). Herein we report E-cadherin structural models suitable to predict the impact of the majority of cancer-associated missense mutations and we show that E-cadherin destabilization leads to loss-of-function in vitro and increased pathogenicity in vivo.",
        "Introduction": "    E-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein comprised of five extracellular cadherin-type repeats, one transmembrane region and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. E-cadherin is expressed primarily in epithelial cells and is the major component of Adherens Junctions (AJ). These junctions cluster, via homophilic interactions, through the extracellular domains of calcium-dependent E-cadherin molecules, on the surface of homotypic neighbour cells.\n\n    The role of E-cadherin in tumour development is well described, and its loss of expression is a hallmark in carcinomas. Experimental evidence supports a role for the E-cadherin complex both in suppressing invasion and metastasis formation. Loss of E-cadherin expression is frequently associated to genetic events such as splice site and truncation mutations caused by insertions, deletions, and nonsense mutations, in addition to missense mutations. In sporadic diffuse gastric cancer, alterations in the gene encoding E-cadherin (CDH1) are found preferentially in exons 7 to 9, while in lobular breast cancers they are spread along the gene, with no preferential hotspot. Missense mutations are found in these two types of sporadic cancer and also in synovial sarcomas.\n\n    Familial aggregation of Diffuse Gastric Cancer (DGC) represents 10% of the cases of Gastric Cancer (GC), and only 1-3% are hereditary. From these familial cases, Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is defined by stringent criteria that were defined by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) in 1999: (1) two or more documented cases of diffuse gastric cancer in first/second degree relatives, with at least one diagnosed before the age of 50; or (2) three or more cases of documented diffuse gastric cancer in first/second degree relatives, independently of age. Early Onset Diffuse Gastric Cancer (EODGC) is considered when an isolated individual is diagnosed with DGC with less then 45 years of age. Germline CDH1 mutations are found in 30% of the HDGC cases. The association of CDH1 mutations and familial gastric cancer was first described by Guilford et al in 1998 and since then many studies reported different types of CDH1 mutations in HDGC. Among all reported CDH1 germline mutations, 77.9% are nonsense, splice-site and frameshift mutations (predicted to produce premature termination codons) and 22.1% are missense mutations. Mutations that generate PTC are normally deleterious, the patients are considered high risk carriers, and are advised to have prophylactic total gastrectomy. The pathogenicity of missense mutations is not straightforward, and these alterations are commonly referred as Unclassified Sequence Variants (USVs) due to the lack of stringent criteria to evaluate their impact. Several parameters have been taken into account for the classification of E-cadherin USVs in HDGC: 1) co-segregation of the mutation with DGC (within pedigrees); 2) mutation frequency in the healthy control population; 3) mutation recurrence (in independent families). Segregation analysis is often impossible, with a small number of affected cases available for molecular diagnosis, and the absence of clinical information is a limiting step to infer the pathogenic significance of these mutations. To circumvent this limitation we have previously developed in vitro functional assays to evaluate the functional impact of E-cadherin germline missense mutations. However, such studies implicate lab specific experimental conditions, namely cell biology assays, and they are time consuming to use in routine. In silico predictions are reliable and fast analysis that one can use to predict the impact of point mutations, especially when structural information is available.\n\n    In this work, we explored the potential of structure-based in silico predictions to evaluate the impact of E-cadherin missense mutations, found in hereditary and sporadic cancer. Our analysis was based on the calculation of native-state stability changes induced by each variant (DeltaDeltaG = DeltaGWT-DeltaGMut), obtained by the protein design FoldX algorithm. Interestingly, the group of patients harbouring destabilizing mutations (DeltaDeltaG>0.8 kcal/mol) is characterized by a younger age at diagnosis or death by DGC, suggesting that the loss of E-cadherin native-state stability contributes to the disease phenotype. Using a cellular model, we analysed the phenotype of E-cadherin destabilization, and found that when a mutation induces decreased native-state stability, E-cadherin is prematurely degraded by the proteasome, exhibits shorter half-life, resulting in loss of the adhesive function. Altogether, our results suggest that destabilization accounts for the pathogenicity of E-cadherin missense mutations found in HDGC.",
        "Methods": "    E-cadherin variants associated to HDGC or EODGC were collected from the literature, and somatic variants were collected from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). Three new E-cadherin sequence variants where reported to our lab for functional analysis: E185V, S232C and L583R. Recently, L583R was reported, with functional data associated.\n\n    E-cadherin-related PDBs were identified using automatic search with Swiss Model Repository (http://swissmodel.expasy.org). Sequence alignment of human E-cadherin and each of the sequences used for the different models was performed with M-coffee (http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/play?name=mcoffee). Images were prepared with Pymol. After analysing sequence and structural homology, three PDBs were selected to use as models: Xenopus C-cadherin ectodomain (PDB 1L3W), mouse E-cadherin prodomain (PDB 1OP4) and the mouse beta-catenin interacting domain (PDB 1I7X).\n\n    Using FoldX (http://foldx.crg.es/) command Buildmodel we built three different models (prodomain, extracellular and cytoplasmic); the three structures were humanized by substitution of each different aminoacid. The resulting structure was optimized using the command RepairPDB and the energies where analysed with Stability or AnalyseComplex commands. The disease-associated mutations were generated with the Buildmodel command, each mutation repeated in five runs. The energies are an automatic output in FoldX, and the native-state stability change, DeltaDeltaG, between WT and mutant (DeltaDeltaG = DeltaGWT-DeltaGMut) is also generated in a separate file, with the corresponding standard deviations, and all the energetic penalties associated to each mutation. Only mutations with DeltaDeltaG>0.8 kcal/mol were considered deleterious.\n\n    We used SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) to evaluate the conservation of each aminoacid substitution, as previously described, using the Blink feature of GI: 31073. Only mutations with a score below 0,05 were considered to be Intolerant.\n\n    ProP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ProP/) was used to evaluate if mutations could have an effect on prodomain cleavage.\n\n    E-cadherin WT cDNA was cloned in pIRES2-EGFP vector according to manufacture instructions (Clontech, Takara Bio) and mutations E185V, S232C, L583R and L583I hE-cadherin were induced by site directed mutagenesis as described previously. The empty vector (Mock) was used as control.\n\n    CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells (ATCC number: CCL-61) were grown in Alfa-MEM medium (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen). Cells were sporadically evaluated for mycoplasm contamination by imunofluorescence with DAPI. Cells were transfected with 1 ug of each of the vectors encoding the different forms of E-cadherin (WT, E185V, S232C, L583R and L583I) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacture procedure. For stable cell line establishment, cells were selected by antibiotic resistance to 5 microg/ml blasticidin (Gibco, Invitrogen). All cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 C.\n\n    Transiently transfected CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells (ATCC number: CCL-61) were subjected to flow citometry, using GFP fluorescence measurement, to evaluate the transfection efficiency before each experiment. For the slow aggregation assay, wells of 96-well-plate were coated with 50 microl of agar solution (100 mg Bacto-Agar in 15 ml of sterile PBS). Cells were detached with trypsin and suspended in culture medium. A suspension of 1x105 cells/ml was prepared and 2x104 cells were seeded in each well. The plate was incubated at 37 C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 for 48 h. Aggregation was evaluated in an inverted microscope (4x magnification) and photographed with a digital camera.\n\n    Cell lysates were obtained with Catenin lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein quantification was done by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For each sample, 25 microg of protein was loaded, separated in 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.5% Tween-20 in PBS. Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies against E-cadherin (1:1000; BD Biosciences), actin (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and alpha-tubulin (1:10000; Sigma). Sheep anti-mouse (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) or donkey anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as secondary antibodies, followed by ECL detection (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Immunoblots were quantified in Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).\n\n    Cells were grown to a confluent monolayer, detached with Versene (Gibco, Invitrogen) and resuspended in ice cold PBS with 0.05 mg/ml CaCl2. A suspension of 5x105 cells was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm 4 C, and washed in PBS with 0.05 mg/ml CaCl2 3%BSA. Cells were incubated for 60 minutes with a primary antibody against E-cadherin, HECD1 (Zymed Laboratories) at 1:100 dilution. Cells were washed twice and then incubated with anti-mouse biotinilated (Dako) at 1:100 dilution. Cells were washed twice and then incubated with streptavidin PE-CY5 (BD Pharmingen) at 1:40 dilution. Finally, cells were washed, resuspended in 500 microl of PBS, and 50000 cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (Coulter Epics XL-MCL). Data was analyzed with WinMDI software.\n\n    For Immunofluorescence and microscopy, cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown to about 80% confluence, fixed in ice-cold methanol for 15 minutes, washed 2 times with PBS, and incubated with primary antibody, diluted in PBS 5%BSA, for 60 minutes at room temperature. Primary antibodies used: mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-Calnexin (Stressgen). Secondary antibodies used: Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse (1:500; Invitrogen); Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit (1:500; Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides, using Vectashield with DAPI for nuclear detection (Vector Laboratories). Image acquisition was performed on Carl Zeiss Apotome Axiovert 200 M Fluorescence Microscope using 40x objectives. Images were acquired with Axiocam HRm camera and processed by software Axiovison version 4.8.\n\n    For the protein synthesis inhibition, cells were treated with 25 microM of Cycloheximide for 8 h and 16 h, and the amount of total E-cadherin was analyzed by WB as described previously. For the proteasome inhibition assay, cells were seeded in 6 well plates, grown to approximately 80% of confluence, and incubated for 16 h with 10 microM MG132 (CalBioChem). Cell lysates were analysed by WB as described previously.",
        "Results": "    There are few human E-cadherin (hE-cad) structures available, and they only cover small portions of the protein (Table S1). Using automatic search of Swiss Model Repository, we found that PDB 1L3W, annotated for the full length extracellular domain of xenopus EP-cadherin (EP-cad), is highly homologous to the same domain in human E-cadherin. We analysed sequence homology by alignment using M-coffee, a multiple sequence alignment that combines the output of several multiple sequence alignment packages (PCMA, Poa, Mafft, Muscle, T-Coffee, ClustalW, ProbCons, DialignTX). Figure 1A shows the alignment of the two extracellular domain sequences. The red brick regions represent perfect agreement among the methods used, representing highly similar sequences. To build the model structure, we removed regions with no similarity (Figure 1A, stars), and limited the model to regions with reliable alignment (black arrow, Figure 1A). The xenopus structure was humanized as described in Material and Methods and Figure 1B shows the structural alignment of hE-cad EC1-EC2 domains (from PDB 2O72) and EC1-EC2 domains of the xenopus derived structural model. The two structures are nearly superimposed, indicating that the similarity between the extracellular domains of human E-cadherin and xenopus EP-cadherin is not only at the sequence level but also at the structural level. The model structure of human E-cad exhibits compatible energies with the structure from xenopus, with a slight decrease of free energy (DeltaG) obtained for the model (DeltaGreal = 559.99 kcal/mol and DeltaGmodel = 531.77 kcal/mol), indicating that the humanization doesn't introduce extra clashes. Recently, a structure of the mouse extracellular domain was released (PDB 3Q2V, Table S1), and we also used this structure as a model, as a way to refine the results obtained with the xenopus model.\n\n    We established two other models, covering the Prodomain (PDB 1OP4, from mouse N-cadherin) and the beta-catenin cytoplasmic domain (PDB 1I7X, from mouse E-cadherin), using the same methodology. Altogether, the three models cover most of the protein structure (Figure 1C): the prodomain model covers positions 28-117, the extracellular models positions 155-697 and the beta-catenin cytoplasmic domain covers 782-838. At the level of the juxtamembrane domain, one structure is annotated, comprising the interacting surface between E-cadherin and p120. This structure contains a small, 18 aminoacids long peptide (covering positions 756-773 on hE-cad), with very low structural content, factors that decrease the reliability of the energy calculations, so we discarded this structure from the analysis.\n\n    E-cadherin mutations are not only the genetic cause of HDGC, but they are also frequently found in different types of sporadic cancers. We analyzed in silico the impact of all cancer-associated E-cadherin missense mutations that localize to the regions covered by the structural models generated: 22 germline mutations found in the settings of HDGC and EODGC, and 57 found in sporadic cancers. Germline E-cadherin USVs were collected from the literature, and some are personal communications of our lab. Some HDGC/EODGC mutations are not possible to model, due to the lack of structural information (e.g. the ones localized in the juxtamembrane domain of E-cadherin), and were not included in this analysis. Somatic mutations were collected from the Cancer Genome Project database, and contain mutations found in gastric and lobular breast cancer (the only two types of cancer associated to HDGC), but also other types of cancer such as synovial sarcoma or bile duct carcinoma (Table S2).\n\n    Using the structural models described previously, we used FoldX to generate each of the cancer associated USVs, and evaluated their native-state stability, DeltaG (commonly referred as total energy for simplicity). The energetic difference between the WT reference and the corresponding mutant (DeltaDeltaG = DeltaGWT-DeltaGMut) was calculated for the 22 HDGC/EODGC E-cadherin USVs localized to the regions covered by the model structures, and the results are listed in Table 1. When DeltaDeltaG is negative, this reflects a gain of native-state stability in the mutant form; when it is positive, it implies that the mutant is less stable then the WT reference. Previous studies in other proteins have shown that stability changes calculated with FoldX algorithm below 0.8 kcal/mol are within the error change of the software, and are thus considered to be non-significant. Accordingly, we only considered mutations to be destabilizing when they induce energy changes above 0.8 kcal/mol. In Figure 2A, mutations above the scheme are destabilizing, while the bottom ones are structurally tolerated. It is clear that destabilizing mutations are spead along the protein, with no preferential domain affected.\n\n    The prodomain of hE-cad is cleaved during maturation, and if this is not accomplished, E-cadherin adhesive function is impaired. For the mutations localized in this domain, we evaluated the impact in total energy with FoldX, the conservation with SIFT, and also evaluated if the interference with the prodomain cleavage site with ProP (details in Materials and Methods). We found that both hereditary (G62V and T118R) and sporadic (P30T, G62D, H92Y, H121R and H123Y) mutations localized in E-cadherin prodomain are structurally tolerated, as predicted by FoldX (Table S3). When we analyse the impact based on conservation using SIFT, we also found that none of the mutations was considered deleterious, because their degree of conservation is low (Table S3). These results indicate that the pathogenicity of E-cadherin USVs localized in the prodomain is likely not dependent on destabilization. We also found no effect on the cleavage of the propeptide, as predicted by ProP (data not shown). Accordingly, we believe that the pathogenicity of E-cadherin mutations in this domain can result from the interference with the docking of proteins involved in prodomain processing, impossible to predict in silico.\n\n    Hereditary E-cadherin USVs span the full length of the extracellular domain, while sporadic mutations are predominantly found in EC2-EC3, as in accordance with the hotspot previously described in exons 7-9. From the total 18 germline HDGC/EODGC mutations localized in this domain, we found that 10 have a significant structural impact in the protein (Table 1). Approximately half of the sporadic mutations are also destabilizing (Table S3), independently of the EC domain where they are localized, suggesting that native-state destabilization may be associated to a substantial fraction of sporadic cancers involving E-cadherin loss by point mutation.\n\n    Only three mutations are localized in the region mapped by the model of the cytoplasmic beta-catenin binding domain (P799R, V832M, S838G): the first two identified in the HDGC/EODGC setting and the other one sporadic, found in ovary carcinoma. For these mutations we analysed the binding energy between E-cadherin and beta-catenin and found that none of them significantly alters the binding affinity of beta-catenin, according to FoldX prediction. This is in accordance with the in vitro results showing that the hereditary mutation V832M efficiently binds beta-catenin, and its pathogenicity seems to be dependent on the inability of the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex to bind alpha-catenin.\n\n    We collected all the predictions and functional in vitro data of HDGC/EODGC mutations and analysed the reliability of the predictors used (Table 1). We classified the results from the predictions as: True Positive (TP) when the mutation is predicted as deleterious in silico (either by FoldX or SIFT) and exhibit loss of function in vitro; True Negative (TN) when the mutation is predicted as tolerated in silico and is functional in vitro; False Positive (FP) when the mutation is predicted as deleterious in silico but is functional in vitro; and False Negative (FN) when the mutation is predicted as tolerated in silico but exhibits in vitro loss of function. TP and TN are positive results, meaning that the predictors are able to detect the mutation impact in function; FP and FN represent their degree of failure. We found that both algorithms are able to predict the functional impact of up to 70% of the germline HDGC/EODGC mutations (11 out of 16 mutations), with predictions overlapping for half of the mutations (Table 1, Figure 2B).\n\n    We analysed the data available for the germline HDGC/EODGC mutations carriers and, although the information is limited, we found that the most complete set of data is the age of onset or death associated to DGC. When we box-plot this data, grouping \"Destabilizing\" and \"Non-destabilizing\" mutation carriers, we observe an evident younger age of disease onset (diagnosis or death) for the first group (Figure 2D), suggesting that native-state destabilization accounts for the earlier development of DGC.\n\n    To determine the biological significance of E-cadherin destabilization, we used as model system three newly identified E-cadherin germline missense mutations reported to our lab for functional characterization: E185V, S232C and L583R, the later recently described in the literature. The in silico analysis described previously was performed for these three new mutations and the results are included in Table 1 (below the dark line). Mutations E185V and S232C are structurally tolerated, with DeltaDeltaG = 0.29 kcal/mol and -0.9 kcal/mol respectively (Table 1), considered insignificant regarding the impact in structure. Mutation S232C promotes a decrease in energy, stabilizing the protein, and this is due to the loss of the high energy of a Serine buried OH group, which is not involved in an H-bond, and to the accommodation of the sidechain of Cysteine. Mutation L583R induces destabilization, with DeltaDeltaG = 2.72 kcal/mol, reflecting the dramatic change from a hydrophobic to hydrophilic aminoacid, that results in an Arginine not able to form H-bonds, being unfavourably buried.\n\n    In vitro functional assays were performed for the above-mentioned HDGC/EODGC mutations, and we found a perfect correlation between the functionality in vitro and the presence/absence of structural impact: E185V and S232C retain the adhesive function of E-cadherin, and are able to form tight cellular aggregates, while L583R exhibits a clear scattered pattern, resembling Mock cells (Figure 3A), indicating that E185V and S232C are non-pathogenic and L583R is pathogenic.\n\n    When we analysed E-cadherin expression in the different cell lines, we found that the total amount of mutant L583R is lower that the WT expression under the same conditions, while mutations E185V and S232C, retain normal levels (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the band corresponding to L583R is retained in the gel, indicating that L583R is not able to properly mature (immature form of E-cadherin is 130 kDa, mature is 120 kDa) and flow cytometry results show that it is less expressed in the plasma membrane (Figure 3C).\n\n    When protein maturation fails, this commonly results in Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) retention of immature protein. To test whether L583R was indeed retained as immature, we analysed if it is retained in the ER by co-immunofluorescence with the ER marker calnexin (Figure 4A), and found that part of the L583R signal is superimposed with the ER marker, indicating increased ER retention.\n\n    To understand if destabilization could be detected in vitro, we analysed the stability of L583R in the cell, evaluating its turnover. We blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide and found that L583R is soon degraded, as evaluated by its residual expression soon after 8 h of protein synthesis inhibition, in contrast to WT and the other mutants that are still highly expressed in the same condition (Figure 4B), indicating that L583R is unstable in the cell. The presence of immature band in WT or mutant E-cadherin samples (top band, Figure 4B) is due to the overload of protein resulting from transient transfection.\n\n    Unstable or misfolded proteins are tightly regulated by Protein Quality Control mechanisms that protect the cell by directing newly synthesized unfolded proteins for degradation in the proteasome. To address if this is the case for L583R, we inhibited the proteasome activity with MG132 and observed that, despite the different initial levels of E-cadherin, the expression of mutant L583R is completely restored upon treatment (Figure 4C), indicating that it is prematurely degraded by the proteasome after synthesis, as previously described for other juxtamembranar HDGC-associated E-cadherin mutations. Interestingly, when proteasome degradation is inhibited, there is an accumulation of immature E-cad in all cell lines, manifesting the importance of the proteasome in the regulation of newly synthesized E-cad, independently of being mutated or not.\n\n    To further validate the in silico predictions, we analysed the phenotype of a reverted destabilized mutation by inducing a structurally tolerated alteration in the same position of the mutant form of E-cadherin. Using FoldX, we calculated the impact of each possible alteration in position 583 and found that the alteration inducing less destabilization was L583I (DeltaDeltaG = 0.56 kcal/mol, as predicted using the mouse model, Table S3). Interestingly, this mutation retains the adhesive function of E-cadherin, resulting in compact cell aggregates (Figure 4D), and is not destabilized in vitro, exhibiting cicloheximide resistance comparable to the WT form (Figure 4E). These results emphasize the reliability of the in silico based predictions of E-cadherin stability and the clear association of E-cadherin destabilization with loss of adhesive function.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    E-cadherin alterations (mutations, deletions and methylation) are the only recognized genetic cause of HDGC. Most mutations identified in HDGC are of the nonsense type, but a significant proportion (20%) of germline mutations give rise to single aminoacid substitutions, of which the pathogenicity is difficult to evaluate and is often unclear. The most important information in terms of genetic counselling of germline missense mutation carriers is familial clinical information (segregation analysis, mostly) but this information is often scarce with the size of the pedigree commonly being too small to allow segregation studies, and the pathogenicity assessment usually comes from cell-based in vitro functional assays, which are time consuming and technically demanding, and are therefore not widely applicable in routine molecular labs. Consequently, there is a need for new methods to determine the pathogenicity of E-cadherin missense mutations associated to HDGC. Our group has previously described a model to infer the pathogenicity of this type of mutation, based on different variants such as co-segregation of the mutation within pedigrees, frequency in healthy population, recurrence in independent families, and functional in vitro and in silico data. In that case, the structural in silico analysis was limited to the EC1-EC2 domains, and was thus incomplete. In this work we used FoldX to generate structural models covering the major part of E-cadherin (Figure 1C), calculate the energetic penalty induced by each mutation, and compare the results with in vitro and in vivo phenotypes.\n\n    We have previously showed that E-cadherin folding is surveyed by mechanisms of Protein Quality Control and that HDGC-associated mutations can be prematurely degraded by the Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation (ERAD), a mechanism responsible for the clearance of misfolded and unstable proteins, dependent on the proteasome. These results strongly suggest that some E-cadherin missense mutations may have structural impact, resulting in protein misfolding. To evaluate if each mutation impacts the structure and stability of E-cadherin, we based our analysis in the calculation of native-state stability changes (DeltaDeltaG) using FoldX algorithm. We evaluated 22 germline HDGC/EODGC and 57 sporadic E-cadherin missense mutations regarding structural impact (FoldX) and evolutionary conservation (based on SIFT analysis) and found that the destabilizing mutations span the full length of the extracellular domain, with no hotspot for a particular domain. Most HDGC/EODGC mutations (16 out of 22) are functionally characterized in vitro, so we used this information to evaluate the power of the predictors to infer loss of function. Using a simple classification of the results obtained with FoldX and SIFT (True Positive, True Negative, False Positive and False Negative), we found that both predictors accurately predict around 70% of the functional impact of the mutations (TP plus TN); with FoldX, we found that loss of function correlates with loss of native-state stability for half of the analysed mutations (8 out of 16), with most of them also being highly conserved (6 out of 8). Interestingly, when we analysed the mutation carriers in detail, we found that the group of patients harbouring Destabilizing mutations is characterized by the development of disease at a younger age, when compared to the group with mutations that keep native-state stability (Figure 2D). These results indicate that not only E-cadherin native-state stability is frequently disturbed by germline mutations, but also that destabilization accounts for the disease phenotype, inducing earlier development of disease. It would be informative if imunohistochemistry of E-cadherin in DGC was compared between carriers of \"Destabilizing\" and \"Non-destabilizing\" mutations, but we didn't have enough material to analyze this parameter in depth. Additionally, the percentage of destabilizing sporadic mutations is also high (around 40%), suggesting that destabilization may also account for the loss of E-cadherin function in sporadic cancer.\n\n    Furthermore, we wanted to analyse if E-cadherin structural destabilization induced by missense mutations was correlated to misfolding in the cell and recognition by ERAD, resulting in loss of expression. We used three newly identified germline mutants (E185V, S232C and L583R) as model, and evaluated their impact in silico with FoldX and SIFT, and in vitro, characterizing expression, subcellular localization and degradation pattern. We found that only mutation L583R induces high impact in the structure (DeltaDeltaG = 2,7 kcal/mol) besides being totally conserved. In vitro functional assays indicate that L583R is pathogenic, exhibiting loss of adhesive function (scattered cell pattern), in contrast to E185V and S232C that retain adhesive function (Figure 3). We found that L583R is less expressed due to maturation deficiency, accumulates in the ER, is prematurely degraded by the proteasome, and exhibits high turnover and shorter half-life, indicating that it is regulated by ERAD (Figure 4). Interestingly, if we introduce a structurally tolerated alteration in the same position (L583I, as predicted by FoldX), the function is recovered and stability is restored, resulting in an increased in half-life of the protein (Figure 4D-E). This result shows the direct correlation between in silico predicted destabilization and decreased E-cadherin half-life.\n\n    Overall, our results indicate that E-cadherin missense mutations found in cancer frequently lead to native-state destabilization, and we show that the carriers of destabilizing mutations develop DGC earlier in life, suggesting that this subset of mutations is more pathogenic. In vitro studies show that structural destabilization results in high turnover in the cell, recognition by ERAD, premature degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and consequent loss-of-function. We propose for the first time that E-cadherin destabilization accounts for HDGC pathogenicity, and that in the absence of clear clinical observations, in silico predictions should be used as a first approach to distinguish pathogenic from probably tolerated E-cadherin variants associated to HDGC or EODGC.",

        "Title": "    Sherloc: a comprehensive refinement of the ACMG-AMP variant classification criteria",
        "Abstract": "    The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines were a major step toward establishing a common framework for variant classification. In practice, however, several aspects of the guidelines lack specificity, are subject to varied interpretations, or fail to capture relevant aspects of clinical molecular genetics. A simple implementation of the guidelines in their current form is insufficient for consistent and comprehensive variant classification.\n\n    We undertook an iterative process of refining the ACMG-AMP guidelines. We used the guidelines to classify more than 40,000 clinically observed variants, assessed the outcome, and refined the classification criteria to capture exceptions and edge cases. During this process, the criteria evolved through eight major and minor revisions.\n\n    Our implementation: (i) separated ambiguous ACMG-AMP criteria into a set of discrete but related rules with refined weights; (ii) grouped certain criteria to protect against the overcounting of conceptually related evidence; and (iii) replaced the \"clinical criteria\" style of the guidelines with additive, semiquantitative criteria.\n\n    Sherloc builds on the strong framework of 33 rules established by the ACMG-AMP guidelines and introduces 108 detailed refinements, which support a more consistent and transparent approach to variant classification.",
        "Introduction": "    Variant classification is the cornerstone of clinical molecular genetic testing. The validity and utility of genetic testing require that variant classifications be evidence-based, objective, and systematic. Clinical and medical geneticists must be able to distinguish between established facts and reasonable hypotheses and must understand the evidence and logic underlying variant classifications. Pathogenicity evaluations must be reproducible and protected from the personal and professional biases that can be present in research laboratories, the investigative settings of diagnostic laboratories, and clinicians' urgent desire to make a diagnosis.\n\n    Certain ACMG-AMP rules conflate concepts that should be considered separately. Sherloc expands overly encumbered criteria into a set of discrete but related rules and weights these rules separately.\n\n    Certain pairings of ACMG-AMP rules capture types of evidence that contribute to the same basic argument, which creates a \"double counting\" effect in which an argument is overvalued by invoking the same basic observation more than once. Sherloc groups evidence types into broader lines of argument to prevent this inadvertent error.\n\n    The \"clinical criteria\" style of the ACMG-AMP guidelines introduces difficulty in intuitively understanding the cumulative strength of the evidence, and in appreciating how much additional evidence is required to move to a confident conclusion. Sherloc substitutes a categorical framework and numerically weighted criteria to support a more intuitive understanding of variant classification. Consistent with the ACMG-AMP guidelines, Sherloc is a system for the evaluation of constitutional variants within a Mendelian disease framework.\n\n    The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants were a major step toward establishing a shared framework for variant classification. However, during the process of applying the ACMG-AMP guidelines to the classification of thousands of variants, we and other groups identified several areas in which the guidelines lacked specificity or were subject to ambiguous or contradictory interpretations. To address this, we developed and validated Sherloc (semiquantitative, hierarchical evidence-based rules for locus interpretation), a variant classification framework that is an effective refinement of the ACMG-AMP criteria. Sherloc addresses several key issues.",
        "Methods": "    Sherloc was developed through an iterative process using the ACMG-AMP guidelines as a starting point. The ACMG-AMP draft guidelines were released for member comment in August 2013 and adopted for internal use at Invitae. A working group was formed comprising American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics-certified laboratory directors, doctoral-level scientists, and American Board of Genetic Counseling-certified genetic counselors with experience in many clinical areas of diagnostic genetic testing, including hereditary cancer, cardiology, neurology, and pediatric genetics.\n\n    The working group interpreted variants observed during diagnostic testing by using the implemented framework, and identified variants for which (i) strict adherence to the framework led to classifications at odds with the established understanding of clinical significance, or (ii) uncertainty or disagreement arose about the correct application of the rule set. The working group met weekly to discuss these cases, identify the underlying genetic issues, and refine the rules and their valuations. This iterative process continued for more than two years and through more than 40,000 unique variants identified during clinical laboratory testing across more than 500 genes and conditions. The framework has developed through many major and minor iterations. The rule set described herein is Sherloc version 4.2. All interpreted variants are routinely deposited into ClinVar.",
        "Results": "    Our experience using the ACMG-AMP criteria was mixed. The guidelines presented a logical framework for categorizing and valuing evidence that generally matched the perspective of our clinical staff, many of whom had participated in ACMG-AMP surveys and discussions during guideline development. However, the criteria left many aspects of clinical molecular genetics undescribed and subject to personal interpretation. We routinely encountered variants that caused uncertainty about the appropriate rule usage, which led to classification inconsistencies and debate. Generally, discrepancies were due either to uncertainty about how to categorize evidence that did not fit neatly into the available rules, or subjectivity about when to count evidence as strong or moderate.\n\n    To address these questions, we set out to describe every use-case with explicit evidence criteria. When ambiguity arose, we developed more granular rules to capture the necessary complexity. For example, the ACMG-AMP guidelines contain one caveat-laden rule (PVS1) capturing premature termination codon (PTC) variants and no alternative criteria for PTC variants that fail to fulfill all of the requirements, even though a PTC that does not meet every usage note criteria can have a predictably disruptive effect on a gene product. To address this shortcoming, we established a set of variably weighted criteria for PTCs (see \"Variant type and the expected consequence for gene products\" below), in which the value is modulated based on the location of the stop codon relative to the pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) structure (5' truncations that lead to nonsense-mediated decay versus 3' PTCs that yield translated, truncated proteins) and the molecular mechanism of disease for the gene (confirmed versus unconfirmed loss-of-function (LOF) mechanism).\n\n    We recognized that the full complexity of clinical genetics was unlikely to be captured prospectively, and expected that regular iterations to Sherloc would be necessary. We therefore designed Sherloc to support refinements that could maintain backward compatibility. Over time, this approach expanded the original set of 33 ACMG-AMP criteria to the 108 criteria contained within Sherloc version 4.2. The iterative process continues and is an essential part of laboratory process quality improvement.\n\n    The ACMG-AMP framework assigns a strength level to each evidence criterion and requires various combinations of strong, moderate, and supporting evidence for a confident classification. However, we regularly identified variants that could be formally classified as likely pathogenic but seemed insufficiently supported or, conversely, variants that could formally be classified as variants of uncertain significance despite persuasive evidence that was not handled well by the ACMG-AMP framework.\n\n    For example, CDH1 c.1118C>T (p.Pro373Leu) is a variant in a gene associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. It is absent from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database and is supported by strong functional studies: in vitro functional characterization shows that p.Pro373Leu impairs cell-cell adhesion and leads to increased cellular motility and activation of EGFR, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Src kinase. Computational predictors recapitulate this conclusion. Clinical observations, however, are inconclusive: the variant has been found in affected and unaffected individuals in the same family. A strict application of the ACMG-AMP rules should yield a likely pathogenic classification: PS3 (well-established functional studies) +PP3 (predicted deleterious) +PM2 (absent from population). However, without supporting clinical observations, this conclusion seems premature, particularly because PS3 and PP3 redundantly describe the functional argument that the protein is disrupted.\n\n    Conversely, TTC8 c.459G>A (p.Thr153=) is a very rare silent change (0.02% in ExAC) in a gene that can cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Although not in the consensus +1/+2 splice site, it is located at the last nucleotide of the exon and is predicted to disrupt normal splicing. It has been observed in the homozygous state in three affected siblings in a single family. A strict application of the ACMG-AMP rules yields a variant of uncertain significance classification of PP1 (cosegregation with disease) +PP3 (computational evidence). In our assessment, however, the rules fail to capture relevant sequence context and undervalue the clinical observations. This variant has been observed in our laboratory in the homozygous state in an unrelated affected individual and is now classified as pathogenic.\n\n    Such examples suggested that the ACMG-AMP criteria were not capturing certain qualitative considerations. Therefore, we first posed a normative question: \"What kind of evidence, and how much, should be required for a pathogenic classification?\" We first recognized that there are two general types of evidence: clinical and functional. Clinical evidence describes the correlation of the variant with disease (or absence of disease) in human populations, and includes observations in affected and unaffected individuals and families. Functional evidence describes the molecular consequence of a variant on various gene products and includes the results of molecular and cellular experiments, and predictions about functional effects based on variant type or complex computational algorithms. Clearly, clinical and functional evidence are both important: a variant is pathogenic if it disrupts a gene product in a way that leads to human disease, and is benign if it has an effect that does not lead to disease in humans. Although both clinical and functional evidence are relevant, they have a hierarchical relationship. Clinical data describe human disease directly, whereas functional data are relevant to disease only to the extent to which the measured property correlates with disease physiology. Therefore, when a discrepancy or conflict arises between clinical and functional observations, the clinical observations should be considered more persuasive. Broadly speaking, a variant should not be considered pathogenic if it is present in a large percentage of healthy individuals (clinical data), even if a measurable effect on protein function has been observed in an experimental assay (functional data). Conversely, a variant should be considered pathogenic if it is present in many affected individuals and has not been observed in healthy individuals (clinical data), even if it is predicted to be nondeleterious and has been demonstrated to have no effect on a measured protein property (functional data).\n\n    Examples of these kinds of conflicts include CDKN2A c.9_32dup24 (p.Ala4_Pro11dup) and SCN5A c.3578G4A (p.Arg1193Gln). CDKN2A c.9_32dup24 is an in-frame duplication predicted to have no effect on protein function and demonstrated not to affect CDK4 or CDK6 binding. However, the variant has been identified in several individuals affected with melanoma and has been shown to segregate with disease (incomplete penetrance) in several melanoma families. The abundance of positive clinical evidence trumps the negative functional evidence. It is possible that the effect on binding was mismeasured or that CDK4/6 binding efficiency is not the relevant molecular consequence of this variant. Conversely, SCN5A c.3578G>A (p.Arg1193Gln) is a missense change in the voltage-gated cardiac sodium channel. Pathogenicity seems to be supported by functional evidence: the variant was demonstrated to destabilize inactivation gating and to lead to a persistent current in vitro. However, a glycine is present at the equivalent position in the horse ortholog, and the variant is present in more than 7% of the East Asian population, with 17 homozygotes reported in ExAC. The abundance of negative clinical evidence outweighs the positive functional evidence.\n\n    This principle of the primacy of clinical evidence establishes a framework for evidentiary thresholds: a rare variant supported by nothing but functional evidence should be classified as a variant of uncertain significance in the absence of supporting clinical data linking the molecular dysfunction to a clinical phenotype.\n\n    In the ACMG-AMP system, the overall strength of the total evidence set is evaluated in a manner analogous to the familiar style of diagnostic clinical criteria. Evidence types are roughly binned into one of four levels, and different combinations of evidence from the bins suffice for a confident classification. In practice, however, we have found that this style of assessing an argument introduced obstacles to the accuracy and flexibility of an evolving system. In many cases, we needed to introduce more subtle gradations to the evidence valuation than the four levels could support. We also found that the combinatorial logic of the ACMG-AMP criteria made it very difficult to predict the consequence of introducing new criteria or changing the valuation of criteria. Because there are different paths to a threshold, it was difficult to understand intuitively how much more evidence might be required for a confident classification.\n\n    We knew Sherloc would evolve, so we needed a weighting system that provided more precision and flexibility. We therefore established a semiquantitative system in which each criterion is awarded a preset number of points on orthogonal benign or pathogenic scales (i.e., 1B-5B or 1P-5P), which reflect the value of the data type toward the overall classification argument (Figure 1). Accumulated benign and pathogenic evidence types are summed separately and compared against preset thresholds. When substantial evidence supports both pathogenic and benign conclusions, that dichotomy may indicate low-penetrance variants, genetic or environmental modifiers, or other ambiguity within the Mendelian framework. For most variants supported by evidence toward both poles, however, the clinical/functional hierarchical framework described previously and the practical approach described in Figure 5 provide guidance for evaluating these apparent contradictions. Point thresholds for likely benign and likely pathogenic classifications are asymmetric (3B versus 4P), and reflect the fact that neutral genetic variation is abundant and pathogenic variants are rare. The burden of proof to reach a benign classification is therefore lower.\n\n    The original translation of the ACMG-AMP guidelines into a point system aimed simply to recapitulate conclusions reached via the ACMG-AMP combinatorial scoring method. The value of criteria has changed over time as the rule set was expanded and refined. The current rules and weights are described throughout this paper and in Supplementary Table S1 online. Although the criteria in Sherloc version 1 had a 1:1 mapping to the ACMG-AMP criteria, subsequent versions diverged from that strict correlation. The derivation history or closest mapping of Sherloc evidence criteria (EVs) to ACMG-AMP criteria is presented in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n    This approach (exhaustive criteria set, fixed point values, and a consistent evaluation protocol) promotes consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency among users. The same steps are performed, the same weight is granted to each element of an argument, and users are guided toward the correct application of evidence types.\n\n    Clinical data include population frequency information and observations of variants in well-characterized affected and unaffected individuals and families. Sherloc contains sets of evidence types to capture these data. Detailed knowledge about the symptoms and phenotypes associated with each condition, the penetrance and age at onset of features, and the percentage of clinical cases accounted for by pathogenic variants in known genes are essential prerequisites for using these data effectively. The sections that follow describe the original ACMG-AMP criteria, the derived Sherloc criteria, and the evaluation process for each clinical data type.\n\n    Variant frequencies from large population data sets can provide strong evidence that a variant is benign, or can reveal that one is sufficiently rare to be considered a candidate for pathogenicity. Most variants encountered during testing have previously been observed at a frequency inconsistent with the incidence of monogenic disease. With appropriate safeguards, beginning variant evaluation with population data maximizes accuracy and efficiency. The full set of frequency criteria are shown in Figure 2.\n\n    The ACMG-AMP guidelines contain two benign rules and two pathogenic rules to capture the impact of population frequency on variant classification: BA1 (allele frequency >5%), BS1 (allele frequency > expected), PM2 (absent from controls), and PS4 (higher prevalence in affected individuals versus controls). We encountered a number of limitations to this approach related to the effective placement of frequency thresholds, the known presence of pathogenic variants in population data sets, and the quality and abundance of population data.\n\n    While it is clear that a variant present in 5% of the population cannot be a cause of a rare, monogenic disease, this is also true for variants at much lower frequencies. The ACMG-AMP framework suggests that frequency thresholds be set based on a synthesis of disease prevalence, penetrance, and percent attribution. This guidance is impractical, primarily because accurate prevalence, penetrance, and gene attribution numbers have not been established for most disorders and can vary two- to tenfold even for well-studied disorders, depending on the subpopulation and the total number of unique pathogenic variants. Moreover, frequency data are inherently quantitative. All other things being equal, the likelihood that a variant is benign increases as its observed frequency increases. A single threshold does not adequately capture this variable likelihood of pathogenicity.\n\n    Absent in ExAC (1P)\n\n    \"Within pathogenic range\" (0.5P): low frequency, but consistent with previously well-characterized pathogenic variants\n\n    \"Somewhat high\" (1B): low frequency and inconsistent with previously well-characterized pathogenic variants\n\n    \"High\" (3B): sufficiently common for a likely benign classification without additional corroborating evidence\n\n    \"Very high\" (5B): sufficiently common for a benign classification without additional corroborating evidence\n\n    To address these issues, Sherloc captures five frequency levels:\n\n    To define the bottom four tiers quantitatively, we developed an empirical approach to establish the frequency spectrum of pathogenic variants in the ExAC database. ExAC contains pathogenic variants, and their frequencies can be characterized. Such analysis revealed that in a set of 79 disease genes (39 dominant, 40 recessive, 1508 total variants), 97.3% of pathogenic variants had an allele frequency of less than 0.01%, and 94% were present at eight alleles or fewer.\n\n    These observations are used cautiously to support frequency thresholds that, although much more aggressive than the ACMG-AMP recommended 5%, are still safely conservative. For dominant genes, Sherloc incorporates thresholds of 0.5%, 0.1%, and >8 alleles for the \"very high\", \"high\" and \"somewhat high\" levels, respectively. For recessive genes, it incorporates thresholds of 1%, 0.3%, and >8 alleles, respectively. These cutoffs support the use of ethnic subpopulation allele frequencies, which can be less precise due to smaller sample sizes but are critical for identifying ethnicity-enriched polymorphisms. When a gene is associated with more than one inheritance pattern, an a priori gene-level decision is made to use either the higher or the lower frequency thresholds based on the severity and age at onset of the monoallelic phenotype.\n\n    Variant frequencies can be elevated for founder mutations and within mutational hotspots. As such, high-frequency variants should not be classified as likely benign or benign without a literature review. (For literature review, our laboratory uses custom software, which combines direct searches using Google and SETH/PubTator with indirect reference reviews from the Human Gene Mutation Database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, and ClinVar. Manual search protocols could provide similar security.) The frequency thresholds used for these criteria may change as public data sets grow in size, but the concept and weighting will probably remain the same.\n\n    There are technical considerations for using aggregate population data. For example, KCNQ1 c.1795-11803A>C is absent from the ExAC exome data, which has weak coverage of intronic regions, but is present at 32.3% in 1000 Genomes. As this example illustrates, the absence of a variant from ExAC does not always indicate that it is rare. At some loci, smaller data sets, such as 1000 Genomes, may have more relevant information, although the frequency may be less reliable. Sherloc includes a second set of frequency criteria for observations supported by fewer alleles. Certain loci in ExAC are also troubled by data quality issues. An example is ATM c.566G>A. This variant is present in ExAC at a frequency sufficient to justify a likely benign classification; however, the data are flagged as not passing the variant quality score recalibration filter. Incidentally, the Exome Sequencing Project and 1000 Genomes data do not report a variant at this position. Frequency information at quality-flagged loci should be used cautiously, if at all; Sherloc contains criteria to formally capture these cases. Likewise, ExAC contains loci with high-quality data but low total allele count. Low-frequency observations may be unreliable at these loci due to small sample sizes.\n\n    For all variants, a single \"population\" rule is selected based on a simple decision tree that reflects these considerations (Figure 2a).\n\n    Finally, we considered the zygosity of ExAC observations. For example, RAD50 c.280A>C (p.Ile94Leu) has been observed at a frequency of 0.7% in the south Asian population in ExAC, a cohort that includes two homozygous observations. For genes such as RAD50, in which biallelic pathogenic variants are expected to be lethal or severe (Nijmegen breakage syndrome), observations of homozygous variants are strong evidence that the variant is benign. Therefore, Sherloc contains three rules of varying strength relating to observations of homozygotes in databases (Figure 2b).\n\n    Individuals who are well characterized both phenotypically and genotypically can support inferences that are more powerful than those that can be drawn from discrete entries in general databases. The ACMG-AMP criteria contain five rules for capturing observations in well-characterized individuals: BS4 (nonsegregation with disease), BP2 (cis'trans with a pathogenic variant), BP5 (case with an alternative cause), PP1 (cosegregation with disease), and PP4 (individual's phenotype or family history is highly specific). Other ACMG-AMP criteria, such as PM2 and PS6 (de novo criteria) and many of the variant type criteria, depend implicitly on an observation in an individual with a relevant phenotype.\n\n    We identified three distinct classes of clinical observations that should be considered separately: (i) variants in unaffected individuals (suggests benign), (ii) variants in affected individuals with an alternate cause of disease (also suggests benign), and (iii) variants in affected individuals without an alternate cause of disease (suggests pathogenic). Case report criteria for each are described below. In general, these criteria are additive: each unrelated observation is considered an independent data point that further contributes to the argument. The three classes of observations are depicted in the case report root decision tree (Figure 3).\n\n    Using case report data accurately requires rigor regarding the appreciation of variant frequency, the distinctiveness of the phenotype, the relevance of the phenotype to the gene in question, and the diagnostic yield of the genetic test in patients with the observed phenotype (Supplementary Figure S1).\n\n    Variant frequency is a primary concern in evaluations of the relevance of positive case reports, and must be a preliminary evaluation. Individual case reports should be considered as possible evidence only if the variant is rare (absent from ExAC or present within the \"pathogenic range\"). If the variant is not rare, spurious case reports should be expected; segregation or case-control data are required to confirm the relevance of any single observation.\n\n    Using the clinical phenotype of affected individuals consistently and accurately proved challenging with the ACMG-AMP criteria. The genes BRCA1, JAG1, and MYH7 demonstrate how observations of a rare variant in an affected individual might contribute to an argument of variant causality to different extents.\n\n    Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 strongly predispose to breast cancer. However, isolated breast cancer is common, and approximately 90% of cases have nongenetic etiologies. Most observations of BRCA1 variants in affected individuals, therefore, must be coincidental, not causal, so the observation of a variant in an isolated affected individual is not strong evidence that the variant is pathogenic unless it is first established that the individual's disease is hereditary. Contrast BRCA1 with JAG1, which causes Alagille syndrome, a rare and clinically distinctive condition without known nongenetic etiologies. For classically affected individuals who meet clinical diagnostic criteria, the diagnostic yield for the molecular test is greater than 95%. It is therefore substantially more likely that a novel JAG1 variant in a clinically distinct individual is causal. JAG1/Alagille syndrome observations are therefore stronger evidence than BRCA1/breast cancer observations. Between these two extremes lies MYH7 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Pathogenic variants in MYH7 can lead to hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, phenotypes that can have genetic origins but can also have substantial nongenetic etiologies (up to 70%). Case reports of rare MYH7 variants in individuals with HCM are cautiously considered evidence of pathogenicity, as a substantial likelihood remains that the combination is coincidental. A cohort of affected individuals with the same rare variant, however, becomes persuasive.\n\n    These examples demonstrate that the value of a clinical observation should vary based on both the specificity of the clinical phenotype and the diagnostic yield of the molecular test for that phenotype. The higher the pretest probability that a proband with a particular phenotype will have a particular gene disruption, the greater the likelihood that an observed variant in that gene or set of genes is the explanation for disease. Conversely, the lower the yield of a test, the greater the likelihood that the true etiology lies elsewhere and the higher the likelihood that observed variants are coincidental.\n\n    To develop a consistent approach to determining the value of clinical observations, we divided genes based on their yield for particular phenotypes. If the diagnostic yield is high (>75%), isolated case reports may be considered very significant, and finding a rare variant in a relatively small number of classically affected probands will be sufficient for a pathogenic classification. However, if the test accounts for less than 75% of cases, case reports are relevant only to the extent that the disease is first established to be hereditary based on the nature of the phenotype or a pedigree analysis. Furthermore, at least two unrelated case reports are required to begin counting the observations as relevant data to protect against circular reasoning in diagnostic testing. A cohort of similarly affected individuals is generally required for a pathogenic classification.\n\n    If the index proband is not a confirmed hereditary case, an isolated case is not used as evidence, and segregation data are required. Sherloc has three levels of segregation data to capture the fact that additional families and higher LOD scores quantitatively substantiate a classification argument (see Supplementary Information, Supplement 4: \"Quantifying segregation\"). When asserting a correlation between a positive genotype and a positive phenotype, the genomic linkage of the observed variant to the causative variant is a concern. Therefore, the value of a single family, no matter how large, is capped to protect against this possibility; other types of supporting evidence (functional data or observations in unrelated, affected individuals or families) are required for a confident classification.\n\n    It is important to predefine the distinct clinical features required to count an observation as a relevant case. Accepted clinical criteria, if they exist, should be used. Summary or simplified condition information, such as that often deposited in ClinVar or included on test requisition forms, may be insufficient for case-based conclusions, and additional communication may be required to capture necessary detail. Sherloc contains a 0-point criterion, \"Observed in patient with nonspecific phenotype or insufficient genotype\" (EV0107), to acknowledge reports of poorly characterized individuals or well-characterized individuals with nonspecific phenotypes.\n\n    Finally, the full genotype and variant inheritance can provide additional support to a pathogenicity argument. Two rare variants in trans in a recessive gene, or a hemizygous variant in an affected male, can provide an additional level of certainty that the case report is valuable. The observation that a variant has arisen de novo in a relevant and established disease gene is counted as strong evidence. Sherloc contains a less heavily weighted criteria for capturing de novo variants in candidate genes, an important consideration for exome analysis, in which multiple de novo events are common.\n\n    Most Mendelian conditions are rare and explained by a single genetic etiology. Therefore, when an affected individual has an identified genetic etiology, additional variants in the same or a different gene are less likely to be pathogenic. In certain cases, co-occurrence observations of this sort can be used as evidence that the additional variants are benign. Sherloc contains four evidence types capturing these scenarios (Supplementary Figure S2). Within the same gene, co-occurrence applies only to variants in trans with pathogenic variants; once an allele is disrupted, there is no selective pressure preventing that allele from acquiring additional variants that would be pathogenic in isolation. It also applies only to variants causing dominantly inherited disease (or in X-linked genes in male probands). Recessive carrier status is no more or less likely in affected individuals.\n\n    Finally, this logic does not apply to relatively common conditions with locus heterogeneity:that is, when there are known case reports of affected individuals who inherit pathogenic variants in related genes from both parents. For example, up to 5% of individuals with a pathogenic HCM variant also have a second pathogenic HCM variant in a different gene. The second variant cannot be presumed to be benign, and co-occurrence evidence types are not applied for HCM cases.\n\n    The observation of a variant in an unaffected individual, which in a genetic context should lead to disease if it were pathogenic, suggests that the variant may be benign (Supplementary Figure S3). For example, CHARGE syndrome is a dominant, highly penetrant, congenital disease caused by pathogenic variants in CHD7. A CHD7 variant in an unaffected adult is therefore strong evidence that the variant is benign. Likewise, biallelic pathogenic variants in BRCA2 cause Fanconi anemia, and there is no difference in the mutation spectrums of pathogenic variants that lead to BRCA2-mediated Fanconi anemia versus hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. A variant in trans with a pathogenic BRCA2 variant in an individual without Fanconi anemia must therefore be benign.\n\n    The strength of these assertions depends on the penetrance and expressivity of a condition. Pathogenic variants in JAG1, as described previously, cause Alagille syndrome, which has highly variable expressivity and severity; some individuals reach childbearing age without recognizing that they are affected. The observation of a JAG1 variant in an \"unaffected\" individual is evidence only to the extent that the individual has been phenotyped thoroughly and found to be devoid of subtle features.\n\n    To address examples like these, Sherloc modulates \"unaffected case report\" rules on inheritance, zygosity, and the penetrance and age at onset of associated diseases. For genes that lead to highly penetrant, early-onset diseases, even a single observation in a well-characterized unaffected individual can be strong evidence that a variant is benign; however, for genes in which we might expect to see unaffected, genotype-positive individuals, additional observations are required.\n\n    The use of these evidence types must be based on the confirmed absence of a particular phenotype. The fact that a phenotype has not been mentioned in a test requisition form or publication is insufficient evidence that it is absent. Furthermore, the term \"unaffected\" is relative; these rules also apply when the individual is affected by a disease but is not affected by the disease associated with the gene in question.\n\n    The ACMG-AMP criterion BS4 (lack of segregation) is challenging to parse, as nonsegregation can refer two separate phenomena that should be considered separately, and remain challenging to quantify. Within the context of a family with multiple individuals affected by a hereditary condition, the variant is (i) present in an unaffected individual (genotype-positive/phenotype-negative), or (ii) absent in an affected individual (genotype-negative/phenotype-positive). Observations of genotype-positive/phenotype-negative individuals, even in the context of a complex pedigree, are treated simply as independent data points using the criteria described in Supplementary Figure S3. Linkage to a causative variant is not a concern in the negative correlation, although the concerns about penetrance and expressivity described above are relevant. On the other hand, the absence of a variant in an affected individual (genotype-negative/phenotype-positive) is currently awarded 1 to 2 \"miscellaneous benign points\" based on the specificity and rarity of the condition. EV criteria do not yet exist and will be addressed more formally in future versions; a method for objectively establishing symptom specificity and phenocopy rates, and weighing this evidence against other data is still being developed.\n\n    A variant is more likely to be pathogenic if it has a consequence for a gene product (a transcript or protein, or both) that is consistent with the disease mechanism of the gene. The ACMG-AMP guidelines contain six rules related to variant type: BP1 (missense variant in a gene with an LOF mechanism), BP3 (in-frame indels in a repetitive region), BP7 (silent change with no predicted impact on splicing), PVS1 (null variant in an LOF gene), PM4 (in-frame indel in a nonrepetitive region), and PP2 (missense variant in a gene in which missense changes are rare). Sherloc expands these rules to 27 criteria that address a more comprehensive set of variant types, specify differences based on variant location in the mRNA exonic structure, and incorporate assertions about molecular mechanism (Supplementary Figure S5, Supplementary Information: Supplement 1, \"Variant type\"). A single variant type rule is applied to each variant. In some cases (truncations, indels, and missense variants), additional dependent rules incorporate information about other nearby pathogenic variants. Missense changes and in-frame deletions/insertions are given a weight of 0 points. Variants that do not reliably affect protein sequence or abundance (such as silent or some intronic variants) are presumed more likely to be tolerated, and variants that exert a more dramatic effect on protein sequence or abundance (such as premature stops and splice junctions) are presumed more likely to be deleterious.\n\n    The relevance of a null variant depends on the disease mechanism of the gene, and ACMG-AMP and Sherloc both give special weight to null mutations in LOF genes. An objective approach to determining whether a disease mechanism has been established as LOF is described in the Supplementary Information (Supplement 2, \"Establishing loss of function as a mechanism\"), and a cohort of three unrelated affected individuals with null variants is typically required to support this conclusion. Variant effect rules are grouped and nonadditive.\n\n    Experimental data can demonstrate an effect on certain aspects of protein or RNA function, localization and abundance but speak only indirectly to the question of pathogenicity. Experimental data are persuasive to the extent that the measured property is recapitulated in vivo and is relevant to the disease mechanism of the gene. The ACMG-AMP guidelines contain two rules capturing functional studies: BS3 (well-established assay, no deleterious effect) and PS3 (well-established assay, deleterious effect). However, we found it challenging to address the evidence provided by less-well-established functional assays, and found that the value awarded to even well-established functional assays was excessive, as we routinely encountered examples in which experimental evidence was later overturned by contradictory experimental evidence or by new population data. For example, ACTN2 c.26A>G (p.Gln9Arg) is an actinin variant observed in a number of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or HCM, or both. p.Gln9Arg expression in a skeletal muscle cell line was significantly different from the equivalent expression of a wild-type construct and failed to support normal cellular morphological changes and protein localization. However, the frequency of this variant in ExAC is greater than 0.1%, which is inconsistent with pathogenicity and high enough to cast substantial doubt on the relevance of case reports.\n\n    Likewise, MLH1 c.794G>A (p.Arg265His) is a rare variant observed in many individuals and families affected with Lynch syndrome. At least two experimental studies have reported cellular or molecular phenotypes attributed to this variant: a mutator phenotype in S288c and SK1 cells, and altered splicing in an ex vivo splicing assay. However, subsequent functional studies demonstrated repeatedly that this variant was mismatch-repair competent when transfected into HEK-293 cells, did not alter beta-galactosidase activities in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and did not lead to a yeast mutator phenotype. Furthermore, the variant has been observed to co-occur with pathogenic MLH1 variants in multiple families. The evidence justifies a likely benign classification in both of these cases, despite initial functional evidence demonstrating a deleterious effect.\n\n    Disagreement about the value of functional data is a major source of classification discrepancies among genetics professionals. Clearly, the value of functional data depends on the relevance of the measured property to the disease biology, the quality of the experiment, the reproducibility of the result, and the amount of measured change, although a consistent evaluation of these considerations is challenging. To address this complexity, Sherloc contains rules capturing varying degrees of confidence, distinguishing splicing and protein effect experiments, and capturing and discounting poorly performed or inconclusive studies (Figure 4). Detailed guidelines for distinguishing between strong and weak categorizations are included in the Supplementary Information (Supplement 3, \"Experimental evidence\"). Functional evidence types are grouped and nonadditive. When multiple criteria are appropriate, only the strongest is counted.\n\n    A well-established, clinically validated assay that measures enzyme activity or analyte abundance in a patient-derived sample is a special data type that straddles the boundary between clinical phenotype and functional data. It is captured here as functional data in recognition of the essential quantitative objectivity of the data. These evidence types augment the value of a case report when appropriate. Newborn screen data are captured but not valued in recognition of the high false-positive rate.\n\n    Many computational tools exist to predict the effect of missense changes on gene products. Although these tools are useful in prioritizing variant lists in gene discovery exercises, their clinical validity as predictors of disease is not well established. Sherloc contains a series of weakly weighted criteria to capture these observations (Supplementary Figure S5). Splicing predictors, although also weakly weighted, are used to indicate which silent or intronic variants should be considered further.\n\n    The presence of an equivalent missense change in a mammalian species is granted a special weight reflecting the assumption that variation within a mammalian clade speaks more directly to questions of mammalian physiology and is therefore more relevant to human disease. Computational predictor evidence types are nonadditive. They are also grouped with, and superseded by, functional evidence criteria. When multiple evidence types from this large group are used, only the strongest is counted.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Sherloc is an implementation and refinement of the ACMG-AMP variant classification guidelines and a robust method for the consistent valuation of classification-related evidence. Sherloc is a collection of specific, interdependent, and consistently weighted evidence types supported by a set of hierarchical decision trees.\n\n    Variant classification should be reproducible and auditable. When confronted with the same evidence, different people should come to the same conclusions. Conclusions should be derived directly from the consistent use of evidence.\n\n    Evidence classification should be specific. A single evidence type should capture a single, well-defined use-case, and every use-case should be captured by an available evidence criterion. Ambiguities should be addressed by iterative refinements to the system.\n\n    Evidence should not be counted twice. Certain types of evidence contribute to the same basic argument. The rule set should contain dependencies to correct for double counting.\n\n    Some observations are additive. Certain arguments become more persuasive when supported by additional observations. Some evidence types can be invoked more than once and are additive when invoked multiple times.\n\n    Data types can be interrelated. Certain data types meaningfully affect the significance of other data types. The frequency of a variant, for example, changes our expectations for and use of case reports and segregation data.\n\n    Clinical genetics can be more complicated than Mendelian inheritance. Contradictory evidence may exist, and the evidence supporting a variant classification of benign or pathogenic should be considered separately. When substantial evidence supports both conclusions, that dichotomy may reflect complex, non-Mendelian mechanisms, exceptionally low-penetrance variants, or genetic modifiers or environmental effects, or may otherwise be ambiguous within the Mendelian framework.\n\n    Sherloc is built on a number of basic principles:\n\n    Molecular genetics is complicated, and that complexity is reflected in the Sherloc rule set. In practice, however, a simple hierarchical approach to evidence types yields accurate and thorough results quickly.\n\n    Evaluate population data. This step identifies variants that are too common to be causes of Mendelian disease and provides the lens through which clinical case reports must be evaluated.\n\n    Evaluate the expected effect of the variant on the gene product(s) (variant type). This step identifies variants strongly suspected to be pathogenic or benign and contextualizes the functional data.\n\n    Evaluate clinical case reports for substantial positive or negative evidence of enrichment in clinically affected individuals.\n\n    Evaluate functional experiments and predictive data. In most cases, functional data are consulted to confirm or refute the argument that has been established by the other data types.\n\n    The most efficient process for variant classification moves from the most powerful and simplest information to the least powerful and most complex information. In practice, we adopt a four-step process, which usually leads to the invocation of three to five evidence types per variant. At each step, we usually choose the single most appropriate evidence type from a related collection of choices. The hierarchical steps are as follows (see Figure 5):\n\n    Once substantial evidence exists for a confident classification, the remaining steps can take the form of a scan for potentially contradictory evidence. Software can support the systematic efficiency of the evaluation process by providing a user interface that supports accurate rule usage and the automatic application of the discrete evidence types that depend on digitally available data. Population data and variant effect data are amenable to automatic classification, but the evaluation of case reports and functional studies are not. Novel variants unsupported by publications are highly amenable to automatic precategorization. Any system has limitations, however, and a purely software-generated classification cannot be considered a substitute for professional evaluation.\n\n    Sherloc presents a general framework for the evaluation of evidence:an epistemological argument that simply addresses the questions, \"When can we say we know the effect of a variant?,\" \"When do we merely suspect?,\" and \"How can we tell the difference?\" The accurate use of this framework depends on specific knowledge of the molecular and clinical aspects of particular genes. A well-supported understanding of the disease mechanism associated with a gene should make rules that depend on the molecular mechanism applicable or inapplicable for variants in that gene. However, the weight granted to the general argument (that the variant is pathogenic because its mode of action is consistent with the mode of action associated with pathogenic variants in that gene) should be the same in all cases.\n\n    Specific knowledge about protein structure and function can lead to conclusions that a particular amino acid residue may be critical. This knowledge may be based on conservation, an understanding of protein domains, or knowledge about pairs of residues that bond to maintain a three-dimensional protein structure. However, the weight granted to the general argument:that a novel variant is pathogenic because it disrupts an amino acid residue suspected to be critical to the protein structure of a structural protein or the protein function of a channel or enzyme:should be the same in all cases.\n\n    Likewise, detailed knowledge about the phenotypes associated with pathogenic variants in a gene should make rules that depend on counting case reports relevant or irrelevant when considering observations of individuals with variants in that gene. However, the weight granted to the general argument:that a variant is more likely to be pathogenic when observed in an individual with a highly specific phenotype:should be the same in all cases.\n\n    The 2015 ACMG-AMP guidelines for variant classification were a major step toward establishing the basic outlines of a shared framework for variant classifications. The conclusion of this paper is that the details of that framework can be further refined, and such refinements will improve the reproducibility and objectivity of variant classification across individuals and laboratories. However, the core value of the framework cannot be overstated: these guidelines help drive consensus by providing a shared framework for documenting the evidence considered in an evaluation, beginning the process of valuing certain evidence types, and turning professional disagreements about variant classifications into meaningful discussions about clinical and scientific data. A complex and nascent field, such as clinical genetics, will uncover cases about which reasonable professionals come to different conclusions. A shared language is the first requirement for achieving a common goal.\n\n    Supplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at http://www.nature.com/gim\n\n    ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE INVITAE CLINICAL GENOMICS GROUP\n\n    Sienna Aguilar, MS, Swaroop Aradhya, PhD, FACMG, Daniel Beltran, PhD, Brandon Bunker, PhD, Amy Daly, MS, Anne Deucher, MD, Tali Ekstein, MS, Ali Entezam, PhD, Karl Erhard, PhD, Ed Esplin MD, PhD, FACMG, FACP, Jennifer Fulbright, MS, Amy Fuller, MS, Kristen McDonald Gibson, PhD, FACMG, Tina Hambuch, PhD, FACMG, Rachel Harte, PhD, Christy Hartshorne, MS, Eden Haverfield, PhD, FACMG, Nastaran Heidari, PhD, Michelle Hogue, MS, Daniela Iacoboni, MS, Britt Johnson, PhD, FACMG, Hio Chung Kang, PhD, Rachel Lewis, PhD, Shiloh Martin, PhD, Sarah McCalmon, PhD, Scott Michalski, MS, Cindy Morgan, MS, Laura Murillo, PhD, Piper Nicolosi, PhD, Karen Ouyang, PhD, FACMG, Carolina Pardo, PhD, Rita Quintana, PhD, Marina Rabideau, MS, Darlene Riethmaier, MS, Amanda Stafford, PhD, Jackie Tahiliani, MS, Chris Tan, MS, S Paige Taylor, PhD, Shu-Huei Wang, PhD, Hannah White, MS, Ian Wilson, PhD, FACMG, Tom Winder, PhD, FACMG, and Michelle K Zeman, PhD.\n\n    All of the authors are employees and shareholders of Invitae, a commercial laboratory performing diagnostic genetic testing.",

        "Title": "    Clinical and genetic variability in children with partial albinism",
        "Abstract": "    Individuals who have ocular features of albinism and skin pigmentation in keeping with their familial background present a considerable diagnostic challenge. Timely diagnosis through genomic testing can help avert diagnostic odysseys and facilitates accurate genetic counselling and tailored specialist management. Here, we report the clinical and gene panel testing findings in 12 children with presumed ocular albinism. A definitive molecular diagnosis was made in 8/12 probands (67%) and a possible molecular diagnosis was identified in a further 3/12 probands (25%). TYR was the most commonly mutated gene in this cohort (75% of patients, 9/12). A disease-causing TYR haplotype comprised of two common, functional polymorphisms, TYR c.[575 C > A;1205 G > A] p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)], was found to be particularly prevalent. One participant had GPR143-associated X-linked ocular albinism and another proband had biallelic variants in SLC38A8, a glutamine transporter gene associated with foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve misrouting without pigmentation defects. Intriguingly, 2/12 individuals had a single, rare, likely pathogenic variant in each of TYR and OCA2 - a significant enrichment compared to a control cohort of 4046 individuals from the 100,000 genomes project pilot dataset. Overall, our findings highlight that panel-based genetic testing is a clinically useful test with a high diagnostic yield in children with partial/ocular albinism.",
        "Introduction": "    Albinism is a group of hereditary conditions characterised by decreased or absent ocular pigmentation and variable skin/hair pigmentation. It can be broadly subdivided into oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and ocular albinism (OA) [MIM: 300500]. Syndromic forms of albinism have also been described (including Hermansky-Pudlak [MIM: 203300] and Chediak-Higashi syndromes [MIM: 214500]); in these rare disorders, pigmentation abnormalities co-exist with other pathological alterations. Ocular features are present in all albinism patients and are characteristic of the condition; these may include nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia, fundal hypopigmentation, iris transillumination and optic nerve misrouting. In contrast, cutaneous features may or may not be present.\n\n    Albinism, and OCA in particular, exhibits significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Notably, skin pigmentation abnormalities can often be difficult to evaluate, especially in people with light-skinned familial backgrounds. In such cases, there is significant phenotypic overlap with a range of other ophthalmic conditions including X-linked idiopathic congenital nystagmus [MIM: 310700], SLC38A8-associated foveal hypoplasia (also known as FHONDA [MIM: 609218], a condition including optic nerve decussation defects and, in some cases, anterior segment dysgenesis), and dominant PAX6-related oculopathy [MIM: 136520]. Obtaining a precise diagnosis and distinguishing between these different entities is particularly important as it enables accurate genetic counselling and personally tailored surveillance and management decisions (e.g. dermatological input). However, the current diagnostic pathway for these individuals is often prolonged, cumbersome and frequently unsuccessful. Investigations such as slit lamp examination, macular optical coherence tomography and visual electrophysiology can be helpful and are typically used to formally diagnose iris transillumination, foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve misrouting respectively. However, performing such tests in infants and young children can be challenging as co-operation for several minutes at a time is required. Furthermore, the ocular signs of partial albinism can be subtle and certain features may be absent in mild cases. As a result, multiple clinic visits over years and several investigations may be needed to reach a formal diagnosis.\n\n    The use of genetic testing early in the care pathway offers significant potential for accelerating diagnosis in individuals suspected to have partial OCA. Over the past decade, advances in DNA sequencing technologies including gene panel testing and genome sequencing have revolutionised diagnostics across many heterogeneous inherited disorders. A recent report on the use of a panel-based sequencing approach in a large cohort of patients with albinism found that a definitive molecular diagnosis could be obtained in 72% of cases. A notable finding of this study was the confirmation of a TYR allele containing two relatively common variants in cis TYR c.[575 C > A;1205 G > A] p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] as a prevalent cause of mild albinism when in trans with a TYR pathogenic variant. Despite this recent progress in dissecting the molecular pathology of albinism, our understanding of the genetic basis of partial OCA remains incomplete.\n\n    Here, we studied 12 individuals who presented diagnostic challenges as they had some ocular features of albinism but their skin was not hypopigmented in the context of their family. Phenotypic and gene panel testing results are discussed. The clinical utility of early genomic testing in this group of patients is highlighted.",
        "Methods": "    This study obtained ethics approval from the North West Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0421 and 15/YH/0365). Informed consent was gained from all patients (or their respective parental guardians) prior to ophthalmic examination and genetic testing. The research adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    Children (under 16 years of age) with: (i) nystagmus, (ii) at least one other ocular feature of albinism (iris transillumination, foveal hypoplasia, optic nerve misrouting) and (iii) skin pigmentation in keeping with their familial background were retrospectively ascertained through the database of the North West Genomic Laboratory Hub, Manchester, UK. The children were self-reported as unrelated. Only individuals for whom a referral for genetic testing was received between June 2015 and June 2018 (36 months total) were included.\n\n    All study participants were examined in tertiary paediatric ophthalmic genetic clinics at Manchester University Hospitals, Manchester, UK. A 3-generation pedigree and full ocular, developmental and medical history were obtained for each patient; this included questioning about skin and hair pigmentation at birth, ability to tan, and ease of burning on sun exposure; eye colour was also noted. Clinical assessment included visual acuity testing using age-appropriate optotypes, dilated fundus examination, cycloplegic refraction and orthoptic assessment; the dermatological phenotype at the time of consultation was also recorded.\n\n    Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging was offered to children aged 4 or more years. The Spectralis HRA + OCT system (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) or the Topcon 3D OCT 2000 (Topcon GB, Newberry, Berkshire, UK) were used. Due to limited compliance and the presence of nystagmus it was possible to obtain reliable scans of the fovea in only 6/12 study subjects.\n\n    Electrodiagnostic testing to look for optic nerve misrouting was performed in 10/12 cases. The protocols used incorporated the standards of the International Society for Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) for clinical VEPs; both pattern onset (30' checks, 200 ms on, 800 ms off) and flash (Grass #4, 1 Hz) stimulation were attempted in all tested subjects. The tests were carried out using either an Espion2 or Espion3 clinical electrophysiology system (Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA, USA), with flash stimulation provided by a PS33 photic stimulator (Grass Technologies, Warwick, RI, USA). Misrouting was assessed using an index of crossed asymmetry, looking at the difference between the VEP recorded 3 cm to the right and left of the occipital midline and comparing right and left eye stimulation. Results were graded using the following scale: -1: No response recordable; 0: No crossed asymmetry (right-left scalp difference plots were the same for the right and left eye); +1: Possible crossed asymmetry (wherein most VEP components did not cross, but minor components did); +2: Probable crossed asymmetry (partial crossed asymmetry, where asymmetry is only seen in one eye, or the polarity of the difference plots is opposite but partially out of phase); +3: Definite crossed asymmetry (difference plots are mirror images of each other). An alternative approach is to use the asymmetry index. However, whereas the asymmetry index utilises a single time slice, our method considers the whole range of the visual response. Notably, we have opted to use this subjective grading technique as opposed to other, more objective approaches that evaluate the whole response (such as Pearson's correlate or the chiasmal coefficient) for two reasons. Firstly, both Pearson's correlate and the chiasmal coefficient do not take data scale into consideration. As a result, when there is no signal, background noise can give an artificially high numeric measure of crossed asymmetry. Secondly, significant but localised optic nerve misrouting may be masked by high positive correlation of the rest of the waveform. In any case, our approach was compared to both Pearson's correlate and chiasmal coefficient and we found these three methods to be in good agreement.\n\n    Gene panel testing and analysis were performed at the North West Genomic Laboratory Hub Genomic Diagnostic Laboratory, a UK Accreditation Service Clinical Pathology Accredited medical laboratory (Clinical Pathology Accredited identifier, no. 4015). DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and subsequently processed using Agilent SureSelect target-enrichment kits (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). These were designed to capture all exons and 50 base pairs of flanking introns of 193 genes associated with inherited ophthalmic disease. Analysis was then limited to a panel of clinically relevant genes, chosen by the referring clinician. For our selected partial albinism cases, the panels used for analysis included: an OA/OCA panel consisting of 18 genes (5/12 cases), a nystagmus & foveal hypoplasia panel consisting of 26 genes (encompassing the genes included in the OA/OCA panel; 5/12 cases), an optic nerve disorders panel consisting of 40 genes (encompassing both the OA/OCA and the nystagmus & foveal hypoplasia panel genes; 1/12); a list of all tested transcripts and genes can be found in Supplementary Table S1. One study participant (proband 9) underwent clinical exome sequencing using a specifically designed Agilent SureSelect target-enrichment kit.\n\n    A detailed description of our sequencing pipeline and downstream bioinformatics analysis has been previously reported. Briefly, after enrichment, the samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq. 2000/2500 system (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Sequence reads were subsequently demultiplexed using CASAVA software version 1.8.2 (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA) and aligned to the hg19 reference genome using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA-short version 0.62). Duplicate reads were removed using Samtools before base quality score recalibration and insertion-deletion realignment using the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK-lite version 2.0.39). The UnifiedGenotyper within the Genome Analysis Tool Kit was used for single nucleotide variant and insertion-deletion discovery. To reduce the number of false-positive variants, we primarily limited the clinical analysis to changes with sequencing quality metrics above specific criteria: single nucleotide variants with >=50x independent sequencing reads and >=45 mean quality value, and insertions-deletions with support from >25% of the aligned and independent sequencing reads were considered. Copy number variants were detected from high-throughput sequencing read data using ExomeDepth version 1.1.6.\n\n    Clinical interpretation of variants was broadly consistent with the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics best practice guidelines. The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor was used to predict functional consequences of the identified genetic changes, and a pathogenicity classification score was assigned after extensive appraisal of the scientific literature, and the patient's clinical referral. In silico modelling was also used, utilising PolyPhen-2 and Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD). A clinical report was then generated and variants that possibly or probably accounted for the tested individual's clinical presentation were highlighted. Where possible, the samples of relatives were sought to identify zygosity and confirm pathogenicity.\n\n    Probable molecular diagnosis group: patients with clearly or likely disease-associated variant(s) in an apparently disease-causing state (e.g., >=1 variant in a gene linked with dominant disease or >=2 variants in a gene linked with recessive disease).\n\n    Possible molecular diagnosis group: cases harboring a single clearly or likely disease-associated variant in a gene linked with recessive disease, provided the patient phenotype matches the known spectrum of clinical features for this gene; it can be speculated that most of these participants will carry a second variant that could not be detected.\n\n    Unknown molecular diagnosis group: all other cases for which no clearly or likely disease-associated variants were detected.\n\n    For the purpose of this study, participants were split into 3 groups, as previously described in Taylor et al.:\n\n    How many of the 4046 individuals have the TYR p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] allele in homozygous state?\n\n    How many of the 4046 individuals have the TYR p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] allele in heterozygous state AND another rare TYR variant?\n\n    How many of the 4046 individuals have a rare TYR variant AND a rare OCA2 variant?\n\n    After identifying some unexpected combinations of TYR variants in the patient cohort, we aimed to ascertain how frequently these combinations were encountered in individuals without a clinical diagnosis of albinism. We interrogated genomic data from 4046 individuals within the 100,000 genomes pilot dataset. None of these individuals had features suggestive of albinism. The data were accessed via remote desktop after the relevant participant agreement was signed. The following questions were asked:\n\n    To define rare for the purposes of this experiment, we interrogated the gnomAD variant database (accessed 23/01/2019) for known disease-associated variants in both OCA2 and TYR. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of the most prevalent OCA2 or TYR mutation was used as cut-off: this corresponded to 0.047, the frequency of the OCA2 c.1441 G > A, (p.Ala481Thr) variant in the gnomAD European Finnish population.\n\n    Ethics approval was obtained from the North West Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0421 and 15/YH/0365).\n\n    Externally peer reviewed.",
        "Results": "    We identified 12 children (under 16 years of age at time of testing) with nystagmus, at least one other ocular feature of albinism, and no apparent skin hypopigmentation in the context of their family. Their clinical features are summarised in Table 1. Nystagmus was the presenting symptom in all patients and the median age at referral for genetic testing was 5.5 years. Foveal hypoplasia was suspected in 11/12 and iris transillumination was detected in 7/12. Possible electrophysiological evidence of optic nerve misrouting was identified at some point in the life of 9/10 patients tested; 3 of these 9 children were tested more than once and there was variability in the visual evoked potential (VEP) findings between visits (Table 1). For example, proband 2 had electrodiagnostic studies at age 9 months which showed minimal crossed asymmetry. When the test was repeated at age 2 years, there was no evidence of crossed asymmetry but a further assessment at age 14 years showed marked crossed asymmetry. This is perhaps not surprising as the visual system undergoes dramatic maturationial change in the first few years of life which is manifested in flash and pattern VEPs, leading to the recommendation to wait until 4 years of age before repeating ambiguous VEPs.\n\n    A probable molecular diagnosis was identified in 8/12 patients (67%); a possible molecular diagnosis was identified in a further 3/12 patients (25%). Overall, 10/12 children were found to have pathogenic variants in OCA or OA-associated genes. The most frequently implicated gene was TYR: sequence alterations in this gene were identified in 75% of patients (9/12). One child was found to have a hemizygous pathogenic variant in GPR143 [MIM: 300808], the gene associated with X-linked OA, and another child was found to have a compound heterozygous changes in SLC38A8, a gene associated with foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve misrouting without pigmentation abnormalities. We identified four previously unreported disease-causing changes: two in SLC38A8, one in TYR and one in OCA2. The genetic findings in all study participants can be found in Table 2 and further details on the individual variants are in Table 3. Familial segregation is discussed below and family trees are provided in the Supplementary File.\n\n    Proband 1, a 1-year-old white British male, was found to have the GPR143 c.659-1 G > A change in hemizygous state. This variant was not detected in a maternal sample and is not present in gnomAD. It has, however, previously been reported in a Chinese male patient with OA.\n\n    Proband 2, a 14-year-old white British female, was found to have compound heterozygous changes in the SLC38A8 gene; these included a heterozygous missense change c.534 C > G p.(Ile178Met) and a heterozygous large inframe deletion removing exons 2 to 5. The missense mutation has not been previously reported as disease causing. It is found at very low frequency in population databases and it is reported as possibly damaging by in silico tools (Table 3). The large deletion removes 167 amino acids (the total length of the protein is 435 amino acids) affecting 5 of the 11 transmembrane domains of this glutamine transporter. Notably, the patient has prominent posterior embryotoxa (Fig. 1). Such abnormalities have been described in 3 of the 9 families with SLC38A8-associated disease reported to date.\n\n    In four probands (3, 4, 5 and 6), we identified a known disease-associated TYR variant along with a genotype in keeping with the presence of the TYR complex haplotype p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] (Table 2; Fig. 2). It was possible to perform segregation analysis only in probands 4, 5 and 6 (please see Supplementary File for more details). For proband 4 it was not possible to verify cis/trans phase of the variants. In proband 5 and 6, the TYR variants p.(Arg402Gln) and p.(Ser192Tyr) were found to be in cis and the resultant haplotype - p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] - was verified as being in trans with known pathogenic TYR variants: TYR c.823 G > T p.(Val275Phe) in proband 5 and TYR c.1118 C > A p.Thr373Lys in proband 6 (Fig. 2). An established pathogenic variant in OCA2 - OCA2 c.1327 G > A p.(Val443Ile) - was also identified in proband 5.\n\n    In probands 7 and 8, both the TYR p.(Arg402Gln) and p.(Ser192Tyr) variants were detected in a homozygous state. These two probands had all the cardinal ocular features of albinism but their skin pigmentation was in keeping with their wider family. Proband 8 was also found to have a rare TYRP1 variant: TYRP1 c.208 G > A p.(Ala70Thr). This variant is reported to be possibly damaging by in silico tools (Table 3) and a recent study identified the variant in a patient with albinism. Proband 8 also has a 1-year-old brother with nystagmus who was also homozygous for TYR p.(Arg402Gln) and TYR p.(Ser192Tyr) but did not carry the TYRP1 p.(Ala70Thr) variant.\n\n    Probands 9, 10 and 11 were found to have heterozygous disease-causing variants in each of the TYR and OCA2 genes. Proband 9 had a single, previously reported disease-associated variant in OCA2 - OCA2 p.(Val443Ile) - and is also heterozygous for the TYR c.575 C > A p.(Ser192Tyr) and TYR c.1205 G > A p.(Arg402Gln) variants; segregation analysis was not possible. Proband 10 had two previously unreported heterozygous truncating variants, one in TYR c.1392dupT p.(Lys465*) and one in OCA2 c.2346deIG p.(Thr783Hisfs*2). Her unaffected mother was found to only carry the TYR variant. Proband 11 harboured a previously reported disease-associated variant in TYR - TYR c.1217 C > T p.(Pro406Leu) - and a hypomorphic allele in OCA2 - OCA2 p.(Ala481Thr). This OCA2 change has previously been suspected to cause albinism in some patients but reports on ClinVar are conflicting. A maternal sample was available for segregation revealing that the proband's mother carried both the TYR and OCA2 alleles but in the absence of a clinical phenotype of partial OCA. This result raises questions over the penetrance/pathogenicity of the genotype in proband 11. However, according to the criteria outlined in the methods section, proband 11 meets the definition for having a possible molecular diagnosis.\n\n    In proband 12, no pathogenic variants were identified.\n\n    To gain insights into the prevalence of certain combinations of variants in individuals without a clinical diagnosis of albinism, we interrogated the genomic data of 4046 individuals from the 100,000 genomes project pilot dataset. First, we looked at how many individuals in this external dataset were homozygous for the TYR p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] haplotype (like probands 7 & 8); two of 4046 individuals were found to be homozygous for both TYR p.(Arg402Gln) and p.(Ser192Tyr). Then, we looked for individuals that have a genotype in keeping with the presence of the TYR p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] haplotype in combination with a rare (MAF < 0.047 in ExAC) TYR variant (like probands 3-6). Six of the 4046 individuals in the external cohort met this criterion. In all these six cases data from other family members were available; we therefore assessed the phase of the variants in the complex TYR allele and found that in all these individuals p.(Arg402Gln) and p.(Ser192Tyr) were highly likely to occur in trans. Finally, we looked for individuals that had both a rare TYR variant and a rare OCA2 variant (like probands 10 & 11). One of the 4046 individuals in the external cohort met this criterion. Evaluation using the Fisher exact test revealed that each of these 3 variant combinations is significantly enriched in the patient cohort compared to the external, 100,000 genomes project pilot cohort (p-value of < 0.0001 for each of the 3 comparisons).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Although the study of severe, complete albinism phenotypes is relatively straightforward, milder subtypes remain difficult to diagnose clinically. Recent studies have made considerable progress in appreciating the clinical heterogeneity and elucidating the genetic basis in this group of conditions. Here, we identified a cohort of children who have ocular features of albinism and skin pigmentation that is in keeping with their familial background. Panel-based genetic testing was performed and the current utility of this investigation in clinical practice was evaluated\n\n    Detailed phenotyping of study participants highlighted the heterogeneity of partial albinism. There were varying combinations of ophthalmic symptoms and signs present in each child. This observation is in line with a recent study on the phenotypic spectrum of albinism that found no pathognomonic features for this condition. This study by Kruijt and colleagues represents a significant milestone towards establishing clinical criteria for albinism. However, although the described classification system is precise and carefully designed, it is also dependent upon high-quality phenotypic information (such as OCT-based grading of foveal hypoplasia) that can be challenging to routinely and consistently obtain in infants and young children. Given this issue and the significant clinical variability, genetic testing represents an important method for obtaining a precise, timely diagnosis in children with partial albinism. We utilised a panel test for genes known to cause albinism or plausible differential diagnoses which in all cases contained 18 common genes linked to albinism (Supplementary Table 1). We established a high diagnostic rate with 92% (11/12) of study participants receiving a probable or possible molecular diagnosis. This finding is comparable to that of a recent report on albinism that identified biallelic or monoallelic variants in relevant genes in 85% (837/990) of patients with albinism. We found that most individuals in the present partial albinism cohort (10/12) had mutations in OA/OCA-related genes. TYR was the most frequently mutated gene: 6/8 (75%) patients who received probable molecular diagnosis had TYR-associated disease. In contrast, Lasseaux and colleagues, in a larger and more heterogeneous albinism cohort (including individuals with both complete and incomplete forms), reported identifying TYR mutations in 300/717 (42%) of the solved cases s.\n\n    Notably, one patient in in the present study had SLC38A8-associated disease, an important differential diagnosis of partial albinism. SLC38A8 encodes a glutamate transporter that, unlike OA/OCA-related genes, has not been linked with defects in melanin biosynthesis or melanocyte differentiation. Individuals with this condition present with nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve misrouting without iris, fundal or skin pigmentation defects (Fig. 1). Prominent posterior embryotoxa are present in some cases (including proband 2) and the presence of this anterior segment sign in an individual with partial albinism should raise suspicion for SLC38A8-associated disease.\n\n    In this cohort, TYR c.[575 C > A;1205 G > A] p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] was the most common pathogenic allele as it was suspected to be present in 7/12 patients. The two genotypes TYR c.575 C > A and TYR c.1205 G > A have arisen on different ancestral haplotypes and each is known to reduce pigmentation. Individually both variants are common (gnomAD frequencies: 25.02% and 17.65% respectively) but their presence together on a recombinant haplotype TYR c.[575 C > A;1205 G > A] p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] is a relatively rare event, predicted to be found in British patients at a frequency of 1.1%. This haplotype has been found to lead to an additive decrease in tyrosinase function compared to each of the two variants individually (Fig. 2). Recent genome sequencing in nine individuals with albinism carrying this haplotye and follow-up functional work did not support any other variants on the haplotype as having a role in reducing TYR function. It appears likely that this haplotype is pathogenic because the combination of these two functional coding variants reduces TYR production to pathogenic levels. This recombination of common single polymorphisms that aberrantly affect protein function onto a single haplotype, with resulting significant decrease in protein function (in an additive or multiplicative fashion) to pathogenic levels is a rarely reported mechanism. Although initially described as a 'tri-allelic genotype' by Norman et al. (2017), we feel it would be better to classify this as a 'complex' or 'pathogenic' haplotype, like Gronskov et al., to reflect these mechanistic underpinnings. Such a 'complex/pathogenic' haplotype has also recently been noted in ABCA4-related eye disease. The discovery of such alleles re-enforces the importance of considering cis-genomic context in mutational analysis. Current genetic laboratory pipelines are often suboptimally set up to identify these complex disease-causing haplotypes as data are filtered based on the rarity of individual variants rather than haplotypes. However, complex/pathogenic alleles may underlie some of the current missing heritability in rare genetic disease. Detailed analysis of individuals with monoallelic pathogenic variants in genes associated with recessive disorders offers the best chance to identify such haplotypes, as has happened serendipitously in albinism.\n\n    We identified two individuals with partial albinism that were homozygous for the TYR p.[(Ser192Tyr);(Arg402Gln)] allele. Compared to a control cohort from the 100,000 genomes project pilot dataset, this genotype is significantly enriched among albinism patients. Gronskov et al. identified six further individuals with mild albinism that were homozygous for the haplotype in their cohort of 93 albinism patients; five of these individuals were clinically diagnosed with OA - supporting the mild cutaneous phenotype associated with this genotype. Gronskov et al. also noted that, given the high predicted carrier frequency of this haplotype in the general population, (i) it would be surprising if it were a fully penetrant disease-associated allele and (ii) mild cases of albinism may remain undiagnosed/asymptomatic especially in light-skinned population. Indeed, homozygosity for the complex haplotype may only cause ocular de-pigmentation that is significant enough to prompt tertiary referral for ophthalmological complications upon an already low pigmentation background.\n\n    We identified two individuals with partial albinism and monoallelic rare variants in both TYR and OCA2 - a significant enrichment compared to a control cohort from the 100,000 genomes project pilot dataset. We with \"considered these individuals as having a possible molecular diagnosis given that they have a variant in a gene linked with recessive disease and a strong genotype-phenotype fit. Intriguingly, oligo/digenic inheritance mechanisms have been hypothesised previously in albinism and given that melanin biosynthesis is known to be an interactive pathway this remains an attractive hypothesis. However, convincing evidence is yet to be reported in the scientific literature.\n\n    This study has a number of limitations. A notable one relates to the fact that the panel tests utilised here did not include three genes previously linked to rare forms of 'syndromic albinism', HSP1, AP3D1, MITF, and one gene recently linked to ocular albinism, GNAI3. In addition to being unable to rule out defects in these four genes, we did not evaluate non-coding variation associated with known albinism-related genes. Further studies of probands and families with an eluding molecular diagnosis would be of interest to identify the sources of the remaining missing heritability in albinism.\n\n    In conclusion, we report that panel-based genetic testing has a high diagnostic rate in ocular/partial albinism suspects. It has the potential to allow timely diagnosis whilst avoiding multiple clinical assessments and diagnostic tests. Also, it impacts clinical management; for example, individuals with confirmed OCA will receive appropriate support and advice regarding skin care. Notably, variants in OCA-related genes account for most genetic diagnoses in this cohort of patients. Findings in a small but significant minority of individuals with partial albinism suggest that investigating the penetrance of TYR variants and exploring a digenic inheritance model involving TYR and OCA2 would be of interest. However, large, collaborative research cohorts with high quality phenotyping and familial segregation data would be required to unravel these genetic phenomena.",

        "Title": "    The contribution of pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes to familial breast cancer risk",
        "Abstract": "    Understanding the gene-specific risks for development of breast cancer will lead to improved clinical care for those carrying germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes. We sought to detail the spectrum of mutations and refine risk estimates for known and proposed breast cancer susceptibility genes. Targeted massively-parallel sequencing was performed to identify mutations and copy number variants in 26 known or proposed breast cancer susceptibility genes in 2134 BRCA1/2-negative women with familial breast cancer (proband with breast cancer and a family history of breast or ovarian cancer) from a largely European-Caucasian multi-institutional cohort. Case-control analysis was performed comparing the frequency of internally classified mutations identified in familial breast cancer women to Exome Aggregation Consortium controls. Mutations were identified in 8.2% of familial breast cancer women, including mutations in high-risk (odds ratio > 5) (1.4%) and moderate-risk genes (2 < odds ratio < 5) (2.9%). The remaining familial breast cancer women had mutations in proposed breast cancer genes (1.7%), Lynch syndrome genes (0.5%), and six cases had two mutations (0.3%). Case-control analysis demonstrated associations with familial breast cancer for ATM, PALB2, and TP53 mutations (odds ratio > 3.0, p < 10-4), BARD1 mutations (odds ratio = 3.2, p = 0.012), and CHEK2 truncating mutations (odds ratio = 1.6, p = 0.041). Our results demonstrate that approximately 4.7% of BRCA1/2 negative familial breast cancer women have mutations in genes statistically associated with breast cancer. We classified PALB2 and TP53 as high-risk, ATM and BARD1 as moderate risk, and CHEK2 truncating mutations as low risk breast cancer predisposition genes. This study demonstrates that large case-control studies are needed to fully evaluate the breast cancer risks associated with mutations in moderate-risk and proposed susceptibility genes.\n\n    Women with the heritable form of breast cancer often harbor mutations in cancer-linked genes other than the usual suspects, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Slavin, Maxwell, Lilyquist, Joseph, and colleagues from major national and international cancer centers studied 2134 women with familial breast cancer who tested negative for BRCA1/2 gene mutations. The researchers sequenced 26 known or proposed breast cancer susceptibility genes and found mutations in approximately 1 in every 12 of the study subjects. They then further broke down the susceptibility genes into those that confer high-, moderate- or low-risk:although not all the proposed breast cancer genes reached statistical significance and, as such, their clinical importance remains unclear. The results support adding some of the high- and moderate-risk genes to multi-panel diagnostic tests that aim to determine the likelihood of a women developing heritable breast cancer.",
        "Introduction": "    Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women in the United States and the third leading cause of cancer death. Morbidity and mortality can be reduced by identification and clinical management of patients at high-risk. One major factor underlying breast cancer risk is genetic predisposition. It is currently thought that up to 10% of all breast cancers are due to an autosomal dominant susceptibility allele. Mutant alleles in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA) account for the majority of hereditary breast cancer susceptibility. However, many other risk-associated alleles in other genes have now been identified through the use of multigene panels in clinical and research applications. An improved understanding of the spectrum of genetic susceptibility and clarification of gene-specific risks for breast cancer may result in enhanced screening, prevention, and therapeutic strategies for patients and their families.\n\n    There are few studies focusing on mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes in affected individuals who have two or more close relatives with breast or ovarian cancer but are BRCA1/2 mutation negative. The purpose of this study was to detail the spectrum of known and proposed breast cancer susceptibility genes, highlight genotype-phenotype correlations, and refine risk estimates for mutations in these genes by examining BRCA negative familial breast cancer (FBC; proband with breast cancer and a family history of breast or ovarian cancer; see methods) women compared to the non-Finnish European controls from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC).",
        "Methods": "    2266 BRCA-negative women with FBC defined as a proband with breast cancer and at least two first-degree to third-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancers under age 70 years were selected from multiple centers (City of Hope, University of Pennsylvania, Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering, British Columbia Cancer Agency, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Stanford, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the National Institutes of Health) and their germline DNA (from blood or saliva) was sequenced for 26 known or proposed breast cancer susceptibility genes at Mayo Clinic and at the University of Pennsylvania. Germline DNA from two-hundred non-cancer controls from one of the contributing centers was used to estimate systematic sequencing artifacts of NGS. All individuals were consented and enrolled into the study through center specific Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Sequencing was completed once per sample.\n\n    The target region for sequencing of the candidate breast cancer susceptibility genes were selected based on coding exons. For established genes, intragenic regions were also included. Baits for solution based hybrid selection capture were designed using the Agilent SureSelect design tool (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/). 500 nanograms of high molecular weight DNA was fragmented using a Covaris E-220. Fragmentation was verified by bioanalyzer. Library preparation was performed using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep kit (E7370L), and NEB Dual indexed adapters. Fragmented DNA (mean fragment size 300 +- 20 bp) was end repaired, adapter ligated, and size selected using Ampure XP /SPRI (A63881) and was PCR amplified for eight cycles. A post-PCR clean-up was performed and enrichment for targets was performed using the Agilent SureSelect protocol. Yields were assessed using BioAnalyzer. The mean library size was 300 +- 10 bp. NGS was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to an estimated 100x mean coverage for the target region to yield paired-end reads of 100 bp per sample, using 24 samples/lane.\n\n    FASTQ files were de-multiplexed to individual forward and reverse files. Initial QC was performed using the FASTQC tool kit. Read alignment was performed using BWA and statistics were generated using bamstats. The human reference GRCh37 with the addition of decoy regions V5 for improving alignment accuracy and speed was used in all cases. Sixty-one samples with low quality were removed using the specific criteria of: (1) samples with <1 M reads, (2) low mean bait coverage (<20) over target bases, (3) +-3 S.D. mean heterozygosity, or (4) first-degree relationship from calculated kinship coefficient values (>0.177). Similarly a variant was dropped if the site-specific call rate was less than 50%. Variant calling was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v2.6-4. For each sample, the BAM was sorted, duplicates were marked for deletion using Picard, indels were realigned and base recalibrated. A gVCF was created per sample using the HaplotypeCaller in GATK and all samples were recalled using the Genotype GVCF module. Variants were annotated using SnpEFF, CAVA, and ANNOVAR.\n\n    Pre-established criteria were used to identify ineligible individuals. Expected vs. Observed homozygosity using single nucleotide polymorphisms was computed using Plink and VCFtools for all samples to identify individual samples from males for removal (Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, relatedness and ethnicity were estimated using kinship coefficients for all pairwise relationships using identity by state metrics. Individuals with a first-degree relative in the study or suspected duplicate samples were removed. Finally, 77 cases were found to carry BRCA mutations (including copy number variants) and were removed. A total of 2134 samples were available for subsequent analyses (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\n    In the FBC women sequenced, allelic ratios between 20 and 80% were required for variant inclusion. Allele ratios were not available for ExAC controls. Variants with allele frequencies (AF) > 0.03 in ExAC, ESP6500 and 1000 genomes were excluded (except for the known common pathogenic variant CHEK2 c.1100delC). The gene set was restricted to genes known (ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, PTEN, STK11, and TP53) or presumed (otherwise in the list below) to have clinically relevant mutations associated with germline breast cancer susceptibility. The list included evaluation of introns and exons for ATM, BARD1, BLM, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, MLH1, MRE11A, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, TP53, and XRCC2. Exon-only analysis was available for BAP1, FANCC, FANCM, PPM1D, and RINT1.\n\n    Variants were classified by two independent methodologies and then subjected to an expert review process for final classification. Researchers classifying the variants were blinded as to the phenotype of the sample from which the variant was derived. In the first methodology, all variants with AF > 0.003 were annotated as VUS, likely benign, or benign. Variants were called pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations when meeting one of two criteria: (1) Loss-of-function (nonsense, frameshift, splicing +/-1 or 2, whole gene deletion, truncating copy number variants (unless after a known truncating benign variant) and (2) Missense, splicing +/-3+ position, intronic or synonymous variants that were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar by two or more of the following clinical genetics group: Ambry, Sharing Clinical Reports Project, InVitae, GeneDX, Emory, or InSiGHT. One exception to this rule was for TP53 missense variants, due to the rarity of these variants, where only one group was required. In the second methodology of variant classification, variants were subjected to Ingenuity Variant Analysis (Qiagen Inc, Alameda, CA). The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants were applied to obtain pathogenic/likely pathogenic/VUS/likely benign/benign calls. In the expert review, results were compared and all concordant calls accepted as final classifications based on the above guidelines. Discrepancies were evaluated based on literature and database sources and discussed by the variant classification team for consensus on a mutation or VUS/likely benign/benign final classification. Known low-risk alleles were classified in a separate low-risk allele group.\n\n    Allele counts for mutations were summed for each gene in FBC cases and non-Finnish European ExAC controls excluding samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (ExAC v0.3.1 (non-TCGA), http://exac.broadinstitute.org/, accessed 29 December 2014). The ExAC dataset has been used for identifying genes associated with disease and estimating risks. The allele number for ExAC controls was calculated by averaging the number of the highest quality allele calls across exonic regions. Associations with breast cancer for each gene were generated using a two-sided Fisher's exact test using minimum likelihood method.\n\n    Potential copy number variants (one or greater exonic deletions and duplications) were identified with the exome hidden Markov model and COpy number Detection by EXome sequencing algorithms from NGS data. Copy number variants identified by both algorithms (n = 12) were examined in the Integrated Genome Viewer to confirm the visual presence of a low read count area spanning at least one exon. Copy number variants called were used as independent confirmation of exon deletions/duplications. Separate DNA aliquots than those used for sequencing was available from 12 of the 14 individuals for analysis by MLPA (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Figure 2). The ExAC genome browser (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) data were downloaded and analyzed in the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) for identification of copy number variants. All gene deletion and duplications spanning large genomic regions beyond a single gene were excluded as were deletions and duplications in repetitive regions, regions corresponding to pseudogenes, and spanning only single exons.\n\n    Clinical data was obtained for the patients in the local tumor set by IRB approved chart review after informed consent. Comparisons of rates in different groups were determined using a two-sided Fisher's exact test of significance. Using a sample set of 2134 FBC individuals vs. 26,375 controls, this study had >80% power to detect a significant difference in breast cancer risk for genes with a >0.1% control carrier rate leading to relative risk of >4 and for genes with a >0.6% control carrier rate leading to relative risk of >2.\n\n    The mutational datasets generated during and/and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.",
        "Results": "    Phenotypic information and an overview of family history information for the 2134 individuals in the high-risk FBC is provided in Table 1. Participants were enrolled from multiple centers (see Methods). There were 2425 breast cancers in the 2134 women, with two breast cancers reported in 14% of these women. Full pathological information was available for 1055 tumors, and 62% of tumors were ER+HER2-, 16% were ER+HER2+, 9% ER-HER2+, and 14% were ER-HER2-. The majority of the cases (81%) were of European-Caucasian descent (Table 1). All FBC women had a family history of cancer, and 65% of women had at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer. A family history of ovarian cancer in at least one first or second degree relative was reported for 18% of women.\n\n    From the 2134 women, 2859 heterozygous single nucleotide or insertion/deletion variants were identified in 26 known or proposed breast cancer susceptibility genes (Fig. 1). Variants were classified using a modified American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics variant classification pipeline (Methods). Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and likely benign/benign variants accounted for 96% of identified variants. We classified 114 (4%) of the variants as pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations (further addressed as \"mutations\" throughout). In addition, analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) data by a combination of the exome hidden Markov model and COpy number Detection by EXome sequencing algorithms, identified 14 germline copy number variants, 12 of which were classified as likely pathogenic (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, counting single nucleotide variants, indels and copy number variants, 126 unique mutations were identified. As some mutations were recurrent, 183 total mutations were identified in FBC patients. The distribution of mutations by mutation type for each of the 26 analyzed genes are shown in Table 2. The same variant classification pipeline was then applied to the 9647 single nucleotide or insertion/deletion mutations identified in the 26 genes in ExAC data from non-Finnish European individuals (excluding samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas). As was seen in FBC women, 95% of the analyzed variants were classified as VUS or likely benign/benign and 5% of variants were classified as mutations (Fig. 1). Analysis of published exome hidden Markov model data for ExAC revealed 118 copy number variants in these genes. The majority of mutations identified were truncating variants in both FBC women and ExAC controls (Table 2).\n\n    From the FBC women, 183 mutations were identified in 176 women (8.2%), or 6.6% when excluding 33 women with monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers (1.6% of cases) (Fig. 2; Table 2). The majority of women had only a single mutation identified. However, six women (0.3%) were double mutation carriers, with mutations found in two different genes, including two in ATM/CHEK2, two in PALB2/CHEK2, and one each of the following: ATM/RAD50 and MSH6/RAD50. Evaluation of the ExAC data for mutations in the 26 genes used in the study identified 1612 mutation carriers (6.1%), or 4.6% when excluding 397 monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers (1.5% of controls) (Fig. 2; Table 2). Mutations were enriched in known high (odds ratio (OR) > 5) and moderate-risk (OR 2-5) genes among FBC women compared to ExAC controls (1.5 vs. 0.2% and 3.2 vs. 1.5%, respectively, p values <0.05) (Table 2). In contrast, the frequency of mutations in proposed breast cancer genes was greater in ExAC controls than among women with FBC (2.4 vs. 1.8%, p = 0.03). The proportions of individuals with heterozygous MUTYH and Lynch syndrome mutations were nearly identical between FBC women and ExAC controls (~1.5 and 0.5% respectively in both groups, p > 0.05).\n\n    Mutations in high-risk breast cancer genes or genes associated with syndromic diagnoses (CDH1, PALB2, PTEN, STK11, and TP53 ) were identified in 1.4% of the FBC cohort (Table 2). Excluding carriers of copy number variants and double mutation carriers, comparing women with FBC to ExAC controls, TP53 and PALB2 showed significant ORs of 8.17 (95% CI 3.74-18.26, p = 2.23 x 10-6) and 6.95 (CI 3.71-12.70, p = 2.33 x 10-8), respectively (Table 3). The average age at breast cancer diagnosis for TP53 mutation carriers was significantly younger than for mutation-negative individuals (Table 4) (age at diagnosis 39 years vs. 48 years, p = 8 x 10-5), and TP53 mutation carriers were more likely to have bilateral breast cancer than mutation-negative individuals (36 vs. 13%, p = 0.05). Compared to mutation-negative women, TP53 mutation carriers were not enriched for a family history of ovarian cancer (9% in mutation carriers vs. 17% in non-carriers, p > 0.05) or for first degree relatives with breast cancer (p > 0.05). Importantly, only five out of 11 (45%) TP53 mutation carriers met classic Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Chompret criteria, or had breast cancer diagnosed under the age of 31. TP53 mutation carriers also had a significantly higher proportion of HER2+ breast cancer compared to mutation-negative cases (83 vs. 24% in non-carriers, p = 0.004). In contrast, PALB2 mutation carriers were more likely to have ER-HER2- breast cancer (46% in mutation carriers vs. 14% in non-carriers, p = 0.006) and less likely to have ER+HER2- breast cancer (31% in mutation carriers vs. 62% in non-carriers, p = 0.04) compared to mutation-negative women. Of note, two women carrying the same CDH1 VUS, currently discordant in Clinvar as either a VUS or likely pathogenic (c.1118C>T, p.Pro373Leu), had no family history of gastric cancer and therefore did not meet criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. Both women had a history of invasive ductal (at ages 34 and 36) rather than lobular carcinoma.\n\n    The ATM, CHEK2, and NBN  moderate-risk breast cancer genes had the highest mutation rate in the FBC cohort at 3.19%, including five of the double mutation carriers. In the case-control analysis, excluding copy number variants and double mutation carriers, mutations in ATM were significantly enriched in FBC women compared to ExAC controls, OR = 3.28, 95% CI 2.06-5.21, p = 3.64 x 10-6 (Table 3). CHEK2 truncating mutations (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.03-2.51, p = 0.041) (Table 3) and CHEK2, p.1100delC alone (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.13-3, p = 0.017) were also enriched in FBC. The personal history of bilateral breast cancer and other cancers were not statistically significantly higher for ATM or CHEK2 mutation carriers compared to mutation-negative women (Table 4). Cancer family history was also similar among these groups when compared to mutation-negative women, except that CHEK2 mutation carriers had a higher proportion of first-degree relatives with breast cancer (87% in mutation carriers vs. 64% in non-carriers, p = 0.007). None of the breast cancers arising in ATM and CHEK2 mutation carriers, for which hormonal status was available, were histologically classified as ER-HER2-, consistent with previous reports (Table 4). Only one case was identified with the common Slavic pathogenic variant NBN c.657del5 (Fig. 2); therefore precluding a case-control analysis.\n\n    Mutations in candidate breast cancer genes were only observed in 1.7% of women in this cohort (Fig. 2). Of these, only FANCM, BLM, and BARD1 had mutations in over five FBC women. Only BARD1 mutations were significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 3.18, 95% CI 1.34-7.36, p = 0.012) in case-control analysis. The rates of bilateral breast cancer, ovarian cancer, family history of breast cancer in a first degree relative, family history of ovarian cancer, or pathological characteristics of the breast cancer were not significantly different in these women compared to mutation-negative women (Table 4). In addition, there were nine women with mutations in recently described ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D. A personal history of ovarian cancer only was reported for only one case; furthermore, these mutation carriers were not statistically more likely to have a first-degree or second-degree relative with ovarian cancer compared to mutation-negative individuals (Table 4).\n\n    Mutations in genes classically predisposing to colorectal cancer were infrequently observed. Mutations in Lynch syndrome (LS) genes (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) were identified in 11 cases, including one case with mutations in both MSH6 and RAD50. Six MSH6 mutations were detected among FBC cases, but this rate was not significantly higher than in ExAC control individuals (0.28 vs. 0.13%). Mutations in other LS genes also were not significantly associated with FBC. The age of onset of breast cancer in women with LS mutations and mutation-negative individuals was similar (age of onset 49 vs. 48, p-value not significant), and there were no differences in the rates of bilateral breast cancer or family history of breast or ovarian cancer (Table 4) or colon cancer (data not shown). Three of the ten LS gene mutation carriers had a personal history of ovarian or endometrial cancer. However, none had a personal history of colon cancer and only two had a family history of colon cancer (data not shown). All breast cancers for which information was available were classified as ER+. There were no phenotypic features identified specific to MUTYH mutation carriers; specifically, the rate of colon cancer family history was not higher in MUTYH mutation carriers compared to mutation-negative individuals (data not shown). No mutations were identified in BAP1, MLH1, PTEN, or STK11.\n\n    The frequency of copy number variants in genes associated with breast cancer in women with FBC has been largely understudied. Using COpy number Detection by EXome sequencing and the exome hidden Markov model, we identified copy number variants in 14 cases (0.7%), and classified 12 as mutations (Table 2, Supplementary Table 1). Two copy number variants, a whole gene duplication of STK11 and a single exon in-frame deletion in PTEN were classified as VUS. Five individuals had copy number variants in CHEK2, five in ATM, one in RAD51C and one in MSH2. Copy number variants in ATM, CHEK2, and RAD51C were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in the 11 individuals for which DNA was available (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, the MSH2 deletion was from an individual meeting Amsterdam I/II criteria for LS testing, and the individual with a RAD51C deletion had a personal history of both breast and ovarian cancer. As there were five or more individuals with copy number variants in ATM and CHEK2 each, a case-control analysis was performed individually for copy number variants identified in these genes in the FBC cohort compared to copy number variants identified in the ExAC cohort. Copy number variants in CHEK2 (OR = 3.2, CI 95% 1.64-5.85, p = 4.5 x 10-6) and ATM (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 3.13-18.1, p = 9.64 x 10-6) were enriched in the FBC women.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We have described the spectrum of mutations in known or proposed breast cancer susceptibility genes in a large cohort of 2134 FBC patients. Overall, 8.2% of patients were found to carry a mutation in the genes analyzed. Mutations in ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 accounted for the majority of mutations (4%), consistent with other studies showing that these are the most commonly mutated genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 that are associated with an increased risk of FBC. While the assayed genes differ slightly between previously reported studies, our results showing a 4.3% mutation rate (Fig. 2) in high and moderate risk breast cancer predisposition genes among BRCA-negative FBC women, are also consistent with these reports.\n\n    In the present FBC cohort, only 1.3% of women carried a mutation in a high-risk breast cancer gene (Fig. 2). This risk estimate for TP53 mutations (OR = 8.17, 95% CI 3.74-18.26) has substantially tighter confidence intervals than previously reported risk estimates (OR = 11, 95% CI 0.6-201). However, further studies providing functional and risk associated annotation of variants, and accounting for contamination of true germline TP53 mutations with mosaic mutations that arise due to clonal hematopoiesis, are needed to define accurate risk estimates for breast cancer associated with TP53 inactivating mutations. PALB2 mutations were also associated with a high-risk of breast cancer (OR = 6.95, 95% CI 3.71-12.70), consistent with prior data. Our results support the rarity of CDH1, PTEN, and STK11 mutations in FBC cohorts and the classification of TP53 and PALB2 as high risk genes (OR > 5) for FBC. Adding samples with unexpected BRCA1/2 findings to the cohort of samples passing quality filters (n = 2211), it is important to point out that more BRCA1/2 mutations were incidentally identified in a cohort of reportedly BRCA1/2 negative individuals (3.5%) than mutations in the other high risk genes combined (1.3%). These results confirm that mutations in high risk genes outside of BRCA1/2 are exceedingly rare in FBC patients.\n\n    Regarding published moderate-risk genes (OR 2-5), this is the first large multigene case-control study that was able to estimate risks of FBC associated with mutations in ATM (OR = 3.28, 95% CI 2.06-5.21). CHEK2 truncating mutations, and c.1100delC alone were also associated with increased risks of breast cancer; however below an OR of 2, thus classifying CHEK2 as a low risk gene for FBC. Larger studies will be needed to accurately define the risk of breast cancer associated with missense mutations in these genes.\n\n    In the proposed breast cancer gene group, mutations in BARD1 were found significantly more frequently in individuals with FBC than in ExAC controls (OR = 3.18, 95% CI 1.34-7.36, p = 0.012) (Table 3). This is the first large study to show that BARD1 is a moderate risk breast cancer predisposition gene for FBC. Similarly, mutations in RAD51D were associated with increased risks of breast cancer (OR = 8.33, 95% CI 2.2-30.48, p = 0.0044). However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the risks were based on four mutation carriers and are likely unstable. Mutation rates overall in LS genes were almost identical in FBC women and ExAC controls. However, mutations in MSH6 and MSH2 were substantially enriched (Table 2) and merit further consideration as FBC predisposition genes. Heterozygous mutations in MUTYH were not associated with increased breast cancer risk. Mutations in the proposed breast cancer gene groups (FANCM, BLM, RAD50, RAD51C, BRIP1, PPM1D, FANCC, MRE11A, RINT1, XRCC2, and BAP1) were rare. Therefore, the contribution of these genes to breast cancer risk could not be assessed.\n\n    Our results showing a significant association of FBC with mutations in ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, PALB2 validate a recent study investigating the association of breast cancer in a cohort of individuals who underwent genetic testing at a large testing company. The results here, albeit on a much smaller sample size, are derived from a cohort with well-curated family and personal cancer histories (instead of information only obtained from clinical testing report forms) and therefore provide needed validation of the results from a broad sample of individuals for whom less clinical information is available.\n\n    Consistent with other reports regarding genotype-phenotype correlations (Table 4), TP53 mutation carriers had a significantly higher portion of HER2+ breast cancer than those without mutations. Forty-five percent of TP53 mutation-positive women met LFS criteria. Since many women and families included in the current study were ascertained prior to multigene panel testing, emergence of well-defined medical management recommendations for LFS, and recent revisions in LFS criteria, it is likely that many of these cases would have been offered genetic testing under current standards of clinical care. PALB2 mutation carriers were more likely to have ER-HER2- breast cancer, whereas ATM and CHEK2 mutations were never associated with ER-HER2- breast tumors. BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D mutation carriers were not more likely to have a first-degree or second-degree relative with ovarian cancer compared to mutation-negative FBC women, inconsistent with prior studies associating mutations in these genes with high-risks of ovarian cancer.\n\n    This study is one of the first to thoroughly evaluate breast cancer predisposition genes included in typical multigene panels in BRCA-negative FBC and to estimate risks of cancer by comparison with the ExAC reference control dataset. Assuming one predisposition gene mutation on average per ExAC control individual, approximately 1.7% of controls had a high or moderate-risk breast cancer gene mutation and 4.4% had mutations in the 26 genes under evaluation (Fig. 2). The high mutation carrier frequency adds to previous data from control populations and clarifies the likelihood of finding unexpected or incidental hereditary cancer predisposition gene mutation carriers in the unaffected population. This also strengthens the justification for counseling about the potentially broad spectrum of genetic findings for individuals undergoing genetic risk assessment. However, these results should be evaluated with caution as different ascertainment and sequencing techniques were used in the ExAC controls compared to the FBC cohort. In addition, the ethnic makeup of the FBC cohort and ExAC controls likely differs and it is possible that ORs may be over or underestimated based on differences in ethnic makeup or number of individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish status. Finally, the associations of FBC with BARD1 and CHEK2 truncating mutations are no longer significant when accounting for multiple testing (p-value threshold of <0.002), and therefore require validation in larger case-control studies.\n\n    Twelve individuals with breast cancer were identified as having copy number variants classified as likely pathogenic in these genes. Copy number variant analysis using NGS is promising, but is still in development. This is the first case-control analysis of this kind to include copy number variant evaluation. Copy number variants in CHEK2 and ATM showed significant associations. Of note, ATM showed a significantly elevated OR of 7.7 (95% CI 3.13-18.1, p = 9.64 x 10-6). Copy number variants were particularly enriched in the FBC women and will require further study. It is possible the FBC women with identified copy number variants represents an underestimate of the total number of copy number variant findings. However, it is unlikely that unidentified copy number variants account for the majority of the genetic etiology in mutation-negative FBC women. Additional research will be needed on this topic given the increasing use of NGS copy number variant calling for copy number variant detection by commercial genetic testing laboratories.\n\n    If we consider only mutations in genes that reached statistical significance in our analysis, (TP53, ATM, PALB2, BARD1, and truncating mutations in CHEK2), approximately 4.7% of BRCA negative FBC women have mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes. Given that BRCA mutations are responsible for another 5-10% of attributable risk, our results suggest that 86-91% of FBC women have no underlying genetic etiology that can be identified by mutational analysis of the exonic regions of genes on the majority of current breast cancer multigene panels, supporting the concept of missing heritability in breast cancer. In this study over 90% of variants identified in these categories among our 26 selected genes were determined to be VUS (Fig. 1). Thus, additional research is needed to study the contribution of intronic, missense, and synonymous variants in the current panel genes and other candidate genes to FBC.\n\n    As shown above, the risk estimates for mutations in many proposed breast cancer genes did not reach statistical significance. Based on these data, clinical actionability of genes with low or undefined-risk remains unclear. Results from this study support targeting the known clinically-actionable high and moderate-risk genes with multigene panels as a first-tier approach to understanding breast cancer susceptibility.",

        "Title": "    Association of functional variants and protein-to-protein physical interactions of human MutY homolog linked with familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    The human gene MUTYH codes for a DNA glycosylase involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Faulty MUTYH protein activity causes the accumulation of G T transversions due to unrepaired 8-oxoG:A mismatches. MUTYH germ-line mutations in humans are linked with a recessive form of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and colorectal cancer predisposition. We studied the repair capacity of variants identified in MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) patients. MAP is inherited in an autosomal recessive type due to mutations in MUTYH (Y165C, G382D, P54S, A22V, Q63R, G45D, S136P and N43S), indicating that both copies of the gene become inactivated. However, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition may serve as carriers, each harboring one copy of the mutated gene without showing signs or symptoms of MAP. Six protein partners have been associated with MUTYH, four via direct physical interactions, namely, hMSH6, hPCNA, hRPA1, and hAPEX1. We examined, for the first time, specific interactions of these protein partners with MAP-associated MUTYH mutants using molecular dynamics simulations. The approach provided tools for exploration of the conformational energy landscape accessible to protein partners. The investigation also determined the impact before and after energy minimization of protein-protein interactions and binding affinities of MUTYH wild type and mutant forms, as well as the interactions with other proteins. Taken together, this study provided new insights into the role of MUTYH and its interacting proteins in MAP.",
        "Introduction": "    Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) alterations in the human MUTYH gene have been associated with autosomal recessive colorectal cancer development. MUTYH is located on Chr1p32-34 and has 16 exons spanning 7,100 base pairs. The phenotype of MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is similar to attenuated FAP, having from 10 to a few hundred colorectal adenomas. It is estimated that ~1% of colorectal cancers are linked to MAP, but this number is likely to increase as more patients are carefully screened and test positive for MUTYH mutations. The clinical course of colon cancer is usually silent and initially without symptoms until the disease has reached an advanced stage as shown in the Fig. 1.\n\n    Although no germ-line mutations were detected in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene, tumor tissue from MAP patients had somatic APC mutations, mostly involving G:C to T:A transversions. KRAS mutations also have been detected in MAP patients.\n\n    The DNA glycosylase MUTYH plays a crucial role in base excision repair (BER) by preventing the accumulation of mutations resulting from oxidative DNA damage. MUTYH is an 8-oxoG:A mismatch repair enzyme in humans and is an ortholog of E. coli MutY enzyme, but has less activity for other mismatches such as G:A or C:A. It is involved in base excisions of the A/G, A/(Gene Ontology) GO and A/C type of non-pairings. MUTYH identifies and removes the oxidized purine 2-hydroxyadenine (2-OH-A) from different base pairs, particularly from 2-OH-A:G, indicating that the protein might counter the biological consequences of other oxidized premutagenic DNA bases. The DNA glycosylase starts BER by removing 8-oxoG from 8-oxoG:C base pairs. MUTYH also removes adenine inserted opposite 8-oxoG during replication. Subsequent to adenine elimination, apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease (APEX) cuts the apurinic site (AP), and the gap filling steps are then accomplished via the long patch BER pathway. Among DNA glycosylases, exclusion of the base opposite the lesion seems to be a distinctive characteristic of MUTYH and entails both the replication machinery and post-replicative mismatch repair (MMR).\n\n    In humans, germ-line biallelic mutations of the MUTYH gene are linked with a recessive form of FAP called MAP. MAP patients exhibit symptoms of colorectal cancer early in adult life, with widespread adenomatous polyps of the colon. Due to the failure of repair of 8-oxoG:A mismatches, tumors of MAP patients accumulate somatic G:C T:A transversions in cancer-related genes. In rodent cells, the inactivation of Mutyh is linked with high mutation rates, frequently because of the increase of G:C T:A transversions. Many mutations in the MUTYH gene, including missense and insertion/deletion alterations, have been observed in MAP patients. The Y165C and G382D substitutions are the most common variants in the European population, with a frequency of 1%, and have been observed in 80% of patients with mutations in both alleles of the MUTYH gene. Therefore, screening for MUTYH mutations might be important in identifying a subset of patients with early onset MAP. Therefore, further large-scale analysis of multiple genes expression datasets might lead to the identification of more representative gene expression signatures associated with CRC predisposition. Herein, we integrated one or more independent CRC gene expression datasets retrospectively, which led to the identification of a five genes that are associated signature associated with colorectal cancer systemic deterioration.\n\n    This paper deals with the identification of a MUTYH gene functional network and its relationships with others genes based on biomolecular interactions. The susceptible loci were interrogated for cross-interactions and ranked, using the Networked Gene Prioritize (NGP) method, to detect FAP-associated genes. Furthermore, we studied the MUTYH protein structural configuration and its mutation transition, via molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, and examined protein-protein interaction (PPI) formation of specific complexes, including structural predictions of such complexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report addressing MD simulation of the MUTYH protein domains (I and II). This study focused on chain A and investigated MUTYH DNA binding and protein interactions. Furthermore, comparative MD analyses of the MUTYH protein with other proteins were performed in order to clarify physical interactions between the wild type and mutants.",

The relationship of gene expression patterns with patient survival in the TCGA database was queried using the cBioportal database with the formula GENE: EXP > 0, where the gene represents a query of our associated genes are linked with polyposis syndrome. In addition, Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney test implied used to investigate the categorical and constant variables. We determined and compared survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze associations between Clinic-Pathological symptoms and patient survival. Overall survival (OS) data was taken from the cbioportal (http://www.cbioportal.org).\n\n    Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) represent common genetic variation that can encode changed amino acid residues in proteins. nsSNPs may impact the structure or function of expressed proteins, and therefore have an effect on disease outcome. In order to evaluate the phenotypic effects of nsSNPs in human DNA repair genes, we considered every polymorphism in terms of various functional properties. The functional properties were computed based on amino acid prediction from programs such as Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT). We provided a comprehensive, updated list of all validated nsSNPs from dbSNP, the public database of human single nucleotide polymorphisms at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI); however, we selected for detailed study MutY homolog (E. coli) nsSNPs within the exonic region, and Genome Variation Server (GVS) (http://gvs.gs.washington.edu), situated in the human DNA repair gene list. The list includes repair enzymes and genes associated with the response to DNA damage, as well as those implicated with genetic instability or sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. PolyPhen version 2.0.9 was used to predict the outcome of an amino acid change on the structure and function of a protein based on specific empirical rules and the encoded sequence. The protein sequence of MUTYH was submitted to PolyPhen2 under ID Q9UIF7, the program calculated PSIC scores (Position to Specific Independent Count) for each variant and estimates the difference between the variant scores, where a difference of >2.884 was considered as detrimental.\n\n    Protein structure effects were carried out from Project HOPE (Have yOur Protein Explanation) developed at the Centre for Molecular and Bio-molecular Informatics (CMBI) Department of Bioinformatics at the Radboud. The molecular origin of disease-related phenotypes caused by mutations in MUTYH was analyzed via data processing, predicting the impact of each specific mutation on the 3D structure and function of the protein. The UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/) web server was used for the retrieval of features that can be mapped on the modified sequence Homology Derived Secondary Structure of Proteins (HSSP) conservation scores and sequence-based predictions by DAS-servers were used for biological sequence annotation. The protein stability prediction were carried out based on the torsion angle (Cologne University Protein Stability Analysis Tool) (CUPSAT) and stepwise multiple regressions were then used to unify the atom and torsion angle potentials to construct the prediction model on both MUTYH domain I and II. Energy functions were predominantly derived from mean force potentials based on the Boltzmann principal. The torsion angle potentials were used in non-redundant structures of MUTYH proteins to derive the torsion angle phi and psi after running Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) for the entire dataset.\n\n    Several computational methods have been developed for the classification of SNPs according to their predicted pathogenicity; however, in this study we used SNPs&GO and Panther,. SNPs&GO program based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) which classify mutation type based on sequence information from Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) with function-based log-odds scores about protein functions describe by Gene Ontology (GO). Input was based on the selected position of each mutation, for both wild and mutant type residues of MUTYH protein structures. Binary predictions (pathogenic/neutral) were taken into consideration with their confidence values. The effects of a missense variant was categorized into three types; \"Probably pathogenic'', \"Possibly pathogenic\" and ''Benign.'' We converted these into binary classifications in two ways, first by considering only the ''Probably pathogenic'' class as pathogenic and the ''Possibly pathogenic'' and ''Benign'' classes as neutral, and second, by considering both the ''Probably pathogenic'' and ''Possibly pathogenic'' classes as pathogenic, and the ''Benign'' class as neutral.\n\n    The Bayesian approach was used to generate a gene network, based upon data obtained from Gene Ontology (GO), (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) (KEGG), Bio-molecular Interaction Network Database (BIND), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), and Reactome. These datasets were comprised of nearly 70,000 predicted protein-protein interactions. The genes received a primary assigned score of three different susceptibility loci, each containing a disease gene (P, Q or R) and a couple of non-disease genes. At each locus the 3 positional candidate genes increase the scores of genes functionally proximate within the gene network, using a kernel function which models the relationship between gene-gene distance and score effect. When all loci were processed, shuffling the three susceptibility loci 10,000 times across the genome allows resolving of an empiric p-value of each gene, and the eventual ranking of the positional candidate genes per locus. Genes P, Q and R should then end up as the top ranked genes, according to the significant p-values. The disease genes were ranked within the top 10 per artificial linkage region, when each region contained 100 genes. Based on this method we were able to identify the genes.\n\n    Using Global Range Molecular Matching (GRAMM-X) Docking Server v.1.2.0 carried out protein-protein interactions. GRAMM was compiled on SGI R10000 and PC (Linux) and also compiled on Red Hat, with glibc2.0. MUTYH (MutY Homolog E. coli) protein domain I determined by (PDB) ID: 1X51 contained several mutations. We selected 6 mutations associated with heritable predisposition to colon and stomach cancer syndrome of FAP. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. (Entrez Gene ID: Q9UIF7: MUTYH). Several proteins interacted with MUTYH. These proteins were used for further docking studies with four other proteins individually with and without mutations. We also compared the docking predictions with other programs, such as Fast Interaction Refinement in Molecular Docking (FIREDOCK). This method simultaneously targets the problem of flexibility and scoring of solutions produced by fast rigid-body docking algorithms. The side-chain flexibility was modeled by rotamers and the obtained combinatorial optimization problem was solved by integer linear program. Following rearrangement of the side chains of two proteins (MUTYH domain I with one of four other proteins), the relative position of the docking partners were refined by Monte Carlo (MC) minimization of the binding score function. The binding score ranks candidates and includes atomic contact energy, softened van der Waals (vdW) interactions, partial electrostatics and additional estimations of the binding free energy. The interaction studies were carried out using Knowledge-based FADE and Contacts (KFC Server) predicted binding \"hot spots\" for proteins and Protein-protein interactions by recognizing structural features indicative of important binding contacts with our proteins. These servers analyzed several chemical and physical features surrounding interface residues by using support vector machines.\n\n    MD simulations were determined by using the bio-molecular simulation program CHARMM. CHARMM-GUI (http://www.charmm-gui.org), offers a web-based graphical user interface to analyze a range of input files and molecular systems to standardize and make use of common as well as advanced simulation techniques in CHARMM. We used selected structures of MUTYH domains I, and II were used in the MD simulation method. In this simulation, the solvated system was neither minimized nor equilibrated; however, 0.15M ions were added in the simulation box by specifying ions (KCl) and concentration (C). The numbers of ions were automatically established by the ion-accessible volume (V), the total charge of the system (Qsys), and by the positive ion (z+) valency, to neutralize the total system charge, (z+N+-N- = -Qsys). The ion-accessible volume, V, was anticipated by subtracting molecular volume from the total system volume, selecting ion-placing method of Monte Carlo (MC). The solvation free energy was expressed as nonpolar and electrostatic contributions, but the nonpolar contribution was again partitioned into repulsive and dispersive contributions using the weak, free energy simulations were performed with explicit solvent water molecules in close proximity to the solute, whereas the influence of the rest of the solvent mass was showed implicitly as an effective Spherical Solvent Boundary Potential (SSBP). KCl was included to neutralize the overall negative charge of the MUTYH protein structure.\n\n    The MD simulations were performed with a 2-fs time step, which was smaller than the fastest vibrational period of liner bonds involved to small hydrogen atoms at a constant temperature of 300K and a constant pressure of 1atm under periodic solvent boundary conditions. The periodic box was enriched with water molecules up to 0.72805 g/l density. Addition of counter ions counterbalanced the entire system and every ionizable residue were protonated based on their pKa values (pH 7). Using simulated annealing process water molecules were relaxed. Energy minimization was run until the maximum atom speed dropped below 2000m/s, the system was then heated from 0 to 300K. Finally, at 300K and 10, 000 ps, equilibrated MD simulation were performed at constant pressure with 12A vdW cut-off. The electrostatic interactions were analyzed and 2000 snapshots were obtained at each 6.5ps. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was utilized for electrostatics, and a 12 A cutoff was applied for vdW interactions. The TIP3P water model was used as the solvent. The initial configuration of ions was verified using short Monte Carlo simulations with a primitive model, for instance vdW interactions. Mutations were studied using The Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 in Protein Crystallography and Molecular Graphic CCP4MG V.2.5.0, and energy minimization were carried out using NOMAD-Ref server. This server utilizes Gromacs force field for energy minimization according to the steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) methods. We also used the conjugate gradient method for 3D structure optimization and the deviation between the two structures was assessed by their RMSD values.",
        "Results": "    Deleterious point mutations of MUTYH in human FAP form 8-oxoG:C pairs, which initiate the binding of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) to regenerate G:C pairs via the BER pathway, with the involvement of PCNA, APE1, MSH6 and RPA1. Both OGG1 and MUTYH proteins have central roles in preventing the build-up of 8-oxodG damage and tumor formation (Fig. 2A-D). The MUTHY gene is associated with various diseases, including polyposis (Fig. 3A). It has been reported that MUTYH interacts with PCNA, APEX1, and RPA1, including the MSH6 subunit of MutSalpha MMR detection complex proteins (Fig. 3B). We examined, for the first time, protein-protein interactions, conformational changes, and binding affinities of wild type and novel mutant MUTYH variants with known partners involved in BER.\n\n    We successively focused on the potential role of the regulated genes that are associated in the CRC cancer panel. Therefore, targeted in a five genes i.e. MUTYH, PCNA, RPA1, APEX1, MSH6 which are associated with polyposis was validated using the TCGA CRC dataset to determine between their relationship to overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) (Fig. 4A) data from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. The OncoPrint for this gene panel in the TCGA CRC dataset with the proportion of patients overexpressing each gene is presented in (Fig. 4B-E). Interestingly, the combination of this five-gene revealed a higher prognostic value, in which patients overexpressing of the five genes showed month survival on both primary and metastatic (log-rank test P-value: 0.15e-9), living and decreases survival (log-rank test P-value: 0.00) and the affected individual both male and female survival ratio shown (log-rank test P-value: 0.843) than those with lower and over expression of these genes. Data from the univariate analysis were subsequently put into the Cox proportional hazards multiple regression models to identify the independent factors for prognosis.\n\n    The mutations nsSNPs in the MUTYH gene were identified and their impacts on the substituted residues were determined. A total of eight nsSNP mutations were detected and checked for their impact on MUTYH protein stability (Table 1). Positions to specific independent count (PSIC) scores for site substitution were as follows: 1.250 (A22V; benign, i.e., lacking phenotypic effect), 0.152 (Q63R, benign); 2.227 (G45D, probably damaged); 2.604 (P54S, benign); 0.351 (N43S, benign); 0.070 (P54S, benign); 2.884 (Y165C, probably damaged) and 2.004 (G382D, probably damaged), with normal accessibility score 0.85. Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) identified amino acid substitution influencing protein function and phenotypic outcome. The impact of point mutation on protein stability was ascertained using the Panther method for selected MUTYH nsSNPs within the exonic region (Table 2). This method was based on algorithms to locate homologous sequences using SWISS-PORT version 51.3 and TrEMBL 34.3. The substitution at position 326 from Ser-Arg was predicted to be tolerated (low confidence) with a score of 0.18 and median sequence conversion of 3.23. Threshold for intolerance was <0.05, damaging was <0.001 (Fig. 5). Among 152 SNPs identified in MUTYH, 95 were nsSNPs. Furthermore, a total of 90 samples obtained from the genome variant server (GVS) identified MUTYH with 32 SNPs; however, only five were nsSNPs (Fig. 6A and B). The functionally significant nsSNPs were predicted by SIFT (35.8%) and PolyPhen (37.7%). SNPs&GO further confirmed these results, with high correlations of 0.82 and 0.81, respectively.\n\n    The protein stability change was expressed as a linear combination of energy functions, where the proportionality coefficients varied with the solvent accessibility of the mutated residue and were identified with the neural network. The sequence optimality score (sum of negative DeltaDeltaGs) was computed for each substituted position in the protein. The optimality calculated a stability score, analogous to the free energy difference between a wild type and mutant protein. The stability score was used for predicting whether or not a mutation had an impact on the protein structure, and consequently a potential role in disease. The torsion angles were initialized with constant values of Boltzmann energy (Table 3).\n\n    The first identifed nsSNP mutation (P54S) substituted proline in the wild type (Fig. 7A), and affected backbone conformation required for correct enzymatic activity. The wild-type Pro residue was highly conserved, unlike other residues in this region. The observed mutant residue was not among others reported before in homologous proteins. The mutation results in the formation of an 'empty space' in the core of the protein (or protein-complex) and causes the loss of hydrophobic interactions in the core of the protein (or protein-complex). The protein stability due to this mutation differed in energy value by 1.47 kcal/mol, solvent accessibility (Acc) 0.00%, and torsion angles (phi, psi) -69.80, 144.10; consequently the prediction was for destabilization.\n\n    The second nsSNP mutation A22V (Fig. 7B) was buried in the core of the protein (or protein-complex), and the mutant residue likely exhibited steric hindrance. The change in energy value 0.03 kcal/mol, solvent accessibility (Acc) 0.00% and torsion angles (phi, psi) -1118.00, 105.10, resulted in predicted protein destabilization.\n\n    The third nsSNP mutation Q63R (Fig. 7C) differed from the wild type based on the energy value 0.15 kcal/mol, solvent accessibility (Acc) 69.36% and torsion angles (phi, psi) -92.50, -49.50; these parameters predited protein destabilization.\n\n    The fourth nsSNP mutation G45D (Fig. 7D) was located close to a highly conserved region and resulted in charge differences between the wild-type and the mutant proteins. The stability was altered due to a change in energy value 0.69 kcal/mol, solvent accessibility (Acc) 66.97% and torsion angles (phi, psi) 115.90, -145.40; hence, the prediction of destabilizing the protein.\n\n    The fifth nsSNP mutation S136P (Fig. 7E) substituted a residue on the protein surface, possibly affecting interactions with other molecules or with other surface residues. The torsion angles for this residue were unusual, indicating that only glycine was flexible enough to make the correct orientation, and mutation caused the local backbone to form incorrect conformations that disturbed local structure. The energy value (0.39 kcal/mol), solvent accessibility (Acc 7.70%), and torsion angles (phi, -68.30; psi, 140.10) predicted protein destabilization.\n\n    The sixth nsSNP mutation N43S (Fig. 7F) was within a domain annotated in Uniprot as \"Nudix hydrolase\". The wild-type residue was buried in the core of the protein (or protein-complex), and the stability of this mutation differed in energy value by -0.08 kcal/mol, solvent accessibility (Acc) 47.73%, and torsion angles (phi, psi) -43.60, 153.50; thus, the prediction of stability change was neutral.\n\n    Two additional mutations (Y165S, G382D) were obtained from Uniprot-entry MUTYH (Q9UIF7). MUTYH domain II structure predictions from I-TASSER showed highly conservered regions for PDB file 3N5N. The Y165S nsSNP mutation caused alteration in the corresponding structural domains (Fig. 7G). Mutation of this fully conserved residue was damaging for the protein. The mutation differed in energy value 0.70 kcal/mol, solvent accessibility (Acc) 45.61%, and torsion angles (phi, psi) -60.30, 141.10, causing the protein to destabilize. The nsSNP G382D mutation (Fig. 7H) affected protein stability, with the difference in energy value from the wild type being 0.64 kcal/mol, solvent accessibility (Acc) 57.89%, and torsion angles (phi, psi) -92.50, -149.30, the outcome being destabilizing.\n\n    Collectively, the data suggested that the stability, flexibility, and functional properties of the mutants differed and affected the protein stability of the wild type. Detailed analysis of contact energies before and after energy minimization located functionally or structurally important residues, and helped to classify consequences of each mutation, as well as identifying novel residues for site-directed mutagenesis. The difference in free contact energies (kcal/mol) for denaturation of MUTYH protein domain I and II between wild-type and mutant proteins was also determined using Chemical Computing Group (CCG) Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) (http://www.chemcomp.com) before and after energy minimization (Fig. 7I).\n\n    The disease-associated genes were obtained from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database based on the Mayo Clinic clinical data set. Colorectal cancer gene networks were identified for this complex disease. Artificial susceptibility loci, each comprising 100 genes, were constructed around 10 putative colorectal cancer genes described in OMIM. We assessed the performance of our classifier on the basis of these various data sources in three different gene networks generated on the basis of a Bayesian framework. One network was generated solely on the basis of GO data (GO network), one network was based on both Microarray Co-expression and predicted PPI data (MA and PPI network), and an overall network was constructed containing all three types of data (GO, MA and PPI network). The microarray co-expression and predicted PPI interaction (MA & PPI) network selected four genes (PCNA, MSH6, APEX1 and RPA1), whereas the GO network identified three genes (OGG1, MSH2, and MUTYH), and the GO, MA and PPI network was comprised of PCNA, MSH6, APEX1 and RPA1 (Fig. 8A-D). However, in the GO, MA and PPI network, among the top five disease genes showing strong interactions with MUTYH, only MSH6 and PCNA were identified.\n\n    The physiochemical properties of interaction interfaces were assessed by incorporating a naive Bayes classifier, a simple probabilistic classifier that relies on Bayes' theorem application with strong (naive) independence prediction, into a computational scheme to integrate diverse information. This approach took into consideration dynamic hydrogen bonding effects between the bio-molecules, inter-molecular H-bond, H-bond energy, and the specific solvation patterns of water molecules. Electronic polarization and charge-transfer as well as chemical bond formation are also taken into consideration. MUTYH protein domain I showed interactions with MSH6, PCNA, APEX1 and RPA1 proteins. Wild type MUTYH (control) and mutant (affected) proteins were analyzed separately based on interactive docking studies (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Protein interactions between the wild type proteins were normal based on the calculations of intermolecular H-bond, or H-bond and binding energies (Table 4.) Interactions also were determined for MUTYH with MSH6, PCNA, APEX1, and RPA1. In the wild type, MUTYH protein domain I interacted with MSH6 (Fig. 9A), and binding energy calculations for MSH6 (residues Ser196, Gly159, His113, Glu198) with MUTYH (residues Gly148, Ser150, Ser200, Pro152, Pro199) were -66.75 kcal/mol, whereas the intermolecular energy of H-bond formation was -7.45 kcal/mol. With wild type PCNA (Fig. 9B), the binding energy between residues Gly111, Leu205, Thr206 and MUTYH (residues Pro29, Ile255, Glu110) was -59.02 kcal/mol. The intermolecular H-bond energy (between three residues in PCNA and MUTYH (Ser154, Ser153) was -2.36 kcal/mol. The MUTYH wild type interacted with APEX1 wild type (Fig. 9C), exhibiting binding energy between APEX1 (Gln71, Arg75, Lys103, Tyr118, Leu104, Trp119) with MUTYH (Leu104, Asn102, Glu72) calculated as -33.85 kcal/mol. The intermolecular H-bond energy between the five residues, two in APEX1 (Lys103, Val142) and three in MUTYH (Glu59, Lys103, Tyr117) was -3.14 kcal/mol. The MUTYH wild type interacted with RPA1 wild type (Fig. 9D), showing binding energy betweens RPA1 (Val76, Ala31, Met1) and MUTYH (Leu38, Leu102, Gln35, Glu129, Leu38) of -93.60 kcal/mol. The intermolecular H-bond energy between two residues in RPA1 (Pro23, Ser150) and two in MUTYH (Tyr146, Ala31) was calculated to be -4.52 kcal/mol.\n\n    We further studied interactions of mutated MUTYH with the four wild type proteins. The mutated MUTYH protein interaction with wild type MSH6 protein had an altered physical interaction (Fig. 10A), which was reflected from the binding energy calculation between MSH6 (Arg140, Gln127, Gly111) and MUTYH (Thr137, Gly148), being less (-41.43 kcal/mol) than the MUTYH (control) and MSH6 (control) interaction. Similarly, the intermolecular H-bond energy was -7.92 kcal/mol between six residues of MSH6 (Arg86, Asp197, Gly149, Glu128, Leu76, Leu72) and six (Arg121, Tyr109, Thr137, Glu198, Ser146, Ser143) in MUTYH. Mutated MUTYH interactions with PCNA wild type (Fig. 10B) had a overall binding energy of -74.40 kcal/mol for PCNA residues Leu46, Gln125, Asn36 and MUTYH (Trp51, Leu47, Leu50). The intermolecular H-bond energy in PCNA (Gln125, Asp29, Asn65) and MUTYH (Thr137, Trp51, Gln40) was -7.92 kcal/mol. The mutant MUTYH interaction with wild type APEX1 (Fig. 10C) showed binding energy of -57.87 kcal/mol between three APEX1 residues (Gln117, Gln71, Tyr118) and three in MUTYH (Lys103, Leu104, Gln117). The intermolecular H-bond energy between the two residues of APEX1 (Lys103, Val142) with two of MUTYH (Glu59, Thr117) was -4.94 kcal/mol. Finally, the mutant MUTYH interaction with RPA1 wild type (Fig. 10D) showed altered physical interaction based on the binding energy betweens RPA1 (Leu102, Val176, Met1) and MUTYH (Leu38, Glu129, Gln35), calculated as -92.83 kcal/mol. The intermolecular energy of H-bond formation between three residues of RPA1 (Glu100, Pro23, Met1) and MUTYH (Thr116, Ala31, Ser150) was -5.71 kcal/mol.\n\n    Deleterious nsSNPs were searched from a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (dbSNP) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP), and from the single amino acid polymorphism database (SAAPdb) (http://www.bioinf.org.uk/saap/db/), which had data on SNPs from both dbSNP and Human Genome Variation database (HGVBASE). This approach displays data onto the translated regions of the gene to establish whether the mutation occurred in a region of interest and whether it resulted in a potential missense mutation. We selectively probed two domains from the MUTYH gene for MD simulations. First, PDB: 1X51 structure of the NUDIX domain from human A/G-specific adenine DNA glycosylase alpha-3 splice isoform, in the experimental structure methods from NMR work (Fig. 11A and B), was examined. This region has the UniProt identifier Q9UIF7. The domain I mutations affected chain-A at residues P54S, A22V, Q63R, G45D, S136P and N43S. Second, domain II of MUTYH protein was predicted by homology modeling from I-Tasser, a program that employs best fit according to the C-score showing homology with Q9UIF7 (MUTYH) protein based on TM-score 0.47 +- 0.15, RMSD 12.4 +- 4.3 A and C-score -2.03. The predicted protein was highly conserved with PDB: 3N5N. The crystal structure analysis of the catalytic domain and interconnector of human MUTYH in the experimental structure methods from X-ray 2.30 A (Fig. 11E and G) revealed this domain I model to have two mutations. These mutations changed the sequence in the glycosylase in a manner that was common in people of European descent. One mutation changed the amino acid Y165C, whereas the second mutation switched the amino acid G382D. The mutations from both MUTYH domains (I and II) positions were examined using SWISS-PORT and viewed separately to obtain altered model structures.\n\n    The energy minimizations were achieved by NOMAD-Ref Gromacs server, using force field energy for the native type protein in both domain I and II and mutant type protein structures. The total energy of native structures of domains I and II, and mutant structures, were calculated (Table 3), and ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 RMSD native and mutant protein structure, respectively. Using the CHARMM-GUI server that offers graphical user interface (GUI) for MD simulations, the consequence of mutations was studied using classical molecular dynamics approaches. We analyzed both the native and mutated structures through long simulations in defined solvent conditions, as well as investigating the differences in dynamics and stability in MUTYH domains (I & II).\n\n    The simulation created an aqueous solvent environment based on fixed parameters around the chain 'A' protein. Both domains of MutY homolog protein 1X51 were solvated showing system with octahedral boundary shapes with 5400 water molecules of 10 A cutoffs to fully solvate the molecule with edge distance 10.0 (Fig. 11C; 11D 11F). MD simulation procedures were employed to examine the dynamic performance of the two MUTYH domains I, and II. Trajectories over 10ns were based on analyzing the RMSD for both domains at 300K. RMSD with 0.10A at the start of the trajectory (t = 0) show the movements of both MUTYH domains took place throughout the thermalization and equilibration phases. The deviation value quickly increased at 300K during the initial 2ns and sustained until the end of simulation (t = 10 ns). The MUTYH domains (I and II) mutations exhibited quick elevation in deviation value (1.10 A) until 10ns and then reduced by the end of simulation.\n\n    The results indicated that the MUTYH domains were not stable and did not reach in folded conformation till finish of the simulation at 70  C. However, it was possible that the Mutated MUTYH domains structure may reach to stable and folded form at lengthier simulation times than the applied 10ns. NOMAD-Ref server performed energy minimizations studies for both wild and mutant structures. The total energy for the native protein structure domain I (1X51) following before energy minimization was 4719.71.985 kJ/mol (score; 0.69), whereas prior to after energy minimization it was 3676.5378 kJ/mol (score: -3.31). For the mutant protein domain II form(s) the corresponding before energy minimization was 390,841.524 kJ/mol (score; 0.50), whereas prior to after energy minimization it was 2453.2390 kJ/mol (score: -1.25).",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, the resulted presented in this study for the first time show that based on computational appoarches, the deleterious SNPs in Mutyh gene, functional network and its relationships with others genes were analyzed via bio-molecular interactions. We also performed comparative MD analyses of the MUTYH protein interactions with other proteins physically interacting with it as well as between the wild type and mutant type structures. The MUTYH protein domains I had six variants P54S, A22V, Q63R, G45D, S136P and N43S variants and likely have great clinical significance associated with cancer risk, whereas protein domains II had two Y165C and G382D. Based on gene ontology the MUTYH protein showed interaction with six proteins, however only four of them (hMSH6, hPCNA, hRPA1, and hAPEX1), exhibited physical interactions. The results suggested that the MUTYH mutations caused decomposition of binding free energies and structural analyses indicated that it also distorted the geometry of the binding site and hence weakened the interactions. Overall results showed that such a computational approach can prove to be very useful for understanding the molecular basis of a disease and significantly contribute to our understanding of protein-protein interactions, mutational implications on the protein structure and its impact on disease progression.",
        "Discussion": "    In the current study, we retrospectively derived and validated a gene expression signature associated with the risk of systemic relapse in patients with colorectal cancer. Analysis of the data from Colorectal Adenocarcinoma dataset (http://www.cbioportal.org). In the datasets, we identified upregulated and downregulated genes associated with in CRC. Interestingly, several of the identified genes (PCNA, RPA1, APEX1, MSH6, and Mutyh) were identified to be differentially expressed mRNA expression profiling of CRC compared to adjacent normal samples. Higher expression of gene MSH6 and MutyH was found to be associated with metastasis in different types of human cancers. Our analysis narrowed down the CRC recurrence signature to these five genes (PCNA, RPA1, APEX1, MSH6, and Mutyh) whose expression was associated with OS (log-rank test P-value: 0.15e-9) and the indidial average gender overall survey (log-rank test P-value: 0.843).\n\n    MUTYH is involved in the initial steps of MMR and BER pathways, providing key contributions for genomic stability and maintenance. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report that deals with in-silico modeling and functional/structural aspects of MUTYH variants. The MUTYH complete crystal structure has not been solved. However, the observed functional and interactive activities of MUTYH variants in this study can be related to the amino acid sequence information and structure of E. coli MutyH protein, which is 41% identical with human MUTYH. MUTYH has a catalytic site resembling the NUDIX domain from human A/G-specific adenine DNA glycosylase alpha-3 splice isoform, determined from NMR. All mutants studied here (Fig. 5A-I) were predicted to be within this catalytic domain.\n\n    While the C-terminal domain of E. coli MutyH protein is not needed for its adenine removal activity, it strongly interacts with the Gene Ontology (GO) containing strand to flip the target adenine out of the helix. In support of this theory, it has been shown previously that the removal of this domain from MUTYH protein drastically reduces its adenine incision activity from A:GO pair, but not from A:G mismatch. Indeed, it was previously shown that the C-terminal domain of truncated MutY is not only defective in removing \"A\" but also in binding substrate containing A:GO. Examples of variants in which the consequence of MUTYH function may be predicted by their corresponding position in the structure are the P18L, V22M and G25D (. These three SNPs are present in the RPA binding site in the N-terminus of MUTYH, and interfere with the localization of MUTYH to the site of DNA replication. Variants E466X and Y90X, which were found in individuals of Indian and Pakistani descent, respectively, represent truncated MUTYH protein due to a premature stop codon.\n\n    MUTYH domain I mutations probably have clinical significance with regard to cancer risk. Mutation P54S (Coil) showed solvent accessibility 0% (i.e. buried), whereas G45D (bend) showed 70% solvent accessibility, indicating that it is exposed on the outer surface; both alterations were designated as 'probable-pathogenic' for gastric cancer. Mutations A22V (beta-ladder, solvent accessibility 60%) and S136P (coil, solvent accessibility 8%, buried) both had predicted phenotypic consequences for colorectal adenomatous polyposis. Variants Q63R (Helix) and N43S (Coil) were predicted to be neutral. Mutation G45D showed 50% solvent accessibility but was buried, and clinical data indicated an associated with high colon cancer risk, as predicted in the modeling studies (\"functionally pathogenic\").\n\n    Domain II also had common mutations based on the clinical report, supporting a role in MUTYH-associated human carcinogenesis. Mutation Y165C (Loop) with 29% solvent accessibility was considered as intermediate, whereas G382D (Bend) with 29% solvent accessibility showed probable clinical relevance for increased cancer risk. Implications for protein structure and stability were calculated through atom and torsion angle potentials. The N43S variant was calculated as -0.08 kcal/mol (DDGp) and predicted to be neutral, whereas all other variants were destabilizing.\n\n    Modeling of protein-protein interactions also can provide important insights of wild type versus mutant MUTYH function, via predicted binding sites, protein networks, multi-molecular assemblies, mapping of metabolic pathways, and eventual drug design. Models supported four candidate proteins (MSH6, PCNA, APEX1, and hRPA1) interacting with mutated MUTYH. MUTYH co-localizes with PCNA to replication foci. In addition, MUTYH interacts with RPA. The interactions of PCNA with MUTYH and mismatch repair enzymes suggest that PCNA may act as a coordinator of both repair pathways. We hypothesize that proteins involved in DNA replication, mismatch repair, and base excision repair may exist as a multiple-protein complex, and that MUTYH may be orientated in the replication fork to recognize 8-oxoG on the parental strands and to excise misincorporated A on the daughter strand.\n\n    It has been suggested that PCNA may act as a molecular adaptor, coordinating and regulating the actions of DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle control. Thus, we further analyzed mutated MUTYH variants for functional networks and relationships based on data from the Bio-molecular Interaction Network Database (BIND), the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), Reactome, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes & Genomes (KEGG). This approach included analysis of susceptibility loci and genes from different loci that might be linked directly or indirectly. These methods are useful to rank candidate genes for each locus, and significantly increase the chance of detecting disease-related genes. Since MUTYH interacts with PCNA and DNA, it is possible that an indirect association between MUTYH and hMUTSalpha may occur. Direct physical interaction of these two proteins was determined from affinity-binding experiments with GST-tagged MUTYH and highly purified recombinant hMUTSalpha and hMUTS beta proteins. MUTYH recognizes the interface between MSH2 and MSH6 heterodimer, rather than the peptide motifs of MSH6. Western blotting suggetsed that MUTYH interacted with MSH6 but not with MSH2. This result is consistent with studies showing no interactions of MUTYH and MSH2 in HCT15 cell extracts. Although both MUTYH and MSH6 can bind to their DNA substrates, the interaction between both proteins can occur in the absence of DNA. It is interesting to note that the interaction of MUTYH with MSH6 wa substantially weaker in MT1 cells that express wild type MSH2 and missense mutant MSH6, as compared with the parental TK6 cells. The mutations are at the C- terminal region of MSH6 downstream of the ATP binding site. The result suggests that the C-terminal region of MSH6 is important for its interaction with MUTYH. Direct contact of MUTYH with the C-terminal region of MSH6 remains to be determined, although MUTSalpha can still bind mismatched DNA. It has been suggested that the mutations in MSH6 in MT1 cells may affect its ATPase activity.\n\n    In-silico MD simulation noted mutations of MUTYH affecting its associations with binding partners, due to binding site variations in hydrophobic versus electrostatic interactions. Generally, the packed protein cores and the 'hot spot' regions had residues that contributed significantly to protein stability. The hot spots were also highly conserved by evolution at the protein-binding site. It has been suggested that a hot spot region may provide a suitable target for drug design. We sought to explore the structural stability and associated thermodynamics in a realistic environment. Nonpolar effects remained consistently more favorable in wild and mutants, emphasizing the significance of hydrophobic effects in protein-protein binding. While entropy analytically opposed binding in every case, there was no observed trend in the entropy difference between wild and mutant MUTYH forms. Free energy decomposition showed residues were placed at the interface, making them favorable.\n\n    Finally, it was found that the monomer MUTYH model was stable in vitro, and such a model is suitable for protein stability analysis, although the monomer MUTYH binding to DNA binding and to other proteins was weaker. Our results showed that the MUTYH mutations examined caused decomposition of binding free energies. Furthermore, structural analyses indicated a distorted geometry of the binding site, and hence weaker interactions with S136P, G45D, N43S (L37V), A22V, Q63R and P54S.",

        "Title": "    Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in insulin resistance, weight regulation, lipid metabolism and inflammation in relation to metabolic syndrome: an epidemiological study",
        "Abstract": "    Mechanisms involved in metabolic syndrome (MetS) development include insulin resistance, weight regulation, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Aim of this study is to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in these mechanisms with MetS.\n\n    In a random sample of the EPIC-NL study (n = 1886), 38 SNPs associated with waist circumference, insulin resistance, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and inflammation in genome wide association studies (GWAS) were selected from the 50K IBC array and one additional SNP was measured with KASPar chemistry. The five groups of SNPs, each belonging to one of the metabolic endpoints mentioned above, were associated with MetS and MetS-score using Goeman's global test. For groups of SNPs significantly associated with the presence of MetS or MetS-score, further analyses were conducted.\n\n    The group of waist circumference SNPs was associated with waist circumference (P=0.03) and presence of MetS (P=0.03). Furthermore, the group of SNPs related to insulin resistance was associated with MetS score (P<0.01), HDL cholesterol (P<0.01), triglycerides (P<0.01) and HbA1C (P=0.04). Subsequent analyses showed that MC4R rs17782312, involved in weight regulation, and IRS1 rs2943634, related to insulin resistance were associated with MetS (OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.02-1.32 and OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79; 0.97, respectively). The groups of inflammation and lipid SNPs were neither associated with presence of MetS nor with MetS score.\n\n    In this study we found support for the hypothesis that weight regulation and insulin metabolism are involved in MetS development.MC4R rs17782312 and IRS1 rs2943634 may explain part of the genetic variation in MetS.",
        "Introduction": "    The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common multi-component condition consisting of abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and hyperglycaemia. It is associated with an increased risk of CVD (cardiovascular diseases) and T2D(type 2 diabetes). A central question in understanding MetS is why its underlying traits cluster together.\n\n    Several mechanisms, including insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, and inflammation have been proposed to underlie the clustering of MetS features. However, the etiology of MetS has not been unravelled completely yet. Genetic association studies may help to better understand MetS etiology.\n\n    A systematic review of genetic association studies on MetS showed that until now most SNPs for which an association with MetS has been found were involved in lipid metabolism. In a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) even all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MetS were involved in lipid metabolism. If effect sizes of SNPs involved in weight regulation and insulin resistance, pathways for which strong pathophysiological evidence exists, are small, these SNPs would not have been detected in GWAS, which have a low power due to adjustment for the large number of associations tested.\n\n    The SNPs for which an association with MetS has been established explain only a small part of the genetic variation in MetS. Therefore, many more genetic variants remain to be discovered. SNPs associated with insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, inflammation and lipid levels in GWAS are likely candidates for an association with MetS itself. For several of these SNPs, however, an association with MetS has not been investigated with a candidate gene approach.\n\n    A common feature of genetic association studies is that the power to detect associations is low, because of small effect sizes and the small alpha caused by adjustment for multiple testing. A way to account for this problem is to increase the effect size and reduce the number of tests, by studying the joint effect of a group of SNPs. To the best of our knowledge such an approach has not been undertaken in relation to MetS.\n\n    Therefore the aim of this study is to get more insight in the etiology of MetS, by studying associations between MetS and groups of SNPs that were found to be related to insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, inflammation or lipid levels in GWAS. For those groups of SNPs associated with MetS, we also study the association with the individual SNPs in this group.",
        "Methods": "    In the EPIC-NL cohort the two Dutch contributions to the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) project are combined: the Prospect-EPIC and the MORGEN-EPIC (Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases) cohorts. Both cohorts were initiated in 1993.The study design of the combined cohort is described in detail elsewhere. In brief, Prospect is a prospective cohort study among 17 357 women aged 49-70 who participated in a breast cancer screening program between 1993 and 1997. The MORGEN-project consists of 22 654 men and women aged 20-59 years recruited from three Dutch towns (Amsterdam, Doetinchem, and Maastricht). From 1993 to 1997, each year a new random sample of approximately 5000 individuals were examined.\n\n    Laboratory and genetic analyses were performed in a 6.5% random sample of the EPIC-NL study, in all incident T2D cases and in all incident CVD cases. In our study we only used the random sample. After exclusion of participants with missing blood samples (n = 157), missing values for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides or C-reactive protein (CRP) (n = 128), or with missing SNP data (n=433) the study population consisted of 1886 participants. All participants signed informed consent before study inclusion. Both studies complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Prospect-EPIC study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Utrecht and the MORGEN project was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of TNO, The Netherlands.\n\n    At baseline, a physical examination was performed and non-fasting blood samples were drawn. During the physical examination, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were performed twice in the supine position on the right arm using a BosoOscillomat (Bosch & Son, Jungingen, Germany) (Prospect) or on the left arm using a random zero sphygmomanometer (MORGEN). The mean of both measurements was taken. Waist circumference and height were measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. Body weight was measured with light indoor clothing without shoes on, to the nearest 100 gr.\n\n    HbA1c was measured with a homogeneous assay with enzymatic endpoint in erythrocytes. Trigycerides were measured in EDTA plasma using enzymatic methods, whereas hsCRP was measured with a turbidimetric method. MetS was defined according to an adapted version of the AHA/NHLBI MetS definition as having at least 3 of the following 5 MetS features: abdominal obesity (waist circumference  >=102 cm;  >= 88 cm); low HDL cholesterol (  <1.0;  <1.3 mmol/L); hypertriglyceridemia ( >=1.7 mmol/L); hypertension ( >=130/85 mm Hg or use of hypertensive medicication); hyperglycemia (HbA1C >=5.7% or glucose lowering medication). MetS-score was calculated by summing the number of MetS features present in each participant.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted in different batches using standard methods, such as salting out, QIAamp  Blood Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The participants were genotyped using a gene-centric 50K iSelect chip array, further referred to as IBC array. The design and coverage of the IBC array compared to conventional genome-wide genotyping arrays has been described in detail elsewhere. Additionally, the MC4R rs17782313SNP was genotyped in 853 women of the random sample with the KASPar chemistry, an allele-specific PCR SNP genotyping that uses FRET quencher cassette oligos. For this SNP genomic DNA was extracted with an in-house developed extraction method at Kbiosciences (Hoddesdon Herts, UK).\n\n    From the available SNPs, we selected those significantly associated (P<=1.0*10-5) with waist circumference, inflammatory markers, triglycerides or HDL cholesterol or homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in published GWAS until 01-01-2011. As only a few GWAS on HOMA-IR are conducted, we additionally included SNPs both associated with a glucose related traits in GWAS (P<=1.0*10-5) and with HOMA-IR (P<=0.05). Highly correlated proxy SNPs were included in case the original SNP from the GWAS was not available on the IBC array (r2CEU 1000 Genome Pilot 1 >= 0.80). If SNPs were only found in one GWAS, without a replication sample, they were excluded. In total we included 39 SNPs: 2 SNPs associated with waist circumference, 5 SNPs associated with insulin resistance, 6 SNPs associated with inflammation, 16 SNPs associated with triglycerides and 16 SNPs associated with HDL cholesterol (Table 1). Sixteen SNPs which were associated in GWAS with waist circumference, inflammatory biomarkers and lipid levels were not on the IBC CVD array (Appendix I).\n\n    Distributions of genotypes were tested for deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by chi-square analyses. Triglycerides and hsCRP were log-transformed to improve normality. Participants on blood pressure medication were excluded from the analyses on blood pressure, participants on glucose lowering medication from the analysis on HbA1C, and participants with acute inflammation (hsCRP > 10 mmol/L) from the analyses on hsCRP.\n\n    SNPs were divided into 5 groups (Table 1) according to the known associations in GWAS. These groups of SNPs were associated with the corresponding phenotype using the linear regression model of Goeman's global test. Subsequently, for each group of SNPs the association with MetS was analysed using the log-linear model of Goeman's global test, and the association with MetS-score using the linear regression model of Goeman's global test (see Figure 1: data-analyses scheme). If one of these associations was statistically significant, we conducted additional data-analyses. First, to see whether the association with the group of SNPs was mediated by the corresponding phenotype from GWAS, we adjusted the association between MetS and the group of SNPs for this phenotype. Second, we tested if the group of SNPs was also associated with the individual MetS features or hsCRP using the linear regression model of Goeman's global test. Third, we analysed the association of the individual SNPs in this group with MetS using log-linear models and with MetS-score using linear regression. For the individual SNPs which were significantly associated with MetS or MetS-score, we analysed associations with the individual MetS features and hsCRP using linear regression. We only conducted analyses with individual SNPs, for those SNPs which were on the group level associated with MetS or MetS-score. Consequently, only a few associations with individual SNPs were analyses. Therefore, adjustment for multiple testing is not appropriate.\n\n    All analyses were adjusted for age, sex and cohort. Significance was defined as a 2-sided P-value <0.05. The global test was calculated in R version 2.12.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; http://www.r-project.org). The analyses for individual SNPs were performed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, INC., Cary, North Carolina).",
        "Results": "    All SNPs were in HWE (P>0.05). Minor allele frequency of the SNPs ranged from 0.04-0.47 (Table 1). The random sample of EPIC-NL consisted of 465 men and 1421 women (Table 2). The mean age was 50.1 (SD 11.7) and 30.3% of all participants had MetS.\n\n    The group of abdominal obesity SNPs was significantly associated with waist circumference (P=0.01), the group of insulin resistance SNP with HbA1C (P=0.04) and the group of inflammation SNPs with hsCRP (P=7.3*10-6). In contrast, the group of triglyceride SNPs was not significantly associated with serum triglycerides (p=0.08) and the group of HDL cholesterol SNPs not with HDL cholesterol (P=0.32).\n\n    P-values for the association of all groups of SNPs with MetS or MetS-score are shown in Table 3. The group of SNPs known for their association with insulin resistance, was borderline significantly associated with MetS (P=0.06) and statistical significantly associated with MetS-score (P=0.003). This group of SNPs was also significantly associated with HbA1C, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol (Table 3). The associations of this group of SNPs with MetS-score and MetS features weakened slightly after adjustment for HbA1C (Table 3). Of the five insulin resistance SNPs included in the group IRS1 rs2943634 was the only SNP individually associated with MetS or MetS-score (Table 4). These associations remained after adjustment for HbA1C (data not shown). IRS1 rs2943634 was also associated with HbA1C (per allele difference -0.034, 95% CI -0.070; 0.002), triglycerides (per allele difference -0.051, 95% CI -0.085; -0.017) and HDL cholesterol (per allele difference 0.029, 95% CI 0.008; 0.052).\n\n    The group of SNPs known for their association with waist circumference, was statistical significantly associated with MetS (P=0.03) and tended to be associated with MetS-score (P=0.08). The association with MetS and the suggested association with MetS-score disappeared after adjustment for waist circumference (Table 3). Furthermore, no association was found with any individual MetS feature except for waist circumference (Table 3). Of the two abdominal obesity SNPs only MC4R rs17782313 was individually associated with MetS (Table 4). This association remained after adjustment for waist circumference.\n\n    MC4R rs17782313 was not associated with any individual MetS feature, including waist circumference itself (data not shown). The groups of SNPs linked in GWAS with inflammation, triglycerides or HDL cholesterol were neither associated with MetS nor with MetS-score (all P-values >= 0.15). Therefore no further data-analyses were done for these groups of SNPs.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this population based study of 1886 participants, we studied the relation between MetS and groups of SNPs associated in GWAS with waist circumference, insulin resistance, inflammation, triglycerides or HDL cholesterol. Only the group of waist circumference SNPs and the group of insulin resistance SNPs were associated with MetS or MetS-score.\n\n    In our study the group of SNPs which were associated with waist circumference in GWAS (MC4R rs17782313 and FTO rs1421085) was associated with waist circumference, as well as with MetS. The association with MetS disappeared after adjustment for waist circumference, indicating that the association with MetS is driven by the association with waist circumference. Furthermore, the association with MetS seemed mainly to be driven by MC4R rs17782313. In the KORA study among 7888 adults, an association between MC4R rs2229616 (r2=1 with rs17782313) and MetS was found, supporting our findings. Unfortunately, in our study, data on MC4R rs17782313 were available for women only. However, since in the KORA study the association between MC4R rs2229616 and MetS was not dependent on sex, we expect that this did not influence our findings. In our study the association between MC4R rs17782313 and MetS remained after adjustment for waist circumference. Furthermore, we found no association between MC4R rs17782313 and any individual MetS feature, including waist circumference. This suggests that the association between MC4R rs17782313 and MetS, is at least in part, independent of body weight. In both human and animal studies MC4R rs17782313 had an effect on insulin resistance, independent of body weight. Therefore, insulin resistance may explain part of the association between MC4R rs17782313 and MetS. Contrary to a meta-analysis among 12,555 Europeans, in which FTO rs9939609 (r2=1 with rs1421085) was significantly associated with MetS (OR 1.17 ; 95% CI 1.10-1.25), we did not observe an association between FTO rs1421085 and MetS. This discrepancy may be explained by the weak association between FTO rs1421085 and waist circumference in our study. In our study the regression coefficient between FTO rs1421085 and waist circumference was 0.03 per SD, whereas in other studies it ranged from 0.07 per SD to 0.14 per SD.\n\n    We found an association between insulin resistance SNPs and MetS and MetS-score that remained after adjustment for HbA1c, indicating that this association was not driven by HbA1C. However, since HbA1C is not an optimal marker of insulin resistance (r2 between HOMA-IR - HbA1C  0.50), we can not rule out that insulin resistance mediates this association. Out of the group of five insulin resistance SNPs, IRS1 rs2943634 was the only SNP significantly associated with MetS and MetS score. It was also associated with HbA1C, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Accordingly an IRS1 knock-out mouse model displayed a MetS like phenotype with insulin resistance, increased blood pressure, increased triglycerides, decreased HDL cholesterol and decreased LPL activity. Furthermore, in human studies IRS1 rs2943634 has been associate with glucose related and lipid traits. In contrast, in a study among 1126 non-Hispanic whites, 898 non-Hispanic blacks and 906 Mexican Americans, IRS1 rs7578326 (r2 with rs2943634=0.82) was not associated with MetS, neither in the overall population, nor in specific ethnic groups. However, as the number of Caucasian participants and MetS prevalence were lower than in our study, the former study may have been underpowered in Caucasian. Besides IRS1 rs2943634 the group of insulin resistance SNPs consisted of PPARG rs1801282, GCKR rs780094, GCKrs1799884, and IGF1rs35767. In line with other studies, none of these SNPs were associated with MetS in our data. This may be explained by the relatively weak effect on HOMA-IR of PPARG rs1801282, GCK rs1799884, and IGF1 rs35767 or by pleiotropic effects of PPARG rs1801282 and GCKR rs780094. The 12Pro allele of PPARG rs1801282 has opposite effects on insulin resistance and BMI in Caucasian subjects, whereas GCKR rs780094 has opposite effects on insulin resistance and lipid levels. These opposite effects may result in a zero association with MetS, as observed by for example Passaro et al..\n\n    We did not observe an association between groups of SNPs known for their association with triglycerides or HDL cholesterol and MetS. On the contrary, in a GWAS and a systematic review of genetic association studies, the majority of SNPs associated with MetS was involved in lipid metabolism. The lack of an association with MetS may be a power issue, because the association between lipid SNPs and lipid levels was relatively weak in EPIC-NL. Subgroup analyses revealed that these weak associations were consistent for all lipid SNPs and could not be explained by medication use, sex or a difference between the MORGEN and Prospect study. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the non-fasting state of our samples gives an explanation, as in a GWAS, the association with lipid levels was independent of the fasting state for most SNPs.\n\n    We found no significant association between a group of inflammation SNPs and MetS. Accordingly, in a study among 4286 British women, a CRP haplotype was not associated with the individual features of MetS. Furthermore, Rafiq et al. could not detect an association between T2D, an endpoint of MetS and 8 SNPs known to alter circulating levels of inflammatory proteins, which were located in the IL-18, IL1RN, IL6R, MIF, PAII and CRP genes. Overall, this evidence may suggest that genetic variants in inflammatory genes do not play a causal role in MetS development. However, for several reasons it cannot be ruled out that some SNPs in inflammatory pathways are causally related to MetS. First, for some inflammatory proteins SNP-MetS associations have not been investigated yet. Second, as the global test gives a combined result for all SNPs, the global test may be not significant despite the presence of an association between one of the single SNPs and MetS.\n\n    In this study we have explored the biomarkers involved in MetS development, by studying SNPs related to these biomarkers. Advantage of this approach is that according to the principles of Mendelian randomization the associations we investigated are neither affected by reverse causality nor by socioeconomic and behavioural confounders. Furthermore, as all participants were Caucasian, it is unlikely that our study results have been affected by population stratification. However, for some SNPs we measured, like IRS1 rs2943634, allele frequencies are very heterogeneous among different populations. Therefore, our results warrant replication in other study populations. Sixteen SNPs which were associated in GWAS with MetS related traits were not on the IBC CVD array. Inclusion of the three waist circumference SNPs, which were not on the array, would probably have increased the possibility to find associations with several MetS features. As the global test of inflammation SNPs on hsCRP was already highly significant (P=7.3*10-6), inclusion of additional SNPs, which were absent on the IBC CVD array, would not have changed our results for the global test, but may have revealed additional individual SNPs. The total number of lipid SNPs in our study was relatively large and relatively few lipid SNPs were missing. Therefore we believe that inclusion of additional lipid SNPs would not have changed our results considerably on the group level. The IBC CVD array covered all insulin resistance SNPs discovered in GWAS. However, up till now for only three SNPs a genome wide association with HOMA-IR has been found and replicated. To increase power we also included those SNPs associated with glucose related traits in GWAS, which were also associated with HOMA-IR (P<=0.05). However, as the association between the group of insulin resistance SNPs and HbA1C was just significant, the power to detect associations with MetS and its features was still low.\n\n    In conclusion, we found that SNPs associated with waist circumference or insulin resistance in GWAS were also associated with MetS. These results are in line with the hypotheses that weight regulation and insulin metabolism are causative factors for MetS.\n\n    Individual SNPs for which we found an association with MetS were MC4R rs17782312 which is involved in weight regulation and IRS1 rs2943634 which is involved in insulin resistance.",

        "Abstract": "    Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has an increasing prevalence in Western countries, affecting up to 20% of the population.\n\n    The aim of this project was to systematically review and summarise the genetic association studies that investigate possible genetic influences that confer susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\n\n    The MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases were searched to identify candidate gene studies on histologically diagnosed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n    A total of 85 articles have been summarised and categorised on the basis of the general pathway each candidate gene is involved in, including lipid metabolism, lipoprotein processing, cholesterol synthesis, glucose homoeostasis, inflammatory response, protection against oxidative stress and whole body metabolism.\n\n    The main findings demonstrate a small but consistent association of PNPLA3 with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Genetic association studies have investigated general disease susceptibility, histological characteristics, severity and progression. However, further study is required to better elucidate the genetic factors influencing fatty liver disease.",
        "Introduction": "    Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common disorder and a major global burden, affecting up to 30% of the general population and approximately 80% of obese individuals. NAFLD is frequently associated with the metabolic syndrome including diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia and obesity, and NAFLD can be divided into simple steatosis (SS), involving lipid accumulation in the liver, and the more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), accounting for approximately 5% of UK cases. There are no approved treatments for NAFLD; management is exercise and weight loss. The mortality in NAFLD is mainly cardiovascular disease; however, NASH causes cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n    It has been proposed that the aetiology of NAFLD is multifactorial, involving interacting genetic and environmental factors. Studies have investigated candidate genes for susceptibility to NAFLD and to NASH. This project aimed to produce a systematic review of the candidate gene studies that investigate genetic association with histological characteristics of NAFLD and NASH.\n\n    NAFLD is defined as \"fat accumulation in the liver exceeding 5% of its weight\", and is a diagnosis of exclusion based on clinical, biochemical and imaging techniques, although the gold standard is liver biopsy. Diagnosis of NASH requires liver biopsy and is based on histological criteria; there is not a universally accepted system, but the NAFLD-Activity Score (NAS), by Kleiner et al, has been independently validated and used in research.",

The MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies evaluating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with and/or severity of histologically diagnosed NAFLD or NASH, using keywords relating to: (1) disease (MESH \"fatty liver\", NASH, NAFLD) and (2) genetic studies (MESH \"polymorphism, single nucleotide\", MESH \"genetic association studies\", MESH \"genetic predisposition to disease\", polymorphism). Results were restricted to human and English language studies. Articles were screened for relevance using the title and abstract. Editorial, correspondence and review papers were excluded. Full-text articles were then obtained for the remaining studies; inclusion required histological diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH, and that fatty liver disease was distinguished from alternate causes of liver disease, including alcoholic, viral, drug-induced and autoimmune aetiologies. Histological diagnosis was used as a standard for study quality, and studies using clinical, imaging or biochemical criteria for NAFLD and NASH were not included. Results were required to be reported using ORs and CIs. A traditional, descriptive review of the literature was performed.",
        "Results": "    Literature searches of MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, through to 12 May 2014, retrieved a total of 465 articles after duplicates were removed. There were 205 articles that were not relevant candidate gene studies, and review, editorial and correspondence articles accounted for 86 papers. Of the genetic studies relating to NAFLD, diagnosis was based on MRI or CT in 25 instances, hepatic ultrasound scan in 48, and 14 papers focused on clinical and biochemical characteristics (figure 1). Four articles were further excluded from the review: in one case, exclusion was due to inconsistency between NAFLD and NASH; two studies did not report results relating to individual genes;  and one study did not exclude fatty liver from the control cases. One study, published shortly after the search date, was identified by personal communication and was included. Two further studies were manually identified after the search date.\n\n    A total of 85 articles investigating over 40 candidate genes were eligible for inclusion in this review. These have been summarised and organised into general pathways, with genome-wide association study (GWAS) papers summarised separately, as shown in table 1. Information relating to study population, number of patient and control participants and candidate genes investigated for each study is summarised in online supplementary table S1. Additional information on candidate genes and polymorphisms, including minor allele frequency, is provided in online supplementary table S2. In all studies, genomic DNA was retrieved from blood samples unless stated otherwise. The results of studies evaluating more than one candidate gene have been described in the relevant sections, where appropriate.\n\n    The patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 gene (PNPLA3), also known as adiponutrin, encodes a lipase enzyme expressed in adipocytes. The gene was first identified as a candidate for NAFLD susceptibility in a GWAS by Romeo et al, which found a significant association with the rs738409 polymorphism (not included in this review as fatty liver was assessed using 1H-MRI). The rs738409 variant is thought to eliminate the lipase activity of the enzyme.\n\n    A number of candidate gene studies have replicated the association of PNPLA3 polymorphisms in different populations (figure 2). The effects of rs738409 on histological characteristics, disease severity and NASH diagnosis have also been investigated.\n\n    Sookoian et al performed a case-control study evaluating rs738409 polymorphism on an Argentinian population of 172 patients with NAFLD, compared with 94 controls. Discrete trait analysis showed the G allele to be associated with NAFLD compared with controls, and this relationship persisted with multivariate logistic regression, independently of age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and insulin status (HOMA-I). Of the patients with NAFLD, 103 were biopsied, 40 had SS and 63 had NASH. The G allele variant was found to be significantly associated with disease severity (GG>CG>CC) and with NASH compared with SS, with reported OR 1.88 per G allele (95% CI 1.03 to 3.43). Increased steatosis was observed with the homozygous variant (GG) compared with the heterozygous variant, which was subsequently more severe than observed for the wild type genotype.\n\n    Hotta et al evaluated the effects of rs738409 on a Japanese cohort of 253 patients with NAFLD and 578 healthy population controls. Of the patients with NAFLD, 189 were diagnosed with NASH and 64 with SS. The study demonstrated a significant dose-dependent relationship of SNP frequency between the NAFLD and control groups, and between patients with NASH and SS. Histologically, the variant allele had an additive effect with increased fibrosis stage, but no association was found with steatosis.\n\n    Zain et al evaluated the rs738409 polymorphism in a mixed ethnicity Malaysian group of 144 patients with NAFLD and 198 healthy population controls, with subgroups of Malay, Chinese and Indian ancestry. Results indicated that NAFLD was significantly associated with the risk G allele with an overall OR 2.34 which remained significant after age and gender were controlled for, and the association was different between the ethnic subgroups as demonstrated in figure 2. The NAFLD group was histologically subdivided into patients with SS, NASH with fibrosis score <2, and NASH with fibrosis score of 2+. When NASH was compared with SS, the variant G allele was found to be associated with NASH (OR 2.64). Histological characteristics of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning and fibrosis grade were further analysed; the GG genotype was significantly associated with fibrosis stage but no other features. Patients with at least one G allele were found to be more likely to have a fibrosis score of >=2 (OR 1.95), suggesting a relationship with disease severity.\n\n    Valenti et al investigated the association of the PNPLA3 I148M variant with histological NAFLD in a European population, comprised of 321 UK and 253 Italian patients. The variant G allele was found to be significantly more prevalent in the Italian patients with NAFLD compared with 179 healthy, population-matched controls, and participants with homozygous variant genotype had an increased risk of NAFLD compared with wild type. In the combined population, the variant G allele was found to be an independent predictor for grade 2-3 steatosis, and had a dose-dependent effect on fibrosis stage >1, independently of steatosis. The variant allele and GC/GG genotypes were also associated with the presence of NASH in the combined and UK cohorts, independently of BMI, steatosis and diabetes. The study also investigated allele transmission in 71 Italian family trios, observing that the variant allele was preferentially transmitted compared with the wild type.\n\n    In the same year, Valenti et al studied the rs738409 polymorphism with histological severity of NAFLD in an Italian paediatric cohort (n=149). The study found that severity of steatosis was associated with the variant GG genotype (OR 18.86), independently of age, body mass and metabolic syndrome. The homozygous variant was also associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and perivenular fibrosis, but not periportal fibrosis.\n\n    Verrijken et al investigated PNPLA3 rs378409 on a cohort of 470 overweight and obese Caucasian patients, of whom 287 underwent liver biopsy. Histological characteristics were evaluated in the biopsied subgroup, with heterozygotes and variant homozygotes found to have a risk of increased steatosis, lobular inflammation, severity of inflammation and ballooning, with sex-adjusted and age-adjusted OR of 7.41 (CI 3.235 to 16.697), 1.86 (CI 1.046 to 3.321), 3.5 (CI 1.712 to 7.150) and 2.78 (CI 1.514 to 5.119), respectively. Fibrosis was not found to be associated.\n\n    Guichelaar et al also evaluated the association of PNPLA3 rs378409 with histological severity on obese patients. A cohort of 144 predominantly female obese patients underwent biopsy; 12 had normal histology, 60 had SS and 72 were found to have NASH. The rs378409 G allele was found to be associated with NASH when compared with the combined normal and patients with SS, with multivariate OR 2.5 (CI 1.1 to 5.3).\n\n    Rotman et al evaluated six polymorphisms including rs738409 in 894 adult and 223 paediatric patients within the US NASH CRN cohort. The adult cohort was compared with a population control group of 336 Caucasian men aged 50 years and over. Results showed three variants: rs738409 and rs2281135 in PNPLA3 and rs2143571 in nearby SAMM50 were significantly associated with NASH compared with controls. The remaining three variants investigated: rs11597390 (CPN1), rs11597086 and rs11591741 (CHUK) were not significantly associated with NAFLD. These were associated with increased fibrosis, although whether this specifically relates to fibrosis in NASH requires further investigation.\n\n    Disease severity was further investigated, with univariate analysis showing a significant association between rs738409 allele frequency and features of steatosis and both portal and lobular inflammation. Variant allele frequency was not significantly associated with histological fibrosis or cellular injury but was associated with more severe disease in a dominant pattern. This relationship persisted after factors of age, sex, BMI, diabetes and alcohol intake were controlled for. Patients with the GG and GC genotypes were more likely to have a moderate-to-severe steatosis score (>=2; OR 1.46), Mallory-Denk bodies (OR 1.55), lobular inflammation (OR 1.84) and portal inflammation (additive OR 1.57). Multivariate analysis showed a highly significant association of the G allele with fibrosis in an additive manner, which remained after adjustment for histological parameters of steatosis, inflammation and ballooning, suggesting an independent variable. Fibrotic bridging was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.50 for each G allele. The variant allele was also associated with an increased NAS in a dominant pattern on univariate and multivariate analyses. Polymorphisms rs2281135 and rs2143571 on chromosome 22 had similar associations with NAS. Furthermore, 438 adult patients with definite histological NASH were compared with 82 with SS and the control cohort (n=336), but the rs738409 was not significantly different between SS and NASH groups. In contrast to results found by Valenti et al, the rs738409 SNP was not associated with any histological parameters in paediatric patients.\n\n    Speliotes et al studied 12 polymorphisms at seven loci in patients in the US NASH CRN cohort. A total of 592 patients of European ancestry were compared with a control group comprised of 1405 US and European patients enrolled in the Myocardial Infarctions Genetics Consortium (MIGen) study. The MIGen study used a control group to limit the influence of cardiovascular disease status. The rs738409 was found to be significantly associated with both NAFLD and overall histological components (steatosis >5%, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, NASH diagnosis and fibrosis) compared with control. However, the histological features are highly inter-related within the NASH CRN cohort, so the case-control associations may not be reflective. PNPLA3 rs2294918 and rs2281135 SNPs were also assessed, but no association was observed after controlling for the I148M variant. One limitation to this study is that the MIGen control group was not assessed for the presence of liver disease. Case-only analysis was performed within the NASH CRN cohort, and showed that rs738409 was associated with increased lobular inflammation >=2, but not hepatocyte ballooning or NASH diagnosis. When steatosis distribution was evaluated, patients with the variant allele were less likely to have perivenular centred steatosis. The authors hypothesise that this may be related to diffuse fat deposition and progression to advanced disease.\n\n    Petta et al evaluated the influence of PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism on NAFLD severity in a Sicilian population. Of 160 patients with NAFLD, 99 had NASH, 15 did not have NASH and 46 were described as indeterminate. The study found the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant was associated with moderate-severe steatosis (grade 2-3) by univariate analysis, but the relationship did not persist after Bonferroni correction. Multivariate logistic regression showed the homozygous variant rs738409 genotype was significantly associated with a higher score when using a recessive model.\n\n    Corbin et al investigated 21 candidate genes on 446 patients in the Duke University Health Systems NAFLD Clinical Database and Biorepository. The study found that PNPLA3 was significantly associated with increased histological steatosis only, with an additive effect. The study did not observe any associations with ADIPOQ, CHDH, MTHFD1, PEMT, PPARG and STAT3 genes; further information regarding these genes is given in relevant sections.\n\n    Gorden et al studied a cohort of 1092 US patients who underwent liver biopsy during bariatric surgery. Of the 1092 patients histologically assessed, 748 had evidence of NAFLD (187 of these diagnosed with NASH), with no evidence of steatosis in the remaining 344 patients who were used as the control group. A number of candidate genes including PNPLA3 were investigated, and rs738409 was found to be significantly associated with histological features of increased steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning. The LYPLAL, GCKR and PPP variants also studied were not associated with an increased risk of lobular inflammation, ballooning or fibrosis, but a trend towards increased steatosis was observed.\n\n    Sookoian et al performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the PNPLA3 rs738409, comparing wild type (CC) and variant (GG) genotypes. Six of the studies with histological NAFLD assessment described above were included: Valenti, Valenti, Sookoian et al, Speliotes et al, Rotman et al, Hotta et al. Meta-analysis showed that NASH was more frequently associated with the variant genotype compared with the wild type. The variant genotype was also associated with increased inflammatory scores when four of these studies were considered, and significantly associated with fibrosis on the basis of five studies. The study also commented that the heterozygous risk was similar to the homozygous variant and suggested a dominant model for the risk of severe histological features.\n\n    Lipin is involved in triglyceride synthesis, lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. The rs13412852 variant was investigated by Valenti et al in two Italian cohorts of 142 paediatric and 115 adults with NAFLD, compared with 337 healthy controls. With regard to the paediatric patients, the variant was significantly less frequent in NAFLD compared with control. Histologically, the homozygous variant genotype was associated with reduced fibrosis (OR 0.29, CI 0.11 to 0.66), and trended towards reduced NASH prevalence. No significant differences were noted between the adult patients and control group, although trends towards fewer NASH and reduced fibrosis were observed with the homozygous variant. The results suggest a protective role for the minor allele; however, the paediatric results should be interpreted cautiously as were compared with an adult control group.\n\n    The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are a group of nuclear receptors involved in regulating the transcription of genes involved in metabolic pathways. Stimulation of PPARG, along with coactivator PPARAGCA1, upregulates the expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and fatty acid storage, whereas PPARA, expressed in the liver, stimulates fatty acid catabolism.\n\n    Gawrieh et al investigated the PPARG Pro12Ala and C1431T variants in a US population. DNA was extracted from liver biopsy samples of 212 patients with NAFLD, and blood samples from 62 controls. Results did not reach statistical significance for allele frequency or histological characteristics. Genetic modelling and haplotype analysis of the two PPARG variants showed that patients with both minor alleles (GT) had a lower risk of NAFLD, but also increased inflammation and advanced fibrotic change, when compared with patients with both major alleles (CC). However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as there was a low successful genotyping rate of 65% from the biopsy samples.\n\n    Rey et al studied the effect of the PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphism in German patients with fatty liver disease, including 100 patients with alcoholic liver disease and 263 patients with NAFLD. Genomic DNA from fatty liver patients was extracted from biopsy samples and compared with 259 blood samples of healthy controls. A slightly increased but non-significant relationship was seen in variant allele incidence between NAFLD and control groups, and there was no association with histological inflammation in NAFLD.\n\n    Dongiovanni et al, 2010 investigated the PPARG (Pro12Ala) and PPARA (Leu162Val) variants in a biopsy-proven NAFLD cohort of 202 Italian patients, compared with 346 healthy controls. Analysis showed that the allele frequency was not significantly different between NAFLD and control, and no significant difference was observed in histological characteristics.\n\n    The same variants of the PPARA and PPARG genes (Leu162Val and Pro12Ala, respectively) were also investigated by Domenici et al. A cohort of 103 Brazilian patients with NAFLD was compared with 103 healthy controls; of the NAFLD group, 89 had histological NASH and 14 had SS. There was no significant difference in allelic frequencies between NAFLD and control, but the Ala PPARG variant was less common in the NASH group compared with the control group. Histologically, the wild type PPARA genotype (LeuLeu) was found to be associated with more severe fibrosis.\n\n    Yoneda et al performed a case-control study investigating 15 SNPs in the PPARGC1A candidate gene, in a Japanese cohort of 115 patients with NAFLD and 441 healthy population controls. Results showed that the T allele of rs2290602 was significantly associated with NAFLD (OR 2.73) in the dominant mode when compared with control. Within the NAFLD group, 65 patients had histological NASH, and 50 had SS; a trend towards increased T allele frequency in the NASH group was noted, however this did not reach statistical significance, possibly a result of the small sample size.\n\n    Sahebkar performed a meta-analysis of the PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphism. Seven studies were included in the quantitative review, including the four histologically proven studies described above. Results of the meta-analysis showed no protective or predisposing effect of the variant in any genetic model. When the results of Gawrieh et al were excluded as an outlier due to high BMI, the variant was significantly associated with NAFLD, and the author proposes the effects of obesity may complicate the relationship.\n\n    The apolipoprotein C-III, encoded by APOC3 gene on chromosome 11, is a very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) component that functions to inhibit lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase. Mutations in APOC3 are known to be associated with hypertriglyceridaemia and it is hypothesised that this protein delays catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles and is involved in hepatic lipid processing. The APOE gene on chromosome 19 encodes apolipoprotein E, the main apoprotein of the chylomicron that is involved in endocytosis and clearance of chylomicron and VLDL particles by the liver. Mutations in this protein are known to be associated with familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia. Oxidised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor 1 is encoded by ORL1 on chromosome 12. The receptor binds oxidised LDL, which is then internalised and degraded in the liver.\n\n    Valenti et al investigated APOC3 polymorphisms T-455C and C-482T in a cohort of 758 European (Italian and UK) patients with NAFLD. The case-control study between the Italian patients with NAFLD and 316 healthy Italian controls found no protective effect of the APOC3 wild type, and no significant association with histological characteristics or NASH diagnosis was observed. Verrijken et al also investigated the rs2854117 variant of APOC3, finding no significant associations with disease severity, fibrosis or other histological characteristics.\n\n    Sazci et al evaluated apolipoprotein E polymorphisms in 57 Turkish patients with NASH, compared with 245 healthy controls. The study found that the APOEepsilon3 isoform was associated with an increased risk of NASH, whereas the heterozygous APOEepsilon3epsilon4 was protective.\n\n    De Feo et al investigated the three major isoforms of APOE on an Italian population of 310 patients with NAFLD (109 biopsy proven) and 422 population controls. The case-control study found that at least one APOEepsilon4 allele significantly reduced the risk of NAFLD (OR 0.51, CI 0.28 to 0.93) when compared with the homozygous wild type. Histological assessment in the biopsied subgroup found no significant association with APOE genotype and fibrosis.\n\n    Gambino et al compared 29 Italian patients with NASH with 27 controls but found no significant difference in APOE polymorphisms; however, this study has less power due to small sample size. Musso et al also investigated APOE isoforms on a larger Italian population, comparing 78 patients with NAFLD, 34 of whom were biopsied and diagnosed with NASH, to 156 healthy controls. APOE genotypes were not found to be significantly different. The study also compared 40 Italian patients with NASH with 40 ORL1 genotype-matched controls and concluded that the ORL1 IVS4-14 G allele was associated with the severity of steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis.\n\n    Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is an enzyme in the liver that catalyses the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine, a substance that is required for VLDL secretion. Dong et al evaluated the prevalence of the PEMT V175M allele in a Japanese population between 107 patients with NASH, a normal control population (n=150) and a cohort of 100 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Both the M allele frequency and M/- genotype were significantly increased in the NASH participants when compared with the control and patients with chronic hepatitis C. There were no significant differences in genotype or allele frequency between the normal and hepatitis C controls, indicating that the association observed is likely to be more specifically related to NASH than viral hepatitis.\n\n    Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) is a heterodimeric protein involved in triglyceride, phospholipid and cholesterol ester transport, and lipoprotein assembly. The MTP gene located at 4q23 encodes the 88kD large subunit of MTTP, and mutations in this protein are associated with familial abetalipoproteinaemia. The encoded variant of MTP -493, with C to G transversion, undergoes less transcription than the wild type protein.\n\n    Namikawa et al studied the variant -493 G allele of MTP in 63 biopsy proven patients with NASH with 150 healthy controls in a Japanese population. The MTP allele and homozygous variant genotype were both found to be significantly associated with NASH compared with controls. The variant genotype was also associated with increased steatosis and increased histological grade of NASH when compared with the heterozygous carriers.\n\n    Gambino et al described above also investigated the frequency of the homozygous MTP variant between patients with NASH and controls. No significant difference in allele frequency was observed between Italian patients with NASH and controls, but within the NASH group, the severity of histological steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis was increased in patients with the variant genotype when compared with heterozygotes and homozygous wild type patients. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited sample size of 27 patients.\n\n    Carulli et al performed a candidate gene study in an Italian population investigating the three candidate genes MTP, PCIKI and IL6. The study compared 114 patients with NAFLD, including 59 who underwent biopsy, against 79 healthy population controls. With regard to MTP, the case-control study was not significant, and there was no association with histological characteristics or NASH diagnosis within the biopsied group. The study also found no association with the PCIK I121Q variant, and results pertaining to IL6 are described in the relevant section.\n\n    Oliveira et al evaluated the MTP -493 (C/G) polymorphism in a cohort of 139 Brazilian patients with NAFLD, comprised of 45 with SS and 86 with NASH. The MTP G allele was not found to be associated with NAFLD when compared to 141 controls or with NASH when compared to SS.\n\n    El-Koofy et al investigated the association of MTTP and SOD2 SNPs with NAFLD in a paediatric Egyptian cohort. A total of 76 children with NAFLD were compared with 20 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls. Within the NAFLD group, 33 underwent liver biopsy, and of these, 8 had SS, NASH was present in 7 cases, and the remaining 18 samples showed normal histology. The homozygous -493 MTP genotype (TT) was not present in any of the 15 patients with NASH or SS. No association was reported with the SOD2 118T/C variant, but when the homozygous wild types of MTP (GG) and SOD (TT) were combined, the study reported a significant risk of NASH compared with controls (OR 54, CI 4.1 to 707). These results should also be treated with caution as only seven patients diagnosed with NASH were studied.\n\n    Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins are leucine zipper transcription factors that regulate the transcription of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Musso et al investigated the effect of the rs11868035 variant of SREBP factor 1C on histological severity in 42 biopsy-proven Italian patients with NAFLD. The wild type and heterozygous genotypes were found to be associated with an increased severity of steatosis, necroinflammation, increased NAS, increased fibrosis score and increased prevalence of NASH when compared with the mutant genotype. Multivariate analysis showed this SREBP1C polymorphism to be independently associated with both severe steatosis and NASH. In a separate study, the same group evaluated the effect of polymorphisms in SREBP factor 2 in biopsied patients with NAFLD. The study reported that patients with heterozygous and homozygous variant genotypes demonstrated an increased severity of histological characteristics and NASH diagnosis compared with wild type patients. The SREBPF2 variant allele was found to be an independent predictor of NASH within these patients (OR 2.92, CI 2.08 to 4.18).\n\n    There are a number of theories regarding the role of cellular oxidative stress as a factor contributing to the development of NAFLD and NASH. It is therefore unsurprising that a number of studies have investigated genetic variants that might reduce the ability of hepatocytes to protect against oxidative stress, including polymorphisms in the SOD2, UCP3 and GCLC genes.\n\n    The superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene on chromosome 6 encodes the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase. This is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and catalyses the conversion of superoxide by-products of oxidative phosphorylation to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Mutations in SOD2 have been previously associated with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, certain cancers and motor neuron disease. The rs4880 C47T polymorphism of SOD2 is a C to T transversion that results in a valine to alanine substitution in the mitochondrial-targeting region of the protein and may alter the tertiary protein structure.\n\n    Al-Serri et al conducted a linkage study on 71 Italian families and found that the C47T SNP was preferentially transmitted. The study then evaluated the C47T SOD2 polymorphism in a European cohort of 510 patients with NAFLD. The study showed the SOD2T variant was associated with advanced fibrosis (scores of >1) with an additive effect. When the PNPLA3 rs738409 was controlled for, the SOD2 was still associated with the degree of histological steatosis, and was an independent risk factor for advanced fibrosis. However, the SOD2 allele did not affect the diagnosis of NASH.\n\n    Namikawa et al performed a case-control study between 63 patients with NASH and 150 healthy controls in a Japanese population to evaluate the SOD2 C47T allele. The study found the homozygous variant genotype (TT) was significantly associated with NASH, however the T allele frequency was not. The MTP polymorphism was also investigated (described above), and the proportion of patients with NASH with both GG (MTP) and TT (SOD2) genotypes was significantly increased compared with controls.\n\n    Uncoupling protein 3 encoded by the UCP3 gene is a mitochondrial proton carrier located at 11q13, primarily expressed in skeletal muscle. The protein is a mitochondrial anion carrier and facilitates the transport of anions from the inner to outer mitochondrial membrane, thus reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential. The protein is considered to be protective against oxidative stress from beta oxidation of fatty acids. Aller et al investigated the -55C/T polymorphism of UCP3 in a cohort of 39 obese patients who underwent liver biopsy. The heterozygous genotype was found to be associated with an increase in both moderate-to-severe histological inflammation and moderate-to-severe steatosis.\n\n    The catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC) is involved in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). GSH is a tripeptide that counteracts cellular oxidative stress from reactive metabolites through thiol group reduction. Oliveira et al evaluated the -129C/T GCLC polymorphism in a cohort of 139 Brazilian patients with NAFLD, 45 with SS and 86 with NASH. The investigators observed a significant association between the T allele of GCLC with patients with NASH when compared with the SS group.\n\n    A key histological component that differentiates SS from more severe disease is the inflammatory response. Polymorphisms of genes encoding components of the immune response, including proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), the interleukin (IL) family of molecules and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), have been investigated for potential associations with NAFLD and disease progression. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pathogen recognition molecule, and the CD14 molecule expressed by macrophages are lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell surface antigens involved in the immune response.\n\n    Valenti et al investigated two TNF polymorphisms (TNFA 238 and TNF2 308) in 99 patients with NAFLD (53 biopsied) and compared with 172 healthy controls. The allele frequency and genotype of TNF2 was not different between NAFLD and controls; however, both the TNFA variant allele and genotype were significantly increased in NAFLD. In the biopsied subgroup, 35 patients had NASH whereas 18 had SS. A trend towards a higher prevalence of TNF polymorphisms in NASH subgroup was observed when compared with those with SS, but this did not reach statistical significance, which may be due to the small sample size. Yang et al investigated these two TNF variants in obese children; histologically, 61 were normal and used as control, 17 had SS and 33 had NASH. No significant difference was observed.\n\n    Hu et al also investigated the same variants, comparing a cohort of 189 Chinese patients with NAFLD, 44 diagnosed histologically, to 138 healthy controls. Neither variant was homozygous in either the patient or control groups. The heterozygous genotype and A allele frequency of the TNFA variant was found to be significantly associated with NAFLD compared with control, with relative risk 2.19. No histological associations were observed in the biopsied subgroup, although the sample size for comparison was small.\n\n    Chowdhury et al evaluated the effect of the -308 and -238 TNF variants on fibrosis in NAFLD, investigating 29 Indian patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. The variants were not found to be associated with fibrosis severity; however, DNA amplification only worked in 25 cases, reducing the sample size.\n\n    Aller et al investigated the -308TNF polymorphism on histological characteristics in 66 patients with NAFLD and 213 obese controls. Variant frequency was not significantly different between patients and controls, although within the patient group those carrying the heterozygous variant (n=15) had significantly more severe inflammation and fibrosis than those with wild type genotype; however, the sample size is small.\n\n    Tokushige et al investigated six TNF polymorphisms in a Japanese population of 102 patients with NAFLD and 100 controls, and found no significant differences between the NAFLD and control groups. Of the patients with NAFLD, 36 had SS and 66 had NASH: the -1031C and -863A variants were significantly more frequent in the NASH group compared with SS, but there were no associations with histological features.\n\n    Wong et al investigated the role of three variants of TNF in a Chinese population. A cohort of 79 patients with NAFLD, comprising 61 individuals with SS and 18 patients diagnosed with NASH, was compared with 40 healthy population controls. The results showed no significant differences in the frequency of the three TNF polymorphisms investigated.\n\n    The study by Carulli et al described above also evaluated the IL-6-174 G/C SNP, comparing 114 patients with NAFLD against 79 controls. Of the NAFLD group, 59 patients underwent liver biopsy; 29 had NASH, 30 had NAFLD. The case-control study showed that IL-6 GC and CC genotypes were significantly more prevalent in the NAFLD group, and furthermore, multivariate logistic regression showed the association of GC and CC genotype with NAFLD was independent of age, gender and BMI (OR 4.116, CI 1.126 to 15.048). Histological features were compared between biopsied patients with NASH and NAFLD. The IL-6 CC and CG variants were associated with NASH (OR 7.035, CI 1.167 to 42.394), but not histological characteristics.\n\n    Petta et al investigated the rs12979860 and rs8099917 variants of IFNL3, also known as IL28B, on histological features in 160 Sicilian patients with NAFLD. The study found the wild type (CC) genotype of rs12979860 was independently linked to moderate-severe lobular inflammation, remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. The rs12979860 wild type was also associated with severe fibrosis by univariate analysis, but not after Bonferroni correction, and multivariate logistic regression was not significant. The rs8099917 was not reported to show any significance.\n\n    Nozaki et al investigated the association between -511T/C variant of IL1B and B3 adrenergic receptor 190T/A polymorphism on a cohort of 63 Japanese patients with NASH. Case-control study showed that the IL-1T allele and TT genotype were significantly more frequent in the NASH group compared with 100 healthy controls. The B3ADRC mutant allele was also found to have a higher prevalence in the NASH group.\n\n    Akyildiz et al investigated the association of the -173 G/C MIF variant with NAFLD and severity. Ninety-one patients with NAFLD stratified as 37 with NASH, 44 probable NASH and 10 SS were compared with 104 healthy controls. MIF variant genotype and allele were not significantly different between NAFLD cases and control, or within the NAFLD groups.\n\n    In a brief communication, Brun et al describe the effect of polymorphisms in genes encoding the TLR4 and CD14 LPS receptors on 28 patients with NAFLD, including 21 with NASH, who were compared with 52 healthy controls. No significant association was seen with TLR4; however, the CD14 homozygous mutant genotype was not present in the seven patients with NAFLD without NASH, and was significantly increased in patients with NASH than controls.\n\n    Adiponectin, encoded by ADIPOQ, and leptin are hormones secreted by adipocytes. Adiponectin is involved in the regulation of energy homoeostasis and metabolism, particularly through enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Reduced plasma levels of adiponectin have been associated with features of the metabolic syndrome including NAFLD. Leptin acts through its receptor, encoded by LEPR, to stimulate satiety and reduce food intake, and also increase energy expenditure. Studies have investigated polymorphisms in ADIPOQ and LEPR for association with NAFLD.\n\n    Wong et al studied four SNPs in the adiponectin gene, comparing a cohort of 79 Chinese patients with NAFLD with 40 population controls. Within the NAFLD group, 61 patients had SS and 18 were diagnosed with NASH. The results showed no significant difference in any of the four ADIPOQ polymorphisms studied between the NAFLD and control groups, or histological severity within the NAFLD group.\n\n    Tokushige et al investigated adiponectin polymorphisms +45 and +276 in a Japanese population. A cohort of 119 patients with NAFLD was compared with 115 healthy population controls. There were no significant differences in the frequency of either SNP between the NAFLD and control groups, or between the patients with NASH and SS. However, the +45G allele frequency and homozygous variant genotype (GG) were significantly associated with histologically severe fibrosis. Further statistical analysis demonstrated that +45GG was an independent factor of severe fibrosis.\n\n    Gupta et al studied two functional polymorphisms of the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene: +45T/G and -11 377G/C on an Indian population. A cohort of 137 patients with NAFLD, including 113 who underwent liver biopsy, was compared with 250 controls. The case-control study showed both homozygous variants to be significantly more prevalent in the NAFLD cohort, with OR 6.7 (CI 1.5 to 28.6) and OR 5.1 (CI 0.6 to 14) for the -11 377 (CC) and +45(GG) genotypes, respectively. When the biopsied subgroup was considered, patients carrying the -11 377 variant allele correlated with necroinflammatory grade were compared with wild type patients.\n\n    Zain et al investigated the rs1137100 and rs1137101 polymorphisms of the leptin receptor on a multiethnic Malaysian cohort. Results indicated that both polymorphisms were significantly associated with NAFLD, but were not specific to any of the ethnic groups studied. Of the NAFLD cohort, 33 patients had SS and 111 had NASH. Histologically, the rs1137100 GG genotype was observed to be associated with a decreased fibrosis score, and the G allele was protective against fibrosis. The interaction between the PNPLA3 and leptin receptor polymorphisms was also investigated using a two-locus model, and a significant effect was noted. Aller 2012 investigated the lys656Asn variant of LEPR on 76 obese participants with biopsy-proven NAFLD. There were no significant differences in histological features between genotypes.\n\n    Swellam and Hamdy investigated the leptin receptor SNP rs6700896 in an obese Egyptian cohort of 90 patients with NAFLD and compared with 30 lean, healthy controls. Of the patients with NAFLD, 30 were described as having mild steatosis and 60 had moderate-to-severe steatosis. The mutant allele was not present in the control group, and the mutant genotype was found to be associated with moderate-to-severe steatosis in patients with NAFLD, when compared with those with mild steatosis.\n\n    The STAT3 gene, encoding signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), is a transcription factor that when activated by growth factors and cytokines, mediates expression of genes involved in a number of different pathways, including cell growth, metabolism, apoptosis and possibly energy homoeostasis(8, 53).\n\n    Sookoian et al investigated three polymorphisms in the STAT3 gene in an Argentinian population: rs2293152, rs6503695 and rs9891119. A cohort of 108 patients with NAFLD, of whom 68 underwent liver biopsy, was compared with 55 healthy controls. In the case-control study, univariate analysis after multiple comparison corrected by permutation tests found significant associations of allelic frequencies of both the rs6503695 and rs9891119 variants with NAFLD. The NAFLD group was histologically divided into fatty liver (not biopsied), fatty liver (biopsied) and definite NASH groups and Spearman rank testing was performed. A significant association was observed with the rs9891119 A allele with increased histological severity, which persisted after BMI was controlled for (AA>AC>CC). However, this result should be interpreted with caution because, although the non-biopsied patients had normal liver function tests (LFTs), histological analysis was not performed on this group. No significant association was observed between STAT3 variants and inflammation or fibrosis.\n\n    The CLOCK gene encodes a transcription factor involved in regulation of circadian rhythm and metabolism, and variants in CLOCK are thought to influence both behaviour and obesity. Sookoian et al studied six variants of the CLOCK candidate gene in an Argentinian population. A cohort of 136 patients with NAFLD was compared with 64 controls; 91 patients were biopsied and 56 were diagnosed with NASH. Univariate analysis showed that both rs11932595 and rs6843722 SNPs were significantly associated with NAFLD compared with control. CLOCK variant combinations were analysed using multimarker analysis, some of which showed association, but these did not retain significance with correction for multiple testing. Further omnibus analysis including the six SNPs did show significant results between NAFLD and control, but no individual markers contributed significantly to this. When histology was considered, the rs1554483, rs6843722 and rs6850524 were all significantly associated with disease severity, as were (rs11932595/rs6850524 GC) and (rs4580704/rs6843722 CA) haplotypes, although this should be interpreted with caution because again the entire NAFLD cohort did not undergo biopsy. Within the NASH subgroup, a significant association with overall fibrosis score was observed with rs1554483, rs6843722 and rs4864548.\n\n    The enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyses 5'10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reduction, producing 5' methyltetrahydrofolate, which is further involved in the formation of methionine from homocysteine. Methionine is an important methyl donor utilised during the epigenetic process of DNA methylation, and mutations in MTHFR have been associated with a number of disease processes.\n\n    Serin et al evaluated the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in 53 Turkish patients with NAFLD, with 23 patients with NASH, defined by a NAS of >=5. The distribution of the polymorphism was found not to be significant between controls (n=282) and NAFLD, or between NAFLD and NASH. Sazci et al also investigated the relationship between polymorphisms of MTHFR and NASH in a Turkish population. The two SNPs investigated:C677T and A1928C:were compared between 57 patients with histological NASH, with 324 healthy population controls. Results indicated A1298C was significantly associated with NASH, with the wild type AA being protective against NASH, but there was no significant association between NASH and 677T. The study also looked at compound genotypes and observed that the CC/AC in men and CC/CC genotypes in women were associated with NASH.\n\n    Assy et al evaluated thrombotic risk factors, including prothrombin, factor V Leiden and MTHFR mutations. Comparisons were made between 15 patients with fatty liver, 15 with NASH and 15 with chronic viral hepatitis. No significant differences were observed; however, only one variant allele was found within the groups studied.\n\n    The Kruppel-like factor 6 encoded by KLF6 on chromosome 10 is a zinc finger transcription factor which functions as a tumour suppressor, and polymorphisms have been implicated in various cancer types. Miele et al investigated the Kruppel-like factor 6 rs37508611 IVSI-27 G>A polymorphism on two cohorts of 306 UK and 109 Italian patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. In the combined and UK cohorts, a significant reduction in fibrosis score was seen in heterozygous patients compared with homozygous wild type, but results did not reach statistical significance in the Italian cohort, possibly due to the reduced sample size. Logistic regression analysis showed the wild type genotype was a significant independent risk fact for the presence of fibrosis, with (OR 2.76, CI 1.295 to 5.908). This study also investigated inheritance patterns in 71 Italian family trios, which indicated a preferential transmission of the wild type allele.\n\n    The HFE gene on chromosome 6 encodes a membrane protein that is hypothesised to regulate iron absorption through the interaction of transferrin with its receptor; homozygotes for mutations (C282Y or H63D) in this gene develop hereditary haemochromatosis.\n\n    Valenti et al evaluated polymorphisms in HFE in an Italian population comprising 134 patients with NAFLD and 291 healthy controls. Within the NAFLD cohort, 67 underwent biopsy, and NASH was found in 42 patients, whereas 25 had SS. The case-control analysis showed that C282Y (but not H63D) was significantly more prevalent in patients with NAFLD compared with controls. There were no significant differences in frequency of either polymorphism between patients with and without NASH, although only a percentage of the patients with NAFLD were histologically assessed. The same group studied the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations in a larger Italian population. The study compared a cohort of 587 histologically diagnosed patients with NAFLD to 184 healthy controls. The study found the frequency of variant alleles was not significant. It was noted that hepatocellular iron deposition was an independent risk factor for moderate-to-severe fibrosis, but no significant association was found between HFE genotype and severity of fibrosis.\n\n    Deguti et al evaluated 32 Brazilian patients with histological NASH and found no evidence of association between either C282Y or H63D variant, HFE mutations with histological injury and did not observe significant iron deposition. Zamin et al also studied the effects of these HFE variants on histological features. A cohort of 29 Brazilian patients with NASH was compared with 20 healthy controls and 20 patients with hepatitis C. The study found the prevalence of the mutation was similar between groups, with no significant association between mutation and fibrosis score or other histological characteristics. An association between liver iron overload and mutation was noted, but this did not correlate with fibrosis score.\n\n    Raszeja-Wyszomirska et al studied the effects of C282Y and H63D HFE mutations on a Polish cohort of 62 biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD. The authors scored patients on fibrosis as described and compared those with no or mild fibrosis (score 0-2, n=48) against those with advanced fibrosis (score 3-4, n=14). It was observed that in cases with severe fibrosis, the variant H63D allele was associated with increased serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, but no other associations between histological disease severities were apparent.\n\n    Nelson et al characterised the C282Y and H63D HFE SNPs in 786 participants in the NASH CRN cohort. The relationship between genotype and histological features, including steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, fibrosis stage and NAS, was evaluated. It was found that participants with the C282Y mutant allele were more likely to have increased iron deposition and hepatocellular pattern, but H63D was not associated with increased hepatic iron accumulation. Both HFE SNPs were shown to be associated with an increased steatosis grade when compared with wild type, and H63D allele was also associated with an increase in NAS. A significant reduction in hepatocyte ballooning and definitive NASH associated with the C282Y SNP was also observed; however, there was no association between HFE SNPs and fibrosis stage. The authors concluded that the H63D allele was an independent risk factor for the highest grade steatosis, lobular inflammation and NAS >=5, and definitive diagnosis of NASH.\n\n    The TMPRSS6 gene encodes transmembrane protease, serine 6, a cell surface enzyme involved in liver matrix remodelling. The encode enzyme also cleaves a co-receptor necessary for the transcription of hepcidin; therefore, mutations in this gene can affect cellular iron status.\n\n    Valenti et al compared the frequency of the TMPRSS6 AV736 polymorphism in a cohort of 216 Italian patients against a 271 population control. The V/V genotype was observed to be associated with reduced hepatic iron and less severe hepatocyte ballooning, but other histological characteristics of NASH were similar. The study concluded that TMPRSS6 is not a risk factor for the development of NAFLD.\n\n    Angiotensin II acts through two receptors to mediate a number of biological effects including vasoconstriction. The angiotensin II receptor 1, encode by AGTR1 on chromosome 3, is a receptor expressed in the liver by stellate cells that initiates a response to tissue injury.  Receptor activation is thought to promote profibrogenic cytokines including transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) which may also have a role in lipid accumulation, and SERPINE1 inhibits enzymes involved in fibrinolysis. Variants in these genes have been investigated as potential risk factors for NAFLD susceptibility.\n\n    Yoneda et al performed a case-control study of 167 patients with NAFLD (61 with SS and 106 with NASH) and 435 healthy controls to investigate 12 SNPs of AGTR1. It was found that five SNPs were significantly associated with NAFLD when compared with the control group, with rs3772622 having the strongest association. When the SS and NASH groups were compared, the rs3772622 polymorphism was also found to be associated with an increased fibrosis index, with an additive effect.\n\n    Zain et al investigated polymorphisms of AGTR1 in a mixed ethnicity Malaysian cohort of 144 patients with NAFLD compared with 198 healthy population controls. A protective effect against NAFLD was observed in the Indian ethnic subgroup compared with controls, but no other significant differences were noted. There were also no significant associations when patients with NASH were compared with those with SS; however, the GG genotype of rs772622 was shown to be associated with increased severity of histological fibrosis. The interaction between the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant and AGTR1 was also analysed; an association with NAFLD susceptibility was observed between the PNPLA3 variant with both the rs772627 and rs3772630 polymorphisms.\n\n    Dixon et al analysed liver biopsy samples from 105 obese Australian patients and evaluated TGFB1 and AT polymorphisms, using reported population data as controls. Of the patients, 103 were diagnosed as having steatosis, and 36 of these also had NASH. The study found no significant association between the polymorphisms investigated separately and presence of fibrosis; however, a combination of the two homozygous mutant genotypes was found to be an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis.\n\n    Espino et al compared the 4G/5G variant of SERPINE1 (PAI-1) in 50 obese Chilean patients undergoing bariatric surgery and 71 controls. Within the obese patient group, 21 were histologically normal, 9 had steatosis and 20 met criteria for NASH. No differences in variant frequency were observed between patients and controls, or those with and without NASH-related fibrosis.\n\n    The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor involved in glucose homoeostasis. The protein encoded by ENPP1 on chromosome 6 is a cell membrane protein that may be involved in insulin sensitivity and IRS-1 encodes a substrate involved in the insulin receptor pathway.\n\n    Dongiovanni et al evaluated the effect of polymorphisms ENPP1 rs1044498 and IRS-1 rs1801278 in a European cohort. A case-control study of 240 Italian patients with NAFLD and healthy population controls showed no significance. Histological features were assessed on a cohort of 702 Italian patients; both polymorphisms were associated with increased fibrosis and the rs1044498 variant allele of ENPP1 was associated with fibrosis severity.\n\n    GCKR encodes glucokinase regulator, a protein that modulates the activity of the enzyme glucokinase in liver cells by reversibly binding to form an inactive complex. Tan et al investigated the GCKR rs780094 (C>T) and rs1260326 (C>T) SNPs on a mixed ethnicity Malaysian cohort of 144 patients with NAFLD and 198 controls. The variant T allele frequencies of each SNP was found to be more prevalent in patients with both NAFLD and NASH when compared with controls; however, when the ethnic subgroups were considered, the relationship was only significant in the Indian population, not those of Chinese or Malay ethnicity. Owing to the mixed ethnicity of this cohort, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\n    Transcription factor 7-like 2 is a transcription factor expressed in T cells containing a high mobility group box that is thought to be involved in glucose homoeostasis. Musso et al investigated the rs7903146 variant of the TCF7L2 gene on an Italian population. A total of 78 patients with NAFLD, 34 of whom were biopsied and diagnosed with NASH, were compared with 156 healthy population controls. It was found that the wild type genotype was less frequent in patients with NAFLD compared with controls. The study reports that severe hepatic steatosis was predicted by TCF (OR 2.2, CI 1.7 to 4.9) and grade 3 fibrosis was predicted by TCF (OR 2.0, CI 1.7 to 4.3); however, the analysis of histological characteristics is limited due to small sample size and because all patients had NASH.\n\n    The cannabinoid receptors are G protein coupled receptors expressed in the brain that mediate the neurological effects of cannabinoid substances through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase when activated. The NCAN gene on chromosome 19 encodes the core protein of neurocan, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan component of the extracellular matrix, primarily expressed in the nervous system and considered to be involved in cell adhesion and migration.\n\n    Aller et al evaluated the influence of the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene rs1049353 variant on histological features of NAFLD on a cohort of 70 Spanish patients. The study found that significantly fewer patients with the variant A allele had histological grade of 4 or more, when compared with homozygous wild type patients, but fibrosis was not significantly different.\n\n    Rossi et al investigated the effect of the Q63R variant of cannabinoid receptor 2 on histological severity of NAFLD in a cohort of 118 paediatric Italian patients. The variant was found to be strongly associated with degree of inflammation, but not with other histological characteristics of steatosis, fibrosis or ballooning. However, the relationship with inflammation was not significant after adjusting for the PNPLA3 variant, which had previously been shown to be significant in this cohort.\n\n    Gorden et al studied a cohort of 1092 US patients undergoing bariatric surgery, as described above. The variant in NCAN was significantly associated with increased histological features of steatosis, lobular inflammation and perivenular fibrosis, and trended towards increased ballooning. However, it is unclear whether these associations are independent of the association with the PNPLA3 rs738409 shown to be significantly associated with steatosis and ballooning in the same study.\n\n    TM6SF2 encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown function; the rs58542926 SNP in TM6SF2 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the rs2228603 NCAN variant discussed above, and associations attributed to NCAN may relate instead to this variant.\n\n    Liu et al studied the effect of the rs58542926 variant of TM6SF2 on two cohorts with histologically characterised NAFLD. Quantitative analysis was performed within a discovery cohort of 349 UK patients with NAFLD, and results were validated using a cohort of 725 European Caucasian patients. Within the NAFLD discovery cohort, minor allele was significantly more frequent than the reference population, OR 1.72 (CI 1.16 to 2.57) and OR 4.84 (CI 1.01 to 22.9) for heterozygous and homozygous variants, respectively, when compared with healthy control group (n=379).\n\n    Histological characteristics were further investigated: degree of steatosis was not significantly associated with either rs2228603 in NCAN or rs58542926 in TM6SF2, in either cohort, although a trend was observed when the cohorts were combined. The authors suggest a possible relationship with a small effect size, which was supported by an association which was noted when the combined group was categorised into mild or pronounced steatosis. Severity of steatohepatits, assessed by characteristics of necroinflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, was associated with the TM6SF2 variant within the discovery cohort, but was not replicated in the validation or combined cohorts.\n\n    Importantly, the variants of NCAN and TM6SF2 were both significantly associated with the stage of histological fibrosis. On further investigation, conditioning the results on TM6SF2 negated the effect of the NCAN variant, indicating TM6SF2 was responsible for the association relationship. This relationship was replicated in the validation and combined cohorts, and was independent of confounding factors including age, gender, BMI, presence of diabetes and PNPLA3 phenotype. When mild fibrosis was compared with advanced fibrosis in the combined cohort, each minor allele was associated with OR 1.88 (CI 1.41 to 2.50). The study also compared 99 UK patients with NAFLD-related HCC to the combined cohort. Although the homozygous variant of TM6SF2 was found associated with an increased risk of HCC in univariate analysis, this did not persist in multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding factors.\n\n    Since this study, two other studies have investigated the role of this polymorphism on histologically proven NAFLD: Dongiovanni et al studied a large, combined cohort of adult and paediatric European patients undergoing liver biopsy for hepatology or bariatric purposes. Of these, 112 patients had no fatty liver disease and served as the control group, 412 had SS and 677 fulfilled histological NASH diagnosis. The results showed the variant to be associated with severity of all histological characteristics (steatosis, necroinflammation, ballooning and fibrosis stage), and this persisted after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, diabetes, recruitment and PNPLA3 genotype. The variant was associated with NASH compared with SS (OR 1.84, CI 1.23 to 2.79) and stage 3-4 fibrosis (OR 2.08, CI 1.20 to 3.55), although association with fibrosis did not remain after adjustment for NASH.\n\n    Sookoian et al performed a case-control study investigating the role of on TM6SF2 in an Argentinian population of 226 patients with histological NAFLD. In comparison to a control group of 135 individuals with no ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver, the rs58542926 variant was found to be significantly associated with fatty liver (OR 1.37, CI 1.02 to 1.84); however, this relationship did not persist after adjusting for age, BMI and rs738409 in PNPLA3. The NAFLD group was subdivided into 96 patients with SS and 130 with NASH; the T allele was found to be associated with disease progression when the control group was included in the analysis; however, this was not significant when the SS group was compared with NASH. Within the patients with NAFLD, degree of steatosis was found to be significantly associated with this variant, independently of PNPLA3 genotype, age, sex and BMI. In contrast, no associations were observed with other histological characteristics of lobular inflammation, ballooning or fibrosis stage (F1-2 vs F3-4), and there was no association with increased NAS (defined as >5).\n\n    The SPINK 1 gene encodes serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1. This enzyme inhibits trypsin, and is a component of pancreatic juice, secreted by pancreatic acinar cells; mutations result in familial calcific pancreatitis. Oruc et al evaluated the SPINK1 N34S P555 polymorphism in 50 Turkish patients with NAFLD and 44 controls. Of the NAFLD group, 30 patients had SS and 20 had NASH. No significant association was found between the SPINK1 variant with NAFLD or histological NASH.\n\n    Both the ABCB11 and NR1H4 genes encode proteins involved in bile processing: ATP binding cassette transporter encoded by ABCB11 is a membrane-bound transport protein that exports of bile salts into canaliculi, whereas NR1H4 encodes a nuclear receptor activated by bile acids that regulates their synthesis and transport. Iwata et al evaluated the ABCB11 1331C allele and NRIH4 variants, comparing UK patients:358 with NAFLD, 206 with chronic hepatitis C and 110 controls undergoing biopsy for metastatic disease. There was no association found with NAFLD or fibrosis for either gene.\n\n    CYP2E1 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds, and NR1I2 encodes the pregnane X receptor, a transcriptional regulator of CYP3A4.\n\n    Varela et al studied cytochrome P450 2E1 variants on 48 obese Chilean women undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients were biopsied and assessed: 15 were diagnosed with NASH, 17 had SS and 13 were histologically normal. The CYP4502E1 polymorphisms Dra1 and Ras1/Pst1 were investigated and it was found that the heterozygous and homozygous variant genotypes of Dra1 increased the risk of both NASH and steatosis when compared with control. The Rsa/Pst variant genotypes also increased the risk of NASH compared with control, although it should be noted that the sample sizes utilised in this study were small.\n\n    Sookoian et al explored eight SNPs associated with NR1I2; only rs7643645 was significantly associated with NAFLD compared with control, with a recessive model for the homozygous variant with OR 3.292 (CI 1.398 to 7.752). Of 188 patients with NAFLD, 113 underwent liver biopsy; 46 had SS and 67 had NASH. Participants were divided into control, fatty liver with normal LFTs, SS and NASH groups to investigate disease severity, noting associations with rs7643645 and rs2461823.\n\n    The fatty acid-binding protein 2 and fatty acid transport protein 5, encoded by FABP2 and SLC27A5, respectively, are involved in transport and processing of long chain fatty acids. Auinger et al explored the rs56225452 variant of FATP5 (SLC27A5) on a cohort of 103 male patients with NAFLD. No difference between genotypes was observed in features of steatosis, fibrosis or necroinflammatory grade, although an association was observed with steatosis degree and BMI within variant allele carriers. Aller et al evaluated the effect of ala54thr of FABP2 on 30 patients with NAFLD, but no differences between histological features were observed.\n\n    GWASs aim to identify genetic susceptibility components that might predispose individuals to developing NAFLD and NASH. A total of five reports of GWASs have been performed on the NASH CRN and Japanese populations.\n\n    Chalasani et al performed a GWAS analysing 324 623 SNPs on 236 female patients in the US NASH CRN cohort, diagnosed using the NASH CRN scoring system. Results showed that FDFT1 variant rs2645424 was associated with NAS, fibrosis was associated with rs343062 on chromosome 7, and lobular inflammation was associated with SNPs in LTBP3, EFCAB4B and COLI3A1.\n\n    Speliotes et al performed primary GWAS testing on a large cohort of patients with CT assessed NAFLD, from which 46 SNPs were selected for further analysis in patients with histologically determined NAFLD. A total of 592 patients within the NASH CRN cohort were compared with 1405 US and European healthy patients enrolled in the MIGen study. The rs738409 in PNPLA3 and rs2228603 in NCAN were found to be significantly associated with histological NAFLD, with ORs of 3.26 and 1.65, respectively. The rs4240624 in PPP1R3B was not associated with histological NAFLD; however, rs780094 in GCKR (OR 1.45) and rs12137855 near LYPLAL1 (OR 1.37) were also significantly associated with NAFLD. The MIGen cohort was used to control for cardiovascular disease status. Therefore, to ensure that the use of this control group was not influential, the five variants (PNPLA3, NCAN, GCKR, LYLPAL1 and PPP1R3B) were compared between the NASH CRN cohort and 3212 healthy participants within the Illuminata Control Database (iCONT). The results of this were comparable to those from the NASH CRN/MIGen comparison.\n\n    Kawaguchi et al performed a GWAS of 484751 SNPs plus PNPLA3 rs738409 on a Japanese population. Initially, 529 patients with NAFLD were compared with 942 healthy controls, and significance was observed for six markers in PNPLA3 including rs738409, which demonstrated the strongest association. The NAFLD group was further divided into four subgroups based on histological class, and genotype distributions were analysed in a pairwise manner. Matteoni class 4 was found to be significantly different from the other three subgroups, and associated with the rs738409 variant. Histological characteristics of Brunt grade and stage, fat deposition, iron deposition were associated with the variant G allele; however, of these only iron deposition remained significant after Bonferroni correction and adjustment for Matteoni type. The authors propose that NASH (assessed as Matteoni type 4) is a clinically and genetically different condition. Of the other polymorphisms investigated, no association was seen with variants in LYPLAL1 or NCAN genes, but rs780094 in GCKR showed borderline association.\n\n    Kitamoto et al performed a pilot GWAS on 392 Japanese patients with NAFLD (345 NASH, 47 SS). Initially, 261 540 genes were analysed and compared with a group of 934 healthy controls. Subsequently, 56 SNPs were further analysed in a replication study, comprised of 172 patients with NAFLD (97 NASH, 4 SS, 71 not biopsied) and 1012 healthy controls. Following the replication study, 12 SNPs remained significantly associated following the replication study, and of these, 8 retained significance after conservative Bonferroni correction. These 8 SNPs were all variants close to PNPLA3 on chromosome 22, and did not retain significance after rs738409 was accounted for, and haplotype analysis suggested that PNPLA3 was significantly associated with NAFLD pathogenesis. When histological characteristics were assessed, six polymorphisms were associated with histological fibrosis, and nine were associated with lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and NAS, but these were not significant after correction for multiple testing. When NASH patients were compared with those with SS, the rs5764455 variant in PARVB was associated with NASH (OR 2.79).\n\n    Vazquez-Chantada et al extracted DNA from liver biopsy samples and tested 92 genes for association with NAFLD in a Spanish pilot study of 69 patients with NAFLD and 217 controls. In total, 1536 SNPs were selected for further analysis and 11 SNPs were found to be associated with NAFLD, 7 of these in the SLC2A1 gene and 1 close to SLC2A1, and variants in CYP2E1, MTR and STK11. A validation study was then performed on a cohort of 451 European patients with NAFLD and 303 controls, and confirmed that rs4658 and rs841856 in SLC2A1 were significantly more frequent in the NAFLD group, however no association was seen in the other variants. The study found no significant association with clinical characteristics of NAFLD.",
        "Conclusion": "    Variants in many genes have been investigated for association with NAFLD and with histological characteristics and progression to NASH. Of the genes studied, many could have plausible mechanistic roles in NAFLD and NASH pathogenicity, for example, in profibrogenic and inflammatory pathways, regulation of energy, metabolism and lipid processing. Other genes investigated are those that have potential roles in obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemias.\n\n    Only six genes described in this review have been replicated in more than one histologically characterised cohort: PNPLA3, APOE, SOD2, TNF, TM6SF2 and GCKR (highlighted in table 1). The main, consistent finding of the candidate gene studies is the association of PNPLA3 rs738409 variant with NAFLD susceptibility. Results regarding the association of this polymorphism with histological characteristics and disease severity are inconsistent.\n\n    Differences may be due to patient characteristics including environment or ancestry, with findings and the strength of associations differing between populations. Even within a biopsy proven cohort, there are further confounding factors of age, sex, BMI, comorbidities including diabetes, diet, exercise and medication to consider. Methodological factors including the size of patient cohorts and control population(s), the method and criteria used for histological assessment, which are not necessarily comparable, and statistical handling of data may also account for discrepancies.\n\n    Liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that can involve complications of infection, haemorrhage and an approximate 1/10 000 mortality. Therefore, larger cohorts of biopsied patients, such as the NASH CRN, Malaysian cohort and the Italian and UK groups have been used in multiple investigations, which needs to be borne in mind when considering effects of marginal significance.\n\n    Various study designs were used to address differing putative gene effects, studies comparing patient cohorts to healthy control groups were used to assess for genetic association with disease. Severity of histological characteristics were compared within patient cohorts, and some studies used control groups with other causes of hepatic fibrosis, such as alcoholic liver disease or hepatitis C to determine whether genetic factors influencing fibrosis were specific to NASH or related to common pathways of fibrosis. It may be that there are multiple genetic factors that come into play, with separate groups of genes influencing NAFLD susceptibility, and different molecular pathways involved steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis of disease progression.\n\n    In this review, methods for reporting results were restricted to individual genes; however, a novel method of reporting using PID pathways was utilised by Chen et al (not included in review), which may be useful to identify the molecular pathways involved in the development of NAFLD and progression to NASH. Similarly, as whole genome scanning becomes more time and cost efficient, it is likely that more studies will utilise this technique for investigating genetic factors of a disease.\n\n    This review has aimed to independently and systematically summarise the candidate gene studies relating to NAFLD and NASH. Fatty liver is a complex disease, with a spectrum of severity encompassing clinical features of steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Only a subgroup of patients with SS progresses to develop NASH and hepatic fibrosis. It is possible that there are multiple genetic components influencing susceptibility through distinct pathways, and that the interaction of these may cause disease progression.",

        "Title": "    The Leptin Gene Family and Colorectal Cancer: Interaction with Smoking Behavior and Family History of Cancer",
        "Abstract": "    Pathologic condition associated with metabolic syndrome traits seems to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. One mechanism underlying this relationship may involve the growth-promoting effects of the circulation hormones associated with obesity and insulin resistance, such as leptin.\n\n    A two-stage case-control study was used to explore the role of polymorphisms of Leptin (LEP) and Leptin receptor (LEPR), either alone or in combination with environmental factors in colorectal carcinogenesis. In stage 1, 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that tag common SNPs in these two genes were genotyped among 470 cases and 458 controls. In stage 2, another population with 314 cases and 355 controls were genotyped for the two most promising SNPs from stage 1. LEPR rs12037879 only presented modestly increased colorectal cancer risk, with odds ratios of 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.76) and 1.74 (95%CI 1.08-2.81) for GA and AA genotype when compared with GG genotype in combined population. Smokers carrying LEPR rs12037879 A allele presented 1.67-fold (95%CI 1.39-fold to 2.01-fold) increased colorectal cancer risk when compared with non-smokers carrying GG genotype in combined analysis. Individuals with family history of cancer harboring LEPR rs12037879 A allele showed 1.52-fold (95%CI: 1.24-fold to 1.86-fold) increased colorectal cancer risk, compared with individuals without family history of cancer harboring GG genotype. Multifactor gene-environment interaction analysis revealed significant interactions among LEPR rs12037879, LEPR rs6690625, smoking status and family history of cancer, exhibiting a gradient of increased colorectal cancer risk along with the increasing number of risk factors (P = 9.82x10-10).\n\n    Our research supports that polymorphisms in LEPR may be associated with marginal increase in the risk for colorectal cancer. Moreover, this association could be strengthened by cigarette smoking and family history of cancer.",
        "Introduction": "    Leptin, secreted primarily by adipocytes, is well-known to be crucial in energy balance, regulation of food uptake and nutrient absorption. In normal conditions, elevated leptin level could suppress food intake and promote the consumption of body fat by a negative feedback regulatory loop controlled by sympathetic nervous system. However, obese humans are resistant to the effects of endogenous leptin by a limitation of the blood-brain-barrier transport system for leptin and an inhibition of the leptin signaling pathway in leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons. Serum leptin level was viewed as a reflector of the amount of energy stored in the adipose tissues and in proportion to body fat mass, consequently, increased in the obese and decreased with weight reduction. Consistently, lines of epidemiologic studies have demonstrated the connection between leptin and human obesity.\n\n    Colorectal cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 1, 330, 000 new cases and 608, 000 cancer deaths in 2008 worldwide. As complex disease, colorectal cancer has been long prevalent in western countries. During the past two decades, the incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer have grown rapidly in developing countries, including China. Epidemiologic studies found that the incidence of colorectal cancer increased along with the rising of metabolic syndrome components, such as obesity. Compared with normal weight, overweight or obesity presented 1.19-fold increased colorectal cancer risk. Although, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, previous evidence has suggested the involvement of abdominal visceral adipose tissue in the development of colorectal adenoma, the precursor of colorectal cancer. Further evidence suggested that adipocytes and preadipocytes could exert growth stimulation role in colon cancer cells, and active substances produced by adipocytes could act as carcinogen in the colon and rectum.\n\n    Given the role of leptin in obesity development and the association between obesity and colorectal cancer risk, Leptin (LEP) was hypothesized as a contributor to colorectal cancer. The biological role of leptin was mediated through binding of specific cell surface receptors coupled to activation of PI3 kinase and Jak/Stat signaling, which exerts a critical role in the regulation of various cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. The leptin receptor was expressed in human colon cancer cell lines and human colonic tissue. Stimulation with leptin led to phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase and increased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Significant decrease of tumor cell proliferation was observed in leptin-deficient tumors, and colon tumor growth was dramatically inhibited in leptin-deficient and leptin-receptor-deficient mice. Recently, epidemiologic evidence has demonstrated the positive association between serum leptin and colorectal cancer risk. A case-control study conducted in Japan showed that, female with serum leptin level in quintile 2 and 3 combined, and quintile 4 and 5 combined harbored 1.40-fold and 4.84-fold increased colorectal cancer risk when compared with the lowest quintile, respectively. Another nested case-control study conducted in Norway demonstrated that men with top quartile leptin level presented 2.28-fold increased colorectal cancer risk in comparison with three bottom quartiles. A Chinese case-control study provided consistent evidence by finding an approximately two-fold increased risk of prostate cancer in men with the highest tertile leptin level relative to the lowest tertile.\n\n    Given the potential role of Leptin gene family in carcinogenesis and the influence of genetic polymorphisms in regulation of gene expression and function, it is inferred that polymorphisms in this gene family might exert an influence on cancer susceptibility. Previous study by Ribeiro et al. found that a functional polymorphism of Leptin (LEP -2548 G/A) increased susceptibility and earlier age of onset for non-small cell lung cancer. Similarly, the tumorigenic role of LEP -2548G/A was also found in prostate cancer in American. However, to date, these have been no studies addressing the role of genetic variants in Leptin gene family as colorectal cancer susceptibility factors in Chinese population. Therefore, we performed a two-stage case-control study to systemically evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LEP and LEPR as a predictor of colorectal cancer risk in Chinese population.",
        "Methods": "    Written informed consent referred to collection of individual's demographic data including age, sex, weight and height, epidemiological information including smoking status, alcohol use, family history of cancer and physical activities, clinical data and blood left from clinical test was obtained from all final participants. This study protocol was approved by the review board of School of Public Health of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in December, 2006 [No.200603].\n\n    A two-stage case-control study design was utilized to estimate polymorphisms in LEP gene family in relation to colorectal cancer. Promising associations identified in stage I were validated in another study population. Study population in stage I and stage II came from Wuhan and Shiyan, respectively, which have been described previously. Of eligible participants, 470 cases (94.0%) and 458 controls (91.6%) in first stage, and 314 cases (87.22%) and 355 controls (98.61%) in second stage completed in-person interviews, and donated blood samples, respectively. (Table S1).\n\n    A total of 119 SNP markers with a minor allele frequency (MAF)>=0.1 of LEP and LEPR were downloaded from HapMap (http://www.hapmap.org/) using phase 1 and phase 2 Data Release 24 (Build 36.3) for the Chinese population (Chinese Han from Beijing-CHB). Tag SNPs were chosen for each gene by using Tagger in Haploview (http://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview). We used the pair-wise mode and selected a minimal set of markers, such that all alleles to be captured would be correlated at an r2>=0.8 with a marker in that set. Finally, LEP and LEPR yielded 4 and 16 tag SNPs, respectively. (Table S2).\n\n    Genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples were isolated using Blood Genomic DNA Purification kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n    The genotyping methods and quality control strategies in both stages have been described previously. Briefly, in stage I, the genotyping assay was carried out through the Sequenom MassARRAY platform (Sequenom, San diego, CA, USA). The call rates of all SNPs were more than 96.5%. In stage II, two polymorphisms were genotyped using the 5'-nuclease (Taqman) assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The call rates of both SNPs were more than 95.3%. In two stages, a total of 10% samples were genotyped in duplicate and showed 99.5% and 100% concordance, respectively.\n\n    Pearson's chi2 test was used to compare the differences in distribution of categorical variables, and either Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Student's t-test was used for continue variables, where appropriate. In this study, BMI was categorized as overweight or obese (BMI>=25 kg/m2) and non-overweight (BMI<25 kg/m2). Individuals who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes were defined as smokers, and the rest were called non-smokers. Cumulative cigarette dose (pack-years) was calculated by the following formula: pack-years = [(number of cigarettes smoked per day) x (years smoked)]/20 cigarettes. Alcohol drinkers were defined as subjects who consumed at least 100 servings of any alcoholic beverages during their lifetime. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested by a goodness-of-fit chi2 test to compare the observed genotype frequencies to the expected genotype frequencies in controls.\n\n    For the main effect of SNPs and two-way interactions, unconditional logistic regression was conducted to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The significance threshold under the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was set at P<2.5x10-3 upon consideration of 20 SNPs analyzed.\n\n    To quantify the cumulative effect of gene-environment interactions, we tailed the total number of risk factors for each individual and set subjects without risk factors as the reference group. Colorectal cancer risk for individuals with different number of risk factors was estimated by calculating ORs and 95% CIs using unconditional logistic regression after adjustment for age and sex. All statistical analyses were two sided and performed using SPSS (SPSS, Inc., ver.12.0, Chicago, III., USA).",
        "Results": "    Both of the two populations were from central China, in which, the colorectal cancer incidence ranked medially across the whole country, which might equal to the average level of 29.44/100000 in 2009 in China. The exposure rates of potential cancer risk factors including overweight, smoking and drinking were 17.44%, 28.5% and 30.8% in average, respectively. The characteristics of our population were almost consistent with general population in central China (Table S1). There were no significant differences in the distribution of age and sex. The median age was 58 and 56 years old in controls in the first and second stage, respectively, compared with 58 and 59 years old in cases, respectively. 55.5% of cases and 56.3% of controls were male in the first stage, and 59.6% of cases and 58.6% of controls were male in the second stage. Alcohol use and BMI only presented marginal and modest influence on colorectal cancer risk in combined population. There were 30.2% self-reported alcohol users in cases, compared with 24.3% in controls of combined population. 25.5% and 20.4% were self-reported overweight or obesity in cases and controls, respectively, in combined population. Smoking status and family history of cancer presented different distribution between cases and controls. 37.4% and 28.5% were self-reported smokers in cases in the first and second stage, respectively, compared with 22.3% and 18.9% in controls (P for stage 1 = 5.86x10-7, P for stage 2 = 0.003). Given the significant role of smoking in colorectal carcinogenesis, we divided smokers into 3 groups (light smokers, medium smokers and heavy smokers) according to the tertile of pack-years of controls from combined population. Compared with non-smokers, medium smokers and heavy smokers presented higher colorectal cancer risk (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.18-2.42 for medium smokers, and OR = 2.96, 95%CI = 2.13-4.12 for heavy smokers, respectively). In addition, more cases possessed family history of cancer in both stages (23.0% of cases vs 16.4% of controls in the first stage, P = 0.02; 13.1% of cases vs 5.4% of controls in the second stage, P = 0.001).\n\n    In the first stage, a total of 20 SNPs in LEP and LEPR were analyzed. All SNPs fit the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among controls. The distribution of genotypes of LEPR rs12037879 G/A was slightly different between cases and controls in both stages before Bonferroni correction. The frequencies of GG, GA and AA genotypes were 0.678, 0.283 and 0.039, and 0.685, 0.279 and 0.037 in controls in the first and second stage, compared with 0.604, 0.336 and 0.060, and 0.593, 0.349 and 0.058 in cases, respectively. In the first stage, the LEPR rs12037879 G/A polymorphism was associated with marginally increased colorectal cancer risk, with ORs of 1.34 (95%CI: 1.01-1.80) and 1.40 (95%CI: 1.06-1.85) for GA vs GG and GA+AA vs GG, respectively. In the validation study (Stage 2), the rs12037879 G/A polymorphism was consistently associated with modestly increased colorectal cancer risk, with ORs of 1.53 (95%CI: 1.09-2.14) and 1.57 (95%CI: 1.13-2.17) for GA vs GG and GA+AA vs GG, respectively. The increased colorectal risk was also observed in combined population with rs12037879 polymorphism no matter before or after Bonferroni correction. Individuals carrying rs12037879 GA genotype, AA genotype and A allele presented 1.41-fold (95%CI: 1.13-fold to 1.76-fold), 1.74-fold (95%CI: 1.08-fold to 2.81-fold) and 1.45-fold (95%CI: 1.18-fold to 1.79-fold) increased colorectal cancer risk compared with those carrying GG genotype, respectively (Table 1). None of other SNPs was found to play a role in colorectal cancer susceptibility whether after Bonferroni correction or not (Table S2 and S3). Given the importance of leptin gene family in the energy/body-mass mechanisms, we further detected whether rs12037879 correlated to any variation in the BMI of cases and controls respectively, to reveal the potential pathogenic mechanism of this polymorphism. However, rs12037879 showed no correlation with BMI either in cases or controls (Table S4).\n\n    Since gene-environment interactions always presented more important role in carcinogenesis than single genetic or environmental factor, we further explored potential interactions between SNPs in this gene family and environmental factors including smoking status, alcohol use, BMI and family history of cancer in colorectal cancer susceptibility. In the first stage, smokers carrying rs12037879 GA, AA genotype and A allele harbored 2.55-fold (95% CI: 1.55-fold to 4.19-fold), 5.27-fold (95% CI: 1.30-fold to 21.38-fold) and 2.93-fold (95% CI: 1.81-fold to 4.75-fold) increased colorectal cancer risk when compared with non-smokers carrying GG genotype. This interaction was also found in the second stage, during which, smokers harbored A allele showed increased colorectal cancer risk, with an OR of 1.47 (95% CI: 1.09-1.99), when compared with non-smokers harboring GG genotype. In the combined analysis, smokers carrying rs12037879 A allele presented 1.67-fold (95%CI: 1.39-fold to 2.01-fold) increased colorectal caner risk compared with non-smokers carrying GG genotype. LEPR rs12037879 also presented interaction with family history of cancer. Individuals with family history of cancer carrying A allele showed 2.49-fold (95%CI: 1.57-fold to 3.95-fold) and 1.52-fold (95%CI: 1.24-fold to 1.86-fold) increased colorectal cancer risk compared with individuals without family history of cancer carrying GG genotype in the second stage and combined population, respectively. Another LEPR polymorphism, rs6690625, although did not exert any significant main effect on cancer risk, but showed interactions with smoking status and family history of cancer in colorectal carcinogenesis (Table S2, S3 and S5). Compared with smokers carrying rs6690625 GG genotype, non-smokers carrying T allele presented decreased colorectal cancer risk, with ORs of 0.59 (95%CI: 0.42-0.81) and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.59-0.81) in the first stage and combined population, respectively. Individuals without family history of cancer carrying rs6690625 T allele also showed decreased colorectal cancer risk, with ORs of 0.61 (95%CI:0.44-0.82) and 0.74 (95%CI:0.63-0.87) in the first stage and combined population, respectively, compared with individuals with family history carrying GG genotype (Table 2). Neither LEPR rs12037879 nor rs6690625 presented significant interactions with BMI or alcohol use (Table S5).\n\n    Since LEPR rs12037879, rs6690625 presented significant two-way interactions with smoking status and family history of cancer, we further detected multifactor interactions among these factors. We summed the number of risk factors of rs12037879, rs6690625, smoking status and family history of cancer for each individual and analyzed the resulting colorectal cancer risk in combined population. For environmental factors, smoking and with family history of cancer were chosen as risk factors. The genotypes of LEPR rs12037879 and rs6690625 were categorized as binary variables according to the potential risk tendency of each SNP in colorectal carcinogenesis exhibited previously (Table 1 and Table S2), namely rs12037879 GA or AA, and rs6690625 GG were viewed as risk factors. We found a significant dosage effect association for increased colorectal cancer risk with an increasing number of risk factors (P for trend = 9.82x10-10). Compared with individuals without risk factors, individuals carrying 1, 2, 3 and 4 risk factors exhibited a gradient of increased colorectal cancer risk with adjusted ORs of 1.48 (95%CI: 1.07-2.06), 1.99 (95%CI: 1.42-2.77), 3.14 (95%CI: 2.06-4.79) and 7.60 (95%CI: 2.07-27.85), respectively (Table 3).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study systematically evaluated the association between a set of polymorphisms in the Leptin gene family and colorectal cancer risk in a two-stage case-control study. We found that LEPR rs12037879 was associated with a marginal increase in colorectal cancer risk. Moreover, LEPR rs12037879 and rs6690625 exhibited more important roles in colorectal carcinogenesis by interaction with smoking status and family history of cancer.\n\n    In the main-effect analysis, LEPR rs12037879 exhibited marginal association with increased colorectal cancer risk in combined population. This association might be biologically plausible. The LEP and its receptor gene were newly found to play a role in carcinogenesis especially in obesity-associated malignancies. Leptin gene family existed roles in stimulation of DNA synthesis, enhancement of cell proliferation and survival promotion by regulating JAK-STAT, ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. All the roles were helpful for the initiation of malignancy. The gene family also induced angiogenesis by upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor and promoted cell migration by the secretion of metalloproteinase. Both functions mentioned above were crucial for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Besides support from biologically functional evidence, elevated leptin concentration has been proven to promote the proliferation of colorectal epithelial cell by interacted with its receptor, whereas, LEPR-deficient mice presented increased susceptibility to azoxymethane-induced tumors. Moreover, LEPR was significantly overexpressed in human colorectal cancer than normal colonic mucosa, and positively related with the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, a proneoplastic transcriptional regulator, which caused a more advanced tumor phenotype. Although, few epidemiologic studies have addressed the role of genetic polymorphisms of LEP gene family in colorectal cancer susceptibility systematically, previous evidence has indicated that SNPs in LEPR increased the risk for obesity and diabetes, which have been demonstrated as risk factors for various cancers. Subsequently, variants in LEPR were also found to influence cancer risk in Caucasian, directly. For example, LEPR Q223R was found associated with an increased risk for oral squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, polymorphisms in intron 2 of LEPR, in which rs12037879 is located, have been demonstrated associated with basal-like beast cancer, which may also revealed the possibility of potential carcinogenesis role of genetic variants in this region.\n\n    Besides the modest main effect of LEPR rs12037879, we also observed significant gene-environment interactions, which were able to amplify the modest effect of the single genetic variant, and enhance the predictive power. In two-way interaction analyses, we found that LEPR rs12037879 presented significant interactions with smoking status and family history of cancer. Consistently, a significant factor-dosage effect was detected among LEPR rs12037879, LEPR rs6690625, smoking status and family history of cancer. The interaction between smoking and leptin family was first noticed in overweight study, during which, smoking was indicated, via nicotinic mechanisms, to modify the sensitivity of hypothalamic leptin receptor and consequently regulate leptin synthesis and reduce body weight. Moreover, an epidemiologic study by Al Mutairi et al. has shown that cigarette smoking presented significantly positive and dose-dependent correlation with leptin receptor in diabetic population. The interaction between cigarette exposure and leptin receptor has been further addressed in a study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which inferred that underexpression of leptin receptor acted as a predisposing factor to cigarette smoking-induced lung disease. Given the common pathogenesis between obesity, diabetes, COPD and cancer, and the individual carcinogenesis role of cigarette smoking and leptin gene family, we inferred a possible role of the interaction between smoking and LEPR polymorphism in colorectal cancer susceptibility. Although, little evidence has shown that family history of cancer exerted an influence on the expression of leptin and its receptor directly, previous studies have indicated that the expression of leptin gene family could be modified by family history of cancer-related diseases, such as diabetes. Moreover, family history of cancer has been well-known to exert an influence on cancer susceptibility either alone or in combination with genetic variants long before. Familial predisposition to cancer represented by individuals harbouring certain genetic defects, might strengthen the carcinogenesis role of LEP gene family, therefore, create a hot bed for tumor. In addition, the interaction between family history of cancer and LEP gene family has been addressed by Yapijakis et al., who found that compared to the controls, the homozygous high gene expression genotype AA of LEP-2548G/A was significantly increased in the subgroup of patients with positive family history of cancer. As a SNP located in intronic region, rs6690625 did not present biological influence in gene expression or splicing, therefore, no main effect in carcinogenesis was found either in our study or previous researches. It might reflect insufficient pathogenicity of the single polymorphism. However, there was still evidence revealing that the SNP might have some indirect and tiny contribution to cancer susceptibility. For example, it has been reported to influence the age of menarche, which was indicated inversely related with colorectal cancer risk. In addition, there were reports referring to the roles of SNPs captured by rs6690625 in cancer susceptibility, which might point out a potential and indirect correlation between rs6690625 and cancer risk. For instance, rs6588153, captured by rs6690625, possessed significantly elevated levels of acute-phase serum amyloid A, which was associated with various malignancies including colon cancer. Moreover, rs6700896, also captured by rs6690625, presented strong association with C-reactive protein, a modest risk factor for colorectal cancer. Given above background, it might reasonable that rs6690625 only presented a role in carcinogenesis in the existing of other risk factors, such as risk polymorphisms, cigarette smoking and family history of cancer.\n\n    There are some limitations in this study. First, both case-control studies were hospital-based, therefore, selection bias may exist, since the controls were from a health examination population which may not be ideal representatives of geographically matched population in similar environmental exposure. However, the controls came from the same region with cases and were randomly sampled, which may reduce the effect of selection bias. Second, the course of colorectal cancer is long and wasting, during which, many cancer patients may lose body weight due to the disease, therefore, retrospective BMI data in case-control study may not reflect the level of obesity before initiation of cancer. However, a large case-control study indicated that BMI based on recent self-reported measures reported similar result with BMI from prospective studies in colorectal cancer risk. So, we infer recent self-reported BMI might bring substantial bias to the results, but not significant. Third, there are some missing data in environmental exposure in both case-control studies, such as family history of cancer, since the participants could not give exact information on related items during interviewing. Therefore, further studies with bigger sample size on gene-environment interactions are needed.\n\n    In conclusion, we provide evidence that one SNP in LEPR (rs12037879) may be associated with a marginal increase in colorectal cancer risk. Besides, LEPR rs12037879 present more important roles by interaction with smoking status, family history of cancer and LEPR rs6690625 in colorectal carcinogenesis. Further studies with large sample size are needed to certify our findings.",
