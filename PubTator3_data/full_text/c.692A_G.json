        "Title": "    Selective Loss of Responsiveness to Exogenous but Not Endogenous Cyclic-Dinucleotides in Mice Expressing STING-R231H",
        "Abstract": "    Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a central role in innate immune responses to viral and intracellular bacterial infections, and cellular damage. STING is a cytosolic sensor of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) including those produced by pathogenic bacteria and those arising endogenously as products of the DNA sensor cGAS (e.g., 2'3' cGAMP). The two most common alternative allelic variants of STING in humans are STING-R71H-G230A-R293Q (STING-HAQ) and STING-R232H that are found in 20.4% and 13.7-17.6% of the population, respectively. To determine the biologic consequences of these genotypic variations, we generated knock-in mice containing the murine equivalents of each variant and studied their responsiveness to CDNs. Homozygous STING-HAQ (R71H-I229A-R292Q) and STING-R231H mice were found to be unresponsive to all exogenous CDNs tested (ci-di-GMP, ci-di-AMP, 3'3' cGAMP and Rp,Rp-CDA). Responses of homozygous STING-HAQ mice to endogenous 2'3' cGAMP was also greatly impaired. However, homozygous STING-R231H mice are fully responsive to 2'3' cGAMP. Analysis of heterozygous mice revealed reduced responsiveness to exogenous and endogenous CDNs in mice carrying a single copy of STING-HAQ, while STING-R231H heterozygous mice exhibit reduced responsiveness to exogenous but not endogenous CDNs. These findings confirm and extend previous reports by demonstrating differing impact of allelic variation of STING on the ability to sense and respond to exogenous vs. endogenous CDNs. Finally, the STING-R231H variant mouse represents a useful tool with which to examine the relative contributions of STING sensing of exogenous and endogenous CDNs in the context of bacterial infections and CDN-based cancer immunotherapeutics.",
        "Introduction": "    Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, aka TMEM173, MPYS, MITA) is a cytosolic receptor for bacterial and synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), and the endogenous mammalian CDN 2'3' cGAMP generated by cGAS upon sensing of cytoplasmic DNA. Ligand binding activates several pathways, including those involving IRF3 and NF kappaB, resulting in production of proinflammatory cytokines. STING activation can also lead to autophagy.\n\n    STING plays an important role in the immune response to viral and intracellular bacterial pathogens, autoimmune inflammation, and immune surveillance [see for a comprehensive review of STING biology]. Bacterial CDNs and synthetic derivatives comprise a potent new class of adjuvants that evoke protective humoral and CD4 and CD8 T cells responses in a STING-dependent manner. In particular, the use of synthetic CDNs in combinational anti-cancer immunotherapy has provided encouraging results.\n\n    Several allelic variants of STING can be found in the general population, some of which appear to have altered function. The two most common minor allelic variants are R232H and R71H-G230A-R293Q (HAQ). The prevalence of these alleles varies among ethnic populations, but on average 20.4% of the human population carries at least one copy of the HAQ variant. The prevalence of R232H variant is reported to be 13.7-17.6%. To gain insight into the functional effects of these variations, several groups have used ectopic overexpression systems, sometimes reaching conflicting conclusions. Human STING HAQ has been reported to have decreased to absent responsiveness to exogenous CDNs, while both normal and absent responses to 2'3' cGAMP have been reported. Human STING-R232H was reported to have reduced responsiveness to most exogenous CDNs but relatively normal responsiveness to 2'3' cGAMP, although others have reported reduced responsiveness to 2'3' cGAMP. Selective unresponsiveness to exogenous but not endogenous CDNs was also observed in mutational analysis of murine STING in which a R231A substitution (equivalent position to R232 in humans) caused a loss of responsiveness bacterial CDNs but not 2'3' cGAMP. A key difference between endogenous 2'3' cGAMP and bacterial derived CDNs is that while the latter only uses 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds to link nucleotides, the former uses a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond and a 3'-5' phosphodiester bond. This altered structure allows 2'3' cGAMP to interact with STING with a higher affinity, which may explain differences in binding to allelic variants.\n\n    To gain more insight into the effects of these two allelic variants on STING function under physiological conditions we generated two new mouse models in which we introduced point mutations in mouse STING in order to emulate the two most common STING variants: HAQ and R232H. Ex vivo and in vivo analysis of immune responses to exogenous and endogenous CDNs reveal that neither variant responds to the exogenous CDNs tested. Interestingly, while STING HAQ has a largely impaired ability to sense endogenous CDNs, STING R231H responds normally to the cGAS product 2'3' cGAMP.",
        "Methods": "    Eight- to sixteen-week-old mice were used for all experiments. STING KO mice and STING HAQ knock-in mice were generated as previously described. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and used as WT controls. The STING R231H knock-in mice were generated by the National Jewish Health Mouse Genetics Core Facility as described below. The STING-HAQ mice and STING-R231H mice are available at The Jackson Laboratory as Stock No. 034434 and 034435, respectively. Both male and female mice were used in our in vitro and in vivo experiments. We have not observed any difference in the response to CDNs between the sexes. Mice were housed and bred in the Animal Research Facilities at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and National Jewish Health. All experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations and approval of University of Colorado and National Jewish Health Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n    A similar approach as described for the HAQ knock-in mice was used to generate the R231H knock-in mice. A linearized targeting vector (Figure S1A) which covers ~10 kb of the genomic region in the STING locus on mouse chromosome 18, with the R231H point mutation, was transfected into C57BL/6-derived JM8.A3 embryonic stem cells. Clones were selected for neomycin positive and diphtheria toxin negative clones. Successful targeting was assessed by PCR. Positive clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocytes and implanted. Chimerism was determined by coat color and males with high chimerism were bred with female C57BL/6 females to select for germline transmission. Successful germline transmission was confirmed by DNA sequencing. These mice were crossed with the FLP1 recombinase line (B6;SJL-Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J, Jackson Laboratory, ME.) to remove the neo gene, generating the STING R231H knock-in line. To validate successful introduction of the R231H generating point mutation exon 6 was amplified by PCR (Exon 6-F, 5'-TCACACTGAGAAGGCTAACGAGC-3'; Exon 6-R, 5'-CACCATAGAACAGGGATCACGC-3') and sequenced (Figure S1B).\n\n    Single cell suspensions of splenic cells were prepared. In some experiments red blood cells were lysed using ammonium chloride TRIS. In most experiments, live cells were isolated using Lympholyte M kit (Cedarlane, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and B cells were purified by CD43 negative selection using MACS CD43-microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., San Diego, CA.). Resultant populations were routinely >97% B cells based on B220 staining and FACS analysis. Ex vivo B cells and splenocytes were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, 2-ME (50 muM), HEPES buffer (10 mM), and 1% non-essential amino acids.\n\n    Ex vivo B cells or splenocytes were seeded (3 x 105 cells/100 muL/well) in 96 well flat-bottom or U-bottom plates and stimulated with various concentrations of CDNs or IL-4 for the indicated time. The following stimuli were used: IL-4 (Supernatant from a J558L culture, 1:200 dilution); c-diGMP (C 057, Biolog life science institute, Federal Republic of Germany); 2', 3' cGAMP (c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p], C 161, Biolog life science institute, Federal Republic of Germany); 3', 3' cGAMP (c-(ApGp), C 117, Biolog life science institute, Federal Republic of Germany); c-diAMP (C 088, Biolog life science institute, Federal Republic of Germany); Rp, Rp-c-diAMPSS (C118, Biolog life science institute, Federal Republic of Germany).\n\n    Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDM) were generated in vitro by flushing bone marrow from both femurs and tibias. Cells were cultured for 6 days in medium that induces the differentiation of macrophages (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% L-cell conditioned media). 5 mL of fresh media was added at day 3. At day 6 BMDMs were plated at 1 x 106 cells in 1 ml in 12 well plates. The next day the cells were stimulated with 10 mug/ml CDG or 2'3' cGAMP or 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma, MO.) for 5 h. Supernatants were harvested and IFNbeta was determined by ELISA (VeriKine-HS Mouse Interferon Beta Serum ELISA Kit, PBL Assay Science, NJ).\n\n    Cells were harvested from cultures and incubated with optimal amounts of antibodies. For analysis of cell surface markers, cells were stained with antibodies directed against the following molecules: B220-BV421 (clone RA3-6B2, BD Bioscience, CA) and CD86-BV605 (clone GL1, BD biosciences, CA). Annexin V-FITC (BD Bioscience, CA) was used to identify dead/dying cells and only Annexin V- cells were analyzed. FACS was performed using a Fortessa X-20 cytometer (BD biosciences, CA.) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Flowjo, Ashland, OR.).\n\n    Mature B cells were purified by CD43 negative selection using MACS Miltenyi microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., San Diego, CA.) and lysed in 1% NP40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5,) supplemented with Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Cell Signaling, MA.) and 1 mM PMSF. Lysates of ~1 x 106 cells were run in each lane of a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (GE/Amersham, PA.). The membrane was blotted with rabbit anti-mouse STING antibody (clone D2P2F, Cell Signaling, MA.) and goat anti-mouse Actin antibody (clone I-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX.) overnight followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, MA.) and anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies (R&D Systems). The membrane was exposed to chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Plus, ThermoScientific, MA.) and the chemiluminescence was detected using ChemiDoc XRS Imagining system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA.). The intensity of the bands was quantified using ImageStudioLite (Li-Cor Biosciences, NE).\n\n    Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane in an E-Z anesthesia system (Euthanex, Palmer, PA.) and subjected to intranasal (i.n.) immunization. Mice received three bi-weekly immunizations administered by drop-wise 40 muL/nostril doses of endotoxin-low OVA (20 mug/ mouse) in PBS with or without CDN (5 mug/mouse ci-di-GMP or 5 mug/mouse 2', 3' cGAMP (c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p], Biolog life science institute, Federal Republic of Germany). Endotoxin was removed (<0.1 EU) from OVA (Sigma, MO) as described or commercial endotoxin-low OVA was used (Biovendor, Asheville, NC.). Serum was collected at the indicated time points and nasal passages were lavaged at the final time point with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS.\n\n    For detection of OVA-specific antibodies, microtiter plates were coated overnight with 10 mug /mL OVA in PBS at 4 C and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS 0.05% Tween-20 for >1 h at RT. Serial dilutions of mouse serum in PBS were added and incubated overnight at 4 C. IgG antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL.) and IgA antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgA-HRP(Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL.) Between each step the plates were washed 4 times with PBS-0.05% Tween-20. The ELISA was developed with TMB single solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA.) and the reaction was stopped with 1N H2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO.). The OD was determined at 450 nm using a VERSAMax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA.) and the data were analyzed with Softmax software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA.). To plot the kinetic of antibody responses the half-max reciprocal of dilution was calculated by using the reciprocal of the dilution factor at a set half-max value for each group at each time point. In order to normalize results of assays performed on different days, a single serum sample collected on Day 42 from the WT mice that were immunized with OVA in the presence of CDG was run on each day.\n\n    The statistical significance was determined using the unpaired Student's t-test (Graphpad Prism 5.0; Graphpad, CA).",
        "Results": "    Previously we showed that B cells respond in vitro to stimulation with CDNs by upregulating the costimulatory molecule CD86 and by undergoing caspase-dependent cell death. We used these parameters to assay the functional consequences of expressing STING-HAQ or STING-R231H variants on the ability of immune cells to respond to exogenous CDNs. Knock-in mice expressing these two common STING variants were generated in our laboratory. The STING-HAQ mouse has been described previously and the generation of the STING-R231H mouse is described in Figure S1. The R231H point mutation in mice corresponds to the common allelic variant R232H described in humans. Purified B cells from homozygous STING-HAQ/HAQ (Figure 1) or homozygous STING-R231H/R231H (Figure 2) were cultured for 18 h with varied concentrations of the bacterial derived CDNs: cyclic-di-GMP (CDG), cyclic-di-AMP (CDA) and 3',3' cyclic-GMP-AMP (3'3' cGAMP). In addition, B cells were cultured with a synthetic CDN: Rp.Rp-ssCDA, an adjuvant with increased stability and affinity for STING that is used in cancer immunotherapy. B cell expressing WT STING responded to these exogenous CDNs by upregulation of CD86 and cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1, 2, Figures S2-S4). This response is STING dependent as indicated by the absence of a response by deficient of STING (STING KO) B cells. In contrast, neither homozygous STING-HAQ/HAQ B cells (Figure 1) nor homozygous STING-R231H/R231H B cells (Figure 2) were able to respond to exogenous CDNs or to the synthetic CDN. This inability to respond to exogenous CDNs was not due to an inability of these B cells to become activated because both STING-HAQ/HAQ B cells and STING-R231H/R231H B cells respond to a STING-independent stimulus, IL4, by upregulating CD86 (Figure 3D).\n\n    Individuals that are homozygous for STING-HAQ or STING-R232H are relatively rare (2-3% of the population). Yet up to 20% of the population carries 1 copy of STING-HAQ and up to 13.7-17.9% of the population carries 1 copy of STING-R232H. To test the consequence of STING-HAQ and STING-R231H heterozygosity on the ability of immune cells to respond to exogenous CDNs, we determined the ability of B cells isolated from heterozygous STING-HAQ or STING-R231H mice to respond to exogenous CDNs. Heterozygosity of both STING variants resulted in a greatly reduced (75-95% reduction in increase of CD86 MFI compared to STING WT) responses to exogenous CDNs (Figures 1, 2). The response to CDG was most affected by the presence of either STING-HAQ (Figure 1A) or STING-R231H (Figure 2A) whereas the response to 3'3' cGAMP and CDA was less affected. The R231H and G230A (HAQ) point mutations both lie within one of the CDN binding regions of STING so altered interactions with different CDNs could be expected.\n\n    A previous report described reduced STING expression in human and murine tissues expressing STING-HAQ. We confirmed these findings in B cells from STING-HAQ mice, detecting a ~50% reduction of detectable STING protein in B cells from homozygous STING-HAQ mice and a ~20% reduction in B cells from heterozygous STING-HAQ (Figures 3A,B). No reduction of STING expression was found in B cells homozygous for STING-R231H (Figures 3A,B), in fact these mice appeared to have slightly higher STING protein expression.\n\n    STING forms homodimers that undergo a conformational change upon CDN binding, leading to oligomerization, recruitment and activation of tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), that in turn activates IRF3. This raises the question whether in individuals that are heterozygous for either STING-HAQ or STING-R231H, the point-mutated STING acts in a dominant negative fashion when forming heterodimers with WT STING. To approach this question, we compared the response of STING-HAQ or STING-R231H heterozygous B cells to exogenous CDNs, to that of STING haploinsufficient B cells. STING haploinsuffient B cells express ~30% of STING protein compared to WT STING B cells (Figure 3B). Despite having lower STING protein levels than heterozygous STING-HAQ or STING-R231H mice, STING haploinsufficient mice have stronger responses to CDG (Figure 3C, Figure S5) and CDA (data not shown). Assuming equal expression of both WT and mutant STING and a dominant negative function of the mutant STING, only 25% of available STING in heterozygous STING-HAQ and STING-R231H B cells would be STING-WT/WT dimers and functional. The observed reduced ability of STING-HAQ and STING-R231H heterozygous B cells to respond to exogenous CDNs, while homozygous STING-HAQ and STING-R231H B cells are unable to respond (Figures 1, 2) is consistent with ~25% WT homodimers present responsible for the observed response. These results are suggestive of a dominant negative effect of the HAQ and R231H STING variants expression on WT STING function, as has been described for other STING variants.\n\n    STING plays a central role in intracellular DNA sensing pathways by binding the cGAS product 2'3' cGAMP, resulting in IRF3 activation. Previous work suggested that STING-HAQ is a null allele, disabling the carrier's ability to respond to 2'3' cGAMP, although others have reported residual ability of PBMCs of STING-HAQ/HAQ carriers to respond to intracellular DNA or cGAMP. We incubated heterozygous and homozygous STING-HAQ B cells with increasing concentrations of 2'3' cGAMP. B cells from STING-HAQ/WT mice have reduced ability to respond to 2'3' cGAMP at all concentrations tested (Figures 4A,B, Figure S6). Homozygous STING-HAQ B cells did not respond to the lower doses of 2'3' cGAMP. However, we reproducibly observed that at the highest concentration of 2'3' cGAMP tested STING-HAQ/HAQ B cells do respond to 2'3' cGAMP by upregulation of CD86 (Figure 4A) and increased cell death (Figure 4B). This suggests that STING-HAQ is not a null allele, but rather is a hypomorph with greatly reduced ability to respond to 2'3' cGAMP.\n\n    Next, we analyzed the ability of STING-R231H B cells to respond to 2'3' cGAMP. Data from ectopic expression experiments suggest that this STING variant can still respond to endogenous CDN. We stimulated STING-R231H homozygous and heterozygous B cells with different concentrations of 2'3' cGAMP. In contrast to their inability to respond to exogenous CDNs (Figure 2), STING-R231H/R231H B cells are fully responsive to 2'3' cGAMP (Figures 4C,D). In fact, they respond better, although this could be due to slightly increased STING expression (Figure 3A).\n\n    To verify that the observed responsiveness to CDNs in B cells is not cell type specific, we generated bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from mice homozygous for STING-HAQ and STING-R231H and tested their ability to respond to exogenous and endogenous CDNs (Figures 4E,F). While WT BMDMs responded to CDG (Figure 4E) and 2'3' cGAMP (Figure 4F) by producing INFbeta, homozygous STING-HAQ BMDMs were impaired in their response to both CDG and 2'3' cGAMP. In contrast homozygous STING-R231H BMDMs only responded to 2'3' cGAMP but not CDG. These results confirm our findings using B cells (Figures 1A, 2A, 4A, 4C). All genotypes were able to respond to LPS by producing INFbeta (Figure 4G), demonstrating that the inability to respond to CDNs does not reflect a general defect in INFbeta responses. The enhanced response of STING KO BMDM to LPS was not a reproducible finding.\n\n    Together these results show that ex vivo immune cells expressing STING-HAQ are greatly impaired in their response to both exogenous and endogenous CDNs, while immune cells expressing STING-R231H are impaired in their ability to respond to exogenous CDN but not endogenous CDNs.\n\n    To determine whether these observations hold true in vivo we examined the ability of STING-HAQ and STING-R231H mice to respond to immunization when CDNs are used as adjuvants. CDG adjuvant activity is well-defined and requires STING expression in multiple cell types, including CD11c+ dendritic cells and B cells, to promote optimal antibody responses. 2'3' cGAMP has also been used as an adjuvant but can also act as a proxy for in vivo responses that elicit a cGAS-mediated response. STING-HAQ homozygous and heterozygous mice were immunized with OVA in the presence or absence of CDG or 2'3' cGAMP (Figure 5A). As shown previously mice expressing WT STING mount greatly enhanced anti-OVA responses when CDG (Figures 5B,D,F) or 2'3' cGAMP (Figures 5C,E,H) is used as an adjuvant. These responses to CDN adjuvants are STING-dependent, as they are absent in STING deficient animals. In agreement with the observed in vitro responses to CDG (Figure 1A), immunization using CDG as an adjuvant did not result in enhanced titers of serum anti-OVA IgG (Figures 5B,D) or mucosal anti-OVA IgA (Figure 5F) in STING-HAQ/HAQ mice. Heterozygous STING-HAQ/WT were able to respond to CDG adjuvants, albeit with reduced magnitude. Similarly, the adjuvant effect of 2'3' cGAMP was lost in STING-HAQ/HAQ mice (Figures 5C,E,G), while STING-HAQ/WT mice were only marginally impaired in their ability to respond to 2'3' cGAMP.\n\n    To test the in vivo consequences of STING-R231H expression, we immunized mice homozygous or heterozygous for STING-R231H with OVA in the presence of absence of CDG or 2'3' cGAMP (Figure 6A). As observed in vitro (Figure 2A), STING-R231H/R231H mice did not mount enhanced anti-OVA IgG (Figures 6B,D) or IgA (Figure 6F) responses following immunization using CDG as an adjuvant. In contrast, heterozygous STING-R231H/WT mouse responses to CDG/OVA were only marginally reduced compared to STING WT mice. The response of STING-R231H/WT mice to 2'3' cGAMP/OVA immunization was of the same magnitude as observed in STING WT mice (Figures 6 C,E,G). Homozygous STING-R231H/R231H mice trended toward enhanced anti-OVA IgG response following 2'3' cGAMP/OVA immunization, compared to STING-WT mice (Figures 6C,E).\n\n    Taken together these data confirm and extend previous reports that expression of STING-HAQ compromises the ability of carriers to respond to exogenous and endogenous CDNs, while expression of STING-R231H compromises the ability to respond to exogenous CDNs while it does not affect the cGAS/STING pathway.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this report we describe two novel mouse models, representing the two most prevalent minor STING alleles, and their ability to respond to exogenous and endogenous CDNs in vitro and in vivo. Under the conditions tested, the STING-HAQ allele conferred unresponsiveness to all exogenous CDNs tested and caused severely reduced responsiveness to endogenous 2'3' cGAMP (Figures 1, 3-5). In contrast, the STING-R231H allele (murine equivalent to human R232H) conferred responsiveness to endogenous 2'3' cGAMP, but disabled responses to the exogenous CDNs tested (Figures 2-4, 6).\n\n    The STING-HAQ function was initially characterized by Patel et al. in a study that was limited to analysis to homozygous STING-HAQ mice and reported that the allele was a null allele, lacking responsiveness to both endogenous and exogenous CDNs. Analysis of human EBV immortalized STING-HAQ B cells supported these findings. Our analysis of the STING-HAQ mice confirmed the finding of Patel et al. (Figures 1, 5) and expand them to show that STING-HAQ heterozygosity impacts the ability to respond to CDNs as well in vitro and in vivo (Figures 1, 3, 5). A noteworthy difference is that in our hands homozygous STING-HAQ retains some responsiveness to high concentrations of 2'3' cGAMP (Figures 4A,B), indicating that STING-HAQ is not functionally null, but rather has reduced affinity for 2'3' cGAMP resulting in near absent responses. These data agree with observations made using PBMCs from STING-HAQ/HAQ individuals, which show a strongly reduced but not absent responses to 2'3' cGAMP and DNA. It should be noted that others have reported that STING-HAQ PBMCs are responsive to both exogenous and endogenous CDNs. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.\n\n    The selective unresponsiveness to exogenous CDNs but not to 2'3' cGAMP observed in STING R231H mice is in agreement with previous studies of ectopically expressed R232H or R231A STING variants. The observed in vivo responses in STING-R231H mice are likely to accurately reflect responsiveness of individuals homozygous for STING-R232H. PBMCs from individuals that are STING-R232H homozygous also have an impaired responsiveness to CDG, but respond normally to 2'3' cGAMP and DNA. It is noteworthy that EBV-immortalized B cells from R232H homozygous individuals are severely impaired in their ability to respond to exogenous CDNs and 2'3' cGAMP stimulation. The reason for this disparity is unclear, however, it is possible that immortalization using DNA virus infection led to selective outgrowth of subclones with decreased responsiveness to 2'3' cGAMP.\n\n    The STING-HAQ and STING-R231H mice described here should be valuable tools to examine the effects of the respective human alleles on the susceptibility to infections and responsiveness to CDN-based vaccines and therapeutics. The first reports examining prevalence of STING-HAQ or STING-R232H variants among patients infected with Legionella pneumophilia and Streptococcus pneumoniae paint a complicated picture. While both pathogens are detected in a STING-dependent manner in vitro, an increased frequency among patients in STING-HAQ heterozygous and homozygous individuals was only observed among patients with Legionnaires' disease. This differential in vivo dependence of functional cGAS/STING to control infections was confirmed using knockout mice. In neither study were differences in R232H prevalence reported. Another study suggests that STING-HAQ homozygosity may result in slower disease progression in HIV-infected individuals. Systematic studies using mouse models such as the ones described in this manuscript could be useful in predicting clinical consequences of carrying these genetic variants.\n\n    STING plays a role in several sensing pathways making it hard to dissect the role STING plays in individual pathways. An example is found in the fact that during bacterial infections STING can be activated by multiple mechanisms. It acts as a sensor of bacterial derived CDNs directly, independent of cGAS, and may sense other bacterial products in a cGAS independent manner. STING also plays a central role in detection of DNA from bacteria and infection-induced host cell damage by sensing 2'3' cGAMP produced by the DNA sensor cGAS. Adding to the complexity, in the immune response to Brucella abortus both IFN and IL-1 responses are STING-dependent but only the IFN response is cGAS-dependent. To gain insight into the different mechanisms by which STING contributes to immune responses, investigators often compare STING KO mice to cGAS KO mice. However, such an approach has limitations. For example, cGAS has been proposed to enhance the response to extracellular CDNs by binding endocytosed CDNs and presenting them to STING. Other studies suggest that cGAS may have additional functions independent of STING that could confound findings. The STING-R231H/R231H mutant mouse circumvents these issues by retaining responsiveness to cGAS-derived CDN (Figures 4, 6), while being unable to respond to exogenous CDNs (Figures 2, 6), eliminating potentially confounding effects of cGAS deficiency. Such an approach has been used successfully in vitro in the context of Chlamydia trachomatis infection, by ectopic expression of a R231A mutant. In this respect the R231H mouse model could be a valuable tool in the arsenal of weapons available to examine the role STING-mediated anti-DNA responses vs. exogenous CDN responses, in the context of bacterial infections or CDN-based anti-tumor responses.",

        "Title": "    Genome Aggregation Database Version 4:Allele Frequency Changes and Impact on Variant Interpretation in Dystonia",
        "Abstract": "    Population-scale databases majorly contribute to variant interpretation. The recently released Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v4 offers a >5-fold increased sample size compared to v2.1.1. Pathogenic variants absent from v2.1.1 are now registered in v4 at a considerable rate. The implications on variant interpretation in dystonia are unknown.\n\n    All curated variants linked to the most common dominant forms of isolated dystonia were extracted from the International Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Society Gene database. We compared variant population-frequencies and gene constraint metrics between gnomAD v2.1.1 and v4.\n\n    The majority of dystonia-causing variants (192/247, 77.7%) remained absent from the newer gnomAD version.

        "Introduction": "    Population databases majorly contribute to variant interpretation in medical genetics. The absence of a variant among population controls supports its pathogenicity (moderate criterion \"PM2\" in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics [ACMG] guidelines). Moreover, a significantly higher prevalence of a variant in affected individuals compared with controls can be used as \"strong\" evidence for pathogenicity according to the ACMG \"PS4\" criterion. The evaluation of variant frequencies in publicly available population databases has been widely adopted into clinical evidence-based frameworks and aims to reduce subjectivity in variant classification.\n\n    Despite these recommended applications, challenges are associated with the use of large-scale reference genetic data for the assessment of variants that were identified in patients with dystonia. In particular, the use of stringent frequency cutoffs (eg, requiring the absence of a variant from controls) can increase the risk of falsely categorizing a disease-causing alteration as benign or as variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Variants causing monogenic dystonia can be found in population datasets for different reasons. First, reduced penetrance, a phenomenon well known for many forms of monogenic dystonia, may result in the enrolment of asymptomatic individuals with pathogenic variation in control cohorts. Second, movement abnormalities can manifest late in life, raising the possibility that individuals harboring an underlying genetic predisposition may be included as controls before symptom onset. Third, variable expressivity may result in mild phenotypes, which can remain undiagnosed in large population cohorts. Fourth, subjects included in population databases may not have been properly phenotyped for the trait of interest.\n\n    One of the largest and most commonly queried resources, the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), is updated periodically. A new gnomAD release was launched in November 2023, v4 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). This v4 version of gnomAD (meanwhile accessible as v4.1) contains sequencing data from 807,162 individuals (730,947 exomes and 76,215 genomes), a more than 5-fold increase in genomic information compared with the previous v2.1.1 release, which had become commonplace in diagnostic practice. Pathogenic variants, often absent from v2.1.1, are now registered in gnomAD at a considerable rate; for example, 14 different ClinVar-annotated (likely) pathogenic loss-of-function (LoF) changes in the neurodevelopmental disease- and dystonia-associated gene CHD8 are found in 28 gnomAD-v4 subjects, as compared with two such variants (in one individual each) in v2.1.1. We recently made the unexpected observation of a patient with dystonia who had a probable clinically relevant de novo variant of extreme rarity according to v2.1.1, but which was later found to display an allele frequency \"greater than expected\" for a rare disorder in gnomAD v4.1. This finding motivated us to explore the impact of the newly provided genomic information in gnomAD on variant analysis in dystonia. To this purpose, we systematically screened gnomAD v2.1.1 and v4.1 for variants described in genes linked to autosomal dominant forms of isolated dystonia based on curated data provided through the International Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Society Gene Database (MDSGene).",
        "Methods": "    We catalogued all MDSGene-reported variants (https://www.mdsgene.org/g4d) related to six genes known to cause autosomal dominantly inherited isolated dystonia (ANO3, GNAL, KMT2B, TOR1A, THAP1, and VPS16). We considered all the variants irrespectively of their presentation with additional non-dystonia features (eg, intellectual disability in the setting of KMT2B and VPS16 variants). Each entry was cross-referenced with ClinVar. Variants classified as (likely) benign according to ClinVar as well as synonymous variants were excluded. For each gene, we obtained variant observed/expected ratios, LoF observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score, as well as probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) and missense z scores from gnomAD versions v2.1.1 and v4.1. We collected the frequencies of each reported variant in both gnomAD versions along with the scores of the following in silico tools: combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) and rare exome variant ensemble learner (REVEL). Fisher's exact or chi 2 tests were applied as appropriate to compare constraint metrics and variant frequencies in the two gnomAD versions. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Study related data are publicly available.",
        "Results": "    From the MDSGene database, 247 variants fulfilled the inclusion criteria (as of March 2024). Of these variants, 26 (10.5%) were found in ClinVar (March 2024). Thirteen variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (13/247, 5.3%; from now on referred to as \"P/LP\"), nine were classified as VUS (9/247, 3.6%), and four variants had conflicting interpretations (4/247, 1.6%).\n\n    Twenty-eight variants (28/247, 11.3%) were already listed in v2.1 (see Table 1). Six of these variants displayed a significant allele frequency decrease in v4.1, whereas two of them displayed an increased frequency in v4.1 as compared with v2.1. The remaining 20 variants showed no significant changes in allele frequencies between v2.1 and v4.1.\n\n    Of 219 variants not listed in v2.1, 27 (27/219, 12.3%) appeared for the first time in v4.1 (see Table 2). Although most of these variants occurred at an absolute allele number of n = 1 in v4.1, six of them (3 in KMT2B, 2 in ANO3, and 1 in VPS16) were found in >=4 individuals.\n\n    Considering the 13 P/LP variants from ClinVar, 8 (8/13, 62%) appeared for the first time in v4.1 (0 count in v2.1). Of the five P/LP variants already reported in v2.1, two displayed a decreased frequency in v4.1.\n\n    Regarding constraint metrics, GNAL exhibited a significant lower constraint against both LoF and missense variants in v4.1 compared with v2.1.1 (see Supplementary Table S1). The constraint of KMT2B against missense variants also significantly decreased in v4.1 compared with v2.1.1 (see Supplementary Table S2). Gene-specific changes in variant frequencies are discussed below.\n\n    Of 25 MDSGene-curated variants, seven (28%) appeared for the first time in v4.1 (see Table 1), two of which were classified as P/LP in ClinVar. Of the five variants already reported in v2.1 (5/25, 20%), one displayed a decreased frequency in v4.1. The remaining 13 variants (52%) were not reported in v2.1 or v4.1.\n\n    Of 34 variants listed in MDSGene, one was already reported in v2.1 and displayed a reduced frequency in v4.1. The remaining 33 variants (97%) were not reported in v2.1 and v4.1.\n\n    Of 67 variants from MDSGene, eight (11.8%) appeared for the first time in v4.1. Five of these were frameshift LoF variants. Notably, the LoF variant p.Thr176Aspfs*8 had an absolute allele count of 11 in v4.1. Inspection of next-generation sequencing read data in gnomAD revealed that eight of 11 datasets had a depth of coverage of <20 at this site (read depth 12-19; variant called in 3-5 reads), whereas two of 11 datasets with a corresponding sequencing depth of >20 presented the variant in 20% of reads only, potentially indicative of mosaic events. Another LoF variant (p.Ala2139Glyfs*6) was also present in four carriers in v4.1; visualization of gnomAD sequencing data showed that the depth of coverage was <20 in all four subjects, with four or less reads affected. One missense variant already present in v2.1 showed no relevant frequency change in v4.1. The remaining 58 variants (86.6%) were not reported in v2.1 and v4.1.\n\n    Nine of 94 MDSGene-listed THAP1 variants absent from v2.1 were now reported in v4.1, two of which were classified as P/LP in ClinVar. Of the 11 variants already present in v2.1, one displayed an increased frequency in v4.1 (absolute carrier number n = 51 in v4.1 vs. n = 1 in v2.1). The remaining 74 variants (78.7%) were not found in v2.1 and v4.1.\n\n    Nine TOR1A variants were reported in MDSGene. Of these, one appeared for the first time in v4.1. Of the six variants already present in v2.1, one displayed an increased and three a decreased frequency in v4.1. The only well-established disease-causing variant (p.Glu303del) displayed an approximately 2-fold frequency decrease in v4.1 compared with v2.1.\n\n    Two of 18 variants appeared for the first time in v4.1. One was a P/LP frameshift LoF variant described in ClinVar. Four variants were already reported in v2.1: two with conflicting interpretations in ClinVar displayed no change in frequency, whereas the other two (1 P/LP; 1 unreported in ClinVar) displayed a reduced frequency in v4.1. The remaining 12 variants (66%) were not reported in v2.1 or v4.1.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Although the ACMG guidelines contain two important criteria to support the pathogenicity of a variant based on its population frequency (\"PS4\" and \"PM2\"), there are often no specific recommendations for defining the expected (or \"allowed\") carrier cutoff of the variant in the context of an individual clinical disorder. For example, rare variants associated with pediatric-onset diseases are expected to be depleted from population-based databases. Nevertheless, the most common variant causing childhood-onset generalized dystonia (TOR1A p.Glu303del) is recurrently found in gnomAD subjects (n = 84 in v4.1). Frequency-based filtering of variants is a key step for identifying monogenic disease variation from next-generation sequencing data. Indeed, the absence of a variant among population controls (PM2 criterion) is sufficient to upgrade a variant from VUS to likely pathogenic and the other way around. Therefore, detailed knowledge about the allele count of variants linked to disorders such as dystonia in the general population is crucial. The v4.1 update of gnomAD is considered to provide more accurate frequency estimates based on a considerable increase in sample size. Therefore, for variant interpretation by the genetics community, the impact of new carrier rates of currently considered disease-causing variants on clinical diagnostics needs to be determined. Here, we comprehensively assessed the carrier rates of variants reported to cause isolated dystonia based on the MDSGene database according to the v2.1.1 and v4 gnomAD releases. Three core observations emerged from our evaluation. First, the majority (77.7%) of presumably dystonia-linked variants from MDSGene remained absent from gnomAD. This finding indicates that a relevant proportion of variants causing monogenic dystonia are ultra-rare or \"private\" alterations yet unobservable in a large sample size of population controls. Second, for many variants already listed in gnomAD v2.1.1, the v4 update did not result in a statistically significant change in allele frequencies, or at least not in an increased prevalence. Rather, a few dystonia-causing variants from MDSGene showed a decreased population frequency in v4 (eg, TOR1A p.Glu303del). This might be attributable to the inclusion of additional cohorts of European ancestry, such as the UK Biobank dataset, in which certain variants are less prevalent than in other populations (eg, the TOR1A p.Glu303del variant being most prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews). Third, a non-neglectable number of variants listed in MDSGene, including many that were cross-referenced as P/LP alterations in ClinVar, appeared for the first time in gnomAD v4. This notion reinforces the conclusion that the (rare) presence of a variant in gnomAD does not indicate that it is benign. We also noted unexpected carrier rates for KMT2B LoF variants in gnomAD v4 (eg, for p.Thr176Aspfs*8; 11 carriers) which has previously been discovered as a de novo event in early-onset neurodevelopmental dystonia. A closer examination of the gnomAD data suggested the presence of sequencing artifacts or mosaic states as possible explanations for some of these relatively high allele counts, adding further layers of complexity to variant interpretation using large-scale sequencing data. To overcome the intrinsic challenges of variant analysis with the use of DNA sequencing-level data alone, the implementation of additional markers for pathogenicity analysis will be a promising strategy. An example is the analysis of genome-wide methylation profiles from blood-extracted DNA to assess the consequences of variants in KMT2B, including alterations with moderate-to-low effect sizes. Interestingly, the KMT2B missense variant p.Ala1541Val, unreported in gnomAD v2.1.1 but present in two carriers in v4, was shown to cause more subtle methylation changes in a family with incompletely penetrant dystonia.\n\n    In summary, we provide a systematic assessment of population frequencies of documented dystonia-causing variants to continue improving the interpretability of variants identified in affected individuals. We found that a sizable portion of dystonia-linked variants now appear in the recently released v4 version of gnomAD, highlighting a role for variable penetrance and expressivity mechanisms and underlining the importance of further research into the prevalence and effects of rare variants carried by patients with dystonia.",

        "Title": "    Mycobacterium bovis Strain Ravenel Is Attenuated in Cattle",
        "Abstract": "    Mycobacterium tuberculosis variant bovis (MBO) has one of the widest known mammalian host ranges, including humans. Despite the characterization of this pathogen in the 1800s and whole genome sequencing of a UK strain (AF2122) nearly two decades ago, the basis of its host specificity and pathogenicity remains poorly understood. Recent experimental calf infection studies show that MBO strain Ravenel (MBO Ravenel) is attenuated in the cattle host compared to other pathogenic strains of MBO. In the present study, experimental infections were performed to define attenuation. Whole genome sequencing was completed to identify regions of differences (RD) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to explain the observed attenuation. Comparative genomic analysis of MBO Ravenel against three pathogenic strains of MBO (strains AF2122-97, 10-7428, and 95-1315) was performed. Experimental infection studies on five calves each, with either MBO Ravenel or 95-1315, revealed no visible lesions in all five animals in the Ravenel group despite robust IFN-gamma responses. Out of 486 polymorphisms in the present analysis, 173 were unique to MBO Ravenel among the strains compared. A high-confidence subset of nine unique SNPs were missense mutations in genes with annotated functions impacting two major MBO survival and virulence pathways: (1) Cell wall synthesis & transport [espH (A103T), mmpL8 (V888I), aftB (H484Y), eccC5 (T507M), rpfB (E263G)], and (2) Lipid metabolism & respiration [mycP1(T125I), pks5 (G455S), fadD29 (N231S), fadE29 (V360G)]. These substitutions likely contribute to the observed attenuation. Results from experimental calf infections and the functional attributions of polymorphic loci on the genome of MBO Ravenel provide new insights into the strain's genotype-disease phenotype associations.",
        "Introduction": "    Mycobacterium tuberculosis variant bovis (Mycobacterium bovis or MBO) causes significant economic hardship for livestock producers. M. bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, is infectious to humans and causes ~150,000 cases of human disease annually. However, the overall virulence of MBO is generally greater than that of M. tuberculosis, as is reflected in the extensive animal host range.\n\n    Historically, inoculation of rabbits was used to discriminate M. tuberculosis variant tuberculosis (MTB) from MBO within clinical samples; rabbits are typically resistant to MTB but highly susceptible to MBO infection. In contrast, guinea pigs and mice are susceptible to both MTB and MBO.\n\n    The MBO type strain for many comparative pathogenesis studies is M. bovis Ravenel (ATCC strain 35720). This strain was isolated from a tuberculous cow circa 1900 and deposited in the Trudeau Mycobacterial Culture Collection in 1910. At the Trudeau Institute, this strain was maintained in the non-native host rabbit before freezer stocks were made. Here it was used for pathogenesis and virulence studies in mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs. It has been used in diagnostic, immunopathogenesis, chemotherapy, and vaccine efficacy studies. Even though the current stocks of MBO Ravenel (ATCC strain 35720) are fully virulent in rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice yet they are attenuated in cattle.\n\n    Experimental infection of calves with MBO strains such as 95-1315 at the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) in the US, WAg202 at AgResearch in New Zealand, and AF2122/97 at Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratory Agency (AHVLA) in the United Kingdom consistently result in progressive disease in cattle, including typical granulomatous gross and microscopic lesions with recovery of bacilli from affected tissues. However, in a bovine TB vaccine efficacy study with cattle by Khare et al., 2007, gross tuberculous lesions were not detected in vaccinated or unvaccinated groups upon necropsy 160 days after intranasal delivery of 106 colony forming units (CFU) of MBO Ravenel challenge, despite the recovery of MBO Ravenel from 10/10 unvaccinated and 4/10 vaccinated animals. However, histopathological changes were seen in 6/10 unvaccinated as well as 4/10 vaccinated animal's tonsils and livers. Even though all the referenced studies used different infection routes, dose rates, ages, and animal breeds, the fact remains that Ravenel failed to replicate the macroscopic granulomatous lesions seen in infection with other pathogenic strains of MBO. Because of this deficiency, pathogenesis studies no longer employ MBO Ravenel. Given these reports on apparent disease phenotype variations among different strains of MBO, the objectives of the present study were: (1) to compare the virulence of MBO Ravenel to MBO strain 95-1315 in cattle and (2) to compare the genome sequences of MBO Ravenel to three virulent strains of MBO.",
        "Methods": "    Two strains of MBO were used for the challenge inoculum: (1) MBO strain 95-1315 [USDA, Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) designation] originally isolated from a white-tailed deer in Michigan, USA and (2) MBO strain Ravenel (ATCC 35720) obtained from John Chan at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY and freezer stocks were kept at NADC. Strains were prepared using standard procedures in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid media (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose complex (OADC) plus 0.05% Tween 80 and 0.5% Glycerol (strain Ravenel only).\n\n    Holstein steers (n = 18, ~1 year of age) were obtained from a TB-free herd in Sioux Center, IA, and housed in a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facility at the NADC, Ames, IA, according to Institutional Biosafety and Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. In an initial study, steers (n = 3) received 105 CFU MBO Ravenel by aerosol. Briefly, inoculum (~105 CFU) was delivered to restrained calves by nebulization into a mask (Trudell Medical International, London, ON, Canada) covering the nostrils and mouth. The inoculum was inhaled through a one-way valve into the mask and directly into the lungs via the nostrils. The process continued until the inoculum, a 1 mL PBS wash of the inoculum tube, and an additional 2 mL PBS were delivered, taking ~10 min. Strict BSL-3 safety protocols were followed to protect personnel from exposure to MBO.\n\n    In a follow-up study, treatment groups consisted of uninfected steers (n = 5) and steers receiving either 105 CFU MBO strain 95-1315 (n = 5) or 105 CFU MBO strain Ravenel (n = 5) by aerosol.\n\n    All calves were euthanized ~3.5 months after challenge by intravenous administration of sodium pentobarbital. Tissues were examined for gross lesions and collected and processed for microscopic analysis and isolation of MBO. Tissues collected included: palatine tonsil, lung, liver, and mandibular, parotid, medial retropharyngeal, mediastinal, tracheobronchial, hepatic, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Lymph nodes were sectioned at 0.5 cm intervals and examined. Each lung lobe was sectioned at 0.5-1.0 cm intervals and examined separately. Lungs and lymph nodes (mediastinal and tracheobronchial) were evaluated using a semi-quantitative gross pathology scoring system adapted from Vordermeier et al., 2002. Lung lobes (left cranial, left caudal, right cranial, right caudal, middle, and accessory) were individually scored based upon the following scoring system: 0 = no visible lesions; 1 = no external gross lesions, but lesions seen upon slicing; 2 = <5 gross lesions of <10 mm in diameter; 3 = >5 gross lesions of <10 mm in diameter; 4 = >1 distinct gross lesion of >10 mm in diameter; 5 = gross coalescing lesions. Cumulative mean scores were then calculated for each entire lung. Lymph node pathology was based on the following scoring system: 0 = no necrosis or visible lesions; 1 = small focus (1 to 2 mm in diameter); 2 = several small foci; 3 = extensive necrosis. Gross pathology data are presented as mean (+-standard error) disease score for mediastinal lymph node, tracheobronchial lymph node, and lung.\n\n    Tissues collected for microscopic analysis were fixed by immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin. For microscopic examination, formalin-fixed tissues were processed by standard paraffin-embedment techniques, cut into 5 microm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Adjacent sections from sections containing caseous necrotic granulomas suggestive of tuberculosis were cut and stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen technique for visualization of acid-fast bacteria (AFB). Microscopic tuberculous lesions were staged (I-IV) as described by Wangoo. Data are presented as the total and mean number of granulomas observed in each histologic lesion stage (i.e., I-IV) for lung and mediastinal lymph node sections (Table 1).\n\n    For quantitative assessment of mycobacterial burden, left tracheobronchial lymph nodes were removed, examined for gross lesions, weighed, and the entire lymph node (other than a small ~1 g section for histology and qualitative culture) homogenized in phenol red nutrient broth using a blender (Oster, Shelton, CT, USA). Logarithmic dilutions (100-10-9) of homogenates in PBS were plated in 100muL aliquots plated on Middlebrook 7H11 selective agar plates (Becton Dickinson) and incubated for 8 weeks at 37  C. Data are presented as mean (+-standard error) CFU per gram of tissue (Table 2).\n\n    Duplicate 250 microL heparinized whole blood aliquots were distributed in 96-well plates with MBO purified-protein derivates (PPD) (10 microg/mL, Prionics Ag, Schlieren, Switzerland), rESAT-6/CFP10 (1 microg/mL), or no antigen (nil) and incubated at 39  C/5% CO2 for 20 h. IFN-gamma concentrations in stimulated plasma were determined using a commercial ELISA-based kit (BovigamTM, Prionics Ag). Absorbance values of standards (recombinant bovine IFN-gamma; Endogen, Rockford, IL, USA) and test samples were read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA). Duplicate samples for individual treatments were analyzed, and data presented as optical densities at 450 nm of the response to MBO PPD minus the response to no-antigen (mean +- SEM) (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n\n    Fifteen days prior to necropsy, calves received 0.1 mL (100 microg) of MBO PPD and 0.1 mL (40 microg) of Mycobacterium avium PPD injected intradermally at separate clipped sites in the mid-cervical region according to guidelines described in USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) circular 91-45-01 (APHIS, 2005) for the comparative cervical test. Skin thickness was measured with calipers prior to PPD administration and 72 h after injection (Figure 3). A scattergram for the interpretation of CCT results provided by USDA, APHIS, and VS was used to categorize animals as negative, suspect, or reactors. Balanced PPDs were obtained from the Brucella and Mycobacterial Reagents section of the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, IA, USA.\n\n    MBO Ravenel was obtained from freezer stocks stored at NADC (APHIS, USDA) and cultured on Middlebrook 7H10 slants (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) for 14 days. Colonies were harvested for DNA extraction. Paired-end (2 x 150 bp) library preparation using NEBNext DNA library preparation kit (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MS, USA) was followed by NovaSeq Illumina genome sequencing (Novogene) (; accessed on 7 April 2021). All reads were quality-checked, and adapters were trimmed by Novogene's in-house custom software (v1.0). Sequences were then checked for contamination using Kraken 2 with default parameters and the author-provided \"Standard\" database. All reads were used to assemble the genome de novo, irrespective of Kraken's taxonomy assignment. ABySS v2.1.5 (k-value = 96) was used to assemble the genome. RagTag v1.1.0 was used to perform MBO AF2122/97 (GenBank accession number LT708304) reference-based assembly correction followed by scaffolding. QUAST v5.0.2 was used to analyze scaffolds and generate Circos plots and Icarus views (Figure 4 and Figure 5:Circos-Images). Uninformative contigs (<200 bp) were removed before submission to the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) v5.1. The draft genome was submitted to both PATRIC and NCBI.\n\n    MBO Ravenel's genomic comparisons were performed against the reference strain MBO AF2122/97, MBO 95-1315 (isolated from deer, PATRIC ID 1765.15), and MBO 10-7428 (isolated from cattle). MBO 10-7428 was submitted to Novogene for resequencing as described above, assembled as a draft genome (PATRIC ID 1765.618; GenBank: JAGEUC000000000.1), and used for comparative genomics and SNP extraction. Snippy was used with default parameters (variant site coverage >= 10 reads, VCF call quality = 100, read mapping quality >= 60, base quality >= 13) to call polymorphisms and indels from paired-end reads from MBO Ravenel (SRR13938830), MBO 10-7428 (SRR13938829) and MBO 95-1315 using MBO AF2122/97 as the reference. The snippy-core script extracted polymorphisms at all positions with sufficient coverage for base calling from all four genomes. Those not unique to MBO Ravenel were removed from the analysis. Indels were placed into a separate data table. The SNPs that remained at this stage were unique to MBO Ravenel. Among these, only the missense mutations in genes with a putative function assigned were cross-checked against the annotated genome on PATRIC.\n\n    RD-Analyzer was used to identify in silico regions of difference for MBO Ravenel when compared against MBO AF2122/97 using raw reads of the available genome. To check for deletions outside of characterized RDs, contigs for MBO Ravenel and the genomic .fasta sequence for MBO AF2122/97 were annotated using prokka [; accessed on 10 January 2021], and output .gff files analyzed by GenAPI [; accessed on 11 November 2020] with default settings. Further validation of gene absence in silico was performed using NCBI's BLAST [; accessed on 12 November 2020].",
        "Results": "    In an initial study with cattle (n = 3), aerosol MBO Ravenel (~105 CFU) elicited immune responses (i.e., DTH and IFN-gamma) to MBO antigens (Figure 1); yet, 2.5 months after challenge, tuberculous lesions were not detectable in two animals, and a single small granuloma was detected in the lung of the third animal.\n\n    To confirm this finding, an immunopathogenesis study was performed to directly compare the virulence of MBO strain Ravenel (n = 5) to that of MBO strain 95-1315 (n = 5), a strain of consistent virulence in cattle. Significant IFN-gamma responses to rESAT-6/CFP10 (E:C) or MBO PPD were elicited by MBO infection (Figure 2), regardless of strain. IFN-gamma responses did not differ (p > 0.05) between the two challenge groups. Significant DTH responses to PPDs were also elicited by MBO infection (Figure 3). Responses to MBO PPD by MBO 95-1315 infected calves exceeded (p < 0.05) respective responses by MBO Ravenel infected calves.\n\n    Despite robust cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses, gross tuberculous lesions were not detectable in 4/5 MBO Ravenel-infected cattle (Table 1). As with the initial study, one MBO Ravenel-infected steer had a single small granuloma in the left caudal lung lobe. In contrast, all 5 MBO 95-1315-infected cattle had granulomatous lesions in the lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes. Microscopic examination revealed no additional granulomas in the tissues collected.\n\n    In contrast to gross and microscopic pathology findings, MBO Ravenel was isolated from tissues of 4/5 cattle (Table 2). Tracheobronchial lymph nodes were the most common site for detectable MBO Ravenel colonization, despite no observable gross lesions in that anatomic site. As expected from prior studies, MBO 95-1315 was isolated from lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes from all five calves receiving this strain. Mean colonization of tracheobronchial lymph nodes in MBO 95-1315-infected calves exceeded that of MBO Ravenel-infected calves.\n\n    The MBO Ravenel genome has been assembled and deposited in publicly accessible databases (GenBank: JAGEUB000000000.1; PATRIC: 1765.617). The sequencing yielded 9,074,522 spots (2 x 150 bp/spot). Draft assembly of the genome after removal of uninformative contigs (<200 bp) yielded 18 final contigs. The total length of the genome was 4,377,551 bp, with a GC percentage of 65.6%. The length of the longest contig (N50) was 4,371,545 bp with a coverage of 625.8x. The NCBI-based Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) identified 4058 coding sequences (CDSs), 3 rRNAs, 45 tRNAs, 3 noncoding RNAs, and 192 pseudogenes.\n\n    Comparisons between strains AF2122/97, 10-7428, Ravenel, and 95-1315 revealed no large-scale deletions in the Ravenel genome compared to the AF2122/97 genome. A total of 974 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted from the three strains against the AF2122/97 reference. Out of 974 SNPs in the set, 173 were present in and unique to MBO Ravenel. Of these, 95 were missense, and 54/95 missense mutations were in genes with a putative function assigned. Regions of the genome assembly flagged by QUAST as having potential for any degree of mis-assembly were excluded, leaving a subset of 32 highest-confidence SNPs (Figure 4 and Figure 5, and Ravenel Supplementary Table S1). Nine highest-confidence SNPs were within \"specialty genes\" (a PATRIC-defined category of essential genes, virulence factors, AMR-associated genes, and others) in the functionally annotated genome available on PATRIC (1765.617) (Table 3). These nine SNPs were cross-checked in Mycobrowser for their functional categorization. Two functional categories were identified: (i) cell wall and cell processes (espH, mmpL8, aftB, eccC5, rpfB), and (ii) respiration or lipid metabolism (mycP1, pks5, fadD29, fadE29).\n\n    Region of difference (RD) analysis of MBO Ravenel revealed that RD9, RD4, RD7, RD8, RD10, RD11, and RD12 were absent (classic MBO type). GenAPI reported seven total genes absent in MBO Ravenel and present in MBO AF2122/97, five of which fall into PE/PPE family proteins and may be false negatives due to the inherent difficulties in Illumina sequencing these regions, one prokka false positive for a short hypothetical protein not annotated by PGAP in the reference, and one showing a loss of the LuxR-family transcriptional regulator Mb2515c. This latter deletion was checked with 14,000 nt of sequence, including Mb2515c and flanking regions from MBO AF2122/97, and performing a blastn search against MBO Ravenel SRA reads (SRR13938830), which recapitulated the GenAPI findings showing no reads aligning over the Mb2515c gene and some flanking regions and suggests a deletion may have occurred.",
        "Conclusion": "    We aimed to compare the in vivo virulence of MBO Ravenel to MBO 95-1315 in the original bovine host and discover the pathways impacted by mutations across the MBO Ravenel genome. Cattle infection experiments supported previously identified differences in MBO Ravenel pathology in the bovine host. Detection of robust immune responses across animals, despite the absence of gross lesions, also supports the Ravenel strain's deficiency in pathogenesis, causing only subclinical infection in contrast to the observed virulence from MBO 95-1315. The stringent set of identified highest-confidence missense polymorphisms in key genes involved with survival and pathogenesis of MBO provides a realistic genetic basis for attenuation. Which of these changes lead to functional impacts, if any, still requires elucidation. In summary, we confirm MBO Ravenel is attenuated and presents subclinically in the bovine host despite its broad genomic structural similarities to fully virulent MBO strains. A constellation of polymorphisms in key genes may instead explain its striking differences in disease phenotype when compared to virulent MBO 95-1315.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    Experimental and clinical studies referred to earlier show that MBO Ravenel is attenuated and elicits a robust immune response in cattle. Several genome-wide SNP studies in M. tuberculosis have shown to have sufficient resolution to develop trait-allele interactions. In the present study, we hypothesized that drivers of attenuation are enciphered in the genome of MBO Ravenel and performed comparative genomic analysis of Ravenel against three clinical MBO strains:95-1315, 10-7428, and AF2122/97. Disease phenotype was assessed by experimental infections with either Ravenel or 95-1315.\n\n    The present study utilized genomes of these select clinical strains to draw comparisons against the attenuated strain MBO Ravenel. This led to the identification of 32 highest confidence MBO Ravenel-specific missense SNPs, visualized by affected locus and position across the genome in Figure 5. Among these, a subset of 9 SNPs was selected based on functional annotation of impacted loci. These SNPs may contribute to reduced virulence and an attenuated phenotype as they affect cell wall synthesis- and transport-associated genes, pathways critical for the metabolism and intracellular survival of the pathogen.\n\n    Experimental calf infection with Ravenel or 95-1315 revealed that the former strain did not produce granulomata but was isolated from lymph nodes. The animals used in this study were older than the ones referenced earlier. However, the low virulence of this strain in cattle was still surprising, given the high virulence of M. bovis Ravenel in mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs. Furthermore, comparative immunopathogenesis revealed significant IFN-gamma responses to rESAT-6/CFP10 or M. bovis PPD were elicited by M. bovis infection, regardless of the strain used. These findings are consistent with the observations of Khare et al., who demonstrated similar attenuation of Ravenel in a vaccination challenge trial. Taken together, our findings confirm that Ravenel is attenuated in the bovine host deserving a deeper explanation for the observed phenotype.\n\n    In contrast to the present study, Khare et al. observed microscopic granulomas in tonsils from 7 of 10 Ravenel-infected cattle. This may be due to the intranasal route of inoculation used rather than the aerosol route of inoculation used in our study. Aerosolization of two different strains of M. bovis, using doses similar to those presented here, also failed to induce lesions or result in the colonization of tonsils. In the present study, microscopic granulomas were not observed in the lungs of Ravenel-infected cattle, in contrast to those described by Khare et al. This may also be due to a difference in the route of inoculation, or differences in the number of passages of inoculum strains.\n\n    The mycobacterial membrane protein [large] (mmpL) genes encode a broad family of transmembrane-transport proteins believed to be involved in fatty acid transportation by performing the function of flippases. These housekeeping genes are essential for survival. Members of this family, such as MmpL3, have thus been proposed as a druggable target, and research into small molecule inhibitors has yielded mycobactericidal compounds. Williams et al. reported a list of mutations in the mmpL3-mutant strains, of which none were identifiable in MBO Ravenel. Instead, MBO Ravenel had missense mutation G2662A (V888I) in mmpL8. Unlike mmpL3's role in mycobacteria survival, evidence is limited for mmpL8 specifically. Nonetheless, being from the same family of proteins mutation in mmpL8 might affect the transportation of pathogenesis-associated compounds.\n\n    Members of the MTBC possess unique Type VII secretion systems (ESX systems). These secretion systems contribute to virulence (ESX-1, -3, -5), nutrient uptake (ESX-5), metal homeostasis (ESX-3), and the export of PE/PPE family proteins (ESX-5). Disruption of these systems is associated with attenuation. In MBO Ravenel's ESX-5 system, we identified the polymorphism C1530T (T507M) in eccC5. The ATPase encoded by eccC5 has three nucleotide-binding domains hypothesized to be essential for substrate recognition. Ates et al. demonstrated that NBD mutations impaired bacterial growth. The mutation in MBO Ravenel's eccC5 (T507M) falls directly adjacent to NBD-1 (K506), which may destabilize the binding and function of this virulence-associated system. MBO Ravenel also has mutation G307A (A103T) in espH, a gene associated with the ESX-1 virulence system.\n\n    The biosynthesis of arabinogalactan by aftB is fundamental for the mycobacterial cell wall. Raad et al. developed a Corynebacterium glutamicum DeltaaftB mutant that caused outer membrane destabilization. Jankute et al. demonstrated similar results in M. smegmatis. Ravenel carries a mutation in aftB C1450T (H484Y), and whether this mutation results in deficient biosynthesis of arabinogalactan remains to be explored.\n\n    Encoded by rpfB, resuscitation promoting factor (RPF), cleaves peptidoglycan, employing E292 in its catalytic pocket. MBO Ravenel carries the rpfB polymorphism A788G (E263G) that, while outside Squeglia et al.'s observed catalytic region, may conformationally affect the downstream pocket by replacement of a charged amino acid with a flexible glycine residue.\n\n    Lipids are the primary carbon source for mycobacteria. The fadD and fadE families of genes are involved in long-chain fatty acid synthesis in mycobacteria, encoding ligase, synthetase, and dehydrogenase. The enzyme encoded by fadD29 converts long-chain fatty acids to the acyl adenylates required for phenol glycolipid (PGL) production, which in turn is required for the synthesis of the outer membrane of MTB. In the present study, MBO Ravenel carried a mutation in fadD29 A692G (N231S). PGL synthesis is required for mycobacterial viability, so missense changes warrant scrutiny. MTB relies on host cholesterol import for carbon supply and survival during chronic infection through fadE29. Knockout studies by Thomas et al., and Gilbert et al., determined that fadE28 and fadE29 are essential for degrading cholesterol metabolites. MBO Ravenel fadE29 has missense mutation T1079G (V360G). The downstream effects of missense mutations in both fadE29 and fadD29 may contribute to alterations in bacterial viability.\n\n    Polyketide synthase 5, encoded by pks5, has been identified as a virulence-associated biomarker of MTBC infection in cattle. The product of pks5 is thought to be involved in multimethyl-branched fatty acid synthesis required for lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis. Loss of pks5 leads to severe MTB growth defects in animal models. In MBO Ravenel, we observed a G1363A mutation (G455S) in pks5, though any effects on function require experimental testing.\n\n    The serine protease mycosin (MycP1) is a conserved membrane component of ESX-1 and ESX-5 systems. Ohol et al. (2010) found that inhibiting MycP1 protease activity leads to increased ESX-1 substrate secretion. C374T (T125I) in mycP1 is, therefore, another SNP of interest in MBO Ravenel, as the destabilization of this protease is known to lead to dysregulation of the tightly controlled ESX-1 machinery. Considering that ESX-1-containing RD-1 is believed to be a major contributor to the substantial attenuation of MBO BCG, any disruption of this system by alternate means could explain virulence deficiencies despite RD-1's presence.\n\n    Out of 32 genes with functional annotations containing missense mutations unique to MBO Ravenel, nine involved in cell wall integrity and critical metabolism have been described here. A single mutation could not reasonably explain the experimental attenuation observed in MBO Ravenel compared to fully virulent strains. However, the cumulative effect of many SNPs across the genome may have contributed to the impairment of pathogenesis. Only a subset of the observed SNPs has been discussed here, and with our stringent cutoffs and filtering, some informative changes may not be included in our analysis. The remaining 23 MBO Ravenel-specific missense mutations, as well as those in loci without annotated function or those in intergenic regions, likely also play some role. While not discussed here, insertions and deletions can have profound effects on gene function, and a table of 57 called indels is provided (Supplemental Table S1). Additionally, a GenAPI comparison of MBO Af2122/97 and MBO Ravenel suggested a genomic deletion and complete loss of Mb2515c, a predicted LuxR transcriptional regulator in MTB thought to contribute to pathogenesis through unknown mechanisms.",

        "Title": "    Clinical Heterogeneity of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Type 13",
        "Abstract": "    In this study, we describe a 54-year-old Indian woman who presented with clinical features of Kufs syndrome A (KSA) and Kufs syndrome B (KSB), as well as neuropathologic and genetic findings consistent with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 13 (CLN13). Subsequently, we review the clinicopathologic features of 20 patients with CLN13 reported in the literature.\n\n    Data and imaging were obtained from the patient's medical records. The patient was examined neuropathologically, and next-generation sequencing was performed.\n\n    Clinical radiologic scans revealed bilateral cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, a thin corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermian atrophy. Pathologic examination was remarkable for NCL. Postmortem genetic testing revealed a homozygous cathepsin F (CTSF) indel variant. A review of 20 reported CLN13 patients revealed novel clinical subtypes, including KSB type I (KSB-I), KSB type II (KSB-II), and Kufs syndrome C (KSC).\n\n    CLN13 was clinically heterogeneous. Most patients with CLN13 (14/20) did not present with classic KSB (KSB-I). Instead, 6 patients presented with KSB-II, 4 patients presented with KSC (including the present patient), and 3 patients presented with dementia. Our results expand the CLN13 clinical spectrum and emphasize the importance of screening CTSF variants in clinical dementia and movement disorder cohorts.",
        "Introduction": "    Kufs disease (KD) is difficult to detect clinically and encompasses adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL) lacking retinal impairment. Clinically, patients with KD were classically dichotomized by those presenting with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (KSA) and those presenting with dementia and motor disturbances (KSB). These clinical differentiations were subsequently bolstered by the identification of pathogenic DNAJC5 and CLN6 variants in predominantly KSA-presenting families and biallelic cathepsin-F (CTSF) variants in predominantly KSB-presenting families.,e1\n\n    Despite this, CLN6 variants have recently been associated with KSB and progressive myoclonic ataxia, and early cognitive, behavioral/neuropsychiatric, and/or movement disturbances preceding seizure onset have been noted in up to 25% of CLN6 carriers. Concurrent reports associating biallelic CTSF variants with juvenile-onset disorders, KSA, and early-onset dementia have suggested that CLN13 phenotypes may be heterogeneous; however, the clinical spectrum of CLN13 has not been reviewed systematically.,e3 In this study, we describe mixed clinical features of KSA and KSB in an Indian patient who had autopsy-confirmed NCL and was homozygous for a CTSF indel. Then, we systematically review the clinicopathologic features of 19 additional patients reported in the literature with biallelic CTSF variants.",
        "Methods": "    A 54-year-old woman of Indian descent presented at age 27 with EEG-confirmed tonic-clonic seizures and right head turning. The patient developed without issues and completed 2 master's degrees before symptom onset. Ten years from onset, she developed depression, social anxiety, and tested in the first percentile for executive control, word retrieval, memory, and verbal learning. Eleven years from onset, the patient developed left hemifacial spasms affecting the mouth and lips confirmed with electrophysiology. Neurologic examination revealed hypomimia, perseverations, ideomotor apraxia, dysarthria, horizontal saccadic breakdown, pronator drift, and hyperactive triceps. There were left upper extremity-predominant movement disturbances including intermittent resting and action hand tremors, chorea, paratonia, myoclonic jerks, slowing of rapid alternating movements, dysmetria, and decreased arm swing. Twelve years from onset, she developed right-sided torticollis. Twenty-two years from onset, the patient developed frontal release signs, dysphagia, falls, right hand and foot dystonia, right upper extremity tremulousness, gait freezing, and festination and was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Family history included a maternal grandmother with late dementia and a distant paternal relative with schizophrenia (Figure 1C). Clinical genetic testing ruled out Huntington disease, Wilson disease, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy.\n\n    Gross examination of the left hemibrain revealed frontal cortex atrophy, a diffusely thinned corpus callosum, and enlarged ventricles (Figure 2). Microscopically, neurons and neurites throughout all cortices and the cerebellum had excessive diastase-resistant lipofuscin that was autofluorescent and immunoreactive with markers of lipofuscin (anti-HDFGL1) and early lysosomes (anti-LAMP1). Phosphorylated-tau (AT8) immunostains revealed a mild but widespread tau pathology affecting neurons, glia, and cell processes. Immunostains for other protein aggregates were negative. Postmortem genetic testing performed on DNA extracted from frozen brain revealed a homozygous CTSF indel variant (c.993_1004delinsTGCCTACT, p.K331Nfs*14).\n\n    We sought to better understand the clinical spectrum of CLN13 by reviewing the literature for individuals reported with biallelic CTSF variants and adequate clinical information, including the clinical presentation and age at onset, age at time of report, and an outline of the clinical course. 20 patients with CLN13 from 12 families (including the present patient) were selected for review (Table).\n\n    The mean age at onset was 34 years, and 14 of 20 patients were female. The earliest presentation was at age 11 (P16), and the latest presentation was at age 66 with tonic-clonic seizure (P6). All patients with CLN13 ultimately developed cognitive impairment/dementia. Epilepsy was reported in 50% of patients, and 6 patients presented initially with seizures without cognitive impairment. Three of these patients were from the same family (P6-P8). All patients who presented with facial dyskinesia had initial onset of seizures. The most frequent motor disturbances were tremors, extrapyramidal signs, and dysarthria (each 9/20).\n\n    Zero patients presented with KSA, defined as progressive myoclonus epilepsy, neuropsychiatric change, cerebellar dysfunction, and late dementia with rare facial dyskinesias and pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs. Only 6 patients (P11, P13-P15, P17, P19) presented with classical features of KSB, which we designated as KSB type I (KSB-I), defined as dementia with behavioral, neuropsychiatric, and movement disturbances without facial dyskinesia or seizures. Additional 6 patients (P1-P4, P7, P18) presented with early seizures and features of classic KSB without myoclonus, which we classified as KSB type II (KSB-II). Four patients (P5, P6, P10, P20) presented with features of KSA and KSB and were classified as Kufs syndrome C (KSC), characterized by the presence of myoclonus epilepsy, dementia with movement disturbance, and rare facial dyskinesias. The remaining 3 patients (P8, P9, P12) presented with early-onset dementia, with behavioral disturbance noted in P8 and P12. Three patients (P11-P13) had unspecified motor speech problems and/or akinetic mutism, but it was not possible to attribute these signs to cerebellar or higher cortical dysfunction, given the available clinical information.\n\n    Most CTSF variants were identified clinically, and NCL pathology was confirmed in 3 patients by autopsy and one patient by brain biopsy. Seven patients received skin biopsies, which were negative/nonspecific in 3 patients, while granular osmiophilic deposits in lipopigments were observed in the remaining 4 patients.",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We describe a 54-year-old Indian woman who presented with features of KSC and confirm the neuropathologic diagnosis of CLN13 disease by identifying a biallelic CTSF indel variant. In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinicopathologic features of 19 additional patients with CLN13 reported in the literature.\n\n    In this review, we broadened the range of symptomatic onset in CLN13 to include juvenile-onset (6-15 years) and late adult-onset (>65 years). We also found that roughly twice as many female patients as male patients were reported with CLN13. Sex differences have been observed in other NCL diseases and NCL animal models. Damaging biallelic CTSF were first identified in predominantly KSB-presenting familiese1; however, we found that CLN13 phenotypes were heterogeneous, and most did not present with classic KSB (KSB-I). Surprisingly, half of the patients with CLN13 had epilepsy and 8 did not present with KSA or KSB, including 4 with KSC, 3 with early-onset dementia, and one with juvenile-onset retinal disturbance and cognitive impairment. CLN13 presentations varied between related and unrelated individuals with the same CTSF variants. Our patient and P18 were homozygous for the same CTSF indel but presented with KSB and KSC, respectively. While our patient was Indian and P18 was reported in India, further studies are necessary to better understand the prevalence of the CTSF indel in India.\n\n    Detecting ANCL clinically remains challenging, and skin biopsies proved unreliable in detecting CLN13 in 7 patients. Furthermore, CLN13 was confirmed by brain autopsy in just 3 patients. Therefore, we cannot determine whether CLN13 pathologic variability or other pathologies might explain the clinical heterogeneity in CLN13. Indeed, in a similar disorder, Gaucher disease, atypical clinical presentations have been associated with atypical pathologic features.\n\n    Because most patients with CLN13 were living when reported and CLN13 clinical presentations may evolve throughout the disease course, as we showed in our patient, our clinical observations may be limited. Previous detection of CTSF variants in clinical dementia cohorts has emphasized screening for CTSF variants in clinical settings. Improved detection of CLN13 may benefit from increased recognition of atypical clinical syndromes in CLN13. It is known that these syndromes overlap considerably (e.g., KSA and KSB), and continued examination of CLN13 is necessary to validate the value of these clinical findings.",

        "Title": "    Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous ASPH frameshift variant causing Traboulsi syndrome in a Chinese family",
        "Abstract": "    Traboulsi syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by ectopia lentis and facial dysmorphism (large beaked nose), which was only reported in 18 individuals to date. It is caused by homozygous/compound heterozygous variants in the aspartate/asparagine-beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) gene, which hydroxylates the aspartic acid and asparagine in epidermal growth factor-like domains of various proteins.\n\n    Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the disease-causing gene of the patient in a consanguineous Chinese family. Domain analysis was applied to predict the impact of the variant on ASPH protein.\n\n    Through exome and Sanger sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous ASPH variant (NM_004318.4:c.1910del/NP_004309.2: p.(Asn637MetfsTer15)) in the patient, which may lead to blockage of the ASPH function through truncating the AspH oxygenase domain of the ASPH protein and/or nonsense-mediated decay of the ASPH transcript. This is the first report of Traboulsi syndrome in a Chinese patient who was combined with ventricular septal defect, lung bullae, and recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax.\n\n    Our results revealed the clinical characteristics of the first Chinese patient with Traboulsi syndrome. Additionally, our study expands the mutational spectrum of Traboulsi syndrome and provides information for clinical genetic counseling to this family.\n\n    This is the first report of Traboulsi syndrome in a Chinses patient who was combined with recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax and ventricular septal defect. Our results revealed the clinical characteristics of the first Chinese patient with Traboulsi syndrome.",
        "Introduction": "    Traboulsi syndrome (OMIM 601552), also known as FDLAB syndrome (Patel et al., 2014), is a rare syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism, lens dislocation, anterior-segment abnormalities, and spontaneous filtering blebs. It was first reported by Traboulsi and his colleagues in a multiplex consanguineous family from the Druze sect in Lebanon in 1995 (Shawaf et al., 1995). Two other unrelated Lebanese families were subsequently reported (Haddad et al., 2001; Mansour et al., 2013), and this syndrome was considered enriched in the Druze Lebanese population. Until 2014, Traboulsi and his colleagues undertook autozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in a Saudi female and two patients from previously reported Lebanese families, and they identified aspartate/asparagine-beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) as the disease-causing gene. In their study, the enzymatic function of ASPH was severely impaired by a truncating mutation (p.Ser589Glufs*18) in one patient and a missense (p.Arg735Trp) mutation in another two patients (Patel et al., 2014). ASPH (NCBI ID: 444) encodes aspartate/asparagine-beta-hydroxylase (ASPH), which has been found to hydroxylate specific asparagine- and aspartate-residues in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-domain containing proteins, and it was reported to have a developmental role in the craniofacial region of engineered knockout mice model (Dinchuk et al., 2002). Eighteen cases of Traboulsi syndrome have been reported in Peru, India, Australia, and the United Kingdom (Abarca Barriga et al., 2018; Chandran et al., 2019; Haddad et al., 2001; Kulkarni et al., 2019; Mansour et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014; Shanmugam et al., 2020; Shawaf et al., 1995; Siggs et al., 2019).\n\n    In this study, we performed whole-exome and Sanger sequencing and identified a novel variant of ASPH in a patient who was born to consanguineous Chinese parents. He was finally diagnosed with Traboulsi syndrome. The patient was characterized by ectopia lentis, ventricular septal defect, lung bullae, and recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax while other family members were unaffected. He was previously misdiagnosed with Marfan syndrome due to the coexistence of lens dislocation (both eyes), tall stature, and thin body habitus. Our study expands the mutational spectrum of Traboulsi syndrome and provides information for clinical genetic counseling to this family.",
        "Methods": "    This study was approved by the Review Board of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in China in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki. A Han Chinese consanguineous family participated in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n    Peripheral blood samples (3-5 ml) from the proband (34-year-old, male) and his brother (37-year-old, unaffected) were obtained with informed consent, respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    Whole-exome capture and high-throughput sequencing were performed by the Novogene Bioinformatics Institute (Beijing, China). Briefly, Genomic DNA was randomly fragmented to 180-280 bp using Covaris technology, and then, added adaptor at both ends of the fragments after end-repairing and A-tailing. The pooled DNA library was hybridized for exome capture by the Agilent SureSelect Human All ExonV6 Kit (Agilent). After polymerase chain reaction amplification, DNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system. The sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome (UCSC hg19; http://genome.ucsc.edu) using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool. Duplicate reads were removed using Picard, and variant calling and annotation were carried out using SAMtools and ANNOVAR.\n\n    Sanger sequencing was used to validate the candidate variants identified by whole-exome sequencing, and segregation analyses were performed in the family members. Primer pairs were designed using an online tool (PrimerQuest, IDT, https://eu.idtdna.com/pages/tools/primerquest). The primer sequences were designed as follows: forward, 5'-GTCACTACCTATTGGAGCAAGAC-3'; reverse, 5'-GGCCAAAGGAAACAACCATTT-3'. PCR products were sequenced by the ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applera Corporation) using the ABI PRISM Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing v.3.1 Ready Reaction Kit.",
        "Results": "    A 34-year-old Chinese male (II-1) went to the emergency department of the Second Xiangya Hospital with a 3-month history of recurrent shortness of breath that had been aggravated for 5 days without any identifiable trigger. The patient was a lean tall man, he was 186.0 cm tall and weighed 59.0 kg (body mass index 17.05 kg/m2). He had been clinically diagnosed with Marfan syndrome because of ectopia lentis (both eyes), tall stature, and thin body habitus 15 years ago. He was high myopia without other reported ocular defects, such as spontaneous filtering blebs, iris atrophy, retinal detachment, shallow anterior chambers, or closed iridocorneal angles. The lensectomy was performed for ectopia lentis in both eyes within 1 year after the initial diagnosis. After a comprehensive clinical assessment, we found the patient's parents are consanguineous (Figure 1a), which was inconsistent with the heredity mode of Marfan syndrome. His eyes were aphakic because the ectopic lenses had been removed 17 years ago (Figure 1b). Echocardiography indicated ventricular septal defect (Figure 1c), and pulmonary hypertension, but without aortic root complications such as aortic root dilatation or dissection which was necessary for clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in the absence of family history and genetic testing (Loeys et al., 2010). He had relatively short fingers without wrist sign or thumb sign, and the patient had an elongated face but without other specific features (Figure 1d). High-resolution chest computed tomography showed diffuse emphysema, multiple bilateral subpleural blebs, bullae, and left lung pneumothorax (Figure 1e). The bullae are predominately distributed in the bilateral upper lobes and left lower lobe (Figure S1). He also had a 10-year history of smoking (about seven cigarettes per day), which may be related to the pulmonary emphysema in the lung computed tomography. He was diagnosed with left lung recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, aphakic eye, and ventricular septal defect in admission. After the removal of pulmonary bulla, pleurodesis, and pleural closed drainage, the respiratory symptom was relieved. Histological examination of the surgical specimen (hematoxylin and eosin staining) showed the pulmonary alveoli dilated and fused into large capsular spaces, and pulmonary hemosiderosis was noticed in lung interstitial tissue (Figure 1f). One year later, secondary glaucoma and retinal detachment occurred in the right eye because the right eye was accidentally poked by a toothbrush. The patient recovered after vitrectomy and retinal laser photocoagulation of the right eye. No ocular, pulmonary, or cardiac defects were reported for the patient's parents, his brother, and his children.\n\n    Whole-exome sequencing generated 10.96 GB data for the proband and 10.54 GB data for his brother (Table S1). The coverage for the target region was 99.90%. After alignment to reference human genome and variant calling, a total of 33576 INDELs (insertion/deletions) and 235033 SNVs (single nucleotide variants) were detected.\n\n    The variant filtering process is illustrated in Figure 2a. Noncoding, intronic variants, and variants with a minor allele frequency of >1% in public data sets (1000 Genomes Project data set; NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project Exome Variant Server; ExAC, Exome Aggregation Consortium) or in-house database of Novogene were excluded. Because the disorder was inherited through consanguineous marriage. Homozygous variants that were in accord with the recessive mode of inheritance were retained. The deleteriousness of variants was further explored by SIFT (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg), MutationTaster (http://www.mutationtaster.org), Polyphen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), and CADD (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu, A score greater than 15 was consider damaging). Variants predicted to be benign in more than half of these algorithms were filtered.\n\n    After the filtering process, three INDELs and four SNVs were classified according to the guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG; Richards et al., 2015). Only one INDEL mutation was classified as pathogenic (Table 1).\n\n    This novel variant was predicted to result in a frameshift mutation at codon 637 in exon 23 and premature termination of ASPH. It was not found in the in-house database of Novogene, 1000 Genomes Project, ExAC, and gnomAD v2.1.1 data sets. Exome sequencing data indicated that this candidate disease-causing variant of ASPH was homozygous in the patient and heterozygous in his brother.\n\n    Sanger sequencing indicated that a novel frameshift homozygous mutation (NM_004318.4:c.1910del/ NP_004309.2: p.(Asn637MetfsTer15)) of ASPH cosegregated with the patient (II-1; Figure 2b). His brother (II-2) was unaffected, and Sanger sequencing showed he was heterozygous for this variant.\n\n    To delineate the influence of c.1910delA/ p.(Asn637MetfsTer15) for ASPH protein, we fetched the ASPH gene structure data from the Ensembl gene database (https://www.ensembl.org), protein domains information from the UniProtKB database (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/) and the literature (Pfeffer et al., 2019).\n\n    The transcript of ASPH (NM_004318.4) has 25 exons. Three SNVs (p.Arg735Gln, p.Arg735Trp, and p.Arg688Gln) are located in the AspH oxygenase domain and five frameshift variants that may truncate the AspH oxygenase domain have been reported to cause Traboulsi syndrome. Another SNV, p.Gly434Val is located to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain was reported to cause vesicoureteral reflux, but whether it could cause Traboulsi syndrome remained unknown because the lens subluxation of the patient may be related to hyperhomocysteinemia, and no further information was provided for this patient (Vivante et al., 2017). In our study, the variant is located at the exon 23, which impaired the enzymatic function of ASPH through truncating the AspH oxygenase domain and/or nonsense-mediated decay of the entire ASPH transcript (Figure 3).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we investigated the first Chinese consanguineous family with Traboulsi syndrome. The clinical manifestation of our patient included a nonspecific facial feature, ectopia lentis, left lung recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, and ventricular septal defect which was different from previously reported. A novel homozygous ASPH mutation (NM_004318.4:c.1910del/ NP_004309.2: p.(Asn637MetfsTer15)) was identified in our patient by whole-exome and Sanger sequencing.\n\n    Traboulsi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease with two prominent clinical manifestations, one is ectopia lentis, another is facial dysmorphism (large beaked nose; Abarca Barriga et al., 2018). In 2014, Traboulsi syndrome was found to be linked to ASPH, an enzyme that hydroxylates asparagine- and aspartate-residues on epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains of proteins (Patel et al., 2014). The facial dysmorphism was consistent with the phenotype of the engineered knockout mice model, which showed a shortened snout. In situ hybridization revealed stronger ASPH expression in the limbs, snout, and eyes of the healthy developing mouse embryos. However, the eyes were not examined in any ASPH knockout animal model (Dinchuk et al., 2002; Patel et al., 2014). No other organs were reported to be involved.\n\n    ASPH is a nonheme ferrous iron and 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. It is a large protein consisted of 758 amino acids, which contains a transmembrane domain, a Ca2+-binding site, a tetratricopeptide repeat, and an AspH oxygenase domain. ASPH can hydroxylate multiple proteins including coagulation factors (VII, IX, and X), protein C, complementation factors, thrombomodulin, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and Notch ligands (Loenarz & Schofield, 2011). All these proteins have a consensus motif (CX[DN]4X[FY]XCXC) in EGF-domain for asparagine- or aspartate-hydroxylation (Pfeffer et al., 2019). ASPH consensus hydroxylation motif was identified in several lenticular phenotypes associated genes such as latent transforming growth factor beta-binding protein-2 (LTBP2) and fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) which were essential in microfibril and ciliary zonule development (Siggs et al., 2019). However, the biological importance of ASPH-catalyzed hydroxylation in these proteins was undefined (Markolovic et al., 2015). Up to now, several ASPH variants have been reported to cause Traboulsi syndrome. All Traboulsi syndrome associated variants affected the AspH oxygenase domain that was essential for the substrates hydroxylation (Figure 3; Pfeffer et al., 2019). The variant p.Gly434Val is located to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain was reported to cause vesicoureteral reflux, and the AspH oxygenase domain was unaffected (Vivante et al., 2017). In our study, the variant is located in the 23rd exon of ASPH gene, which may truncate the AspH oxygenase domain and/or lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the ASPH transcript thus impaired the function of ASPH.\n\n    Our patient presented with ventricular septal defect, ectopia lentis in 19 year old, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax in 34 year old. His facial feature was not specific, and it was also reported in a patient with Traboulsi syndrome from a UK family, which may be related to a different ethnic background (Kulkarni et al., 2019). To diagnose Traboulsi syndrome in patients without typical facial features, differential diagnoses should include syndromes that cause ectopia lentis such as Marfan syndrome and isolated ectopia lentis. In our patient, Traboulsi syndrome was confirmed through exome and Sanger sequencing after excluded deleterious mutations related to ectopia lentis including ADAMTS10, ADAMTS17, ADAMTSL4, CBS, COL18A1, FBN1, LTBP2, PAX6, and VSX2 (Chandra & Charteris, 2014).\n\n    Marfan syndrome is a human autosomal dominant disease caused by loss-of-function variants in FBN1. The clinical features of Marfan syndrome include aortic root aneurysm/dissection, ectopia lentis, and findings in other organ systems such as skeleton, skin, and lungs (Loeys et al., 2010). In our study, ectopia lentis and spontaneous pneumothorax presented in our patient with Traboulsi syndrome are overlapped with Marfan syndrome. A previous study showed ASPH-mediated hydroxylation of FBN1/LTBP2 may be associated with ectopia lentis (Siggs et al., 2019). Furthermore, FBN1 can bound TGFbeta and prevent abnormal activation of TGFbeta signaling in lung, aorta, and skeletal muscle, which is possibly responsible for many Marfanoid features including pneumothorax (Neptune et al., 2003; Sakai et al., 2016). Although the role of FBN1 in Traboulsi syndrome was undefined, these studies suggested that the overlapped phenotypes may attribute to the molecular link between ASPH and FBN1.\n\n    However, it is noteworthy that whether ventricular septal defect and recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax are related to the ASPH mutation remained unknown, because only one patient was found in this consanguineous Chinese family. Furthermore, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax occurred in our patient may also be attributed to his smoking history and low body mass index (Tschopp et al., 2015). Additional investigation is warranted to explore the mechanism underlying Traboulsi syndrome and to determine the phenotypic spectrum of Traboulsi syndrome in different ethnic people and in animal models.\n\n    In conclusion, we presented the clinical characteristics of a patient from a consanguineous Chinese family with ventricular septal defect, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, and ectopia lentis. By using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, a novel mutation in ASPH associated with Traboulsi syndrome was identified. Sequence analysis indicated that this novel variant may truncate the AspH oxygenase domain and/or lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the ASPH transcript. This is the first report of Traboulsi syndrome in a Chinese patient, and our study expands the spectrum of ASPH variants and provides information for clinical genetic counseling to this family.",

        "Title": "    Germline and Somatic Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies New Candidate Genes Involved in Familial Predisposition to Serrated Polyposis Syndrome",
        "Abstract": "    Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is characterized by the presence of serrated lesions in the colon and a higher colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. An important part of risk is due to the alteration of certain genes, which will be transmitted from one generation to another in the same family. Our main objective was to identify alterations of the human genome relevant to the hereditary predisposition to SPS, by focusing on families with several cases of this disease (familial SPS) and by using massive sequencing techniques to decode the genome. Our strategy allowed us to suggest the implication of 14 new genes in SPS predisposition. Identifying the inherited genetic factors involved in SPS can be useful to identify those families with medium-high CRC risk and, therefore, implement more targeted, intensive preventive measures for this group of patients.\n\n    The serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is the most common and yet underdiagnosed colorectal polyposis syndrome. It is characterized by multiple and/or large colonic serrated polyps and a higher associated risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). The main objective of this study was to identify new candidate genes involved in the germline predisposition to SPS/CRC. Thirty-nine SPS patients from 16 families (>=2 patients per family) were recruited without alterations in well-known hereditary CRC genes, and germline and somatic whole-exome sequencing were performed. Germline rare variants with plausible pathogenicity, located in genes involved in cancer development, senescence and epigenetic regulation were selected. Somatic mutational profiling and signature analysis was pursued in one sample per family, when possible. After data filtering, ANXA10, ASXL1, CFTR, DOT1L, HIC1, INO80, KLF3, MCM3AP, MCM8, PDLIM2, POLD1, TP53BP1, WNK2 and WRN were highlighted as the more promising candidate genes for SPS germline predisposition with potentially pathogenic variants shared within families. Somatic analysis characterized mutational profiles in advanced serrated polyps/tumors, revealing a high proportion of hypermutated samples, with a prevalence of clock-like mutational signatures in most samples and the presence of DNA mismatch repair-defective signatures in some cases. In conclusion, we identified new candidate genes to be involved in familial SPS. Further functional studies and replication in additional cohorts are required to confirm the selected candidates.",
        "Introduction": "    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with a significant associated mortality. Aside from lung cancer, with an avoidable environmental cause, CRC is responsible for more deaths than any other malignancy in Western countries. In Europe, CRC represents the second leading cancer type both in incidence and mortality, when considering both genders.\n\n    A vast majority of CRC cases develop from non-malignant precursor adenomas. In recent years, serrated polyps have been identified as another type of precancerous lesions. They were considered indolent until the discovery of the serrated pathway, which is currently known to be involved in up to 30% of CRC cases.\n\n    at least 5 serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon with two or more of these being >10 mm,\n\n    any number of serrated polyps proximal to the sigmoid colon in an individual who has a first-degree relative with serrated polyposis,\n\n    >20 serrated polyps of any size, but distributed throughout the colon.\n\n    Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) is a recent clinical condition characterized by the colonic presence of multiple and/or large serrated polyps, as well as higher CRC risk. In SPS, polyps show characteristics that make them different from sporadic serrated polyps, such as a higher proportion of alterations in KRAS and BRAF. There is no gender predominance for SPS and the age at diagnosis is 50-60 years. Although its real prevalence is unknown, it could be higher than expected according to data from CRC screening programs. It is also probably under-recognized in the medical community due to the more difficult endoscopic detection of serrated polyps (small size and flat morphology). Therefore, the following criteria were initially established by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help to identify this clinical entity:\n\n    This initial arbitrary definition, recently updated to include also distal serrated polyps and not include the second criterion, is not based in any genetic alteration and has been considered by some means restrictive, leading to the under-diagnosis of SPS. Besides, this syndrome surely represents a disease spectrum with a high degree of heterogeneity.\n\n    As for other complex diseases, SPS etiology involves genetic and environmental factors. In contrast to conventional adenomas, older age and male sex are not strong risk factors. Risk does not appear to increase substantially in patients over 50 years old, and men and women have roughly equivalent risk. Among modifiable risk factors, as is the case for CRC, smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity seems to be the more relevant factors linked to a higher SPS risk.\n\n    In some cases, SPS presents a certain degree of familial aggregation, suggesting the existence of germline predisposition to this disease. However, the hereditary basis of this disease is mostly unknown. Some of the common, low-penetrance CRC genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies could be involved in some SPS cases. Concerning rare, high-penetrance germline predisposition, only RNF43 has been proposed as a hereditary SPS gene with some controversy and most likely corresponds to a rare contributor. Other genes such as BMPR1A, SMAD4, PTEN, MUTYH or GREM1 involved in the gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, hereditary mixed polyposis and MUTYH-associated polyposis syndromes are not commonly altered in individuals with SPS.\n\n    Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has been one of the most common strategies to discover new genes associated to hereditary diseases in the last decade. In CRC research, it has been applied both to somatic and germline samples permitting a deeper understanding of this disease. Paired germline and somatic WES data can be used to identify new candidate predisposition genes affected by a two-hit inactivation. Also, somatic WES has enormous potential to expand our comprehension of the alterations occurring in tumors or precursor lesions, and it has been used to characterize the mutational burden and somatic mutational spectrum in polyposis and CRC.\n\n    Accordingly, with the aim of finding rare, high-penetrance germline variants involved in SPS predisposition, we performed germline and somatic WES in 16 families showing familial aggregation mainly compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.",
        "Methods": "    Thirty-nine SPS patients from 16 families with aggregation for this disease were selected in the study. MUTYH, APC and the DNA MMR genes were previously screened with negative results. Families were recruited on high-risk CRC clinics at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Hospital Donostia, Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Ourense, and Hospital Universitario de Mostoles in Spain. Patients were diagnosed with SPS based on the criteria recommended by the WHO. Recently, the diagnostic criteria were updated excluding criteria 2. However, this study used the 3 criteria-based diagnostics.\n\n    The whole cohort underwent germline WES and at least one individual per family had a somatic sample paired sequenced when possible, seeking for tumor samples (in SPS.7, SPS.11 and SPS.14) or the most advanced serrated lesion available in the rest of families. Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was performed to check MMR protein status in the tumor/somatic sample available for some families. Germline DNA samples were extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood kit (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA, USA), whereas tumor/somatic DNA samples were obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the QIAamp Tissue kit (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA, USA), in both cases following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    Sequencing raw data analysis and variant filtering was performed as previously described. Briefly, WES was performed using the HiSeq2000 Platform (Illumina, San Diego, USA) in both germline and tumor/somatic samples. For exon enrichment, the Sure SelectXT All Exon v5 kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for both cases. Library quality control was performed with Bioanalyzer 2000 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples were indexed with adapters containing different barcodes, allowing to be pooled and massive parallel sequenced using a paired-end 2 x 100 (germline) or 2 x 75 (somatic) base pair read length protocol.\n\n    The post sequencing quality control used the Real-Time Analysis software sequence pipeline (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) before data analysis. Mean coverage was >95x in all samples. Only regions with a coverage >10x were used for the following analyses. A good ratio of shared regions with high coverage (70%) was expected in good-quality somatic samples, whereas low-quality ones were characterized by a significant drop in this percentatge and excluded. Germline WES data was mapped to the human genome hg19/GRCh37 using Genome Multitool, whereas the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM algorithm) was used for somatic data. In both cases, PCR duplicates were processed using Picard (Broad Institute, Cambridge, USA;  (accessed on 10 June 2016)) and local indel realignment and base quality score recalibration were performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, Broad Institute, Cambridge, USA;  (accessed on 12 June 2020)).\n\n    Variant calling of SNVs and indels was performed with GATK tools (Genome Analyzer Toolkit) Haplotyple Caller for germline data or with MuTect2 for somatic data. An extra somatic variant caller, SMuFin ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), was also used in order to improve the confidence of somatic variant calling. Somatic variant calling was paired with the germline counterpart except for the tumor sample available in SPS.16, which was unpaired with the germline samples sequenced in that family. In this case, we performed an unpaired analysis using a pool of 110 germline WES samples available from our in-house cohort.\n\n    Copy number variation analysis of germline samples were performed as previously described. In summary, CoNIFER ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)) and ExomeDepth ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)) were used for CNV identification.\n\n    Variant annotation was carried out with SNPEff ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), which can predict functional effects (synonymous, nonsynonymous, frameshift and nonsense) and functional impacts (high, low, moderate, modifier) of genetic variants. Also, multiple databases were used to annotate data, including populational allele frequency databases such as dbSNP ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), 1000 Genomes Project ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), the Exome Variant Server ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), the Exome Aggregation Consortium ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), gnomAD ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)) and 100 whole genomes of Spanish Ancestry from Centre Nacional d'Analisi Genomica ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)). Annotation was complemented by SNPSift using the dbNSFP database using six pathogenicity predictor tools (PhyloP, SIFT, Polyphen, MutationTaster, GERP, LRT). Biological functions and pathways of the genes containing variants were also annotated with terms and previous bibliography according to NCBI Gene ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), Gene Ontology ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), KEGG ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)), and Reactome ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)).\n\n    It is important to highlight that in the variant prioritization strategy, an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern was mainly expected for the SPS analyzed families. However, both dominant and recessive variants were considered. It should be noted that no relevant autosomal recessive variants were detected, and therefore only heterozygous genetic variants were further selected. Also, only shared variants between all affected members sequenced in the family were considered. All previous annotated information was used to establish stringent criteria to select potentially pathogenic variants in a three-round filter selection. Firstly, candidate variants were filtered so that only variants with a MAF < 0.1% along with a nonsynonymous and/or with truncating effect were selected. In addition, it was required that missense variants fulfilled at least 3 pathogenic predictions with the bioinformatic tools used.\n\n    In a second phase of variant prioritization, a manual curation based on biological function was carried out, using as exclusion criteria if genes were previously involved in a non-cancer disease, a gene function non compatible with cancer predisposition, incomplete or vague information for gene function, incorrect segregation of the same variant in another SPS family of this study, and incorrect segregation of the same variant in our CRC cohort. In a third-round prioritization, genes with specific biological functions compatible with cancer development, senescence and methylation were prioritized since they were shown to be relevant for SPS.\n\n    Regarding the tumor data, additional filters as a minimum germline-somatic coverage of 10x and a minimum alternative allele frequency (AAF) in the tumor of 20% was required. Identified mutations in the most relevant cancer driver genes such as POLE/POLD1, MMR genes (MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2), BRAF and KRAS were analyzed in the individuals with somatic WES without using the AAF threshold of 20%.\n\n    Final candidate variants identified by WES were validated both using IGV (Integrative Genome Viewer;  (accessed on 12 June 2020)) followed by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics, Luxembourg, Germany).\n\n    Given the availability of germline and somatic data, the comparison between both data following the Knudson two-hit hypothesis was performed. Therefore, one of the strategies of this study was to search for genes with potentially pathogenic events compatible with a TSG model (SNV, indels or LOH) as previously described for CRC.\n\n    ALFRED (allelic loss featuring rare damaging) approach was used to test Knudson's two-hit hypothesis genome-wide, predicting the LOH of the wild-type allele in tumor/somatic samples.\n\n    In addition, the mutational aspects from somatic available samples from families (one sample per family) were analyzed in order to complement and support analysis of germline data, helping to shed light into the inherited predisposition in the family. Part of the analysis included evaluation of the mutational burden and mutational signatures using SigProfilerExtractor. The tumors/advanced serrated polyps were then classified as hypermutated (>10 mut/megabase) or ultra-hypermutated (>100 mut/megabase). In addition, more than 60 available COSMIC database mutational signatures ( (accessed on 12 June 2020)) were estimated for each somatic sample based on its mutational burden.",
        "Results": "    Sixteen families including 39 patients (>=2 patients per family) diagnosed with SPS fulfilling the 2010 WHO recruitment criteria were included in the study (Figure 1). Most families (13/16) included two patients per family, whereas SPS.9, SPS.10 and SPS.11 included three, four and six patients, respectively. A complete clinical characterization of the studied cohort is summarized in Table 1. It included 21 men and 18 women, with ages of diagnosis between 20-79 (mean age of diagnosis of 53.74 +- 12.13). All families had a positive cancer family history, except for SPS.8. Importantly, nine families had a positive family history for CRC.\n\n    Germline WES was performed for the entire SPS cohort including 39 samples, and a three-step prioritization workflow was carried out. The first phase consisted of variant filtering, based on variant impact (nonsynonymous, truncating), allele frequency (<0.1%) and pathogenicity prediction tools for missense variants (score > 3), identifying 393 variants in 363 genes, with an average of 24.5 variants per family. Since there was still a high number of candidate variants and genes, a second-round of prioritization based on manual curation of biological function was performed. A total of 71 variants in 69 genes with a mean of 4.5 variants per family remained (Supplementary Table S1). Finally, using more stringent filtering criteria based on compatible biological functions as epigenetic regulators, senescence and the previous involvement in cancer development, 12 candidate genes with potentially pathogenic genetic variants were selected, including ANXA10, ASXL1, CFTR, DOT1L, INO80, KLF3, MCM3AP, MCM8, POLD1, TP53BP1, WNK2 and WRN. No relevant copy number variants (CNV) were identified, therefore, only single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and insertion/deletion variants (indels) were considered for variant prioritization. Final candidate variants and genes were validated by manual inspection of sequencing data and Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure S1A).\n\n    Somatic WES was performed in at least one somatic sample per family, except for family SPS.10 with no available samples, and SPS.5 that did not pass quality control. In one family, the available somatic sample in the family was unpaired with the corresponding germline sample (SPS.16).\n\n    In order to identify genes that could comply with the Knudson two-hit hypothesis for tumor-suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation, an integration of paired germline and somatic WES data was carried out. Second mutational hits could be SNVs, indels, CNVs, loss of heterozygosis (LOH) or epigenetics events. In this work, SNVs, indels, CNVs and somatic LOH were analyzed.\n\n    Five genes in family SPS.7 contained possibly pathogenic SNVs in both germline and somatic DNA (Supplementary Table S2), and MCM3AP stood out among them. No other two-hit SNVs were identified in other families.\n\n    Following the same germline vs. somatic WES strategy, 29 germline variants in 27 genes were identified as being affected by a second-hit LOH in the paired somatic sample (Supplementary Table S3). Among them, there were two of the previously selected candidate genes by the germline WES-only strategy (CFTR, KLF3). After manual curation for biological functions involved in cancer development, both HIC1 (family SPS.14) and PDLIM2 (family SPS.7) were selected as final candidate genes and further validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure S1B).\n\n    Taking together all the different strategies to identify new candidate genes for SPS germline predisposition, including searching for potentially disruptive germline variants and germinal-tumor comparison, the final most promising candidate genes identified were ANXA10, ASXL1, CFTR, DOT1L, HIC1, INO80, KLF3, MCM3AP, MCM8, PDLIM2, POLD1, TP53BP1, WNK2 and WRN (Table 2).\n\n    Fourteen somatic WES samples were assessed in order to characterize the somatic mutational profile of the SPS cohort. Mutational signatures, tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor indel burden, and variants in cancer driver genes (BRAF, KRAS, POLE, POLD1 and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes) were analyzed for available samples.\n\n    The characterization of the mutational profile included the analysis of mutational signatures, which are unique combinations of mutational footprints on the tumor left by different mutational processes. Considering the single base substitutions (SBS) mutational signatures analyzed, SBS1 and SBS5 were the most represented throughout the cohort (Figure 2A). SBS1 and SBS5 are considered clock-like mutational signatures, as they correlate with age. This means that a higher mutation rate is observed within a later age of diagnosis. This process is considered to happen in a constant rate throughout life. Other SBS signatures were also present in somatic samples of patients, such as SBS15 and SBS21. They are two of the mutational signatures related to DNA MMR deficiency and were observed in the somatic samples of families SPS.2 and SPS.7, which was concordant with the MLH1-/PMS2- tumor status in SPS.7. SBS15 alone was also present in SPS.13 and SPS.14, though, in this case, it probably represents an overfitting of this signature for these samples, since there was only a small contribution of mutations to this signature (Figure 2A). Finally, SBS54 also appeared in SPS.7, and although usually indicates some germline sample contamination, it has a tendency to come out in samples with microsatellite instability (MSI), as it is the case.\n\n    Small insertion and deletion (ID) signatures were also considered for the cohort. ID1 and ID2 had the major contribution along the samples analyzed (Figure 2B). They are found in most cancer samples and are also aging-related, since they can correlate with age of diagnosis in non-hypermutated cancer samples. However, both signatures are often elevated in cancer samples with defective DNA MMR. Overall, clock-like mutational signatures were the major contributors in our cohort with some relevance also of the DNA MMR signatures in some samples. Regarding SPS.16, with an unpaired germline sample available, SBS and ID analysis revealed prevalence of aging signatures and also presence of a MMR-deficiency mutational signature. Again, the MMR defective signature was concordant with the MLH1-/PMS2- tumor status in SPS.16.\n\n    Regarding TMB, six samples showed a hypermutated profile (>10 mutations/Mb) (families SPS.2, SPS.3, SPS.7, SPS.8, SPS.11 and SPS.14), and one sample (family SPS.7) stood out as ultra-hypermutated (>100 mutations/Mb) (Figure 3A). The whole cohort had a mean of 17.57+-30.81 mutations/Mb. Among the hypermutated samples, SPS.2 was the one with the highest TMB (27.6 mutations/Mb) (Figure 3A). The unpaired tumor sample in SPS.16 also showed a hypermutated profile (89 mutations/Mb).\n\n    Interestingly, the same pattern was seen in the somatic indel burden analysis. We observed that in family SPS.7, the somatic profile was also ultra-hypermutated (100.6 indels/Mb) and that the second on the ranking was also from family SPS.2 (8.4 indels/Mb) (Figure 3B).\n\n    It is noteworthy that samples more hypermutated in the TMB or indel burden analysis (SPS.2, SPS.7, SPS.16) were the ones where MMR deficiency signatures were more evident. Also, ID1 and ID2 signatures, besides the clock-like behavior in non-hypermutated samples, were representative of MMR deficiency when the sample was hypermutated.\n\n    Cancer driver genes as BRAF and KRAS are usually found mutated in serrated polyps, along with MSI and CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). The analysis of somatic mutations by WES can be challenging, since the detection of variants depends on the tumor/somatic purity and is conditioned by intra-tissue heterogeneity. Considering this fact, alternative allele frequency (AAF) can vary to very low to more than 50% in case of homozygous variants. Therefore, a threshold of 20% AAF was established as a confidence value to determine somatic variants in this cohort.\n\n    Among the cancer driver genes analyzed, BRAF V600E was the most represented somatic mutation throughout the cohort (Figure 3C). This mutation was present in 4 out of 13 samples sequenced with AAF > 20% (families SPS.2, SPS.6, SPS.7 and SPS.15), but also present in other three samples with AAF < 20% (families SPS.1, SPS.3 and SPS.9) (Supplementary Table S4). On the other hand, only one KRAS (A146T) variant of unknown significance (VUS) was identified in the somatic profile of one patient in family SPS.14 (Supplementary Table S4).\n\n    Loss of MMR proteins such as MLH1 are mostly responsible for the MSI phenotype observed in serrated lesions. Somatic variants in MMR genes were the second most frequent, identified in six samples within the cohort (SPS.2, SPS.4, SPS.7, SPS.8, SPS.11 and SPS.14) in the MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1, and MLH3 genes (Figure 3C). Of them, one variant had AFF > 20% (MLH1 R687Q, in SPS.7) and the other variants showed a confidence value below 20% (Supplementary Table S4).\n\n    POLE and POLD1 encode for the catalytic subunits of polymerases epsilon and delta, respectively, involved in the DNA proofreading process. Mutations in these genes have been related to a hypermutator tumor phenotype. Only POLE variants with AAF < 20% were found in somatic samples from families SPS.3, SPS.7 and SPS.8. No somatic POLD1 variants were detected.\n\n    Hypermutated somatic profiles are mainly related to mutations in the MMR genes or POLE and POLD1, either in somatic or germline DNA. Interestingly, the ultra-hypermutated sample SPS.7 displayed the somatic R647Q MLH1 variant, possibly explaining part of the hypermutated profile of the tumor. On the other hand, a germline variant in POLD1 was also identified in this patient and segregated correctly in the family (Supplementary Table S1), being another possible explanation for the ultra-hypermutated somatic profile observed. Furthermore, SPS.7 harbored a somatic VUS in MLH1 and a likely pathogenic MSH2 mutation, possibly explaining the origin the mutational signatures SBS15 and SBS21 (Supplementary Table S4). Nevertheless, for family SPS.2, only somatic variants at very low AAF in MMR genes (MSH3 and MSH6) were identified (Supplementary Table S4).\n\n    All relevant mutations identified in BRAF, KRAS, POLE, POLD1 and MMR genes are described in Supplementary Table S4.",
        "Conclusion": "    The present study brings new insights to the high penetrance germline predisposition to SPS. Although its limitations (sample size, need for replication in independent cohorts and functional studies), an in-deep, integrative analysis was carried out using both germline and somatic sequencing data. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of SPS assessed by this manner. Since not predominant candidate germline alteration was detected, we can corroborate the genetic heterogeneity of this clinical entity. Also, since alterations in previous hereditary polyposis genes either with a dominant or recessive inheritance were not detected, it suggests a differentiated profile for it. Based on our integrated analysis, we suggest 14 genes as candidates to participate in the germline predisposition to SPS including ANXA10, ASXL1, CFTR, DOT1L, HIC1, INO80, KLF3, MCM3AP, MCM8, PDLIM2, POLD1, TP53BP1, WNK2 and WRN.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    SPS is a clinical condition with familial aggregation in some cases and an important risk for CRC. However, it is probably largely underdiagnosed, and the underlying germline causes are still mostly unknown. In order to identify new candidate genes for germline SPS predisposition, this study analyzed 39 SPS patients in 16 families that underwent germline and somatic WES. Following germline and paired germline-somatic analysis strategies, we suggest 14 new candidate genes to be associated with this condition including ANXA10, ASXL1, CFTR, DOT1L, HIC1, INO80, KLF3, MCM3AP, MCM8, PDLIM2, POLD1, TP53BP1, WNK2 and WRN.\n\n    Senescence plays an important role in tumor progression through the serrated pathway of CRC carcinogenesis. After oncogene activation of BRAF or KRAS, the proliferation of intestinal crypt cells is initially blocked by a senescence-associated growth arrest. However, hypermethylation of p16 and IGFBP7 promoters leads to the surpassing of this senescence barrier, driving the progression of hyperplastic polyps to sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/P). Of note, Gala et al. reported that an enrichment of rare germline loss-of-function mutations impairing senescence-related genes was associated with the development of SSAs. Particularly, genes involved in senescence are mainly involved in p16-Rb and ATM-ATR DNA damage response pathways.\n\n    In this study, we identified rare, potentially pathogenic germline variants in four genes involved in senescence processes (INO80, TP53BP1, WRN and DOT1L). Chromatin-remodeling ATPase INO80 acts as part of the INO80 (inositol requiring mutant 80) chromatin remodeling complex, and it is involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and DNA repair. Min et al. demonstrated that in mouse embryo fibroblasts, depletion of Ino80 led to an activation of p21-dependent cellular senescence and impacted in DNA damage signaling and repair. p53BP1 (TP53-binding protein 1) is a key protein involved in double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair, cell cycle and apoptosis by interacting with the ATM-CHK2-P53 pathway. In CRC cells, TP53BP1 loss produced proliferation, cell apoptosis and cellular arrest. WRN encodes for the Werner syndrome protein, a member of the RecQ helicase family protein, which harbors exonuclease and 3' to 5' helicase activities. It is involved in DNA replication, recombination and repair, and also plays an important role in maintaining genomic stability. Depletion of WRN is known to lead to genomic instability and premature senescence.\n\n    Epigenetic alterations are also an important hallmark in the serrated carcinogenesis process. For instance, DNA methylation is frequently found in early serrated lesions, either as hypermethylation of the p16 and IGFBP7 promoters as mentioned beforehand, or as hypermethylation of MLH1 or MGMT in the SPS malignancy processes. The former is usually related with an MSI and CIMP-high phenotype, and the latter with a microsatellite-stable and CIMP-low phenotype. In addition, aberrant DNA methylation may also affect the expression of TSG, contributing to the carcinogenesis process. Two candidate genes, DOT1L, a methyltransferase of H3K79me (also a senescence candidate gene) and MCM3AP were classified as epigenetic regulators. DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like) encodes for a methyltransferase responsible for mono-, di-, and tri- methylation of lysine 79 of histone H (H3K79me), an important factor to regulate cell cycle progression at G1/S transition and DNA damage response. In human cell lines, DOT1L depletion leads to upregulation of CDK inhibitors, conducting cells to an irreversible G1 arrest. In addition, DOT1L also regulates the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (gammaH2AX) and participates in DNA repair of DSBs via homologous recombination. Regarding MCM3AP (MCM3-associated protein), it binds and acetylates the MCM3 protein, negatively regulating DNA replication and cell cycle progression.\n\n    Finally, genes previously associated with cancer development were also prioritized. Particularly, ASXL1, CFTR, HIC1, KLF3, MCM8, PDLIM2, POLD1 and WNK2 were selected. ASXL1 (Additional sex comb like 1) is a TSG involved mainly in hematological cancers, but also in other malignant processes such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. It forms a complex with BAP1 that regulates H2A deubiquitination, avoiding extrinsic and intrinsic anti-proliferative signals. Therefore, mutations in this gene may confer proliferative advantage to malignant cells. CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is well-known to be associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). The risk of CRC in adults with CF is 5-10 times greater compared to the general population and it is estimated that 25% of patients with CF will develop advanced adenomas, with a risk also extended to carriers of CFTR mutations. The mechanisms by which CFTR acts as a TSG are not well understood, but its promoter methylation might trigger its downregulation in CRC. HIC1 (Hypermethylated in cancer 1) is a TSG located within a CpG island, and its methylation and loss-of-heterozygosity are very common in tumors. Traditionally, HIC1 is suggested to be related with its transcriptional repressor role and the upregulation of SIRT1 and consequent inactivation of p53, stimulating tumor growth. On the other hand, new evidence suggests HIC1 has also a relevant role in maintaining the genomic stability through the regulation of DNA repair. Hic1 inactivation in mice cells was shown to lead to cell cycle arrest, premature senescence, chromosomal instability and spontaneous transformation in vitro. KLF3 (Kruppel-like factor 3) acts as a transcriptional repressor, regulating gene expression in several biological processes such as erythropoiesis and B cell development. It has been shown to be involved in more aggressive forms of some cancers, as CRC and metastatic processes in uterine cervical cancer and sarcoma. MCM8 (mini-chromosome maintenance 8 homologous recombination repair factor) germline mutations were recently associated with early-onset Lynch like-syndrome. This DNA helicase forms a complex with MCM9, both contributing to DNA repair and genomic stability. PDLIM2 (PDZ and LIM domain 2) is downregulated in many types of NF-kB-associated tumors as leukemia, breast and colon cancer, supporting its role as a TSG in early phases of cancer development. However, it can also have a potential oncogene role later in tumorigenesis, as observed for breast cancer. Its PDZ and LIM domains are associated both with cytoskeleton and NF-kB transcription factor regulation, respectively. POLD1 (DNA polymerase delta 1) encodes for the catalytic and proofreading units of DNA polymerase delta, compromising the repair of possible DNA mismatches during DNA replication. Alteration in this function leads to an accumulation of mutations throughout the genome, potentially affecting TSGs and other cellular functions. Missense germline mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 were associated with colorectal multiple polyposis and CRC predisposition, as well as for endometrial cancer. WNK2 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 2) was seen to be down-regulated in SPS. In hepatocellular carcinogenesis, WNK2 was also shown to be a driver and a risk factor for early recurrence. As a serine/threonine kinase, it participates in the ERK/MAPK-pathway, regulating many cellular processes as cell signaling and cell proliferation. Finally, ANXA10 (Annexin A10) has also demonstrated to be an interesting candidate since its expression is used as a histological marker for serrated polyps and serrated pathway to carcinogenesis. It was demonstrated that a higher ANXA10 expression indicates high risk for developing a metachronous serrated neoplasm. ANXA10 seems to be implicated in many biological processes as growth regulation, apoptosis and cell differentiation, although its specific function in CRC is still not fully understood.\n\n    Regarding previous studies, some attempts to identify rare, high-penetrance germline predisposition to SPS have been performed, including the screening of patients with family aggregation for SPS or those severely affected patients, or looking at the enrichment of specific pathways as senescence-related. Currently, the only gene suggested to be involved in the germline predisposition to SPS is RNF43, although it seems to be involved in only some rare cases. None of the genes suggested for the germline SPS predisposition in this study was previously observed. RNF43 was not observed in our cohort, corroborating other studies that claim RNF43 to be a very rare contributor to SPS.\n\n    Lastly, performing WES on somatic samples has provided insights over the mutational profile of the serrated lesions in the evaluated SPS cohort. Clock-like mutational signatures were the most represented mutational signatures. Although they are found through various tissues at variable levels, those cell types with high replication rates, such as colon cells, exhibit higher \"clock-like\" mutation rates. For instance, a high prevalence of clock-like mutational signatures, but a low prevalence of MMR and POLE signatures was previously observed in a familial CRC cohort, as seen in this study. This fact suggests that there are no specific somatic mutational patterns that correlate specifically with SPS and/or CRC or that the current knowledge in mutational signature profiling is not capable of identifying them. On the other hand, 7% (1/14) of samples were ultra-hypermutated and 50% (7/14) were hypermutated, showing higher rates than for CRC (16%; 31%,). Finally, we observed that BRAF was the most common gene mutated among samples, in agreement with previous studies, where BRAF mutations were very frequent in SSA (75%) and in mixed polyps (86%). Accordingly, Horpaopan et al. detected that 50% of serrated polyps presented BRAF p.V600E mutation in a 41-years old female patient.\n\n    In conclusion, we suggest 14 new candidate genes to be involved in the germline predisposition to SPS (ANXA10, ASXL1, CFTR, DOT1L, HIC1, INO80, KLF3, MCM3AP, MCM8, PDLIM2, POLD1, TP53BP1, WNK2 and WRN) involved in senescence, epigenetics regulation or cancer. Variants detected in these genes were present in all affected members of the analyzed families, they were potentially pathogenic (truncating or with >3 pathogenicity predictions for missense variants), and a two-hit inactivation was evident for some of them. The somatic analysis of the serrated lesions in our cohort showed a relevant hypermutated profile and high contribution of clock-like mutational processes along with MMR signatures in some samples. In this sense, although SPS is a condition that might predispose to CRC, it presents its own features, and it differentiates from sporadic and the traditional adenoma-carcinoma CRC. Nevertheless, we are aware that additional replication of these results in larger cohorts and functional studies are needed to corroborate the germline predisposition involvement of these genes on SPS.",

        "Title": "    Phenotypes of GNAO1 Variants in a Chinese Cohort",
        "Abstract": "    This study aimed to analyze the genotypes and phenotypes of GNAO1 variants in a Chinese cohort. Seven male and four female patients with GNAO1 variants were enrolled, including siblings of brothers. Ten different GNAO1 variants (nine missense and one splicing site) were identified, among which six were novel. All the variants were confirmed to be de novo in peripheral blood DNA. Eight (73%, 8/11) patients had epilepsy; the seizure onset age ranged from 6 h after birth to 4 months (median age, 2.5 months). Focal seizures were observed in all eight patients, epileptic spasms occurred in six (75%, 6/8), tonic spasm in four (50%, 4/8), tonic seizures in two, atypical absence in one, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in one. Seven patients had multiple seizure types. Eight (73%, 8/11) patients had movement disorders, seven of them having only dystonia, and one having dystonia with choreoathetosis. Varying degrees of developmental delay (DD) were present in all 11 patients. The phenotypes were diagnosed as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) in two (18%) patients, which were further diagnosed as West syndrome. Movement disorders (MD) with developmental delay were diagnosed in two (18%) brothers. EIEE and MD were overlapped in six (55%) patients, among which two were diagnosed with West syndrome, one with Ohtahara syndrome, and the other three with non-specific EIEE. One (9%) patient was diagnosed as DD alone. The onset age of GNAO1-related disorders was early infancy. The phenotypic spectrum of GNAO1 included EIEE, MD with DD, and DD alone.",
        "Introduction": "    In 2013, Nakamura et al. had reported, for the first time, the identification of de novo mutations in the GNAO1 gene of four patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-17 (EIEE17; 615473), and the mutations led to loss of function. In 2016, Ananth et al. reported GNAO1 mutations in patients of neurodevelopmental disorder with involuntary movements (NEDIM; 617493). In 2017, Feng et al. demonstrated that the epileptic encephalopathy phenotype is related more to GNAO1 loss-of-function variants, while the movement disorders (MD), with or without epilepsy, were predominantly related to the gain-of-function variants.\n\n    The GNAO1 gene encodes the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (Galphao). G proteins are composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. They are highly abundant in the mammalian central nervous system and are involved in signal transduction. They mediate signals from a variety of important G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including GABAB, alpha2 adrenergic, adenosine A1 (A1R), and dopamine D2 (D2R) receptors. Mutations in GNAO1 and other G-protein subunits (GNAL), adenylyl cyclase (ADCY5), and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE10A) had been reported previously for early-onset movement disorders. The G-protein-cAMP pathway axis is known to play a key role in the pathophysiology of movement disorders. At cellular level, Galphao works as an inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and activator of inward rectifying potassium channels. Knockout of Galphao in mice displayed complex variable neurological phenotypes including tremor, severe epilepsy, abnormal behavior, and severe motor control impairment.\n\n    In this study, we aimed to investigate the patients with GNAO1 variants in a Chinese cohort, and explore the genotype-phenotype correlation for GNAO1.",
        "Methods": "    Patients were enrolled from the Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, between January 2016 and August 2020. Eleven patients with pathogenic GNAO1 variants were collected and identified retrospectively. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants or their legal guardians for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or data included in this article. Information regarding seizure onset age, clinical manifestations, family history, genetic testing data, video electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging, and treatment were collected. Patients were followed-up at the pediatric neurology clinic or via telephone. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital [No: 2012 (453)]. Developmental delay of the patients was evaluated according to the developmental milestones at last follow-up.\n\n    The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) genetic epilepsy with or without movement disorders, and (b) the proband carried pathogenic GNAO1 variants in peripheral blood DNA as per Sanger sequencing. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) other causes of epilepsy, such as structural, metabolic, immune, and infectious, excluding genetic factor; and (b) absence of GNAO1 variant in the peripheral blood DNA of probands.\n\n    Mutation screening of GNAO1 (RefSeq NM_020988) was performed using epilepsy panel or whole-exome sequencing (WES). Synonymous changes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 5% were removed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) from the sequencing results first. Pathogenicity of the identified variants was predicted by the MutationTaster server (http://www.mutationtaster.org/), Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2) (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), and Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) (http://sift.jcvi.org/). GNAO1 variants identified in the patients were evaluated against those in the literature, ClinVar, 1000 Genomes, ExAC (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/), and gnomAD (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). Variant classifications were determined according to the guidelines set out by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMGG). The potential pathogenic variations were validated by Sanger sequencing.",
        "Results": "    Eleven patients with pathogenic GNAO1 variants were collected in our cohort, of which seven were males and four females. Ten different pathogenic GNAO1 variants were identified in the 11 patients; nine were missense and one was a splicing site variant. All the variants were verified as de novo in peripheral blood DNA after parental testing. Two brothers (Patients 10 and 11) shared the same splicing site variant c.724-8G>A (Figure 1). Six novel variants were detected, including c.136A>G (p.K46E), c.687C>G (p.S229R), c.470T>C (p.L157R), c.810C>A (p.N270K), c.817G>T (p.D273Y), and c.724-8G>A (Figure 2). The variants were predicted to be deleterious using the MutationTaster server, PolyPhen-2, and SIFT tools. The new variants had not been reported in 1000 Genomes, ExAC, or gnomAD previously. Details about the genotypes of all 11 patients are listed in Table 1.\n\n    In 11 patients with GNAO1 variants, eight (73%, 8/11) had epilepsy, eight (73%, 8/11) had movement disorders, and six (55%, 6/11) had both; all patients had developmental delay. Detailed information of clinical data is listed in Table 1.\n\n    In the eight patients with epilepsy, seizure onset age ranged from 6 h after birth to 4 months (median age, 2.5 months). While focal seizures were observed in all eight patients, epileptic spasms were seen in six (75%, 6/8), tonic spasm in four (50%, 4/8), and tonic seizures in two. Atypical absence seizures were observed in Patient 2. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were observed in Patient 6. Seven patients had multiple seizure types. Status epilepticus was not observed in the patients.\n\n    Eight patients had clinical manifestation of movement disorders, including dystonia in all (Patients 2, 3, 5-8, 10, and 11), and choreoathetosis in one (Patient 10). Five patients (Patients 2, 3, and 5-7) had brief focal or truncal dystonia triggered by sound stimulus or emotional disturbance. Three patients (Patients 8, 10, and 11) had severe and persistent involuntary movements. Patients 10 and 11 were brothers, harboring the same de novo GNAO1 variant c.724-8G>A (Figure 1). Patient 10 was born as the first child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents; at 5 months of age, motor developmental delay was observed by the parents. He had difficulties in head control and turning over. Independent walking was achieved at the age of 2 years, and he would walk sometimes unstably with tumble. He subsequently developed involuntary dystonia and choreoathetosis of the limbs. He had abnormal posture while walking. Symptoms disappeared when he was asleep. He had dysarthrosis and could not speak even at 16 years of age, as per last follow-up. His intellectual delay was mild. His pediatric neurologist had diagnosed him with movement disorders combined with developmental delay. His younger brother (Patient 11) also exhibited motor developmental delay at 4 months of age. He had dystonia at 3 years of age, although no choreoathetosis was seen at last follow-up at the age of 7 years.\n\n    All patients had developmental delay and hypotonia. Among the eight patients with epilepsy, the degree of DD was significantly severe in both motor and intellectual disabilities. They could not raise their head stably, or roll over, rarely grasped objects, and had little or no response to sound or light stimuli. In the two brothers (Patients 10 and 11) with MD, motor and intellectual delay was mild. Patient 9 had no epilepsy and movement disorder. He only manifested as DD, and had severe delayed milestones and intellectual disabilities.\n\n    All the 11 patients underwent video EEG monitoring at least once. Out of the eight patients with epilepsy, EEG results showed three (Patients 1, 4, and 6) to have slow rhythm of background activity. All the eight patients with epilepsy had epileptiform discharges during the interictal phase (Figure 3). Hypsarrhythmia was observed in five patients (Patients 1-5). Two (Patients 3 and 5) revealed a suppression-burst pattern. Focal or multifocal epileptiform discharges were detected in all eight patients with epilepsy. Clinical seizures were recorded in six out of eight patients. Epileptic spasms and tonic spasms were recorded in four patients. Focal seizures were monitored in two patients. Tonic, generalized tonic-clonic, and atypical absence seizures were monitored in each patient. In Patient 9 with developmental delay only, EEG was normal. In the two brothers (Patients 10 and 11), EEG showed slow background activity, and no epileptic discharge.\n\n    All patients had undergone brain MRI. Their age at the time of MRI ranged from 1 month to 7 years. In Patient 3, brain MRI displayed white matter myelination delay at 1 year and 5 months of age. Slightly wider bilateral frontotemporal extracerebral space occurred in three patients (Patients 4, 7, and 9). White matter developmental delay was also observed in Patient 9. Brain MRI results were normal in a total of seven patients (64%, 7/11).\n\n    The phenotypes were diagnosed as EIEE in two (18%, 2/11) patients (Patients 1 and 4) and were further classified as West syndrome. The two brothers (18%, 2/11) were diagnosed with MD with DD. EIEE and MD were overlapped in six (55%, 6/11) patients, among which two were diagnosed with West syndrome (Patients 2 and 3), one with Ohtahara syndrome (Patient 5), and another three with non-specific EIEE (Patients 6, 7, and 8). One (9%, 1/11) patient was diagnosed with developmental delay only (Patient 9).\n\n    In the last follow-up of, eight patients had epilepsy, seven had tried two or more antiepileptic medications, and one (Patient 8) used only monotherapy. Seizures were well-controlled for 3-7 months in five patients. Five patients (Patients 3, 4, and 6-8) out of eight patients were seizure-free. Seizures were well-controlled with single topiramate in Patients 4 and 8, single vigabatrin in Patient 3, add-on therapy of levetiracetam in Patient 6, and add-on therapy of vigabatrin in Patient 7. Of the eight patients with MD symptoms, three (Patients 8, 10, and 11) were treated with levodopa, trihexyphenidyl, or clonazepam, but did not respond very well, and involuntary movements persisted. However, the hypertonia of limbs was mitigated to some extent. The last follow-up age of our cohort ranged from 8 months to 16 years. Three patients (27%) died before the last follow-up. Patient 1 died at 1 year and 11 months during sleep, presumably due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Patient 8 died of milk choking and asphyxia at 10 months. Patient 9 died due to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure at the age of 2 years and 3 months.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Since 2013, GNAO1-associated neurological disorders have been consistently reported. GNAO1 variants could cause multiple neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including epileptic encephalopathy, involuntary movements, and developmental delay. Kelly et al. had reported 14 patients with GNAO1 variants, among which nine (64%) had epilepsy, nine (64%) had movement disorders, and five (36%) had both symptoms. Movement disorders included chorea, dystonia, dyskinesia, stereotypes, and ataxia. One patient with p.R209C only manifested developmental delay and hypotonia, but no seizure and movement disability. In our cohort of 11 patients, eight (73%) had epilepsy, eight (73%) had movement abnormalities, and six (55%) had both. One patient displayed developmental delay alone. All our patients had varying degrees of DD manifestations. GNAO1-related neurological phenotypes were of broad spectrum, including epilepsy, movement disorders, developmental delay, and combinations of all phenotypes.\n\n    Approximately 25 different GNAO1 variants had been reported previously from more than 50 patients, including 23 (92%) missense, one frameshift deletion, and one splicing site variant. There are three mutation hotspots (G203, R209, and E246) in the GNAO1 gene. A genotype-phenotype correlation was also noted recently. Many functional studies had been performed, especially for recurrent variants. Gain-of-function variants turned out to be associated with movement disorder, while loss-of-function variants were more related to epilepsy phenotype. However, the relationship of variant functionality with phenotype could not explain all the cases. The explicit genotype-phenotype correlations and mechanistic basis for heterogeneity still remain to be clarified. Further studies about phenotypes, genotypes, and molecular pathways would be required for evaluating the possible genotype-phenotype correlations better. In our current study, 10 different pathogenic GNAO1 variants were identified, of which nine (90%) were missense, and one was a splicing site variant. All were verified as de novo in peripheral blood DNA. In previous reports, siblings sharing the same GNAO1 variant and parental mosaicism of this gene had been confirmed in a few families. WES sequencing, performed for both siblings and their parents revealed a pathogenic variant in GNAO1 at c.119G>A (p.G40E) that appeared to be de novo in each sibling. However, re-evaluation of parental WES data revealed three variant alleles out of 150 reads (2%) in one parent, consistent with germline mosaicism. Amplicon sequencing verified maternal mosaicism in one family. In this family, the patient carried the variant p.R209H, and Sanger sequencing analysis revealed a low heterozygous peak of the mother. This verification was crucial for genetic counseling in this family. In our study, the same variant (c.724-8G>A) was identified in siblings (Patients 10 and 11). We highly suspected parental germline mosaicism with low-level frequency. Further amplicon-deep sequencing detection for the mosaic variant frequency in multiple tissue samples needs to be performed in the future. This would be very important for genetic counseling.\n\n    Epilepsy is the major phenotype of the GNAO1 gene variant. Previous studies had reported the onset of seizures to either precede or follow the MD manifestation. In the 22 patients reported with epilepsy, median age of seizure onset was 5 months (range, 1 month to 10 years); nine patients presented with EIEE, including two cases of Ohtahara syndrome and two of West syndrome. Seven patients exhibited focal seizures, while three had generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In the remaining three patients, the epileptic syndrome was not specified. In our eight patients with epilepsy, the age of seizure onset ranged from 6 h after birth to 4 months. Multiple seizure types were observed in most patients. The common seizure types were focal and epileptic spasms in our patients. The epileptic syndromes included West syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, and non-specific EIEE. Feng et al. had reported that seizures were well-controlled by medication in half of the patients with epilepsy and GNAO1 variants. Responses to topiramate and levetiracetam had been reported earlier. Among our eight patients with epilepsy, seizures were completely controlled in five by topiramate, vigabatrin, and levetiracetam treatment. Results from published literature and our current study suggested that treatment with topiramate, levetiracetam, or vigabatrin should be recommended for patients with epilepsy and GNAO1 variants.\n\n    Movement abnormalities were also the major presenting symptoms of patients with GNAO1 variants. The median age at MD onset was 4 years, ranging from 3 months to 8 years, as per published reports. Most patients had a mixed hyperkinetic syndrome, encompassing different combinations of dystonia, choreoathetosis, and dyskinetic movements. In the overall cohort, dystonic features were most frequently reported to be a component of the MD (65%, 30/46), followed by dyskinesias (63%, 29/46) and choreoathetosis (58%, 27/46). Eight patients in our cohort had MD; its range included dystonia and choreoathetosis. The most common feature of MD in our patients was dystonia. The last follow-up age of our patients was <4 years, and we believe that they should be followed-up further for their clinical manifestations, including movement disorders. EEG showed low background activity but no abnormal discharge in patients with only MD (Patients 10 and 11). Partial patients obtained satisfactory management of the MD with oral drugs, the effects being variable across the different cases. They were treated with phenobarbital, benzodiazepines (clonazepam and diazepam), levodopa, neuroleptics (haloperidol and risperidone), and antiepileptics (topiramate, carbamazepine, valproate). In one case of severe MD with the GNAO1 variant, the episodes were treated successfully with gabapentin. However, few patients presenting with severely medical-refractory MD required surgical treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was performed to reduce the frequency and severity of MD exacerbations. Three of our patients were administered oral drugs of levodopa, trihexyphenidyl, or clonazepam for controlling the MD symptoms; however, the effects were not satisfactory. DBS may be suggested and tried in such patients with refractory persistent dystonia.\n\n    Together with epilepsy or involuntary movements, the phenotypes involved global retardation of motor and intellectual development in patients with GNAO1 variants. Kelly et al. reported all 14 patients to have developmental delay and show a broad spectrum of severity. Five (36%) patients showed profound impairment and were non-verbal and non-ambulatory. Few patients had the mildest developmental abnormalities, including delayed speech and motor development and mild intellectual disability. All our 11 patients had developmental delay ranging from mild to severe. In patients with epilepsy, the developmental disability was global retardation involving motor and intellectual delay. The progress was still slow in patients with controlled seizure. In two patients with MD and seizure unaffected, their motor developmental difficulties were significantly severe, and intellectual delay was milder. In our cohort, Patient 9 with GNAO1 variant, p.E246K had the phenotype of DD alone. Age at the last follow-up was 2 years and 3 months. No symptom of seizure and movement disorder was observed in this patient, although the global developmental delay was significantly severe. Regrettably, he died due to respiratory failure and sepsis after pulmonary infection. Twelve patients with the variant p.E246K had been reported previously, and the variant was located in a mutational hot spot. For available detailed information in eight patients, seven patients had MD, and only one patient had focal epilepsy. The data led to the speculation that the p.E246K variant may be a specific site for MD phenotypes, usually without epilepsy.\n\n    The phenotypic spectrum of GNAO1-related neurodevelopmental disorders ranges broadly from epileptic encephalopathy, movement disorders, and developmental delay, to the combination of various phenotypes. De novo missense variants were frequent in the GNAO1 gene. The age of seizure onset, in the presence of the GNAO1 variant was early infancy. Dystonia may be the most common symptom related to movement disorders. When patients with EIEE had combined dystonia, GNAO1 may be suspected as the causative gene. All patients had developmental delay with a wide range of severity; however, the genotype-phenotype correlations are still unclear. Further studies on genotype, phenotype, and molecular pathways would be required for better understanding of the process.",

        "Title": "    The diagnostic yield, candidate genes, and pitfalls for a genetic study of intellectual disability in 118 middle eastern families",
        "Abstract": "    Global Developmental Delay/Intellectual disability (ID) is the term used to describe various disorders caused by abnormal brain development and characterized by impairments in cognition, communication, behavior, or motor skills. In the past few years, whole-exome sequencing (WES) has been proven to be a powerful, robust, and scalable approach for candidate gene discoveries in consanguineous populations. In this study, we recruited 215 patients affected with ID from 118 Middle Eastern families. Whole-exome sequencing was completed for 188 individuals. The average age at which WES was completed was 8.5 years. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in 32/118 families (27%). Variants of uncertain significance were seen in 33/118 families (28%). The candidate genes with a possible association with ID were detected in 32/118 (27%) with a total number of 64 affected individuals. These genes are novel, were previously reported in a single family, or cause strikingly different phenotypes with a different mode of inheritance. These genes included: AATK, AP1G2, CAMSAP1, CCDC9B, CNTROB, DNAH14, DNAJB4, DRG1, DTNBP1, EDRF1, EEF1D, EXOC8, EXOSC4, FARSB, FBXO22, FILIP1, INPP4A, P2RX7, PRDM13, PTRHD1, SCN10A, SCYL2, SMG8, SUPV3L1, TACC2, THUMPD1, XPR1, ZFYVE28. During the 5 years of the study and through gene matching databases, several of these genes have now been confirmed as causative of ID. In conclusion, understanding the causes of ID will help understand biological mechanisms, provide precise counseling for affected families, and aid in primary prevention.",
        "Introduction": "    Global Developmental Delay (GDD)/Intellectual disability (ID) represents a group of genetic, phenotypic, and clinically heterogenic disorders that affect approximately 1% of children worldwide. Significant limitations define GDD or ID in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior that originates during brain development. Non-genetic causes such as infections, autoimmunity, and environmental factors are described, but the majority of such disorders have a genetic basis.\n\n    Hundreds of genes are thought to be involved in the etiology of ID. The list of ID genes has expanded and according to the SysNDD database, there are now 2841 primary and candidate human ID genes. In the last decade, advances in genetic technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized clinical practice in medical genetics, aided clinical diagnosis, and proved to be very effective in discovering an ever-increasing number of ID-related genes. They have also enabled deciphering the ID's heterogeneous genetic mechanisms.\n\n    Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), as a clinical diagnostic test, has a success rate of about 30-40%. The diagnostic yield of chromosomal microarray in children with no underlying cause of their ID is around 15 to 20%. In trio-based WES done in groups of children with severe ID, the yield ranged from 13 to 35%. In contrast, exome sequencing in samples from consanguineous families with various ID-associated phenotypes has produced a high yield. For example, in several studies of ID from the Middle East, NGS yield ranged from 37 to 90%, depending on the patients' cohorts, the study design, and the classification of the variants.\n\n    This study reports on the diagnostic yield and candidate genes of a genetic study of intellectual disability in 118 Omani families. The study period extended over five years and included 215 affected individuals. The diagnostic yield when considering both pathogenic and uncertain variants was 55%. Candidate genes with a possible association with ID phenotype seen in this cohort were detected in 32/118 (27%) with a total number of 64 affected individuals. Understanding ID causes will provide precise counseling for affected families and aid in primary prevention. Also, the costs of unnecessary investigations will be spared, with fewer diagnostic odysseys. The paper also discusses the pitfalls and challenges of candidate gene discovery in a consanguineous population.",
        "Methods": "    The Medical Research Ethics Committee approved the study of Sultan Qaboos University (SQU MREC#1362). Informed written consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. The target patients included in this study presented with global developmental delay or intellectual disability, all assessed clinically by medical geneticists (detailed methods in SUPP_S1). Severe phenotypes causing death within the neonatal or early infantile period were also included as a neurological phenotype was evident, such as seizures, hypotonia, or brain malformations. Families with a likely autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance were selected. Patients with known molecular diagnoses at the time of recruitment were excluded. The study and exome data analysis were carried out over 5 years, between 2016 and 2021.\n\n    Whole-exome sequencing analysis was performed for all affected individuals where samples were available. A detailed methodology is presented in the supplemental data (SUPP_S1). In brief, the method used hybrid capture technology (Agilent SureSelect Human All-exons-V6 or V7) for exome enrichment and capture. Illumina technology (Hiseq2500, Hiseq4000, or NovaSeq6000) of 150 bp paired-end, at 150-200X coverage, was used for sequencing. The reads were mapped against UCSC GRCh37/hg19 or GRCh38/hg38. Filtering and variant prioritization were analyzed using an in-house pipeline (SUPP_S1). Variant filtration was performed to keep only novel or rare variants (<= 1%). Public databases such as 1000 Genomes, Exome Variant Server, and GnomAD were used for alleles frequencies. For filtration of common variants against the Middle Eastern population, the Greater Middle East (GME) and variome database \"al mena\" that comprises data of 2497 samples was used. Our in-house population-specific exomes database, which contains data of 1564 WES, was also used. During the filtration process, the phenotype and mode of inheritance were both considered. Any potential variants identified after prioritization were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Members included in the segregation analysis ranged from 3 to 12 members of each family, depending on the DNA availability. Most of the segregation was performed for the parents and siblings alongside the index patient. When a definitive cause was not possible or when a candidate gene was considered, further analysis of copy number variants was performed on exome data using ExomeDepth (SUPP_S1).\n\n    Classification of variants was based on the published ACMG guideline. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in known disease-causing genes which could be linked to the reported phenotypes of the affected patients were categorized as disease-causing variants. The second category was for the variants in known disease-causing genes that overlapped with the patient's phenotype, and these were considered possible disease-causing variants. These were rare and damaging variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Variants in candidate genes, which were predicted to be deleterious and found in genes not previously confirmed to be implicated in human disease, formed the third category. These genes are novel; they were previously reported in a single family or cause strikingly different phenotypes with different modes of inheritance. Supporting data for candidate genes included variants within a shared autozygosity area. The variant is of high or moderate impact; the population frequency supports genic intolerance to such variants, and in-silico prediction tools indicate a damaging effect. Data for gene function and network, gene expression, and animal models were also considered.",
        "Results": "    Whole-exome sequence analysis was performed for 188 individuals representing 118 characterized families with a total number of 215 affected individuals. Of the 118 families included, 93 (78.8%) had a family history of one or more affected individuals in addition to the index patient, all with a similar phenotype. The age range of the affected individuals, at first clinical assessment, was from birth to 34 years old. The average age at which WES was completed was 8.5 years, and children below five years of age, represented 30% of the affected individuals when WES was completed. Males represented 57.2% of the studied group (123 Males:92 Females). The rate of consanguineous marriages within the included families was 91%. The affected patients exhibited diverse phenotypes, including global developmental delay, seizures, brain malformations, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and other systemic manifestations (Table 1 and Supplementary SUPP_Table1).\n\n    A total of 420 members' DNA samples were available for WES or Sanger sequencing for segregation analysis. These included healthy or affected members. However, DNA samples were not available for analysis in 22 out of the 215 affected individuals. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the variant and phenotype-genotype segregation in all candidate variants. Only variants that were confirmed and segregated with the phenotype are reported.\n\n    Variants in previously known and described ID genes were seen in 65/118 families (55%). Following the ACMG guidelines of variant classification, pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants were detected in 32/118 families (27%). Variants of uncertain significance were seen in 33/118 families (28%). The majority of these two groups showed homozygous variants (51/65; 78.5%). These variants are rare; they explain the disease manifestations, are predicted to be damaging, are confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and are segregated with the phenotype (All listed in SUPP_Table1).\n\n    Candidate genes with a possible association with ID phenotype seen in this cohort were detected in 32/118 (27%) with a total number of affected individuals of 64 (Table 1). These candidate genes were selected according to rarity and absence in homozygosity status in local control exomes or public databases. The impact of the variants is predicated damaging. The expression patterns or mouse models supported an association with neurological dysfunction. Importantly, Sanger sequencing confirmed segregation for all variants in candidate genes in up to 3 generations in the family pedigrees (Fig. 1). The total number of candidate genes identified was 28. Table 1 shows detailed findings for the candidate genes.\n\n    Twenty-one families (18%) with 40 affected individuals remain unsolved despite multiple molecular tests, including WES, chromosomal microarray, and Fragile X where applicable. There is a trend of milder phenotypes and usually non-syndromic intellectual disabilities in unresolved cases. However, we can not draw a firm conclusion because of the small numbers.",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, using WES to identify the novel causes of human disease has changed the research landscape of genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders. Although WES is comprehensive technology, its limitations must be considered when negative results are obtained. The pitfalls of WES can potentially reduce the effectiveness of this technique in biological and medical research as well as in clinical settings. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that identifying a likely candidate gene is often just the start of a long process to confirm the variant's pathogenicity.",
        "Discussion": "    Global Developmental Delay (GDD)/Intellectual disability (ID) represents a group of genetic, phenotypic, and clinically heterogenic disorders that affect approximately 1% of children worldwide. This study presents the results of 188 exome analyses representing 118 consanguineous Omani families. This cohort included 215 affected individuals with intellectual disabilities, including global developmental delay, seizures, brain malformations, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and other systemic manifestations. Overall 82% were found to have a possible explanation. Specifically, 55% had variants in previously described and known genes (P/LP or VUS) and 27% in possible candidate genes.\n\n    With the enrichment for consanguineous families (91%), it was not surprising that the majority (85.5%) of the overall variants in the three groups were homozygous. The consanguinity rate is high due to the preference to include families with autosomal recessive phenotypes and multiple affected individuals. This study detected pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in 32 families, making the diagnostic rate of the study 27%. The main goal of this study was to recruit unsolved cases. However, the diagnostic rate observed was higher than anticipated. This can be explained by frequent reanalysis of exome data during the last five years of the study, thus enabling newly published genes to be detected. Also, VUSs, including non-coding variants, were selected with further evidence of pathogenicity becoming available. Also, during the study's initial phase, some families did not have access to clinical exome sequencing and thus were channeled to the research exome.\n\n    In a large-scale exome sequencing study, Monies and colleagues reported the yield of exome sequencing on 2219 families from Saudi Arabia. The overall diagnostic yield of exome sequencing based on cases with confirmed pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants was 43.3%. However, if considering variants of unknown significance (VUS) that are in an established disease-related gene or candidate genes with compelling biological candidacy were considered, the yield rate would be 73%. The high throughput design of this study led to the discovery of 236 genes that have no established OMIM phenotypes and were proposed as candidate genes. The negative results (unsolved cases) accounted for 27% of the total.\n\n    The total number of candidate genes for intellectual disability identified in this study was 28. During the course of this study, Gene Matcher was used to provide further evidence of association with the phenotype. Through this study and in collaboration with the scientifc community, several of these genes have been successfully confirmed to cause intellectual disability (Table 1). One interesting shared candidate variant within the XPR1 gene was identified in multiple affected individuals from four apparently unrelated families (Table 1). These families come from different geographical areas of Oman. However, haplotype analysis using exome data indicated that they all shared the same haplotype (Data not shown). The XPR1 protein functions to mediate phosphate export from the cell as well as binding inositol hexakisphosphate and related inositol polyphosphates, which are key intracellular signaling molecules. Mutations in the XPR1 gene are known to be associated with the dominant condition of idiopathic basal ganglia calcification-6; OMIM 616413. The earliest age of onset for this condition is in the third and fourth decade of life, with symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency associated with movement disorders, cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms. Our patients' phenotype is strikingly different; we detected biallelic XPR1 variants and apparently healthy parents. The phenotype included variable signs of neonatal pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, serum hypophosphatemia, chronic lung disease requiring oxygen therapy, severe developmental delay, and brain basal ganglia calcification. Further functional characterization for these variants has commenced.\n\n    Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis can cover up to 98% of the human genome, whereas WES only covers about 95% of the coding regions and only 1-2% of the genome. WES has a lower cost per sample than WGS, a greater depth of coverage in target regions, lesser storage requirements, and easier data analysis. It is, however, worth highlighting the pitfalls and challenges that can occur when WES analysis is performed. WES is a high-throughput, complex technique with potential pitfalls at every step. These pitfalls and the consequential missing of the molecular diagnosis in exome sequencing and analysis is a recognized phenomenon. This phenomenon could be caused by various factors, including technological limitations in variant detection, a lack of enrolling additional family members, many variants identified for probands, or the causal variant being located outside of the coding regions. Pitfalls related to WES analysis can be categorized into three main groups (Table 2).\n\n    The first group of pitfalls consists of those which are sequence-related. Large rearrangements or complex structural variants are one example. Structural variants are genomic rearrangements larger than 50 bp in size, and they account for about 1% of the variation in human genomes. Complex structural variants have been shown to contribute to human genomic variation and to cause Mendelian disease. Unfortunately, these cannot be identified easily by WES. However, multiple pipelines for CNV analysis are available. In this study and using ExomeDepth, it was possible to detect CNVs in a homozygosity state as a cause of the phenotype (Families 11MS8800 and 10DH12500). Mitochondrial mutations are other causative factors that WES cannot detect. Other factors also include mosaicism, abnormal methylation, and uniparental disomy.\n\n    Other causes of missing variants in WES include decreased coverage, locus-specific features such as GC-rich regions, and sequencing biases. Difficulty in the alignment of indels (insertions/deletions) larger than 20-50 nucleotides long is one of the limitations, which is likely to be the reason for WES missing such variants. Incomplete human genome annotation and sequence might also affect the accuracy of variant mapping and annotation. For instance, an intronic variant could be located in an unannotated exon. Another potential cause is the high sequence similarity between pseudogenes and their corresponding functional genes.\n\n    The second group to consider is pitfalls due to annotation and prioritization errors. Annotation and prioritization steps are used in WES analyses to reduce thousands of variants to a few candidates. During the filtering process, all annotations except for the \"canonical\" transcripts (i.e., the longest transcript of a gene) are initially ignored. Remarkably, pathogenic variants can be missed if alternative transcripts are not fully considered. Splicing is thought to be involved in 15-30% of all inherited disease variants. Despite advances in exome capture methods or machine learning for detecting variants that affect splicing, accurate detections of deep intronic variants remain limited and this could be the reason for missing splicing variants. In our cohort, intronic variants that were likely to affect splicing were detected in 19/118 families (16.1%) of which 8 were in non-canonical splicing sites.\n\n    Databases like OMIM and HGMD are used to find gene-disease and variant-disease associations in the literature. Variants or genes listed in these databases would be flagged as potentially disease-causing. Nevertheless, a reason for an initial false-negative result is that such variants or disease databases have not been kept up to date. A recent study by Bruel and colleagues illustrated this issue in a study cohort of 313 individuals. Likewise, when considering deleterious variants, those with high population prevalence might be filtered out. Penetrance of the disease might be influenced by numerous factors, including other hidden rare variants, family history, inheritance, additional medical problems, and ethnic background.\n\n    Synonymous variants, which are known as 'silent' variants, represent almost 50% of the variant list identified by WES. Filtering out synonymous variants reduces the variants' list because they are assumed to be benign. However, our increased knowledge about the relationship between genetic variants and disease has shown that synonymous variants play a significant role in human disease risk and other complex traits, including variants that affect splicing. Indeed, a recent study challenged the concept that synonymous variants are neutral. In their yeast study, Shen and colleagues showed a strong non-neutrality of most synonymous mutations. If this holds true for other genes and organisms, then numerous biological conclusions, including disease causation about synonymous mutation, would require re-examination. An example in our cohort is the family 16SS2600, where GPT2 (p.Gly245Gly) was initially missed and flagged as a silent variant.\n\n    All labs encounter pitfalls related to clinical factors and phenotypes. As a result, a negative WES result must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical history to determine whether reevaluation or further testing is necessary. For example, within our cohort (family 10MS6600), two related families with multiple affected individuals were enrolled as having the same phenotype and WES analysis was initially negative. However, after a detailed clinical reevaluation and exome reanalysis, the results showed that two different diseases were possibly running in the family. Some of the affected members were indeed found to harbor a deep intronic variant in the PGAP3, which was recently reported to cause hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome type 4 (OMIM 615,716). Another example is family 10MS16500, demonstrating that multiple individuals carrying two or more different diseases can complicate the phenotype. Similarly, the family (10DF10800) with multiple affected individuals presented with developmental delay, congenital cataracts, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. WES analysis identified two different variants for two different syndromes in two genes, one of which is novel as the underlying cause. Another aspect is the mode of inheritance in which conditions are known to be autosomal dominant but manifest as autosomal recessive. Monies and colleagues reported many examples of genes or diseases inherited as both AD and AR.",

        "Title": "    Gonadal mosaicism in GNAO1 causing neurodevelopmental disorder with involuntary movements; two additional variants",
        "Abstract": "    GNAO1 encodes an alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). Mutations in GNAO1 result in two clinical phenotypes: Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 17 (EEIE17-OMIM #615473) and Neurodevelopmental disorder with involuntary movements (NEDIM-OMIM #617493). Both are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders and originate mainly as de novo. Only a few are reported as gonadal mosaicism.\n\n    We recruited and retrospectively reviewed five patients from two families seen at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh (KFSHRC).\n\n    All patients presented with severe neurodevelopmental disorder, followed by progressive dystonia and hyperkinetic movements. In addition, none of the patients had seizures which was consistent with NEDIM phenotype. The specific diagnosis was not clinically entertained and was only found on whole exome sequencing (WES), which identified two variants (c.724-8G > A & c.709G > A). Both variants were previously reported as pathogenic de novo in patients with NEDIM, and one was reported as parental gonadal mosaicism.\n\n    We report these variants as additional variants in GNAO1 gene that may be inherited as parental gonadal mosaicism. Both variants resulted in NEDIM with no observed clinical differences in the severity than the reported cases. This noticeable reported association between GNAO1 gene associated disorders and gonadal mosaicism should be considered in reproductive genetic counselling of affected families. Furthermore, in view of these reports, more studies with prospective data collection to explore the association between GNAO1 and gonadal mosaicism and the underlying mechanisms will be necessary.",
        "Introduction": "    GNAO1 gene encodes Galphao, the alpha subunit of Go, a member of the Gi/o family of heterotrimeric G protein signal transducers. Go is the most abundant membrane protein in the mammalian central nervous system and plays a major role in synaptic neurotransmission and neurodevelopment. Galphao localizes ubiquitously throughout the brain with relatively high expression in hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. Mutation in GNAO1 gene results in two clinical phenotypes; (EEIE17-OMIM #615473), and (NEDIM-OMIM #617493). Both are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders and are caused mainly by de novo mutations.\n\n    The most common manifestations of NEDIM are hypotonia, developmental delay, spasticity, dystonia, and hyperkinetic movements with choreoathetosis. Before the first exacerbation of chorea, the motor syndrome typically appears nonspecific, and patients may be misdiagnosed with hypotonic or dyskinetic cerebral palsy. To date, four variants in GNAO1 have been reported with parental gonadal mosaicism. Three variants are linked to NEDIM, and one variant caused EIEE17. Here we report two additional variants (Table 2) in GNAO1 associated with parental gonadal mosaicism among five patients with NEDIM. Both variants have been reported previously as pathogenic de novo mutations.",
        "Methods": "    This publication was approved by the Office of Research Affairs (ORA) at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre-Riyadh (KFSHRC-R).\n\n    We retrospectively reviewed all available clinical data and molecular findings on patients diagnosed with GNAO1 mutation at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC) Riyadh.\n\n    Identical twin (I:1, I:2) born preterm at 34 weeks to a healthy consanguineous parents of Arab descent. They were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit shortly after birth due to prematurity for three weeks and discharged in good condition. They were noted to have delayed milestones since infancy. They walked around three years, followed by the occurrence of dystonic posturing of the lower limbs around four years and then progressing to upper extremities and face by age five. This was followed by choreoathetosis and cervical dystonia resulting in left-sided intermittent torticollis with dystonic involuntary movements. Both twins had significant speech delay. On examination at eight years, their weight was below the 3rd percentile, height was on the 3rd percentile, and head circumference was appropriate for age. Extraocular movements were normal. They had spastic quadriplegia with hypertonia, more pronounced in the lower limbs as compared to upper limbs. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk, and planters were up going bilaterally. Initially, they were diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, but as dystonia became more evident, other diagnostic possibilities were entertained, including genetic causes. Twin B (I:2) was able to walk until the age of eight years, then she lost ambulation, whereas twin A (I:1) lost the ability to walk by 12 years. The dystonic involuntary movements partially responded to Artane, Baclofen, Clonazepam, and intermittent Botox injections. The third sibling was a baby boy (I:3), a product of full-term normal vaginal delivery without complications during pregnancy with a birth weight of 2.5 kg. He was discharged home as a normal newborn. By one year of age, the family noticed global developmental delay as he could not sit alone, had poor handgrip and linguistically, he could not babble. Socially, he interacted with his surroundings, and there were no concerns regarding hearing and vision. He sat at the age of 15 months, started to walk at 20 months of age, and started babbling at the age of 24 months. Currently, he is six years old and dependent on his mother for all daily activities. On examination, his growth parameters are appropriate for his age. He has some functional eye contact, responds to social smiles and is not communicating verbally except for babbling sounds. He has dystonic spastic posture with no hyperkinetic movements and his extraocular muscle movements are normal. Excessive saliva drooling is noted. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk, and planters were upgoing bilaterally. He has hypertonia in upper and lower extremities with the latter more severely affected and can walk with an ataxic spastic gait.\n\n    Two siblings (II:1, II:2) delivered by normal vaginal delivery with uneventful antenatal and postnatal course. They were found to be floppy from birth. They started to reach objects by two years. They began to stand up and walk with support for a short distance by three years. They developed involuntary movement and dystonia associated with abnormal posturing by the age of four years. Speech delay was prominent and by five years, they only spoke a few words. On examination, they had generalized hypotonia, predominantly axial with normal reflexes till the age of three years. Then at the age of five years, they started to have spasticity and hyperreflexia more prominent in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. The muscle bulk was decreased, and the power was 3/5 with dystonic hyperkinetic movements. Currently, both siblings have severe growth retardation and spastic dystonic posture with normal head circumference.\n\n    In family I, Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, Array CGH + SNP was negative, and WES showed a heterozygous variant in GNAO1 c.724-8G > A in all affected individuals. Whereas, in family 2, WES was performed for II:1 and revealed a heterozygous missense variant in GNAO1, c.709G > A (Glu237Lys). Further targeted mutation analysis confirmed the presence of the same variant in his sibling II:2. Both variants were not detected in the parental blood samples in both families, indicating gonadal mosaicism.",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    To date, over 95 patients with GNAO1 gene mutations have been reported in the literature; at least 39 patients with 21 unique variants are linked to EEIE17, 45 patients with 25 unique variants are linked to NEDIM, while four variants are linked to Ohtahara syndrome. The majority of variants are; missense in nature, few deletions, and one deep intronic splicing defect. Of these, four variants (Table 3) in nine cases have been reported with parental gonadal mosaicism. Three variants (p.E246K) in dizygotic twins and two variants p.R209H and c.724-8G > A in two sets of siblings were reported as a cause of NEDIM. In these six patients with NEDIM, all had motor and linguistic developmental delay. They also have developed progressive chorea and athetosis at the age of five years. One patient had a daily exacerbation of chorea that required intensive care admission and management. Two patients had improvement in the chorea with deep brain stimulation. One variant p.G40E was reported to cause EIEE17 in two adult brothers. Both had seizures that started in infancy, with significant findings in EEG and MRI imaging. In our view, instead of viewing GNAO1 mutations as distinct phenotypes, we believe that they rather represent a clinical spectrum from a severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy to a protracted neurodevelopmental delay with a movement disorder.\n\n    We describe here five patients from two families (See Fig. 1) with global developmental delay, hypotonia, spastic quadriplegia, and severe hyperkinetic movement disorder attributed to gonadal mosaicism, expanding the list of the mutations in GNAO1 gene associated with this type of inheritance. Their phenotype was consistent with NEDIM. The oldest patient is 16, and the youngest patient is 6. None of our patients had clinical seizures, but they showed abnormal EEGs. Three patients presented in early infancy with hypotonia, whereas the other two had a normal initial neonatal period followed by global developmental delay at four and five months, respectively. The dystonia started in lower extremities and later extended gradually to the upper extremities and facial muscles. They all exhibited hyperkinetic movement with dystonia between four and seven years with partial response to pharmacotherapy. Eventually, they all lost the ability to ambulate as they grew older without triggering factors and became wheelchair-bound. They all demonstrated severe linguistic delay, but none had evidence of dysphagia. To date, they are all alive, and none of them have deep brain stimulation yet.\n\n    Using whole exome sequencing, two heterozygous variants have been detected in GNAO1 gene. The variants were not detected in parental blood samples from either family and all siblings are healthy. The presence of the same heterozygous variant in multiple children and its absence in both parents supports parental gonadal mosaicism. E237K variant was reported before in two patients with NEDIM. Also, this variant was reported in ClinVar database in an individual with microcephaly, seizures, and muscle weakness. The other variant c.724-8G > A has been reported by GeneDx in Clinvar as de novo in two presumably unrelated individuals with similar clinical features. In three recent reports, four additional patients with c.724-8G > A variant has been described in three families; two patients with germline mosaicism, one patient who inherited the variant from her mother with low-prevalent somatic mosaicism and one as de novo. This variant caused abnormal splicing of in-frame 6-bp intronic retention, leading to 2 amino acid insertion (p.Thr241_Asn242insProGln). Immunoblotting and immunostaining using wild type and mutant GNAO1 vectors showed no significant differences in protein expression level, but the cellular localization pattern of this mutant was partially shifted to the cytoplasm whereas WT was exclusively localized in the cellular membrane. Investigators suggested that this mutant might have a loss of function effect alongside with dominant negative effect predisposing to movement disorders without seizures. In some reports, parental somatic mosaicism has been observed in 6.6% - 8.3% of parents who had a child with a diagnosis of an apparently de novo monogenic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by different genes. The level of mosaicism in their parents is widely correlated with the severity of disease and symptoms tend to appear in case with a mosaic rate of >10%. There is not enough evidence that GNAO1 gene is associated with parental gonadal mosaicism more than the other genes; however, the association is significantly noticeable and should be considered when families are counselled about the recurrence risk and prenatal testing.\n\n    To conclude, we report two variants in GNAO1 gene inherited as parental gonadal mosaicism. Both variants resulted in NEDIM with no observed clinical differences in the severity away from the reported cases. This noticeable reported association between GNAO1 gene associated disorders and gonadal mosaicism should be considered in reproductive genetic counselling of affected families. Furthermore, in view of these reports, more studies with prospective data collection to explore the association between GNAO1 and gonadal mosaicism and the underlying mechanisms will be necessary.",

        "Title": "    Clinical utility of genetic testing in Indian children with kidney diseases",
        "Abstract": "    Kidney diseases with genetic etiology in children present with an overlapping spectrum of manifestations. We aimed to analyze the clinical utility of genetic testing in the diagnosis and management of suspected genetic kidney diseases in children.\n\n    In this retrospective study, children <= 18 years in whom a genetic test was ordered were included. Clinical indications for genetic testing were categorized as Glomerular diseases, nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinoses, tubulopathies, cystic kidney diseases, congenital abnormality of kidney and urinary tract, chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology and others. Clinical exome sequencing was the test of choice. Other genetic tests ordered were sanger sequencing, gene panel, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and karyotyping. The pathogenicity of the genetic variant was interpreted as per the American College of Medical Genetics classification.\n\n    A total of 86 samples were sent for genetic testing from 76 index children, 8 parents and 2 fetuses. A total of 74 variants were reported in 47 genes. Out of 74 variants, 42 were missense, 9 nonsense, 12 frameshifts, 1 indel, 5 affected the splicing regions and 5 were copy number variants. Thirty-two were homozygous, 36 heterozygous and 6 were hemizygous variants. Twenty-four children (31.6%) had pathogenic and 11 (14.5%) had likely pathogenic variants. Twenty-four children (31.6%) had variants of uncertain significance. No variants were reported in 17 children (22.3%). A genetic diagnosis was made in 35 children with an overall yield of 46%. The diagnostic yield was 29.4% for glomerular diseases, 53.8% for tubular disorders, 81% for nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinoses, 60% for cystic kidney diseases and 50% for chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology. Genetic testing made a new diagnosis or changed the diagnosis in 15 children (19.7%).\n\n    Nearly half (46%) of the children tested for a genetic disease had a genetic diagnosis. Genetic testing confirmed the clinical diagnoses, changed the clinical diagnoses or made a new diagnosis which helped in personalized management.",
        "Introduction": "    With rapid advances in gene sequencing technology, an increasing number of Mendelian forms of kidney diseases are being identified in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), tubulopathy, nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis, cystic kidney disease and hemolytic uremic syndrome. In some kidney diseases like congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), genetic etiology is not completely characterized. Many of the children with these kidney diseases progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nearly 30% of children and 5-30% of adults with CKD have one of the 450 genes mutated to explain the etiology of CKD. Identifying monogenic causes has significant benefits in the management of children with kidney diseases. It ends the diagnostic journey by unequivocally establishing a diagnosis, allows informed treatment and helps in detecting and monitoring extra-renal complications. It also helps in detecting the disease in mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic family members by extended family screening. Knowledge of inheritance patterns and specific genetic variants guides further reproduction decisions and detection of the genetic variant in the fetus.\n\n    There is a significant shift in the paradigm of genetic testing in pediatric nephrology clinical practice with a move from a rare specialized and expensive test to the emergence as one of the common diagnostic methods used in the clinical setting. This is mainly due to the rapid progress in massively parallel sequencing and decreasing cost of massively parallel sequencing technology. Massively parallel sequencing has also allowed the identification of new disease-causing genes and helped in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of many inherited diseases of childhood. However, clear information regarding the likely outcome and impact of genetic testing is still missing. While the data on the clinical utility of genetic testing in specific disease groups in Indian children are available, information about its impact on diagnosis and management in an unselected group of children with kidney diseases is limited. We report our experience about the clinical utility of genetic testing in children with kidney diseases.",
        "Methods": "    The study was done at a tertiary care public nephrology teaching institute in India.\n\n    The study was approved by institutional ethics committee registered at CDSCO with registration no ECR/143/Inst/GJ/2013/RR-19, reference letter: IKDRC-ITS EC/App/31Jul20/2. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and/or their legal guardian(s).\n\n    This was a retrospective study where medical records of all children under the age of 18 years treated at a tertiary care nephrology center in whom a genetic etiology was suspected, and a genetic test was ordered between September 2016 to January 2021 were analyzed. Demographic details, history of consanguinity in parents, family history of similar illness, extrarenal and syndromic features were noted.\n\n    kidney diseases were categorized under the following disease categories: glomerular disease, nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis, tubulopathy, cystic kidney disease, CKD with unknown etiology (CKDu), congenital abnormality of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and others.\n\n    The genetic testing method (karyotyping, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), Sanger sequencing, gene panel and clinical exome sequencing (CES)) was noted. The test results were interpreted as per the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) classification. Where possible, family segregation studies were performed.\n\n    A genetic test was ordered by sending 5 ml blood in EDTA to a commercial laboratory.CES or targeted nephrotic syndrome panel were the investigations of choice when a genetic cause was suspected. Selective capture and sequencing of the protein-coding regions of the genome/genes were performed with a custom capture kit using the DNA extracted from blood. The libraries were sequenced to mean > 80-100X coverage on the Illumina sequencing platform (Illumina Inc., CA, USA). Genome Analysis Tool Kit best practices framework was followed for the identification of variants in the sample using Sentieon (v201808.01). Gene annotation of the variants was performed using the VEP program against the Ensemble release 91 human gene model. In addition to SNVs and small Indels, copy number variants (CNVs) were screened from sequence data using the ExomeDepth (v1.1.10) method. Clinically relevant variants were annotated using published variants in literature and a set of diseases databases:ClinVar, OMIM, GWAS, HGMD (v2018.3) and SwissVar. Common variants were filtered based on allele frequency in 1000Genome Phase 3, ExAC (v1.0), gnomAD (v2.1), EVS, dbSNP (v151), 1000 Japanese Genome and internal Indian population database. The non-synonymous variant's effect was evaluated using multiple algorithms such as PolyPhen-2, SIFT, VariantTaster2 and LRT. Only non-synonymous and splice site variants found in the clinical exome panel consisting of 8332 genes were used for clinical interpretation. Silent variations that do not result in any change in amino acid in the coding region were not reported.\n\n    Sanger sequencing was done for some of the cases in parents of a proband when there was a strong suspicion of a particular gene, but more commonly to confirm the variant in the case of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). MLPA was ordered for one of the selected case when there was no variant found in CES but when a copy number variation (CNV) was strongly suspected like in HUS. The SALSA MLPA Probemix P236 CFH Region from MRC Holland was used for the detection of deletions or duplications in the CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR4 and CFHR5 genes in genomic DNA isolated from human peripheral whole blood specimens. Copy number differences of various exons between test and control DNA samples were detected by analyzing the MLPA peak patterns. Segregation analysis could not be done in all cases due to limited funds. The work flow diagram has been depicted in Fig. 1. The clinical impact of genetic testing was assessed by determining its utility in confirming the clinical diagnosis, making a new diagnosis, reclassifying a disease, reverse phenotyping, changing treatment and genetic counselling.\n\n    CES was done in 72 samples, targeted Nephrotic Syndrome gene panel in 2 (genes covered in Nephrotic Syndrome gene panels are given in Table 1), Sanger sequencing in 14 and MLPA in 1. Of the 14 Sanger sequencing performed, 2 were done to confirm CES variants, 8 in parents of children to confirm inheritance pattern and segregation, 2 for screening known genes in familial context or established syndrome, and 2 in the fetus. Karyotyping was done in 3 children.\n\n    Descriptive statistics were used for the study. The yield of genetic testing for various disease categories were expressed as percentage. The categorical variables were described as median. The numbers were small for any comparative statistical analysis.\n\n    The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available in the NCBI repository at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA863410\n\n    Institute of Kidney Disease and Research Center-Institute of Transplantation Sciences Ethics committee registered at CDSCO with registration no ECR/143/Inst/GJ/2013/RR-19 (valid up to Nov 2024) approved the study. Reference letter: IKDRC-ITS EC/App/31Jul20/21. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\n\n    Written informed consent were obtained from legal guardian(s).\n\n    Not applicable.",
        "Results": "    Genetic testing was performed in 86 individuals between September 2016 to January 2021, consisting of 76 index children, 8 parents, and 2 fetuses. Overall, the median age (IQR) of children at the onset of disease was 48 months (12-96 months). Forty out of 76 children (52.6%) were males. Nine families (10.5%) had a history of consanguinity. A family history of the same disease was present in only 4 families. The clinical disease categories are provided in Table 2. Glomerular diseases (44.7%) were the most common disease category for which a genetic test was ordered, in which the majority were steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (32.8%). Notably, 5.2% of the patients presented with kidney failure of unknown origin.\n\n    A total of 74 variants in 47 genes were reported in 59 out of 76 index children (77.6%). Seventeen children (22.3%) did not have any genetic variant. Out of all 74 variants 51 were novel and were not previously reported. Eighteen out of 51 novel variants were pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 33 were VUS. Forty-two variants were missense, 9 nonsense, 12 frameshifts, 1 indel, 5 variants affected the splicing regions and 5 were copy number variants (CNV).\n\n    A genetic diagnosis was made in 35 children (overall yield 46%; 35/76). Twenty-four children (31.5%) had pathogenic and 11(14.4%) had likely pathogenic variants. By disease category, the diagnostic yield was 29.4% in glomerular diseases (10 of 34 children), 53.8% in tubular disorders (7 of 13 children), 81% in nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis (9 of 11 children), 60% in ciliopathies/cystic kidney diseases (6 of 10 children) and in 50% of CKD of unknown etiology (2 of 4 children) (Table 3). Of the 17 distinct monogenetic disorders detected, primary hyperoxaluria (n = 6) followed by Alport syndrome (n = 5) were the most common genetic diagnoses in the cohort. In 15 children (19.7%) genetic testing provided a new diagnosis or changed the clinical diagnosis. It revised the clinical diagnosis in 4 children. Clinical characteristics and details of genetic variants of children diagnosed with a genetic disease are depicted in Table 4. Twenty-four out of 76 children (31.5%) had variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Six children with pathogenic variants had also additional VUS. The details of children with VUS and children without a genetic variant are depicted in Tables 5 and 6 respectively.\n\n    The median age of the children with a genetic disease at disease onset was 24 months (range 10-108 months) compared to 48 months (range 48-82 months) in children without a genetic diagnosis. The majority, 28 (80%) had an autosomal recessive inheritance and 6 (17.1%) had a history of consanguinity. Syndromic features were noted in 6 children (17.1%).\n\n    Among glomerular diseases, steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) was the most common indication for ordering a genetic test (n = 25; 32.8%). All were initial SRNS. Seven children (28%) had a pathogenic variant, 9 (36%) had VUS while 9 children did not have any variant. Four of the seven (57%) with a pathogenic variant had the age of onset less than 24 months. Two children had a pathogenic variant in WT1 and 1 each in NPHS2, PLCE1, COL4A3, LAMB2 and NPHP1. One child with WT1 had clinical phenotype of Frasier vs Denys Drash syndrome (Case 37) and other with WT1 (Case 67) had SRNS without any other syndromic feature. Genetic testing resulted in a new diagnosis in 3 children (12%) with a clinical diagnosis of SRNS [nephronophthisis-1 (case 5), Pierson syndrome (case 24) and Frasier syndrome (case 67)]. In case 5 the patient was clinically diagnosed as FSGS as he had nephrotic syndrome at presentation along with kidney failure and biopsy had revealed sclerosed glomeruli. CES revealed nephronophthisis which gave the genetic diagnosis and predicted post kidney transplantation recurrence. In the other two children it helped in reverse phenotyping. In case 67 who was phenotypically female, karyotyping was done after CES which revealed 46 XY suggesting complete sex reversal. In case 24 with Pierson syndrome however there was no microcornea. In 5 children, immunosuppression was discontinued following genetic diagnosis. Nine children with VUS also had very severe disease resistant to both prednisolone and calcineurin inhibitors, similar to those with an identified genetic cause. Causality could not be established in those with VUS as genetic tests in parents were inconclusive and functional analysis could not be done. Four children with a pathogenic variant and 5 with VUS progressed to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In contrast, only 1 child without any genetic variant progressed to ESKD.\n\n    CES was done in all children with alternative complement pathway abnormality (atypical HUS n = 4, C3GN n = 2); however, MLPA was done in only 1 child due to cost constraints. VUS were identified in all children in WT1, SPTB, CFB, CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes. In 3 children with suspected Alport syndrome, diagnosis was confirmed in all (1 X linked Alport Syndrome and 2 Autosomal recessive Alport Syndrome).\n\n    Ten children with suspected cystic kidney disease were evaluated for a genetic variant. Five had suspected nephronophthisis, 2 were suspected Bardet Biedl Syndrome, while 1 patient each was clinically diagnosed with glomerular cystic kidney disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Five (50%) had extrarenal manifestations; retinitis pigmentosa in 3, polydactyly in 1and skeletal dysplasia in 1. Six (60%) had confirmed genetic disease out of which 4 had a pathogenic variant in SDCCAG8, DYNC2H1, NPHP 1, and CEP164 and 2 had likely pathogenic variant in PKHD1. Two had VUS in PKD1 and PKD2. In one child (case 1) the clinical diagnosis was reclassified from Bardet Biedl Syndrome to nephronophthisis 15. In Case 32, a new diagnosis of short-rib thoracic dysplasia was made. In one child (case 72) clinical diagnosis of ADPKD (large kidneys with cysts in kidneys and liver) was reclassified to ARPKD. One child (case 10) had no genetic variant despite having a strong phenotype of nephronophthisis realted ciliopathy (ESKD and retinitis pigmentosa with an affected sibling of a similar phenotype).\n\n    Of 11 children with nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis, clinical diagnoses were primary hyperoxaluria (n = 8), uric acid stone with hyperuricemia (n = 2) and familial hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) (n = 1). Nine (81%) had a pathogenic variant. Five had a pathogenic variant in the AGXT gene leading to the diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. All of them had ESKD at presentation. One child (case 27) who had normal kidney function had a likely pathogenic variant in HOGA1. One child had a VUS in the GRHPR gene. Two (case 12, 14) with hyperuricemia, AKI and obstructive stones at 2 and 10 months of life were found to have a pathogenic variant in the HPRT1 gene leading to the diagnosis of Lesch Nyhan syndrome. Apart from hyperuricemia, there were no other features of Lesch Nyhan syndrome in these children. The child with suspected FHHNC had a VUS in Claudin 16.\n\n    Among 13 children with a clinical diagnosis of tubular disorders, 4 had Fanconi syndrome, 2 suspected distal RTA, 2 bartter syndrome, 2 rickets, 1 dent disease and 2 unknown tubulopathies. Seven (53.8%) had pathogenic variant; 1 SLC12A1, SLC4A1, SLCA2, FAH1, PHEX, CTNS and ATP6V0A4. No causal variants were identified in 3 children with unclear clinical diagnoses.\n\n    CES was done in four children with CKD with unknown etiology before transplant. One girl (case 35) had a Pathogenic variant in COL4A4 leading to the diagnosis of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. On family screening, the younger sibling was found to harbor the same pathogenic variant leading to early diagnosis of Alport's syndrome. One boy (case 44) had a homozygous pathogenic variant in COL4A5 while one child (case 64) had a homozygous VUS in the BBS4 gene. The other two children had no genetic variant.",
        "Conclusion": "    Genetic testing was useful in confirming a suspected diagnosis, making a new diagnosis, reverse phenotyping, genetic counselling, and personalized treatment in our cohort. Detailed phenotyping probably increased the yield of genetic testing. However, detection of a variant of uncertain significance remains a significant clinical challenge.\n\n    Publisher's Note\n\n    Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
        "Discussion": "    The study presents two points that are of interest. First, the feasibility of genetic testing in a clinical setting using a combination of methods for sequencing and second the impact of genetic diagnosis in the management of kidney disease and family screening in an unselected cohort. In the study, the genetic cause for kidney disease was identified in 35 out of 76 children (46%). The solve rate was high in children with nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis (8/11;81%), ciliopathies/cystic kidney diseases (6/10; 60%), tubular disorders (7/13; 53.8%) and was least in glomerular diseases (10 of 34;29.4%). With the help of genetic testing, in 50% of children (2/4) with CKD with unknown etiology, a specific cause could be ascertained. Children with a pathogenic variant were younger at disease onset than those without a genetic etiology. This was similar to earlier reports, where the probability of having a pathogenic variant increase with younger age and decreases as age increases. Although a majority of the children (81%) with genetic disease had a homozygous variant with autosomal recessive inheritance, family history was present in only 4. Hence it is important to note that the absence of family history should not be a factor in not suspecting a genetic cause.\n\n    The high yield in our cohort substantiates the use of genetic testing in establishing a molecular diagnosis. Low median age, 10% consanguinity and detailed phenotyping in the cohort before sending genetic test were probably predictive of the high diagnostic yield. In published studies, the diagnostic yield of genetic testing varies from 6.3 to 100% depending on the characteristics of the cohort and the method of analysis employed. In a cohort of 127 patients ranging from newborn to 81 years, the overall solve rate of massively parallel sequencing by a kidney disease panel (KidneySeq v1, 177 genes) was 43% (54 of 127 patients). The solve rate was 46% in patients between 0-14 years, which decreased to 22% for patients > 30 years old. The solve rate (46%) in our cohort was similar. Though CES was not done in all the children with SRNS, the proportion (28%) of children with a pathogenic variant was similar to the median of 26% reported in earlier cohorts. One-third of children had VUS, mostly novel with a phenotypically severe disease similar to those with a monogenic form, indicating a high probability of having a genetic cause.\n\n    Whole exome sequencing in patients < 25 years with either nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis detected a monogenic cause in 29% in an earlier study. However, 9 of 11 children (81%) with nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis in the current study had a pathogenic variant, probably reflecting a carefully selected cohort where a genetic test was done. Similarly, the yield of a causal variant in tubulopathies in our cohort was high (53.8%) which was similar to the previous report in European cohorts. Two-thirds of children with cystic kidney disease had a pathogenic variant, which was much higher than reported in one study (12%) but similar to a median of 50% based on two earlier studies.\n\n    CKDu is frequently seen in CKD cohorts; 6% at 12-15 years, 21% at 18-21 years and 36% of all cases with adult-onset CKD do not have a diagnosis. Massively parallel sequencing has been increasingly used in the CKD population and is found to be useful in providing an alternative strategy to obtain a definitive diagnosis as recently demonstrated in 9 out of 92 patients by Lata et al. and in 16 of 34 families (47%) in a cohort of 114 Irish families. Two out of 4 children with CKDu (50%) had a pathogenic variant in our study. It established the diagnosis of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome and X linked Alport syndrome in these children.\n\n    In 20 out of 35 children with a genetic diagnosis, genetic testing correlated with the phenotype thereby confirming the diagnosis and further helped in prognostication, clinical management, and genetic counselling. For example, diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria was confirmed in 6 children. Renal prognosis is different in different types of primary hyperoxaluria. Hence, genetic testing in hyperoxaluria not only helps establish the diagnosis but also to know the specific type of hyperoxaluria. In addition, it informs about the approach to transplant as Type I hyperoxaluria requires combined kidney-liver transplantation while in Type II, only kidney transplant would suffice.\n\n    In 15 children (19.7%) genetic testing provided a new diagnosis or revised the initial diagnosis. A correct diagnosis by genetic testing helps in counselling, facilitates living donor selection, and clarifies the risk of recurrence post-renal transplantation. For example, detection of a pathogenic variant in the NPHP1 gene established the diagnosis of nephronophthisis in a child suspected of FSGS progressed to ESKD (case 5). It not only unequivocally established the cause of kidney failure but also clarified disease recurrence risk post kidney transplantation. In case 72, the diagnosis was changed from ADPKD to ARPKD after the detection of a pathogenic variant in the PKHD1 gene. Reclassification or establishing a new diagnosis helps in reverse phenotyping in children. For example, in two children with CKD (case 36, 44) in whom etiology was unknown, diagnosis of Alport syndrome was made based on detection of homozygous pathogenic variant in COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes. This has important management implications as these children require screening for deafness as well as evaluation of the eyes. Similarly, detection of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in intron 9 of WT1 lead to the diagnosis of Frasier syndrome in a girl (case 67), who was then found to have 46 XY in karyotyping, complete sex reversal and gonadal dysgenesis. Further, immunosuppression was stopped as a therapeutic response was unlikely. This is a powerful demonstration of personalized medicine based on a genetic diagnosis.\n\n    Massively parallel sequencing has increasingly helped in identifying phenocopy. A child (case 70) with dense medullary nephrocalcinosis and suspected primary hyperoxaluria based on a high urine oxalate excretion, was diagnosed to have Bartter syndrome type 2 after detection of a homozygous pathogenic variant in the KCNJ 1 gene. It has important therapeutic as well as prognostic implications. The child did not have typical symptoms of Bartter syndrome. Repeat investigation following genetic results did reveal metabolic alkalosis and high urinary chloride establishing the correct diagnosis and helped in initiating appropriate treatment.\n\n    Diagnosis of genetic disease helps in the detection of disease in other family members as well as for antenatal counselling. For example, case36 was diagnosed with ARAS (pathogenic variant in COL4A4) when CES was done to evaluate the cause of CKD. Sanger sequencing of the same gene in her younger sibling who had microscopic hematuria, led to the discovery of the same variant (case 76). Detection of the same genetic variant in HPRT1 and AGXT gene in two fetuses as observed in index cases with Lesch nehan syndrome and hyperoxaluria respectively helped in appropriate counselling and termination of pregnancy.\n\n    While massively parallel sequencing based testing has many utilities, there are limitations too. Despite advances in bioinformatics, pathogenicity in some cases will remain uncertain. Twenty-four children (31.5%) had VUS, in whom definitive pathogenicity could not be established although phenotypically they were strongly suspected of having a genetic disease. Identification of VUS (mostly novel variants) as observed in a significant proportion of children in the current study poses challenges in interpretation and conveying the information to parents. In addition, segregation studies in the family to ascertain causality adds to the cost. A girl (case 11) with a heterozygous VUS in the PLCE1 gene developed recurrence of FSGS post kidney transplantation proving that the variant identified in the child was not causal. Hence, critical assessment of reported variants must occur before clinical decision-making is influenced by genetic findings. Besides VUS, 17 children did not have a genetic variant. Two siblings had a phenotype of Senior Loken syndrome and ESKD but no pathogenic variant was detected in one of the siblings (case 10) who was tested. Inability to detect causal variants could be due to limitations in testing strategies or identification of the variant in a gene that is yet to be associated with the phenotype or when the disease has a complex inheritance pattern (e.g. Digenic variants). Whole-exome sequencing could be useful in these cases as clinical exome sequencing might not detect a novel variant or copy number variations. These limitations and the requirement of additional testing in the family should be informed to parents before ordering genetic testing. In 6 children, a VUS was identified as a secondary variant along with a pathogenic variant. The significance of these variants could not be found out and they remain a clinical challenge. Also, being a retrospective review, detailed clinical information like GFR was lacking in many patients which is a major limitation of this study.",

        "Abstract": "    The established causative mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 can explain less than 1%,Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Of the identified variants, the PSEN2 mutations are even less common.\n\n    With the genetic study from the dementia cohort of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), we aim to illustrate the PSEN2 mutation spectrum and novel functionally validated mutations in Chinese AD patients.\n\n    702 AD participants, aged 30-85, were identified in PUMCH dementia cohort. They all received history inquiry, physical examination, biochemical test, cognitive evaluation, brain CT/MRI, and next-generation DNA sequencing. Functional analysis was achieved by transfection of the HEK293 cells with plasmids harboring the wild-type PSEN2 or candidate mutations.\n\n    Nine PSEN2 rare variants were found, including two reported (M239T, R62C) and seven novel variants (N141S, I368F, L396I, G117X, I146T, S147N, H220Y). The HEK293 cells transfected with the PSEN2 N141S, M239T, I368F plasmids showed higher Abeta42 and Abeta42/Abeta40 levels relative to the wild-type PSEN2. The PSEN2 L396I, G117X, S147N, H220Y, and R62C did not alter Abeta42, Abeta40 levels, or Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. 1.9%,(13/702) subjects harbored rare PSEN2 variants. 0.4%,(3/702) subjects carried pathogenic/likely pathogenic PSEN2 mutations. The three subjects with the functionally validated PSEN2 mutations were all familial early-onset AD patients. The common symptoms included amnesia and mental symptom. Additionally, the M239T mutation carrier presented with dressing apraxia, visuospatial agraphia, dyscalculia and visual mislocalization.\n\n    The PSEN2 N141S, M239T, and I368F are functionally validated mutations.",
        "Introduction": "    Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia. The well-established causative genes include amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2). They are related to the autosomal dominant form of AD. Based on the previous research, almost 73 APP, 322 PSEN1, and 87 PSEN2 variants have been identified (https://www.alzforum.org/). However, they can explain less than 1%,AD population. In this case, many studies are devoted to exploring new causative genes or loci.\n\n    The PSEN2 gene encodes the PSEN2 protein. It has nine transmembrane domains, a cytoplasmic N-terminus and C-terminus, as well as a cytoplasmic loop between the 6th and 7th transmembrane domains (https://www.alzforum.org/). It is a major component of the gamma-secretase, which accounts for the proteolytic cleavage of the APP and the formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. The PSEN2 and PSEN1 proteins are highly homologous and share about 60%,amino acid identity. However, of the identified variants, the PSEN2 mutations are far less than the PSEN1 mutations. Moreover, most of these PSEN2 mutations do not have functional evidence.\n\n    In this paper, we will illustrate the mutation spectrum of the PSEN2 gene in the dementia cohort of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). As well, we will disclose the novel functionally validated PSEN2 mutations in Chinese AD patients.",
        "Methods": "    702 participants, aged 30-85, were extracted from PUMCH dementia cohort. They all met the diagnostic criteria for probable AD according to the 2011 recommendations from National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association. They all underwent history inquiry, physical examination, biochemical test, cognitive evaluation, and brain CT/MRI. 558 subjects had whole exon sequencing, and 144 cases had targeted exon sequencing of 278 dementia-related genes. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of PUMCH (No. JS-1836). Written informed consent was obtained from the participants.\n\n    Cognitive assessment included neuropsychological screening tests and multi-domain assessment. The former involved Clinical Dementia Rating, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), etc. The latter covered executive, visuospatial, linguistic, memory, and reasoning domains. It consisted of Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Rey complex figure, word fluency, Digital Symbol Substitution Test, Trail Making Test part A, graphics copying, block design, episodic memory, paired associate learning, similarity, calculation, as well as oral comprehension, repetition, naming, reading, copying, dictation, spontaneous speech and writing, etc. Z-score = (individual score - average score) / standard deviation.\n\n    Peripheral blood was collected. Genomic DNA was extracted by QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA libraries were sequenced on NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, USA). All reads were aligned to human genome reference (UCSC hg19) with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.5.9). The reads were realigned and recalibrated by GATK Indel Realigner (version 3.5) and Base Recalibrator (version 3.5). SNVs and small indels were determined with GATK Unified Genotyper (version 3.5). Variant annotation was performed by Annovar (version 2016Feb01). The pathogenicity of rare variants was illustrated according to the standards of American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The potential pathogenic mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing.\n\n    The high-purity, endotoxin-free plasmids were prepared by Escherichia coli. HEK293 cells containing Swedish mutant APP (APPsw) were transfected with plasmids harboring wild-type PSEN2 (PSEN2wt) and candidate PSEN2 mutations, respectively. The supernatant of cell culture medium was collected after 48 h of transfection. Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in the supernatant were determined by ultra-sensitive Abeta40 and Abeta42 Human ELISA Kit (Thermo, KHB3441, KHB3544). Abeta40 and Abeta42 values, as well as Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio were compared between the wild-type and candidate PSEN2 mutations by Student's t test.",
        "Results": "    As shown in Table 1, 37.9%,(266/702) subjects were males, and 62.1%,(436/702) were females. The age ranged between 41 and 84, with an average of 67.2+-9.8 years. Based on the age of onset (AOO), 52.3%,(367/702) subjects were early-onset (AOO < 65 years), while 47.7%,(335/702) were late-onset (AOO>=65 years). 43.6%,(306/702) subjects had at least one first-degree or second-degree relative suffering from dementia, defined as a positive family history of dementia. The APOE genotype distribution was as follows: e2/e2 (n = 5, 0.7%,), e2/e3 (n = 52, 7.4%,), e3/e3 (n = 344, 49.0%,), e2/e4 (n = 17, 2.4%,), e3/e4 (n = 227, 32.3%,), e4/e4 (n = 57, 8.1%,).\n\n    4.0%,(28/702) subjects harbored rare variants in APP (n = 7), PSEN1 (n = 12), and PSEN2 (n = 9). According to the ACMG criteria, 14 cases carried pathogenic/likely pathogenic (PLP) variants, and the other 14 cases had variant of uncertain significance (VUS). This paper focused on the PSEN2 mutation spectrum.\n\n    As shown in Supplementary Table 1, nine PSEN2 rare variants were found in the cohort. The PSEN2 R62C was a published variant. The PSEN2 M239T was reported by our group in 2021. The other seven variants were novel, including N141S, I368F, L396I, G117X, I146T, S147N, and H220Y. Of them, eight variants were missense, and one is stopgain. The variants were rare or missing in ExAC, 1000 Genome, Cosmic, or GnomAD databases. They were supposed to be damaging according to SIFT, Polyphen, Mutationtaster, or LRT predictions.\n\n    As illustrated in Fig. 1, all the variants were within the Presenilin domain except for the PSEN2 R62C mutation. Moreover, seven variants were located in trans-membrane regions, including the PSEN2 N141S, M239T, I368F, L396I, I146T, S147N, and H220Y. The PSEN2 R62C was in intracellular domain adjacent to N-terminus. The G117X was in the extracellular domain between 1st and 2nd trans-membrane regions.\n\n    Functional analysis was performed in eight variants. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the HEK293 cells transfected with the PSEN2 N141S, M239T, I368F plasmids showed increased Abeta42 levels (pg/ml) (140.34+-7.02, 144.72+-29.06, 380.94+-47.11 versus 71.54+-6.87; p < 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.001), as well as elevated Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios (0.067+-0.005, 0.067+-0.012, 0.156+-0.018 versus 0.031+-0.003; p < 0.001, p = 0.007, p = 0.001) relative to the wild-type PSEN2. Abeta40 levels did not differ between the wild-type PSEN2 and the PSEN2 N141S, M239T, and I368F. The other five variants (L396I, G117X, S147N, H220Y, R62C) did not alter Abeta42, Abeta40 level, or Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio.\n\n    The causative mutations at the residue 141 and 239 of PSEN2 had been previously confirmed, such as the PSEN2 N141I and M239V. However, the causative variants at the residue 368 of PSEN2 had never been reported before. According to the ACMG criteria, the PSEN2 N141S and M239T were pathogenic, the I368F was likely pathogenic, whereas the other six variants were VUS.\n\n    1.3%,(9/702) subjects harbored the rare variants in PSEN2. 0.4%,(3/702) subjects carried the PSEN2 PLP mutations. The incidence of the PSEN2 PLP mutations was higher in the familial and early-onset subjects relative to the sporadic and late-onset patients (1.0%, 0.8%,versus 0%, 0%,).\n\n    The 54-year-old female used to take good care of her family. She always danced with her friends in the community. Things had changed since two years ago. She frequently quarreled with her husband, forgot to use salt when cooking, and asked the same questions repeatedly. She had difficulty in learning a new dance. Her father started with memory deficit in his 60s and died about a decade later. Her mother died in her 70s without cognitive decline. Her siblings were all cognitively normal (Fig. 3).\n\n    On admission, she did not think she had any problems. She scored a 28 on the MMSE, and 22 on the ADL. She showed relatively intact performance on memory tests. The z-scores of immediate, short, and long delayed recall of AVLT, recall of complex Rey figure were -0.84, -0.81, -0.52, and -0.3, respectively. Physical examination, electroencephalography, and brain MRI were almost normal (Fig. 3).\n\n    Five years later, she was unable to recognize her seven-year-old granddaughter sometimes. She could not remember when her father died or when her son married. She insisted that her husband stole her jewelry and cheated on her. She scored 20 on the MMSE, and 23 on the ADL. On domain assessment, she showed severe deficit on verbal and non-verbal memory tests. The z-scores of long delayed recall of AVLT, paired associate learning and recall of Rey complex figure were -3.38, -3.52, and -4.64, respectively. Executive, visuospatial, reasoning, and linguistic domains were relatively preserved.\n\n    Over the past one year, the 48-year-old right-handed female had encountered difficulty in dressing, writing, and calculating. She always forgot to take medicine. She was restless and irritable. She could do the chores, but very slowly. During sleep she had frequent arousals and sleep-talking.\n\n    On admission, she got a 20 on the MMSE and 30 on the ADL. She showed slight deficits on memory domain. The z-scores of short and long delayed recall of AVLT, paired associate learning were -1.8, -2.4, -1.8, respectively. In addition, she showed severe deficit on visuospatial and executive domains. She was unable to finish graphics copying, block design, digital symbol substitution task, and trail making test. She had difficulty in visual and auditory calculation. She spoke fluently with relatively intact naming, repetition, oral and reading comprehension. Writing disturbance was mainly manifested as character structural abnormality. It did not improve with copying the written text. Additionally, she exhibited prominent visual mislocalization. She could answer what animal toys were on the table, and which was the closest to \"monkey\". However, when asked to touch \"monkey\", she showed great difficulty and always reach in the wrong direction.\n\n    Other physical examinations were almost normal, including visual field, acuity, and fundus, etc. Brain MRI showed left predominant parietal atrophy (Fig. 3). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker was in favor of AD diagnosis (Abeta42 439 pg/ml, phosphorylated tau-181 66 pg/ml, total tau 242 pg/ml). Brain 18F-AV45 PET showed increased uptake in diffuse cortical regions. Four years later, she could not do any chores. She developed bradykinesia and rigidity of right upper limb and the trunk. She scored 16 on the MMSE, and 53 on the ADL.\n\n    On family diagram (Fig. 3), her mother, uncle, and aunt all showed cognitive deficit in their 70s and died around 80. Her siblings and cousins were all cognitively normal. Her 46-year-old sister received gene sequencing which showed no PSEN2 p.M239T (c.716T > C) mutation.\n\n    This 60-year-old male started with memory impairment two years ago. He could not find his own belongings. So he always suspected his family of stealing from him. He was unable to pick up his grandchild from school as usual since he could not remember the route. He often got lost in the subway station and asked the police to send him home. Occasionally he got up at midnight to brush his teeth and tidy up his clothes and shoes. He was irritable and agitated. He showed word-finding difficulty sometimes. His mother had memory impairment in her 70s and died two years later.\n\n    On admission, he scored 7 on the MMSE, and 35 on the ADL. He spoke fluently with intact oral comprehension. Physical examination and brain MRI were almost normal (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, he was lost to follow-up.\n\n    As illustrated in Supplementary Table 2, six subjects harbored the VUS in the PSEN2. They were four males and two females. The AOO ranged between 56 and 70 years old. Five were familial cases, while one was sporadic. They all presented with memory deficit and mental symptom during the initial stage. The other initial symptoms included dyscalculia, disinhibition, impaired oral comprehension, etc. Three cases had parietal and/or temporal lobar atrophy. Four cases were accompanied by periventricular and/or subcortical white matter lesions, Fazekas grade 1-2.\n\n    The PSEN2 G117X was found in a 63-year-old male. His father died of hepatic cancer at the age of 50. His father's two siblings developed cognitive decline in their 70s. He started with memory deficit, lack of initiative, and restlessness at 56. Gradually, he was unable to calculate, write, or dress himself. On admission, he scored 8 on the MMSE and 55 on the ADL. Brain MRI showed bilateral parietal atrophy.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This is a retrospective study from the PUMCH dementia cohort. 0.4%,(3/702) AD patients carry the PSEN2 PLP variants. In the early-onset and the familial AD patients, the prevalence of PSEN2 PLP variants are 0.8%,(3/367) and 1.0%,(3/306), respectively. These are close to the previous findings. Brouwers demonstrated that in the early-onset AD patients, the PSEN2 mutation frequency is about 1%,. According to a Chinese familial AD research, 1.7%,(7/404) pedigrees harbored PSEN2 mutations.\n\n    The HEK293 cells transfected with the plasmids containing the PSEN2 N141S, M239T, and I368F exhibit increased Abeta42 and Abeta42/Abeta40 in comparison to the wild-type PSEN2, indicating their contribution to Abeta42 production and AD pathogenesis. The causative mutations at the residue 141 and 239 of PSEN2 have been reported before, including N141I, N141D, N141Y, M239V, and M239I. Most N141I patients have Volga German ancestry, whereas most M239V and M239I cases have Italian heritage. The PSEN2 N141D, N141Y, and M239V have been described in Chinese pedigrees with early-onset AD. However, it is the first time that the causative mutation at the residue 368 of PSEN2 has been identified in a familial early-onset AD patient.\n\n    The three functionally validated mutations are within the second, fifth, and seventh trans-membrane regions, respectively. The trans-membrane domains of the PSEN2 are mutation hotspots. The previously reported PSEN2 p.S175C (c.524C > G), p.Y231C (c.692A > G), and p.T430M (c.1289C > T) are located in the third, fifth, and ninth trans-membrane regions, respectively.\n\n    The three subjects harboring the functionally validated PSEN2 mutations are all familial early-onset AD patients. They all presented with memory decline and emotional symptom. Additionally, each case had his own characteristic manifestations. The subject with the PSEN2 N141S mutation showed prominent mental symptom with lack of insight. She denied that she has any problems and refused to see a doctor. Unlike the PSEN2 N141S carrier, the subject harboring the PSEN2 M239T mutation complained of her \"locked\" brain and had a strong willingness to seek medical treatment. She also manifested with dressing apraxia, visuospatial agraphia, dyscalculia, visual mislocalization, and sleep disorder. The subject with the PSEN2 I368F mutation was characterized by spatial and temporal disorientation, as well as word-finding difficulty.\n\n    The PSEN2 N141S and I368F mutations have not been reported before. Our group reported the PSEN2 M239T mutation in 2021. Li et al. reported another Chinese early-onset AD patient harboring the PSEN2 M239T in 2021. He presented with visuospatial and memory impairment.\n\n    It is the first time that visual mislocalization has been described in an AD patient with the PSEN2 mutation. It is a disorder of visually guided reaching, which might be due to the left prominent parietal involvement in case 2. As illustrated by Husain et al., the parietal cortex receives sensory inputs, such as visual, somatosensory, and vestibular stimuli. Meanwhile, it has reciprocal connections to premotor cortex, hippocampus, etc. It plays a crucial role in the perception and integration of sensory information, as well as in the association of sensory and motor signals, directing attention, especially for localizing objects at different spatial locations.\n\n    Among the three cases, the subject harboring the PSEN2 I368F mutation showed the worst cognitive performance on admission. Among the three mutations, the PSEN2 I368F mutation had the highest CSF Abeta42 level and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in in vitro studies. We suppose that the in vitro greater Abeta42 or Abeta42/Abeta40 level of the specific mutation might predict the faster disease progression in the subject harboring the mutation. The previous in vivo studies showed that the low Abeta42 level and high tau/Abeta42 ratio correlated with the rapid cognitive decline. The association between the in vitro and in vivo biomarkers, as well as the disease progression should be further investigated.\n\n    In conclusion, we report three functionally validated PSEN2 mutations, including the PSEN2 p.N141S (c.422A > G), p.M239T (c.716T > C), and p.I368F (c.1102A > T). The PSEN2 L396I, G117X, S147N, H220Y, and R62C do not alter Abeta42, Abeta40 level, or Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in in vitro transfection studies. Nevertheless, these variants cannot be necessarily determined as non-pathogenic based on these results alone. For instance, the APP p. E693G (c.2078A > G) mutation did not increase Abeta42, Abeta40, or Abeta42/Abeta40, either. However, it formed protofibrils at a high rate, which contributed to accelerated insoluble Abeta deposits. Therefore, the pathogenicity of these variants needs to be clarified by further functional validation and pathological examination. The main limitation of this study is the absence of CSF biomarkers and pathological evidence. These are expected to confirm the in vivo pathological effect of these mutations.",

        "Title": "    Progressive demyelinating polyneuropathy after hematopoietic cell transplantation in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a case series",
        "Abstract": "    Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a neuro-metabolic disorder due to arylsulfatase A deficiency, causing demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can provide a symptomatic and survival benefit for pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic patients by stabilizing CNS disease. This case series, however, illustrates the occurrence of severely progressive polyneuropathy shortly after HCT in two patients with late-infantile, one with late-juvenile, and one with adult MLD, leading to the inability to walk or sit without support. The patients had demyelinating polyneuropathy before HCT, performed at the ages of 2 years in the first two patients and at 14 and 23 years in the other two patients. The myeloablative conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan, fludarabine and, in one case, rituximab, with anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, steroids, and/or mycophenolate mofetil for GvHD prophylaxis. Polyneuropathy after HCT progressed parallel with tapering immunosuppression and paralleled bouts of infection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Differential diagnoses included MLD progression, neurological GvHD or another (auto)inflammatory cause. Laboratory, electroneurography and pathology investigations were inconclusive. In two patients, treatment with immunomodulatory drugs led to temporary improvement, but not sustained stabilization of polyneuropathy. One patient showed recovery to pre-HCT functioning, except for a Holmes-like tremor, for which a peripheral origin cannot be excluded. One patient showed marginal response to immunosuppressive treatment and died ten months after HCT due to respiratory failure. The extensive diagnostic and therapeutic attempts highlight the challenge of characterizing and treating progressive polyneuropathy in patients with MLD shortly after HCT. We advise to consider repeat electro-neurography and possibly peripheral nerve biopsy in such patients. Nerve conduction blocks, evidence of the presence of T lymphocytes and macrophages in the neuronal and surrounding nerve tissue, and beneficial effects of immunomodulatory drugs may indicate a partially (auto)immune-mediated pathology. Polyneuropathy may cause major residual disease burden after HCT. MLD patients with progressive polyneuropathy could potentially benefit from a more intensified immunomodulatory drug regime following HCT, especially at times of immune activation.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00415-024-12322-3.",
        "Introduction": "    Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD, OMIM #250,100) is an inherited lethal neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ASA). ASA catalyzes desulfation of 3-O-sulfogalactosyl residues (sulfatides) in glycosphingolipids, and its deficiency results in intralysosomal sulfatide accumulation. Myelin sheaths of the central and peripheral nervous system are predominantly affected, leading to progressive demyelination and, to a lesser extent, axonal loss. The most prominent clinical features are motor and cognitive regression, ataxia, pyramidal signs, and eventually loss of all motor function and speech. Based on the age of disease onset, four clinical types of MLD can be distinguished, including late-infantile (< 2.5 years), early-juvenile (2.5-6 years), late-juvenile (6-16 years), and adult (> 16 years). Generally, the younger the age of onset, the faster the disease progression.\n\n    Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can provide a symptomatic and survival benefit for presymptomatic and early symptomatic patients with MLD. However, progressive polyneuropathy may cause major disease burden, despite otherwise successful HCT. Our systematic review indicates that approximately 75% of the HCT-treated patients show a decline in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) or deterioration of clinical symptoms, but information about detailed clinical course of peripheral polyneuropathy progression after HCT is scarce, and its cause and pathology remain unclear. We wondered whether progressive polyneuropathy after HCT should only be attributed to ongoing sulfatide accumulation, especially in case of rapid deterioration shortly after treatment. Alternative causes include neurological toxicity of HCT drugs, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or another (auto)immune-mediated cause. This case series illustrates progressive polyneuropathy in two patients with late-infantile (MLD-45 and MLD-50), one with late-juvenile (MLD-87), and one with adult MLD (MLD-62), exemplifying the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in these patients.",
        "Methods": "    For this patient record review study, 4 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MLD were included in the Amsterdam Leukodystrophy Center, a Dutch nationwide expertise center. The patients were selected because their polyneuropathy progressed significantly within 1 year post-HCT despite the fact that HCT was performed early in the disease course, and are derived from a cohort of 18 patients, the majority diagnosed with demyelinating polyneuropathy, who have received HCT since 2004 in the same center. Significant progression of polyneuropathy was defined as an increase in muscle weakness, whether accompanied by new signs or symptoms indicating impaired sensory function and the absence of deep tendon reflexes, leading to considerable disability when compared to the pre-HCT status. HCT outcomes other than polyneuropathy from part of this cohort, including patients MLD-45 and MLD-50, were described previously. The local Institutional Review Board approved the study, and appropriate written consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki.",
        "Results": "    The four patients experiencing severe and rapidly progressing polyneuropathy shortly after HCT, which significantly contributed to their inability to walk or sit without support, are described in detail in the supplementary material. In summary, all had signs of a severe demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy on neurological examination and nerve conduction studies before HCT performed at the ages of two years in patients MLD-45 and MLD-50, 14 years in MLD-87, and 23 years in MLD-62. Cognitive function was normal for age in MLD-45, MLD-50, and MLD-62 and below average but in line with school level and stable in MLD-87. An overview of patient characteristics, test results, and treatment details before and after HCT is presented in Table 1. All patients achieved full-donor chimerism in blood at 1 month post-HCT. Post-HCT course was complicated by multiple viral infections, acute-GvHD varying from grade 1 (MLD-45 and MLD-50) to grade 3 (MLD-62), diabetes dysregulation (only in MLD-62), and slow restitution of T lymphocytes (only in MLD-45).\n\n    In MLD-45, post-HCT complications resulted in delayed tapering of prednisone and replacement of cyclosporine with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Her first episode of polyneuropathy progression occurred at 9 months post-HCT when MMF was tapered. A second episode of polyneuropathy progression was observed at 15 months post-HCT after tapering both MMF and prednisone. The differential diagnosis during both episodes included MLD flare-up, neurological GvHD or another (auto)immune-mediated cause, including Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Brain MRI and cognitive function were stable since the first MRI at 6 months post-HCT showed initial worsening of white matter abnormalities and cerebral atrophy (LOES score increase from 3 to 8). No signs of infection or GvHD of other organs existed. During the first episode, an initial dose of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) did not have clinical effects, but after increasing prednisone dose and restarting MMF a clear clinical improvement was observed. The second episode improved upon a combination treatment of IVIG and MMF. After 13 months, treatment with IVIG was aborted as no further improvement was observed. Treatment with MMF was stopped 2 years later as her polyneuropathy continued to slowly progress. At that time, her brain white matter abnormalities were still stable compared to pre-HCT. Until her passing at 11 years post-HCT, she remained interactive but severely disabled, primarily due to her polyneuropathy. Infrequent spasms suggested the presence of pyramidal symptoms, which were mitigated by her polyneuropathy.\n\n    In MLD-50, a slight increase in polyneuropathy was noticed 3 weeks post-HCT, leading to delayed tapering of prednisone with subsequent clinical improvement. A second episode of polyneuropathy progression occurred at 3 months post-HCT after he had a viral infection parallel to decreasing his prednisone dose. Differential diagnoses included MLD flare-up, CMV reactivation, another viral infection, GvHD, or another (auto)immune-mediated cause, including GBS and CIDP. Besides low serum IgG, additional test results were normal. Brain MRI showed white matter abnormalities as expected in the immediate period after treatment (LOES score increase from 2 to 12). Clinical improvement was observed after treatment with one dose of IVIG and increasing prednisone dose. When at 9 months post-HCT prednisone tapering was resumed and another viral infection occurred, he suffered from a third episode of polyneuropathy progression not responding to IVIG, corticosteroids and MMF. Blood examination indicated a mild (viral) infection; lumbar puncture and chest X-ray were negative. Repeated brain MRI showed progression of the white matter abnormalities and severe atrophy (LOES score increase to 20). He died 10 months post-HCT from respiratory failure.\n\n    In MLD-62, a severe deterioration of polyneuropathy was observed during the first three post-HCT weeks. The differential diagnosis included GBS, CIDP, neurological GvHD, or MLD flare-up after HCT. Blood examinations were normal, lumbar puncture showed elevated protein and leukocytes. Treatment with methylprednisolone and IVIG resulted in rapid improvement. Two months later, he was hospitalized for multiple respiratory and intestinal viral infections, intestinal GvHD flare-up and pancytopenia. GvHD treatment with MMF was aborted, while cyclosporine tapering was slowed. Another three weeks later, he developed a second episode of rapid polyneuropathy progression and became wheelchair bound within one day. Treatment with IVIG was restarted after three weeks of empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy and varying dosages of prednisone and hydrocortisone, albeit without immediate clinical effect. Another four weeks later, his motor function showed rapid clinical improvement. Subsequently, his peripheral neuropathy continued to deteriorate gradually, while his brain MRI abnormalities remained stable following an initial increase in the LOES score from 12 to 16 six months post-HCT, with a follow-up of 5.4 years.\n\n    In MLD-87, a sudden worsening of polyneuropathy was noticed 7 weeks post-HCT, starting with fever from a line-associated coagulase negative staphylococcal bacteremia. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in full recovery of function to pre-HCT level except for an incapacitating tremor of both arms. Although additional test results were suggestive of a Holmes-like tremor, a peripheral origin of the tremor could not be excluded. Her tremor decreased slightly after stopping cyclosporine as GvHD prophylaxis. Treatment effects of propranolol and levodopa/carbidopa were unsatisfying. Nearly three years post-HCT, her tremor remains incapacitating, while her overall motor and cognitive functions, as well as her nerve conduction studies and brain MRI abnormalities:following an initial increase in the LOES score from 11 to 20 within 6 months post-HCT:have remained stable ever since. The timelines of progression of polyneuropathy and immunomodulatory treatments before and in the first year after HCT are shown for all four patients in Fig. 1.\n\n    In MLD-45 and MLD-50, examination of the sural nerve was performed at the second episode of polyneuropathy progression and postmortem, respectively. Findings are displayed in Fig. 2. Histopathology showed a segmental demyelinating neuropathy with signs of remyelination, secondary axonal degeneration, and sparse perineural and intraneural macrophages and CD3 + T lymphocytes without significant inflammatory infiltration. All macrophages were patient-derived and loaded with sulfatides. No donor macrophages were present in the nerve tissue, in contrast to brain white matter in MLD-50, where presence of donor cells could be confirmed. Patient-derived and donor-derived lymphocytes could not be distinguished, but based on the full-donor chimerism in blood of both patients it was most likely that all tissue lymphocytes were probably donor-derived.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We describe four patients with MLD with significant clinical progression of polyneuropathy after HCT, in parallel with tapering of their immunosuppressive drugs and in three of them with stable brain MRI at the time. Treatment with steroids (prednisone/prednisolone), MMF and IVIG led to partial clinical improvement/stabilization, but not sustained stabilization of polyneuropathy, except for one. The presence of T lymphocytes in the neuronal and surrounding tissue, which is not observed in untreated patients with MLD, in combination with the initial beneficial effects of immunomodulatory drugs suggest a partially (auto)immune-mediated cause of rapid polyneuropathy progression in these transplanted patients with pre-existent MLD induced demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n\n    Several MLD cases concurring with or mimicking immune-mediated demyelinating diseases have previously been published, including GBS (n = 9), CIDP (n = 8), multiple encephalopathic episodes (n = 2) and attacks of acute tumefactive cerebral lesions (n = 4). None of these patients had been treated with HCT at the time of these manifestations.\n\n    The patients reported here had all been treated with allogenic HCT. Immune-mediated demyelination is a known complication of HCT. After HCT, a decrease in immune tolerance while awaiting immune reconstitution may foster the emergence of an immune-mediated demyelinating disease, either induced by auto-reactive patient cells or alloreactive donor-derived cells. In light of the previously published non-transplanted cases, pre-existing MLD-related damage to the nerves and brain may render individuals with MLD generally more susceptible to (auto)immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. In addition, the higher rate of infections during the immunosuppression period may increase the risk of GBS or CIDP.\n\n    Immune-mediated polyneuropathies after HCT are typically classified as GBS or CIDP in association with GvHD (GvHD-associated GBS/CIDP) or as GBS or CIDP due to an aberrant immunological response to antecedent infection (classical GBS/CIDP). Comparable to our patients, symptoms of both GvHD-associated and classical GBS/CIDP often emerge after immunosuppressive drug tapering, and recovery after treatment varies. Treatment response is probably dependent on the underlying pathology, with classical GBS/CIDP responding better to IVIG and plasma exchange and GvHD-associated GBS/CIDP to corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and MMF. Distinction between classical and GvHD-associated GBS/CIDP can, however, be difficult as they share pathological features and GvHD-associated GBS/CIDP may develop when other GvHD manifestations are absent. CSF examination is often normal except for elevated protein level, which is common in MLD. Nerve biopsy might be helpful as significant infiltration of donor-derived (alloreactive) CD8 + T lymphocytes would support GvHD-associated GBS/CIDP and its absence classical GBS/CIDP. Nonetheless, classical GBS due to CMV infection after HCT can also be mediated by peripheral expansion of CD8 + T lymphocytes. In addition, an autoimmune mechanism could also be sustained by residual patient's plasma cells producing autoantibodies and a decrease in immune tolerance. We advise close clinical monitoring of signs of infection and (systemic) GvHD, and careful consideration of repeat electroneurography and possibly peripheral nerve biopsy in these patients. Additionally, the option of repeated skin biopsies for morphological analysis of dermal myelinated nerve fibers could also be considered. Gaining further insight into the progression of peripheral neuropathy may improve tailored therapy in individual cases and enhance our understanding of MLD pathophysiology.\n\n    Our patients had a history of (low-grade) acute-GvHD and a temporal relationship between tapering of immunosuppression, worsening of polyneuropathy, and improvement after reinitiating immunosuppression, suggesting GvHD-associated GBS/CIDP. In MLD-45, this was supported by the lack of an infection. Nevertheless, examination of the sural nerve of MLD-45 and MLD-50 did not reveal significant infiltration of probably donor-derived T lymphocytes. Instead, the macrophages present were all patient-derived, suggesting classical GBS/CIDP. Especially classical CIDP may respond to steroids and MMF, and antecedent infections might be absent. Treatment response to IVIG in MLD-45, MLD-62, and MLD-87 although temporarily, additionally supports classical GBS/CIDP as (partial) cause of rapid progression after HCT. In addition, MLD-50 had multiple viral infections and a history of CMV reactivation after HCT, one of the most common viral triggers of GBS. The lack of treatment response to IVIG in this patient might be explained by insufficient dosing based on treating low IgG serum levels and not GBS. In MLD-62, no sural nerve biopsy was performed and the presence of both intestinal GvHD flare-up and several viral infections prior to the progression of polyneuropathy further complicates a retrospective diagnosis. Importantly, his history of type 1 diabetes and blood glucose dysregulation after HCT could have played an additional role for fluctuation of polyneuropathy. Although rapid improvement of peripheral nerve function due to better control of blood glucose levels is unlikely, diabetes type 1 is a potential risk factor for CIDP and other autoimmune disorders.\n\n    Given that sural nerve biopsies revealed no metabolic competent donor macrophages, in contrast to post-HCT brain white matter, and only one patient experienced sustained stabilization of polyneuropathy following treatment, it is highly probable that MLD disease progression contributes significantly to the long-term deterioration of polyneuropathy in transplanted patients with MLD, despite stable white matter abnormalities observed on brain MRI. Neither HCT nor immunomodulatory drugs appear to mitigate this progression. Indeed, in late-infantile cases (MLD-45 and MLD-50), rapid polyneuropathy progression aligns with the expected natural course of the disease at their ages. Importantly, such cases would likely not be considered suitable candidates for HCT today due to its inefficacy in late-infantile MLD. Pre-symptomatic late-infantile and pre- and early-symptomatic early-juvenile patients are now eligible for treatment with atidarsagene autotemcel (Libmeldy , Orchard Therapeutics), an ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell-based gene therapy that produces a functional version of the ASA enzyme at supra-physiological concentrations. Fumagalli et al. demonstrated that late-infantile patients treated with atidarsagene autotemcel exhibited significantly improved nerve conduction velocities compared to age-matched natural history control patients at 2 and 3 years post-treatment, although results in early-juvenile patients were variable. Notably, no cases of rapid polyneuropathy progression shortly after treatment with atidarsagene autotemcel have been documented thus far, indicating the potential for genetically modified blood cells to migrate into the peripheral nervous system and differentiate into ASA-producing endoneural macrophages. Alternatively, the elevated levels of ASA achieved by the therapy may facilitate enzyme penetration of the peripheral nerves.\n\n    The typical course of polyneuropathy progression in late-juvenile and adult MLD generally remains stable. However, it is plausible that polyneuropathy progression was triggered post-HCT, akin to the previously documented progression of white matter abnormalities and atrophy on brain MRI within the first year post-treatment. HCT-related drug toxicity, particularly cyclosporine, may have additionally contributed to the rapid progression of polyneuropathy in all patients. Nonetheless, it's noteworthy that most drug-induced toxic neuropathies are axonal in origin and tend to improve rather than worsen following cessation of the offending drug.\n\n    An important limitation of our study is the lack of a definitive cause for peripheral neuropathy. This emphasizes the challenge of characterizing progressive polyneuropathy in HCT-treated patients with MLD and the need for additional research. Another limitation is that, due to the retrospective study design, our findings rely on the accuracy of the patient records and on the performed tests and treatments in a clinical care setting, e.g., no nerve conduction study at time of clinical polyneuropathy progression was performed in MLD-50 and MLD-62. In addition, no nerve biopsy was performed in MLD-62 and MLD-87, and it is uncertain if the observed T lymphocytes in the biopsies of MLD-45 and MLD-50 are donor- or patient-derived, although the latter is less likely considering the short lifespan of T lymphocytes and full-donor chimerism in blood of all patients achieved months before examination. Besides this, it is impossible to establish cause and effect. The goal of this paper was to gain more knowledge on progressive polyneuropathy shortly after HCT. Therefore, we did not compare patients with and without progression of polyneuropathy following HCT.\n\n    Lastly, it is important to highlight that the long-term disability observed in our patients was influenced by the involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Similar to the cases of patients MLD-4 and MLD-37 described by Al-Saady et al., we observed signs of slowly progressive pyramidal symptoms in MLD-45 and MLD-62, as well as gradual cognitive decline in MLD-62 during long-term follow-up.\n\n    In conclusion, characterizing progressive demyelinating neuropathy, as occurring in some MLD patients treated with HCT, is challenging. Why central and peripheral myelin behave differently in response to HCT, is not understood. This knowledge gap needs to be filled to help physicians making the correct diagnosis and selecting the most effective treatment. Severe peripheral neuropathy is immensely debilitating. The findings in our transplanted patients with rapid polyneuropathy progression parallel with tapering of their immunosuppressive drugs suggest a partially (auto)immune-mediated pathology. Therefore, it might be considered to add or increase immunomodulatory drugs in patients with MLD and progressive polyneuropathy following HCT, especially during periods of suspected immune activation such as infection, and GvHD.\n\n    Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.",

        "Title": "    Genetic landscape of Romanian PPGLs",
        "Abstract": "    Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumours that originate from chromaffin cells and occur in the adrenal medulla and in the sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia. Nearly 70% of PPGLs result from germline or somatic mutations in a single driver gene. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic background and clinical characteristics related to genetic profile of patients with PPGLs from Romania. We retrospectively retrieved data of 125 patients consecutively registered, diagnosed with PPGLs in a tertiary referral center of endocrinology from Romania, between 1976 and 2022. We identified 88 (70.4%) women, and 37 (29.6%) men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.5 +- 15 years. From these 125 patients, 80 (64%) were submitted to the genomic study; 35% (n = 28) had a germline mutation (20 RET, 3 VHL, 1 SDHB, 1 NF1, 1 SDHD, 1 FANCA, 1 CASR) while 65% (n = 52) presented sporadic disease. Patients with hereditary disease had significantly lower age at diagnosis comparing to sporadic cases (37 +- 15 vs. 49.9 +- 12.2 years, p = 0.001). Bilateral tumors developed in twelve patients from the hereditary group. Metastatic disease was described in 4 out of 80 patients (2 of them with hereditary disease). Patients from sporadic group tended to have a right lateralisation of the tumour compared to hereditary cases, where the tumour was more often left sided. RET pathogenic variant (p.Cys634Trp) associated with MEN2A syndrome was the most prevalent in Romanian population with PPGLs and could be considered as a founder effect. Patients with hereditary disease are diagnosed at a younger age and develop bilateral tumors more frequently compared to sporadic cases.",
        "Introduction": "    Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumours that originate from chromaffin cells and occur in adrenal medulla and in sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia. Comprehensive molecular analysis revealed that PPGLs have a remarkable diversity of driver alteration including germline and somatic mutations. Despite a low incidence (0.8/100.000), over one-third of PPGLs are associated with inheritable syndromes:the highest heritability rate among solid tumours. Currently, nearly 70% of PPGLs result from germline or somatic pathogenic variants (PVs) in a single driver gene.\n\n    According to their transcriptional pattern, mutations involved in PPGLs are allocated to 3 clusters.\n\n    Cluster 1 includes genes related to the Krebs cycle. Characteristic genes are those from SDHx complex (SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD), FH, MDH2, GOT2, IDH1, SCLC25A11, EPAS1 and VHL. The presence of germline or somatic PVs in these genes leads directly or indirectly to dysregulation in HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha, generating pseudohypoxia, increased angiogenesis and cell proliferation.\n\n    Cluster 2 has signature activation of MAP kinase signalling pathways. The following mutated genes are included in cluster 2: NF1, RET, HRAS and TMEM127.\n\n    These mutations lead to overactivation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1)/p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), and RAS/RAF/ERK signalling pathways, generating overactivation of cellular growth, angiogenesis and survival.\n\n    Cluster 3 (identified by the Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]) is caused by dysregulation in Wnt pathways and include only somatic mutations with an increased risk of metastatic PPGLs.\n\n    Approximately 50%-60% of hereditary cases belong to cluster 1 while 40%-50% to cluster 2.\n\n    A combination of particular demographic, geographical, and historical conditions has led to a diverse and specific geographical distribution of the genotype and subsequent phenotype of these tumours. For Romania, there is no report yet about the genetic landscape of these tumours.\n\n    In this study, we aim to characterize, for the first time, the genetic background and clinical characteristics related to the genetic profile of patients with PPGLs from Romania.",
        "Methods": "    Retrospective data of 125 patients consecutively registered, diagnosed with PPGLs in a Tertiary Referral Center of Endocrinology from Romania, between 1976 and 2022 were retrieved. The inclusion criteria was confirmation of PPGL by histopathology.\n\n    Patient data included age at diagnosis, gender, previous history and family history of PPGLs, presence of syndromic presentation, measurements of plasma and urinary normetanephrine (NMN) and metanephrine (MN), information about tumour locations and lateralisation, dimensions, histopathology and genetic testing results (germline panel by NGS or Sanger genetic screening of the RET proto-oncogene, if the case had a typical MEN2A syndrome). Patients were diagnosed with PPGLs due to: (I) incidental finding of adrenal/extra-adrenal tumours, and/or (II) symptoms-based diagnosis and/or (III) genetic screening because they had first-degree relatives with a hereditary PPGL.\n\n    Most of the DNA samples from peripheral blood cells were stocked in our biobank before the study begun. In some of the patients, the DNA was extracted during the study process. In total, we had the DNA from 80 patients. The rest of them were either lost to follow-up or diagnosed before the era of genetic testing begun. All the genetic tests were performed after year 2000.\n\n    DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells following a standard method.\n\n    Patients with classic MEN2A/MEN2B phenotypes and atrisk relatives underwent direct analysis of the RET proto-oncogene, and the remained samples were submitted to complete Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in a Genetic Laboratory from Hungary. Oligonucleotide primers for the amplification of different RET exons were designed at intronic sequences flanking exons 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. PCRs were performed in a final volume of 25 muL containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1 U Taq polymerase, 1 mM specific primers and using 100 or 200 ng of genomic DNA as input. The NGS sequencing was done using a commercial cancer panel:Trusight Hereditary Cancer Panel:targeting 113 genes from Illumina . The analysis included identification of germline pathogenic genetic variants, copy number variations (CNV).\n\n    This panel covered genes related to PPGLs (VHL, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, NF1, MAX, TMEM127, HIF1A, FH, CDKN1B, MET, PPKAR1A) and other non-PPGLs related genes. Somatic DNA was extracted only in four patients, and the genetic test using NGS custom panel was performed for them. The results for these patients will be presented in Table VI.\n\n    According to the results from NGS tests, in agreement with the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), we classified the patients into two groups: pathogenic variant group (PV) and sporadic. In the sporadic group were also included patients with variants of unknown significance (VUS). They will be presented as Table 6. The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients were recruited under study protocols approved by the appropriate local institutional review boards or ethics committees of our centre. Informed consent for genetic analyses and use of existing clinical data was obtained from all patients.\n\n    All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY: USA). Descriptive analysis included absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies and summary measures [mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum and interquartile range (IQR)]. We used Student T test, Pearson's chi 2 test or Fisher's exact test when necessary to compare proportions. Two-sided p value was significant if less than 0.05.",
        "Results": "    In the study were included 125 patients with PPGLs with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.5 +- 15 years. Eighty-eight (70.4%) were women and 37 (29.6%) men; median follow-up duration was 3 (0-38) years (Table 1). From these 125 patients, 80 (64%) were submitted to the genomic study. The genetic landscape of those 80 PPGL patients submitted to the genomic study showed the following:\n\n    Germline mutations were identified in 35% (n = 28) of the tested patients (20 RET, 3 VHL, 1 SDHB, 1 NF1, 1 SDHD, 1 FANCA, 1 CASR), and 65% (n = 52) were sporadic (Table 2).\n\n    At diagnosis, patients with PV were younger compared to those from the sporadic group (37 +- 15 vs. 49.9 +- 12.2 p = 0.001). In PV group we identified 18 (64%) women and 10 (36%) men. In sporadic group 39 (75%) were women and 13 men (25%). All the patients from PV group presented with PHEOs while in sporadic group, 4 (7.6%) patients had PGLs (1 glomus caroticum, 1 pulmonary, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 Zuckerkandl) and 48 (92%) PHEOs (29 right, 19 left). Bilateral tumors (synchronous and metachronous) were identified in 12 patients (9.6%). All of them were hereditary cases. Metastatic disease was described in 4 (5%) out of 80 patients (2 of them with hereditary disease) (Table 3). We did not find any difference in tumour diameter or catecholamine levels in sporadic versus hereditary cases. Patients from sporadic group tended to have a right lateralisation of the tumour compared to hereditary cases, where the tumour was more often left sided, but without a significant difference between the two groups (Table 3).\n\n    Some of the patients from sporadic group had characteristics of potentially hereditary disease as described in Table 7.\n\n    The rest of 36 %, n = 46 from all the cohort were not tested due to lack of DNA material. Mean age for non-tested patients was 52 +- 16 years old, 34F, 12M.\n\n    Overall, we found a 13.6% recurrence rate. Patients with pathogenic variant had a recurrence rate of 26.7 %, compared to 15.2 % of patients with a sporadic background. Clinical characteristics of each group of patients are as follows.\n\n    Patients with RET PV represented 71.4% (n=20) out of patients with PV and 25% of the tested patients.\n\n    In 75% of RET cases (15/20), a mutation in codon 634 was identified [p.Cys634Trp (55.5%), p.Cys634Arg/Tyr 22.2%/16.6%], while 20% (4/20) patients had a mutation in codon 618 [p.Cys618Arg (75%), and p.Cys618Tyr (25%)], and one case in codon 631 (p.Asp631Tyr).\n\n    All patients presented with MEN2A syndrome. Twelve (60%) were women and 8 (40%) men. Mean age of diagnosis for all the group was 36.5 +- 11.5 years old. Mean age at diagnosis for patients with mutation in 634 codon was non-significantly lower compared to patients with 618 codon mutation (34 +- 10.9 vs. 40.5 +- 8 years). The patient with mutation in codon 631 was diagnosed with PHEO at 51 years old. Nine patients developed bilateral tumours. Five of them were diagnosed due to genetic screening. In 10 patients, PHEO was the first manifestation of the syndrome, all of them with mutation in 634 codon. Two of them presented with metastatic disease. Median follow-up duration was 8 (IQR 11.5) years.\n\n    Three (3.75%) out of 80 patients representing 15% out of patients with PV had VHL (vonHippel Lindau) syndrome. Two patients had VHL2A (mother and daughter) and 1 VHL2C. Patients with VHL2A-associated PHEO with hemangioblastomas of the nervous system. The third patient had only PHEO, without any other manifestation of the syndrome, but with a family history of hypophyseal adenoma (her mother). None of them developed renal clear cell carcinoma at a median follow-up duration of 5 (range: 38-3) years. Mean age of diagnosis was 12.3 +- 2.3 years; all were women. All three patients had synchronous bilateral tumours. None was malignant.\n\n    One patient with VHL2A died due to complications related to VHL syndrome (hemangioblastomas, back spine tumours). The third patient was disease-free at 10 years of follow-up.\n\n    Patient with neurofibromatosis had 39 years old at diagnosis of a left PHEO with noradrenergic secretion pattern. He also had clinical signs of neurofibromatosis but no other tumours.\n\n    One patient with SDHB and VUS of MLH 1 had 36 years old at the diagnosis of a right PHEO, and no recurrence at 7 years from the diagnosis. He had no family history of PHEOs.\n\n    Patient aged 57 years, with left PHEO and noradrenergic pattern. She also presented with hepatic and renal cysts. She had no family history of PHEOs or history of calcium metabolism abnormalities.\n\n    Patient diagnosed at 56 years old with left PHEO and noradrenergic secretion pattern had renal and splenic cysts.\n\n    Patient aged 53 years old was diagnosed with right PHEO with noradrenergic secretion pattern. He did not develop any other diseases related to FANCA gene mutations at 9 years of follow-up, but had a daughter with hepatocarcinoma.\n\n    In patients with VUS, the mean age at diagnosis was 51.9 +- 12 years, 6M, 13F. All of them presented with PHEO, 12 right and 7 left. From those 19 patients with VUS, 4 had less than 40 years old at the time of diagnosis. In the following rows, we will present the patients with VUS and clinical aspects of hereditary disease. One patient (MSH 6 c.1474A > G) associated PHEO with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. One patient (BRIP 1 c.728 T > C) had malignant PHEO, with an aggressive pattern and family history of colonic cancer. One patient had clinical phenotype of neurofibromatosis. She had 35 years at diagnosis, and her son has clinical features of neurofibromatosis. In her case, we identified a somatic mutation of NF1 (c.7966del) and germline VUS of MSH2 + ATM c.1134_1136delAGA+ c.1444A > C. One patient (MEN1 c.526G > T) associated PHEO and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and 2 other had PHEO and idiopathic hypercalcemia (RB2 c.644C > T), respectively, primary hyperparathyroidism (ATM c.5639C > T). Another patient, with PHEO, papillary thyroid carcinoma and colonic polyps, had a VUS of BARD1 (c.1333G > A). Among patients with VUS, there are some likely pathogenic variants: MEN1 c.563C > T; SDHA c.1937_1938insACAAAACT.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our study is the first report that summarized genetic landscape of patients with PPGLs from Romania. RET (p.Cys634Trp) PV associated to MEN2A syndrome is the most prevalent in Romanian population therefore this finding could be considered as a founder effect. Patients with hereditary disease were diagnosed in younger age and, presented bilateral tumors more frequently compared to sporadic cases. Most of them were women.\n\n    Among patients with sporadic disease, including VUS, there are some clinical features suggestive for a syndrome, which were not described earlier. For this category of patients, further reports, even functional testing of the genes should be applied in order to categorize them as a PV.\n\n    In summary, PPGLs have a high genetic determinism, and there is still a lot to discover about their genotype-phenotype correlations. A new entity of patients with PPGLs that have a VUS and clinical aspects of hereditary disease is up to be explored.\n\n    While every cohort report brings new characteristics for these patients, the already known classification of PPGLs will stand for new changes. Although genetic test is achieved in about 75%-80% of patients diagnosed with PPGLs, the genetic profile of these patients remains unknown in a significant percentage of cases.",
        "Discussion": "    To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the germline genetic profile of PPGLs from Romania. In the study were included 125 patients from a single tertiary referral centre. The percentage of patients with germline PV was 35%, similar to the last studies where the percentages ranged between 35% and 50%. In our cohort, the most prevalent mutation was in RET, followed by the VHL gene.\n\n    However, patients included in the study originated from the most important centre of endocrinology from Romania, where only RET gene is tested. MEN2A is a syndrome related to other endocrine diseases; therefore, when a patient has a suspicion of MTC, or hyperparathyroidism, he is redirected to our centre. This may have produced some referral bias resulting in a higher frequency of RET PV.\n\n    As other reports, our results confirm that there is a geographical pattern of distribution in PV. For instance, SDHx genes predominate among Western European population (SDHB in the Spanish population and SDHD in the Flemish population), while the Brazilian population has a predominance in RET PV similar to Romania. The Chinese population, on the other hand, has fewer germline variants than Europeans. Some reports have demonstrated that RET PV profile may also vary according to geographical area. As this is the first report of patients with PPGLs from Romania and one of the few reports with this topic from Eastern Europe, RET p.Cys634Trp variant could be considered as a founder effect for the Romanian population. Further studies should be carried out to clarify this issue. Other studies from Mediterranean basin, reporting the genetic background of MEN2A syndrome, found that the most prevalent variant was RET p.Cys634Tyr in a cohort from Spain and Italy. While in Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Cyprus and Turkey, the most reported RET variant was p.Cys634Arg. In the Spanish cohort, RET p.Cys634Trp (our variant) was associated to a lower PHEO penetrance.\n\n    Furthermore, in a large Brasilian cohort, RET p.Cys634Gly variant was most frequently described. Similar results as in our cohort, with a predominance of PHEO expression in p.Cys634Trp mutation (80% of patients with PHEO had this variant, similar to our finding), were described in a study from 2007 developed in the USA, including a large cohort of patients with MEN2A.\n\n    As expected, patients with PV had a younger age at diagnosis than those with VUS or sporadic, consistent with previous reports. Female gender is predominant in this study, in keeping with previous reports, but there are also few studies indicating an equal gender balance.\n\n    PHEOs develop in about 50% of patients with MEN2A, usually around the age of 30-40 years. This was also proved in our cohort, with an earlier penetrance of PHEO in codon 634 than in 618 or 631. This finding is consistent with previous studies. It is known that approximately 60% of patients with MEN2A develop bilateral PHEOs. In our cohort, 45% of the patients presented with bilateral PHEOs, most of all with metachronous tumour. Based on this aspect, patients with RET PV need to be carefully followed as they can develop a second tumour, up to 20 years after the first diagnosis. The particularity of this group of patients is one patient with mutation in 634 codon, multiple recurrences and metastatic PHEO, non-responsive to 131-I-MIBG (metaiodobenylguadinine) treatment. This patient had a form of MEN2A with lichen amyloidosis.\n\n    In our cohort, VHL syndrome was identified in the two decades of life, earlier than any other PV identified. In the literature, the mean age at diagnosis of PHEOs with VHL syndrome is 30 years, while in our cohort, the mean age at diagnosis was 12.3 +- 2.3 years.\n\n    The presence of bilateral tumours in patients with VHL is not an unexpected finding. Approximately 35%-60% of the patients with VHL have bilateral tumours. Interestingly, all of our patients with VHL had synchronous bilateral tumours already in paediatric age.\n\n    The two variants of VHL syndrome described in our cohort are considered to be rare based on population cohorts in the Genome Aggregation Database. In the literature, p.Arg82Leu segregated with bilateral PHEOs in families without any other manifestation of the disease and originated de novo in at least one family. However, in our cohort, this variant was associated with hemangioblastomas. The third patient had an even rarer variant (p.Arg161Glu) which was firstly described in 1995 and was associated with multiple VHL tumours and to isolated PHEO as well. In our case, this patient developed only PHEO.\n\n    He had a PV associated with the classical form of NF1. He had all the clinical signs of NF1, but no other tumours. He inherited this PV from his mother who also had a PHEO. It is reported that PHEO in NF1 PV stands out in the 4th and 5th decades of life. Our patient aged 39 years at the time of diagnosis, older than the mean age for patients with RET or VHL. Our patient did not develop malignant disease at 10 years of follow-up. However, in the literature, at least one case of NF1 with metastases after 20 years of follow-up is described.\n\n    We found a unique association between a SDHB pathogenic variant and a VUS of MLH1 in a patient with PHEO diagnosed at 36 years old; he did not develop metastatic disease at 7 years of follow-up. However, early genetic characterization of his siblings is critical considering the SDHB malignancy-associated risk.\n\n    For SDHD and FANCA, we found large deletions that could not been identified with NGS. Both presented with PHEO and had no family history of PHEOs. It is known that SDHD mutation is more often associated with head and neck paragangliomas, and FANCA mutation is associated with Fanconi anaemia. Our patient with SDHD developed PHEO and the other one with FANCA mutation was anaemia-free.\n\n    CASR c.1856_1857delTT PV is a novel variant that was not earlier described in patients with PHEO based on Genome Aggregation Database This patient had no calcium or parathormone abnormalities.\n\n    About these two mutations (FANCA and CASR), we rather think that this is a coincidental finding, as CASR and FANCA genes were never related to PPGLs.\n\n    Regarding patients with VUS, we will further discuss only cases with potentially hereditary treats.\n\n    This variant was previously reported in patients with Lynch syndrome and in one patient with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, but in any patient with PPGLs or pulmonary adenocarcinoma.\n\n    In one patient with malignant PHEO and family history of colonic cancer, we identified BRIP 1 (c.728 T > C). This variant was identified in patients with breast and ovarian cancer as well as in patients with colorectal cancer, but not in patients with PPGLs.\n\n    This association of genes was never described in patients with PPGLs. This variant of MSH gene was not described in any database, while this ATM variant was observed in individuals with breast and colon cancers and in a breast cancer study. Our patient, clinically presented with a NF1 phenotype and somatic mutation in NF1.\n\n    This variant was observed in some patients with MEN1 syndrome but was not described earlier in patients with PHEOs. Our patient did not have the signs of MEN1 syndrome but had familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. This association could be a part of a syndrome.\n\n    ATM (c.5639C > T) was previously described in 1 out of 13.087 cases of breast cancer in the UK but was not related to PHEO., In our cohort, this variant was associated with a case of PHEO and primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\n    This alteration was reported in a Romanian breast cancer cases meeting where 1 out of 130 cases presented this variant. This variant was also reported in 2 of 1197 individuals with personal and/or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancers, but in the literature it was not associated with PHEO or papillary thyroid carcinoma, as our patient presented.\n\n    This variant was not previously described in the Human Genome Database. Our patient associated right PHEO with idiopathic hypercalcemia.\n\n    For patients with sporadic PHEOs, we can see that some of them developed other tumours that are suggestive for a syndrome, as well as family history of non-PPGLs tumours. This finding suggests that the genetic landscape of PPGLs needs more exploration and that other mutations, which were not covered by the gene panel, could be involved in those patients, or that gene fusions are a reasonable variant as well.",

        "Title": "    Cardiac Genetic Investigation of Sudden Infant and Early Childhood Death: A Study From Victims to Families",
        "Abstract": "    Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death up to age 1. Sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) is similar but affects mostly toddlers aged 1 to 4. SUDC is rarer than SIDS, and although cardiogenetic testing (molecular autopsy) identifies an underlying cause in a fraction of SIDS, less is known about SUDC.\n\n    Seventy-seven SIDS and 16 SUDC cases underwent molecular autopsy with 25 definitive-evidence arrhythmia-associated genes. In 18 cases, another 76 genes with varying degrees of evidence were analyzed. Parents were offered cascade screening. Double-blind review of clinical-genetic data established genotype-phenotype correlations. The yield of likely pathogenic variants in the 25 genes was higher in SUDC than in SIDS (18.8% [3/16] versus 2.6% [2/77], respectively; P=0.03), whereas novel/ultra-rare variants of uncertain significance were comparably represented. Rare variants of uncertain significance and likely benign variants were found only in SIDS. In cases with expanded analyses, likely pathogenic/likely benign variants stemmed only from definitive-evidence genes, whereas all other genes contributed only variants of uncertain significance. Among 24 parents screened, variant status and phenotype largely agreed, and 3 cases positively correlated for cardiac channelopathies. Genotype-phenotype correlations significantly aided variant adjudication.\n\n    Genetic yield is higher in SUDC than in SIDS although, in both, it is contributed only by definitive-evidence genes. SIDS/SUDC cascade family screening facilitates establishment or dismissal of a diagnosis through definitive variant adjudication indicating that anonymity is no longer justifiable. Channelopathies may underlie a relevant fraction of SUDC. Binary classifications of genetic causality (pathogenic versus benign) could not always be adequate.",
        "Introduction": "",
        "Methods": "    The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n    The study was supported and organized by the Lullaby Trust (London, UK), a registered charity operating nationwide across England and Wales. The study's main partners were the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals and Sheffield Children's National Health Service Foundation Trust (SCH) in Sheffield, UK, and the Istituto Auxologico Italiano (IAI), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, in Milan, Italy. Case samples were obtained through consecutive referrals from the Lullaby Trust, originating either from coroners at SCH or from other collaborating hospitals in the United Kingdom. SCH initially provided to the IAI linked anonymized tissue samples obtained during autopsy of victims with SIDS/SUDC, whose parents had consented for the tissue to be used in the joint research study conducted by the 2 partners.\n\n    The study population comprised 104 unrelated cases of infants and young children, collected between 2011 and 2018, whose death was classified as SIDS or SUDC according to the coroners' reports and for whom comprehensive autopsies, including histological, toxicological, and microbiological examinations, were performed, in addition to evaluations of medical and family history, and to investigations as to the circumstances of death. Self-reported race was White (specifically, White-British, according to the ethnic groups adopted by the 2021 Census of England and Wales) in all but 5 cases for which race or ethnicity information was not available.\n\n    The study was approved by the respective institutional review boards. Bilateral material transfer agreements were established for the transfer of samples, written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples obtained during autopsy with the QIAamp DNA Mini kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). DNA concentrations were measured fluorometrically with the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen). Genetic testing was performed through next-generation sequencing (NGS) on a MiSeq platform (Illumina) mainly with a custom amplicon NGS panel (TruSeq Custom Amplicon, TSCA, Illumina) targeting 21 channelopathies and cardiomyopathy genes with mostly definitive or strong evidence of association to inherited cardiac diseases, such as LQTS, CPVT, BrS, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy etc, as previously described (Table S1). Moreover, the 3 calmodulin genes CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3, as well as the gap junction protein alpha 1 GJA1 gene, were screened with NGS in all samples through a Nextera XT assay (Illumina; Table S1).\n\n    The last 18 samples enrolled in the study were sequenced with a commercially available expanded NGS panel (TruSight Cardio, Illumina) and, in addition to the 25 genes in common with the custom NGS panel/assay, another 76 genes with varying degrees of disease association were also analyzed (Table S2). The only definitive-evidence nonsyndromic genes not targeted by this panel were FLNC and TECRL. In-house pipelines were created according to Broad Institute's Genome Analysis Toolkit Best Practices recommendations with custom scripts in Bash (Data S1).\n\n    Several databases and web-based resources were used for the prioritization and classification of genetic variants (Data S1). Allelic frequencies were obtained through the 1000 Genomes browser and the gnomAD browser (v.2.1.1). As a first step, the genetic data set was interrogated for rare nonsynonymous variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) that fell below the SIDS incidence (ie, 0.3:1000 live births), as reported by the United Kingdom's Office of National Statistics for the year that enrollment in the study was concluded. This resulted in a first-step filter of MAF<0.00015 for rare variants, and ultra-rare genetic variants with a MAF<0.00005 were prioritized at a second step. In the additional 76 genes of the expanded NGS analysis, only ultra-rare variants were assessed. Variant status and potential clinical significance were evaluated with the use of several publicly available and licensed databases, in silico pathogenicity meta scores, as well as published literature (Data S1). Classification of genetic variants was performed in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. All rare genetic variants identified by NGS were validated with Sanger DNA sequencing at the IAI in Milan, Italy, and in some cases were further validated by the Sheffield Diagnostic Genetics Service in Sheffield, UK, before being communicated to the victims' families.\n\n    As per the study's protocol, the parents of victims with SIDS/SUDC consented to be informed of the results of the study in case a genotype-positive genetic test result were obtained and opted for the possibility to be called back to undergo clinical and genetic cascade family screening. Most parents opted to be informed of the test result even if the results were considered inconclusive. For this purpose, SCH maintained a joint follow-up SIDS/SUDC clinic toward the conclusion of the study where parents were informed of the genetic tests results of the deceased infants, were subjected to clinical examinations, or were referred to perform these at their place of residence, while also providing DNA samples for cascade genetic screening. Clinical examinations included an ECG and, depending on the case, 24-hour Holter ECG, signal-averaged ECG, echocardiogram, and exercise stress test (EST). Parental DNA samples were sent for genetic screening at the IAI in Milan, Italy, and targeted variant analysis was performed through direct Sanger sequencing. Parental genetic results were then again validated by the Sheffield Diagnostic Genetics Service in Sheffield, UK.\n\n    At the conclusion of all genetic analyses, carrier status of the parents for the variants found in the SIDS/SUDC cases were communicated to the SCH partners while the latter shared with the IAI the clinical data that had been obtained from the clinical family screening. At that stage, a double-blind review of the clinical and genetic data was performed. Genetic and clinical data were first reviewed separately for each genotype-positive case and the respective parents. The reviewers of the clinical data (P.J.S. and L.C.) were blinded as to the gene or the classification status of the genetic variant involved, as well as to its parental origin, and the reviewers of the genetic data (M.C.K. and M.T.) were blinded as to the clinical status of either parent. This resulted, for each case, in the simultaneous and reciprocal disclosure of the potential diagnosis, suspicion, or dismissal of a cardiac disease in a parent, with the disclosure of the genetic variant identified in the subject, its classification, and its parental origin.\n\n    Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 28.0. Continuous variables are summarized as mean+-SD, median, and range. Categorical variables are presented as absolute (n) and relative frequencies (%) and compared among groups with Fisher's exact test. A 2-sided P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binomial exact 95% CI are provided for the estimated genetic yield in SUDC versus SIDS cases.",
        "Results": "    The initial study population included 104 unrelated SIDS/SUDC cases. We applied stringently the age cutoff of 1 year as a criterion for a SIDS definition, while reserving the SUDC definition for all cases exceeding 1 year, even by just 1 day. In the whole cohort, there were 88 SIDS cases (56 male, 64%) with an age range at the time of death of 2 to 365 days (mean 105+-88, median 76 days). The remaining 16 were SUDC cases (10 male, 62.5%), with an age range at the time of death of 12.0 to 54.1 months (mean 23.6+-11.1, median 20.5 months). In 11 SIDS cases, DNA integrity was low, and this resulted in partial genetic analyses (Data S1).\n\n    Complete genetic analyses were possible in 93 SIDS/SUDC cases. These underwent NGS of 25 major arrhythmia-associated genes (Table S1) with mostly definitive evidence of disease associations or specifically implicated in SIDS.\n\n    In the SIDS cohort (n=77), NGS of the 25 arrhythmia-associated genes yielded 25 rare nonsynonymous variants with a MAF<0.00015 in 24 SIDS cases (Table 1). Among these, there were 2 novel and 13 ultra-rare (MAF<0.00005) variants in 15 cases. Most genetic variants were missense, with only 3 being non-missense. In accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines, 2 variants were classified as likely pathogenic (LP), 21 variants were classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and 2 as likely benign (LB). Three VUS were further classified as favor nonpathogenic (FNP) according to expert judgment. Altogether, the yield of LP variants (n=2, 2.6%) was equal to that of novel VUS and of LB variants, with a higher yield of ultra-rare and rare VUS (n=11, 14.3% and n=8, 10.4%, respectively; Figure 1A).\n\n    Genetic analyses of the 25 major genes in the SUDC cohort (n=16) yielded in total 3 novel and 5 ultra-rare nonsynonymous variants in 7 SUDC cases (Table 2). Novel variants were contributed by the SCN5A, RYR2, and DSC2 genes in 3 cases. Most genetic variants were missense, with 2 being non-missense. American College of Medical Genetics variant classification adjudicated 3 variants as LP and 5 (2 novel, 3 ultra-rare) as VUS. Thus, the yield of LP variants in the SUDC cohort was 18.8% (3/16). Altogether, the yield of LP variants was equal to that of ultra-rare VUS (n=3, 18.8%), with a lower yield of novel VUS (n=2, 12.5%), whereas there was no yield of rare VUS or LB variants (Figure 1A).\n\n    Thus, among the 93 SIDS/SUDC cases, there was a significantly higher percentage of LP variants in SUDC cases with respect to SIDS (18.8% [95% CI, 4.0-45.6] versus 2.6% [95% CI, 0.32-9.1], respectively, P=0.03), whereas ultra-rare VUS (18.8% [95% CI, 4.0-45.6] versus 14.3% [95% CI, 7.4-24.1] respectively, P=0.70) and novel VUS (12.5% [95% CI, 1.6-38.3] versus 2.6% [95% CI, 0.32-9.1], respectively, P=0.14) were comparably represented in the 2 groups. Of note, all the 10 rare VUS and LB variants across the 25 major genes (10.4% and 2.6%, respectively) were contributed exclusively by SIDS cases and none were found in the 16 SUDC cases (Figure 1A).\n\n    In the whole cohort, across the 25 major genes, there were 8 genes (RYR2, LMNA, MYBPC3, DSC2, DSP, MYH7, KCNQ1, KCNH2) that yielded >1 rare variant, for a total of 29 variants, mostly represented by ultra-rare (n=16, 55.1%) and less frequently by rare (n=9, 31%) and novel variants (n=4, 13.8%). The RYR2 gene contributed most variants (n=7, 24.1%), of which 1 was novel, 5 were ultra-rare, and 1 was rare (Figure 1B). In fact, ultra-rare nonsynonymous RYR2 variants appeared to be overrepresented in the SIDS/SUDC cases with respect to the gnomAD population (RYR2 nonsynonymous ultra-rare alleles, 6/186 [3.22%] in cases versus 3890/282 912 [1.37%] in controls; P=0.04). No genetic variants were identified in the CALM1-3 and GJA1 genes.\n\n    For the last 18 cases enrolled in the study (15 SIDS, 3 SUDC), genetic analysis was extended to an additional 76 genes (Table S2), for a total of 101 genes, with varying degrees of association to inherited arrhythmias. However, the contribution of novel and ultra-rare genetic variants stemmed principally from genes with definitive evidence of disease associations (n=12, 63%), and secondarily from disputed genes (n=5, 26%; Figure 2A). The only gene that contributed >1 novel/ultra-rare variant, absent from the smaller 25-gene panel, was TTN (Table S3). Most important, LP and LB variants stemmed only from definitive-evidence genes (6/18, 33.3%), whereas limited, disputed, and noncurated genes contributed only VUS (5/18, 27.8%) (Figure 2B).\n\n    All genotype-positive SIDS/SUDC cases were communicated to SCH, along with a prioritization scheme for cascade family screening, according to the classification status of the variants identified in the infants (LP>VUS>LB). SCH then attempted to inform the respective parents, offering them the possibility to attend the follow-up SIDS/SUDC clinic. At the study's initiation, and after proper genetic counseling, many parents had opted to be informed of the genetic test result even if it were inconclusive or with unlikely causative genetic findings (ie, LB variants) and to aid in the variant adjudication process.\n\n    As such, after genetic analyses in the victims had been concluded, 24 parents of 13 victims with SIDS/SUDC were subjected to genetic and clinical cascade family screening, thus enabling genotype-phenotype correlations to be performed. Parental DNA screening of 22 parents for the variants found in the respective 11 infants revealed that these were of parental origin. In the remaining 2 cases, where only 1 parent attended follow-up and did not carry the respective variants, parental origin or de novo inheritance status could not be ascertained. Unfortunately, several families (some of whom with potentially clinically significant variants, such as novel) opted to be followed up locally at their place of residence and some could not be recontacted (see Limitations).\n\n    All genotype-phenotype correlations resulting from the double-blind review of the clinical and genetic data in the victims' families are shown in Table 3. Among families who underwent a complete evaluation, there was, in most cases, good agreement between initial variant classification status and clinical phenotype, that is, cases where the genetic variants had been originally classified as LP, LB, or VUS-FNP (cases S.011, S.051, S.059, S.103, S.117). In 3 cases (S.003, S.059, and S.113), the correlation was, to some degree, positive for LQTS and CPVT. In the other 3 cases, with KCNH2 and RYR2 VUS, the correlation was negative (S.024, S.068, S.090). Finally, in 3 cases (S.010, S.057, S.121), genotype-phenotype correlation could not be completed due to lack of parental data.\n\n    In 3 cases (S.003, S.059 and S.113), the correlation of genotype to phenotype was, at least in some degree, positive.\n\n    In the SIDS case S.003 (male, aged 6 days), a KCNH2 rare (MAF=0.0001205) variant (p.G903R) was identified that was initially classified as VUS. This variant has an equivocal VUS classification from 7 laboratories in ClinVar (VCV000067428.23, last accessed March 2023). It was originally identified in 3 patients with LQTS then in 1 young child with sudden unexplained death and normal heart at autopsy, and with positive cosegregation for QT prolongation in 1 family member, as well as in 1 patient with unspecified arrhythmia. Because its MAF exceeds what would be expected for a monogenic disease-causing variant (ie, MAF<0.0001), it was recently dismissed as a potential monogenic cause of disease. More recently, an in vitro functional study showed a mild functional effect, with modestly accelerated deactivation of the mutant channel. Cascade family screening evidenced that the variant was inherited from the child's father. His ECG presented with several abnormalities but was not typical of LQTS. In our center in Milan, we have been recently following up a family (mother and adult son) with the KCNH2-p.G903R variant. They are both asymptomatic and have ECGs with borderline QT intervals (QTc=450 ms), which have, however, been found prolonged in Holter ECG recordings (mother, QTc=467 ms; son, QTc=453 ms in nocturnal hours). In addition, the mother presents with ventricular extrasystoles in Holter ECG and EST and has constant notched T waves. As such, our S.003 SIDS case was adjudicated as having a partially positive genotype-phenotype correlation (see Discussion).\n\n    In the SUDC case S.059 (male, aged 1.3 years), a KCNQ1 ultra-rare (MAF=0.00001205) variant (p.G460D) was identified that was classified as likely pathogenic. This variant has been previously described in a SADS case during molecular autopsy, and it affects an amino acid residue previously implicated in SIDS. Cascade family screening revealed that the variant was of maternal origin. The clinical workup of the father was unremarkable. The mother's ECG showed a borderline QTc in basal conditions but with a clearly pathological prolongation (QTc>550 ms) at the pre-EST ECG performed in the upright position, which often unmasks the impaired QT interval response to brisk standing. During the double-blind review process of this case, genotype and phenotype correlated positively for LQTS and the variant was adjudicated as LP/P. The SCH partners were informed with an indication to extend the screening to other family members/siblings, if any, to follow up the mother, and to initiate treatment with beta blockers.\n\n    In the SUDC case S.113 (male, aged 1 year and 19 days), 2 ultra-rare genetic variants were identified, in the RYR2 and DSP genes. The RYR2-p.T153I ultra-rare (MAF=0.00001809) genetic variant was initially classified as LP. This variant has been previously identified postmortem in at least 2 unrelated cases of SADS. The S.113 subject also carried the ultra-rare DSP-p.A2019S variant (MAF=0.00003898) that was classified as VUS. This variant was originally described in a patient with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, who fulfilled the task force diagnostic criteria, and with positive family history of SCD, but it has recently been questioned as a potential monogenic cause of disease. Cascade genetic screening revealed that both variants were inherited from the child's father. At follow-up, he was subjected to an ECG that showed QRS fragmentation in some leads. An echocardiogram showed mild dilatation of the left atrium and normal biventricular function; however, magnetic resonance imaging was not performed. At the EST, isolated polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles, but not repetitive forms, were observed at heart rates >125 bpm and disappeared during recovery.\n\n    Upon the double-blind review process, the clinical reviewers disclosed that the father had an exercise-induced arrhythmic phenotype, which, despite not fully reaching the criteria, was highly suggestive of CPVT. The disclosure that the father was a carrier of RYR2-LP and DSP-VUS variants adjudicated the case as having a positive genotype-phenotype correlation, although not of typical CPVT. A contribution to the arrhythmic phenotype by the DSP variant could not be excluded. The SCH partners were informed of these results with an indication to follow up, perform magnetic resonance imaging, and further extend the family screening, if applicable.\n\n    Among cases with a negative genotype-phenotype correlation there were cases S.051, S.068, and S.103.\n\n    In the SIDS case S.051 (female, aged 2 months), a KCNH2 rare (MAF=0.0001999) variant (p.E289K) was identified that was formally classified as VUS, but FNP according to expert judgment. The variant initially, under gnomAD v2.0.2, fell below the rare variant threshold set in the study but was found to exceed the cutoff when MAFs were interrogated again under gnomAD v2.1.1 at the study's conclusion. Because, in the meantime, cascade family screening had already been initiated, the case is presented here, without being considered in the genetic yield of the SIDS subgroup.\n\n    The variant was first reported in association to LQTS in a mutation update compendium. An in vitro functional study of the mutant channel showed normal cell surface channel expression, however, the biophysical properties of the mutant channel were not assessed. It was later identified in a SIDS case and classified as a VUS. The ClinVar database contains 9 entries of this variant with an equivocal VUS classification from different laboratories (VCV000067535.18, last accessed March 2023). In our S.051 SIDS case, the variant was of maternal origin. Her clinical workup was completely within normal limits and medical and family history were unremarkable. Genotype-phenotype correlation was thus negative and, post family screening, the variant was adjudicated as LB.\n\n    In the SUDC case S.103 (female, aged 1.5 years), we downgraded the RYR2-p.K2053R variant from VUS-FNP to LB due to lack of EST-induced arrhythmias in the S.103 carrier mother, taking also into account its MAF and lack of in silico support of pathogenicity. However, due to a QT interval prolongation observed during the recovery phase of EST, more data are needed to definitively adjudicate this variant as benign.\n\n    In the SIDS case S.068 (male, aged 1.3 months), carrying the RYR2-p.R4257Q variant that was initially classified as a VUS, a cardiomyopathy phenotype was present in the carrier mother that could not be fully evaluated clinically. Although the variant was downgraded to LB status post family screening in association with CPVT, there are some considerations to be made. First, there is anecdotal evidence of a RYR2-hypertrophic cardiomyopathy disease association (limited evidence hypertrophic cardiomyopathy gene). Second, the variant has been previously identified in a parent-child trio whole-exome sequencing study in a child with benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes and nocturnal seizures who also had an arrhythmic phenotype (sinus arrhythmia and atrial premature beats). Therefore, although \"acquitted\" for CPVT, this variant as well needs more data for a definitive adjudication of a benign role in disease.\n\n    Among the cases with incomplete clinical evaluation was the SUDC case S.010 (female, aged 1.6 years) carrying the novel SCN5A-p.S1964Y variant that was classified as VUS. The disclosure, however, of a history of febrile convulsions in the deceased infant upgraded the variant to a VUS-favor pathogenic status according to expert judgment. Residue 1964 has been previously implicated in BrS which may masquerade as febrile seizures in young children. In addition, inherited febrile seizures have been described in a significant proportion of SUDC. Unfortunately, the carrier father opted to perform the pharmacological provocation test at his place of residence and the result is not available.\n\n    Altogether, cascade family screening and the subsequent genotype-phenotype correlations, aided in downgrading 7 VUS to a LB/B classification status (S.011, S.024, S.051, S.068, S.090, S.103, and S.117), while upgrading 1 VUS and 2 LP variants to a LP/P (S.003, S.059, S.113) or VUS-favor pathogenic status (S.010). One variant in RYR2 was downgraded from VUS to LB/B specifically with respect to a CPVT phenotype (S.068); however, a potential role in arrhythmia susceptibility could not be completely excluded.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our findings should help steering research on sudden infant and early childhood death toward directions more likely to clarify the underlying causes. Most important is the evidence that, by overcoming case anonymity, which has dominated and bogged down SIDS research, it is possible to provide answers much needed by the grieving parents and essential to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death in the family members with the same disease-causing variant. When SIDS or SUDC are investigated in the setting of specialized and multidisciplinary research clinics, with appropriate procedures of counseling and consent in place, most parents appear willing to exercise their right to know and to also aid in the process of clarifying genetic ambiguities. In addition, our study brings SUDC to the foreground of SADS, not only because cardiogenetic investigations focused on the former may be particularly fruitful, but also because these may eventually aid in the identification of factors that, by operating in a time-limited manner, may shape different outcomes, such as SIDS or SUDC.",
        "Discussion": "    The present study, specifically designed to overcome the major stumbling block of anonymity thus far dominating sudden infant death research, has provided multiple novel findings. SUDC should be brought to the foreground of SADS investigations. The genetic yield in SIDS and SUDC stems principally from genes with definitive evidence of disease associations to inherited arrhythmia syndromes, such as LQTS, and CPVT, thus suggesting that molecular autopsy could be more rewarding if performed with definitive-gene panels. Rare variants in established genes should also be explored because this facilitates the definitive adjudication of such variants still populating the literature as VUS and it relays information on intermediate effect variants, possibly contributing to an oligogenic risk model. Finally, our study shows that anonymity hinders SIDS research without any benefit and whenever genetic results remain inconclusive, family screening may prove invaluable in determining variant pathogenicity, with implications that extend, beyond the child's family, to other patients carrying the same VUS.\n\n    In 2017, under the National Institutes of Health Clinical Genome Resource, an evidence-based gene curation framework for the assessment of the clinical relevance of genes was developed that assigned different levels of evidence of a gene-disease relationship. Interestingly, the recommended genes in the 2011 consensus document largely survived this reappraisal, while novel genes were added or disputed. We sequenced most cases with a custom NGS panel that had been designed endorsing the 2011 consensus document. The yield hereby reported (2.6% in SIDS and 18.8% in SUDC) stems only from definitive-evidence genes, although not all such genes were analyzed across the cohort. This implies that the yield could be higher in both SIDS and SUDC if all definitive-evidence genes are systematically screened. Comparisons of yield with other studies, targeting genes with varying degrees of evidence of pathogenicity, are not readily feasible.\n\n    The expanded panel used in our last 18 cases was commercialized around 2015 and, despite being highly performing, includes many genes that have now limited or disputed evidence of pathogenicity (Table S2). However, the yield of novel or ultra-rare variants from such genes was minimal. The fact that LP or LB variants were contributed exclusively by definitive-evidence genes, whereas disputed and limited-evidence genes yielded only VUS, likely reflects both the concept of weaker disease associations and our inability to attribute causality to variants in such genes. This altogether indicates that molecular autopsy should preferably be performed either through panels targeting definitive-evidence genes, for which variant interpretation is more feasible and clinically actionable, either exome- or genome-wide, but in parent-child trios or with family screening available, to uncover novel disease associations.\n\n    The gene in our cohort that contributed most novel, ultra-rare, and rare variants was RYR2, with an overrepresentation of ultra-rare variants in cases with respect to gnomAD, whereas cascade family screening was possible in 4/6 cases harboring such variants. Among these, we adjudicated only 1 case as having a positive genotype-phenotype correlation (S.113) due to an exercise-induced arrhythmic phenotype suggestive for CPVT. Given the presence of polymorphic ventricular premature beats in the EST of the carrier father, we confirmed the RYR2-p.T153I variant as LP post family screening.\n\n    The role of RYR2 in SIDS has been previously demonstrated both in human and animal studies, although overrepresentation of ultra-rare RYR2 variants in cases has been previously reported in SADS. In rare cases of RYR2-associated CPVT, genotype-positive family members may not present inducible arrhythmias in EST, but may nevertheless later experience cardiac events. Moreover, CPVT may include also atypical forms, associated with loss-of-function RYR2 variants, where ventricular fibrillation occurs in the absence of complex arrhythmias upon adrenergic stimulation. These are important considerations for RYR2 variant adjudication given that the tolerability of RYR2 to genetic variation could, probably in a few cases, incorrectly lead to dismissal of pathogenicity of novel/ultra-rare genetic variants.\n\n    No pathogenic or rare genetic variants were identified in GJA1-encoded connexin43, a gap junction previously implicated in SIDS with support from molecular and functional data, demonstrating that it is a minor player in SIDS pathogenesis. We, as others, did not identify any clinically relevant variants in the CALM1-3 and TRDN genes in our SIDS or SUDC (<=4.5 years) cases. Although CALM1-3 pathogenic variants seem thus far not to contribute to SIDS, they may, however, be identified in a small fraction of sudden unexplained death in the young (<10 years). In the study that focused also on a 1- to 5-year-old SUDC subgroup, in the few cases that the CALM genes were screened, no clinically relevant variants were identified either. This could be partly explained by the lack of significant numbers in SUDC cohorts, impeding the possibility of identifying such a rare disease as calmodulinopathy, and the fact that infants with calmodulinopathy manifest with extreme phenotypes that, in many cases, are likely to come to medical attention before a sentinel event occurs. Another possible explanation could be related to the differential expression of the CALM genes between fetal, infant, and adult stages of development. However, in the International Calmodulinopathy Registry, SUDC represents a small subgroup (9/140) of an already rare clinical entity, and among these 9 cases, all CALM genes are represented.\n\n    In the 18 cases in which the TTN gene was screened with the expanded panel, we identified 1 novel and 5 previously described ultra-rare TTN missense variants in 6 cases that were classified as either VUS or LB. In one such case (S.117, TTN-p.R4160S), cascade family screening aided in adjudicating the variant as probably benign. Because TTN seems not to be an important contributor to the rare dilated cardiomyopathy infantile forms, TTN variants, especially missense, are expected to result in extremely low clinical actionability in the setting of SIDS or SUDC.\n\n    The upgrade of the novel SCN5A-p.S1964Y VUS to VUS-favor pathogenic in the S.010 SUDC case deserves a comment. The fact that inherited febrile seizures have been described in a significant proportion of SUDC, combined with BrS underlying some cases of febrile seizures in young children, implies that the traditional concept that BrS is unlikely to contribute to SIDS/SUDC should probably be reconsidered and the combination of SCN5A variants with febrile convulsions should be looked for.\n\n    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to overcome the obstacle of SIDS case anonymity and to include cascade family screening. Albeit with lower numbers than what we had envisioned, this has resulted in (1) a cardiogenetic diagnosis, or dismissal of a diagnosis, in some families and (2) providing evidence in favor or against pathogenicity of several variants, mostly VUS. These results strongly argue in favor of implementing procedures and regulations which, although safeguarding the victims' families, will allow to connect them with the molecular autopsy findings, because this may result in prevention of avoidable deaths.\n\n    To this end, we complied with all best-practice recommendations for molecular autopsy and family screening, that is, consent after expert genetic counseling, possibility to opt out, results confidentiality, and validation. Our study highlights that family screening postmolecular autopsy, in the setting of an expert multidisciplinary team, may have important implications for the clarification of inconclusive test results, such as VUS. Although a VUS, let alone a LB variant, cannot be used to initiate family screening in the setting of a purely genetic testing laboratory, it may be used in the setting of a specialized arrhythmia clinic. In the latter case, family genotype-phenotype correlations may prove invaluable in determining variant pathogenicity, thus avoiding further population of the literature with VUS, which would leave not only variants but also families in a genetic purgatory.\n\n    Besides infants with SIDS, we also included infants beyond 1 year of age, defined as SUDC, a definition more appropriate than SADS, because SUDC mostly affects children aged 1 to 4 years, while also sharing some epidemiological features with SIDS. This clear separation goes beyond semantics as the incidence of unexplained sudden death in the young follows the order of SIDS>SUDC>SADS, dropping dramatically after age 5, while rising again only after age 10 to 11.\n\n    The reported yield of expanded cardiogenetic testing in recent studies is 4.3% in SIDS5 and 13% in SADS. However, when SUDC is lumped under SADS, valuable information on yield, and thus causality, may be lost (such in a SADS cohort of 302 cases, with a median age of 24 years, where 5/40 cases carrying LP/P variants are children <4 years). Preliminary reports of cardiogenetic yield specifically in the SUDC age subgroup are comparable to ours: 16.2% (6/37) versus 18.8% (3/16) in our study (P=0.35). This warrants future studies to focus separately on this age subgroup, since SIDS and younger SUDC victims may share common causes and risk factors of SCD, which may easily be diluted when accounted for as unexplained SCD in the young.\n\n    Genetic yield in our SUDC subgroup was mostly contributed by male infants in the 1.0 to 1.3 years age range. One of these (S.059), carried the KCNQ1-p.G460D LP variant and there was positive family correlation for LQTS. It is tempting to speculate whether it was by chance or some other factor that this infant apparently escaped SIDS, just to undergo SUDC. We postulated long ago that asymmetry and immaturity of cardiac sympathetic innervation in infants, with REM sleep-related changes in sympathetic activity and heart rate, may influence arrhythmic risk. More recently, specific changes in differential expression of alternative ion channel spliceoforms (KCNQ1 included) were described to underline different developmental stages, thus potentially creating uniquely vulnerable, time-limited arrhythmogenic substrates. This fits with the triple-risk etiological model, in which 3 factors (a stress-related trigger, a biologically vulnerable infant, and a critical developmental period) converge for SIDS to occur. This altogether suggests that, depending on the nature and effects of underlying genetic and contributory factors, some infants may remain at high risk after the first year of life, whereas others, if they survive the vulnerable time window, may escape SCD.\n\n    Although the former group may represent those with highly penetrant pathogenic variants, the latter may represent those in whom SCD risk is shaped by oligogenic or polygenic genetic signatures made of variants with intermediate or lower effect sizes. Genome-wide molecular autopsies support this concept as younger victims with SCD harbor both more VUS as well as rare variants in cardiac disease genes than matched controls, whereas a burden of ultra-rare variants in channelopathies genes exists both in SIDS and SADS. Of note, in our study, despite the small sample size, all the 10 rare VUS and LB variants across the 25 major genes were contributed exclusively by SIDS cases and none were found in the 16 SUDC cases.\n\n    These considerations altogether readily imply that binary classifications of genetic causality (pathogenic or benign) may not be able to capture the whole spectrum of effect sizes variants may have on phenotype and, while we strive for being stringent in the search for monogenic causes, information on intermediate effect variants, possibly contributing to an oligogenic risk model, may be easily lost. For this reason, we have previously argued in favor of exploring not only ultra-rare, but also rare genetic variants in established arrhythmia-associated genes. As we show here, this may have 2 important implications: first, it may aid in the definitive adjudication of variants still populating the literature as VUS, such as the higher MAF KCNH2-p.E289K variant, previously identified in SIDS, which we initially classified as VUS-FNP. The higher MAF of this variant, particularly its even higher frequency among Black people in whom LQTS is exceedingly rare, in addition to a completely negative genotype-phenotype correlation here, altogether seem to \"acquit\" it as a monogenic cause of LQTS.\n\n    The second implication of also exploring rare variants is demonstrated in another SIDS case (S.003, KCNH2-p.G903R). The mild ECG abnormalities in the carrier father, as well as the mild QT prolongation and notched T waves observed in 2 of our own patients with this variant, appear to be in line with its recently demonstrated mild in vitro functional effect. Variants such as this challenge our ability to dichotomize causality in binary terms of pathogenic or benign, especially when, upon American College of Medical Genetics classification, neither the in vitro effect (PS3) nor the no effect (BS3) criterion can be safely applied. Although we do not demonstrate here that this variant was indeed SIDS causative, we postulate that such variants may contribute to an increased inherent arrhythmic risk, a risk that may be modulated differently in infant and adult life and shape different outcomes under the influence of extrinsic factors (eg, a QT prolonging drug). The definition of appropriate penetrance-based MAF-disease thresholds has been invaluable in avoiding overattribution of genetic causality, a long-term evil. However, with the risk of SCD being always probabilistic, the underlying genetic causes cannot be viewed as deterministic.\n\n    Our study has limitations. First, 2 definitive-evidence nonsyndromic genes, FLNC and TECRL, were not targeted by the expanded analysis, whereas the 25-gene panel contained only, but not all, definitive-evidence genes. Second, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to changes in living circumstances, such as relocation, several families opted to be followed up locally at their place of residence. This led to several cases with potentially clinically significant variants (eg, novel) missing cascade screening, thus diminishing the family screening capacity that we had envisioned for the study. In addition, family screening was restricted to the victims' parents, thus impeding the possibility of performing wider and more comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlations. Furthermore, another limitation is the small sample size of the SUDC cohort, which, however, also reflects the much lower incidence of SUDC with respect to SIDS. Moreover, epidemiological data were not systematically recorded across cases, thus not allowing us to present combined epidemiological data on our cohort.",

        "Title": "    Phenotypes in children with GNAO1 encephalopathy in China",
        "Abstract": "    The GNAO1 gene encodes the alpha-subunit (Galphao) of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of patients with GNAO1 pathogenic variations.\n\n    Ten patients with pathogenic variations in GNAO1 were enrolled from the Shenzhen Children's Hospital. Clinical data from several cases previously reported from China were also included and analyzed.\n\n    Twenty-seven patients with variations in GNAO1 were analyzed (10 patients from Shenzhen Children's Hospital, 17 patients from previously published studies) including 12 boys and 15 girls. The median age of onset was 3 months with moderate to severe global developmental delay. Nineteen different GNAO1 heterozygous variants were identified. Epilepsy was observed in 18 patients (67%, 18/27), movement disorder (MD) was observed in 22 patients (81%, 22/27), and both were seen in 13 patients (48%, 13/27). Seizures typically presented as focal seizures in all patients with epilepsy. MD typically presented as dystonia and chorea. Loss-of-function (LOF) or partial loss-of-function (PLOF) mutations were more frequent in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (p = 0.029). Interictal electroencephalograms showed multifocal or diffuse epileptiform discharges. The most common magnetic resonance imaging finding was widened extracerebral space. In contrast to MD, in which improvements were not common, seizures were easily controlled by anti-seizure medications. Severe dystonia in three patients was effectively treated by deep brain stimulation. Seven (26%, 7/27) patients died of respiratory complications, status dystonicus, choreoathetosis, or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.\n\n    We analyzed clinical data of 27 cases of GNAO1-related encephalopathy in China. MD seemed to be the central feature and was most difficult to control. LOF or PLOF variants were significantly associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The active intervention of severe dystonia may prevent death due to status dystonicus. However, future studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these results.",
        "Introduction": "    The GNAO1(MIM 139311) gene maps on chromosome 16q13 and encodes the Galphao subunit of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), which is present in many important G protein-coupled receptors, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type B, dopamine receptor D2, and A1 adenosine and alpha2-adrenergic receptors. The typical function of Galphao is the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). GNAO1 is widely expressed in the brain, especially in the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum, and plays an important role in neural development and synaptic transmission. Animal experiments have shown that GNAO1 knockout mice showed neurological symptoms such as tremors, seizures, abnormal behaviors, and movement disorders (MDs) and often died early.\n\n    In 2013, GNAO1-related encephalopathy was first reported in patients with Ohtahara syndrome and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 17 (EIEE17; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 615473). More recently, about 150 cases of GNAO1 variants associated with MD with or without seizures have been reported worldwide. Interestingly, Feng et al. reported a biochemical analysis of 15 different GNAO1 mutant alleles that revealed that loss-of-function (LOF) GNAO1 alleles were associated with epilepsy based on an inability to suppress cAMP production, whereas gain-of-function (GOF) or normal-function (NF) GNAO1 alleles were associated with MDs. In addition, developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) was correlated with LOF variants in a genotype-phenotype association analysis of 58 patients.\n\n    In the present study, we analyzed the genotypes and clinical phenotypes of ten patients with GNAO1 gene variants and data from 17 previously reported GNAO1-related encephalopathy cases from China. We analyzed possible genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with GNAO1 variants based on recent studies on the functional behavior of several GNAO1 variants.",
        "Methods": "    Ten patients with GNAO1 encephalopathy were enrolled from September 2020 to November 2022 at Shenzhen Children's Hospital (Shenzhen, China). The study protocol and consent documents were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Children's Hospital (No:202202001). Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the patients, and assent was obtained when appropriate. Patients were followed-up at the pediatric neurology clinic or via telephone.\n\n    Blood samples were collected from participants and both of their parents for whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, or targeted capture next-generation sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed for validation. Variant prediction and interpretation followed the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. We classified all variants into LOF, partial-loss-of-function (PLOF), GOF, NF, and unknown-function based on the inhibition of cAMP production in Galphao mutants. Furthermore, GNAO1 variants associated with disease were assessed for pathogenicity using several predictive bioinformatic tools: Mutation Taster (http://www.mutationtaster.org), Polyphen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), and SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org).\n\n    Clinical information was collected retrospectively from face-to-face and/or telephone interviews with patients, their families, or treating physicians. A questionnaire was developed to gather detailed information regarding sex, age at onset, family history, pre- and perinatal events, neurological symptoms, psychomotor development, cognitive function, neurological examination, treatments, and outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) data were also collected and reviewed by experienced pediatric neurologists. The follow-up period was terminated on January 30th, 2023 or at death.\n\n    Previously reported cases in the Chinese population were identified via the China Knowledge Network (https://cnki.net/), Wanfang Data (https://wanfangdata.com.cn/), and PubMed search using the keywords \"GNAO1\" and \"China.\" Clinical and molecular genetic data were obtained from the respective references after removing duplicate individuals.\n\n    The clinical data for all patients were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Continuous data are presented as median (range), and categorical data are presented as frequency (percentage). To test whether the associations of symptoms differed between GOF and LOF/PLOF, Fisher's exact test (2 x 2 contingency table) was used to analyze nonrandom associations between two categorical variables. Fisher's exact test was reliable for the small sample size in the present study. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA SE (v16.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    Ten patients were enrolled including three boys and seven girls. All patients were unrelated with negative family history for developmental delay (DD), epilepsy, or MD. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. In addition, clinical data from 17 patients with GNAO1 variants from previously published articles were included. A summary of the individuals with GNAO1 variants is provided in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n    Eight different variant types were observed in the ten included patients, including six reported variants, c.607G>A(p.G203R), c.709G>A(p.E237K), c.680C>T(p.A227V), c.143C>T(p.T48l), c.808A>G(p.N270D), c.133G>C(p.G45R), and two novel variants, c.140G>A(p.S47N), and c.717_723+1del. We identified 19 different GNAO1 heterozygous variants, including 17 missense variants, one deletion, and one splicing variant. The variants were found to occur de novo after testing the parental DNA in all patients. The most common variants identified were c.607G>A(p.Gly203Arg) (n = 4), c.709G>A(p.Glu237Lys) (n = 3), c.724-8G>A (n = 3), and c.143C>T(p.Thr48Ile) (n = 2). Membrane topology and distribution of their GNAO1 variants were predicted using the PROTTER program (http://wlab.ethz.ch/protter/start/; Figure 1). All variants were tested using the in silico variant prediction tools PolyPhen-2, Mutation Taster, and SIFT, and predicted to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. More detailed information on the GNAO1 gene is shown in Table 1.\n\n    The phenotypes of 27 patients (12 male, 15 female) with GNAO1 gene variants included 22 (81%, 22/27) patients with MD, 18 (67%, 18/27) patients with epilepsy, and 13 (48%, 13/27) patients with both MD and epilepsy. The median age of onset of symptoms was 3 months (range, 6 h to 4 years). The most common initial symptom was epileptic seizure (63%, 17/27) with a median onset age of 30 days. The median age of symptoms onset for the MD was 6 months. The clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1.\n\n    MDs presented as mixed hyperkinetic syndrome including dystonia, chorea, and orofacial dyskinesia. The median age of onset of MD was 8 months. Provoking factors for episodes included fever (patients 1 and 5) and emotional stimulus (patients 4, 8 and 9). Dystonia (91%, 20/22) was the most common form of MD, followed by chorea (32%, 7/22). Patients with variant sites in c.709G>A or c.724-8G>A only had MD but not epilepsy. In our cohort, two patients (patients 1 and 3) presented with generalized hypotonia, and patient 3 presented with appendicular hypertonia. Axial and appendicular hypertonia was observed in four patients (patients 4, 6, 8, and 9), with opisthotonos position in patients 6 and 8. Other children with dystonia showed single appendicular hypertonia (patient 2, 10) and thumb adduction (patient 7). Moreover, three patients presented with severe chorea (patients 1, 5, and 8).\n\n    Seizures typically presented as focal seizures in all patients with epilepsy, then progressed to multiple seizure types including epileptic spasm (50%, 9/18) and tonic seizures (33%, 6/18). The median age of oneset of epilepsy was 3 months. Two patients had status epilepticus events. Thirteen children developed DEE including nine patients with Infantile Epileptic Spasm Syndrome (IESS), and four with EIDEE. In our cohort, two patients presented with epilepsy in infancy, followed by chorea (patient 1) and dystonia in early childhood (patient 6). For patient 5, delay in motor and cognitive functions during childhood was observed by the parents. However, the patient developed episodic MD after fever at the age of 12, manifested by orofacial dyskinesia with sustained torsional movements of the extremities, and epileptic seizures began 2 months later.\n\n    Almost all patients had mild to severe DD, manifesting with motor, speech, and cognitive deficits in the first year of life. In our cohort, seven patients (patient 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) displayed severe global DD, with absence of head control, absence of speech, and intellectual disability throughout the entire disease course. In the other children, motor and language development, including head control, sitting, standing, walking, and speech skills, were also delayed but were better than in the other seven patients. Moreover, patient 5 was able to stand with help and speak (\"ba ba, ma ma\") until the age of 12 years, but was unable to walk independently. However, after the onset of MD, the patient was observed to have development regression manifesting with progressive inability to raise his head stably and loss of language function due to severe dystonia and chorea.\n\n    Genotype-phenotype associations were evaluated. Most of the mutation sites in patients with MD were located within or near the mutational hotspots (207-246 amino acid region). Of the 27 included cases, six carried GOF variants, six PLOF or LOF, one NF, and the remaining 14 carried variants whose functional effects were uncertain. Four clinical features, including epilepsy, DEE, MD, and death as final outcome were used to evaluate associations with different variant functions. LOF or PLOF variants were associated with a higher frequency of DEE compared with GOF or NF variants (p = 0.029). However, there were no statistically significant differences between GOF/NF and PLOF/LOF variants regarding epilepsy, MD, and death (Table 2).\n\n    Interictal EEG showed abnormalities in 19 patients. Focal or multifocal discharges involving the frontal, temporal, or occipital lobe or the central area were seen in all patients with epilepsy. Slow background activity was present in six patients, hypsarrhythmia in seven, and burst-suppression in four. MRI in most individuals showed normal results or no specific findings. Widened extracerebral space was seen in eight patients; other MRI findings included abnormal corpus callosum, arachnoid cysts, smaller temporal lobe gyrus, and white matter abnormalities.\n\n    The patients were followed-up for at least 3 months, and their ages ranged from 7 months to 18 years at the last follow-up. Among all available medications to control MDs, the most commonly used was levodopa (Table 2); others included gabapentin, tetrabenazine, trihexyphenidyl, and tizanidine. However, these medications did not effectively improve MD symptoms. Three patients (patients 25-27) with MD underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS). Globus pallidus interna (GPI) DBS was performed in patients 25 and 27, and subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS was performed in patient 26. Following surgery, both GPI and STN DBS were effective in improving dystonia symptoms. Seventeen children were treated with more than two anti-seizure medications (ASMs). The most frequently prescribed ASMs were valproate, topiramate, and levetiracetam. In addition, three patients were prescribed ketogenic diets but discontinued due to poor efficacy. At last follow-up, seizure-free status was obtained by treatment with multiple ASMs in five patients, seizure remission (reduction of seizure frequency >50%) occurred in two patients, and poor seizure control was seen in six patients.\n\n    Seven patients (26%) with GNAO1 variants experienced death, 3 patients from Shenzhen Children's Hospital and 4 patients from previously published studies, including 3 boys and 4 girls. Of these deceased patients, the median age at death was 2 years 3 months (ranged 10 months to 12 years 9 months). Three patients had the same variant (p.G203R) located in the hotspot of variants. The common causes of death were respiratory complications (3/7) and status dystonicus (SD) (3/7) (Table 3). Another cause of death was sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Pyrexia/infection is the commonest trigger for SD. In our cohort, Patient 1 and 2 presented with exacerbations of dystonia that were triggered by infection, lasting for hours to days ending up in dystonic state with rising creatine kinase and renal failure causing multiple organ dysfunction and death. Due to the young age, we were not able to perform deep brain stimulation (DBS). Patient 5 experienced hyperkinesia with dystonia and continuous choreoathetosis of the limbs and trunk at 12 years old. At age 12 years 9 months, he developed dyskinetic state triggered by an infection, requiring intensive care, with deep sedation. SD persisted, with rise in creatine kinase, leading to multisystemic deterioration and death.",
        "Conclusion": "    In the present study, our data support the findings that patients with GNAO1 variants usually present with MD, epilepsy, and DD at varying degrees. The age of onset in most individuals was infancy. MD seemed to be the central feature of GNAO1 encephalopathy, with an earlier age of onset than previously reported. LOF or PLOF variants were significantly associated with DEE. SD and respiratory complications were the main cause of GNAO1-related death. Further studies with a larger number of patients are needed to evaluate the possible genotype-phenotype correlations.",
        "Discussion": "    Galphao, encoded by the GNAO1 gene, could be involved in signal transduction processes of G proteins. Galpha binds with Gbetagamma and GDP in its initial state. Upon activation, Galpha exchanges GDP for GTP. Both the active Galpha-GTP and Gbetagamma subunits carry out separate downstream signaling. Many downstream targets of Galphao could lead to symptoms of epilepsy or MDs, including inhibiting the expression of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases cyclic cAMP production; N-type (Cav2.2) and P/Q type calcium channel (Cav2.1) activation; and stimulating the opening of inward rectifying potassium channels. cAMP signaling and neurotransmitter release affect many ongoing neural functions and neurological development. This could explain why most patients with GNAO1 variants exhibit DD.\n\n    Data were available on 27 patients with GNAO1 variants from China. The age of onset in most individuals was infancy. Our study showed that the DD phenotype was seen in almost all patients, consistent with previous reports. MD seemed to be the central feature of GNAO1 encephalopathy with high incidence (81%), and it was more difficult to control. The symptoms of attacks included dystonia, chorea, and orofacial dyskinesia. Triggers of attacks included fever and emotional agitation. In a recent article including 157 cases with GNAO1 variants, GNAO1-related MD usually starts during infancy or childhood, with a median age at onset of 26 months. We observed that the age of onset of MD was 8 months, which is earlier than previously published cases. At last follow up we found no parkinsonian features and ocular movement abnormalities which Novelli and colleagues reported. More than half of patients (67%) experienced seizures with multiple seizure types including focal seizures, tonic seizures, epileptic spasm, and myoclonic seizures. Among them, focal seizures were the most common seizure type. Epilepsy in the present cases was more easily controlled compared to MD, consistent with previous reports. GNAO1 encephalopathy was associated with IESS and EIDEE. EEGs were characterized by focal and multifocal epileptiform discharges, generalized sharp slow waves, hypsarrhythmia, and slow activity. However, the pathogenic variant frequency of GNAO1 in the Chinese population patients is still unknown due to a lack of large multicenter prospective cohort studies.\n\n    In our genotype-phenotype correlation study, we found that LOF or PLOF variants were associated with DEE, which is in agreement with previous observations. However, we found no statistical correlation between GOF variants and MD symptoms. Considering the small sample size collected herein, further study with a larger sample of patients with GNAO1 encephalopathy will be required to confirm the observed genotype-phenotype correlations. In a previous study, LOF variants, mostly involving GTPase, led to enhanced cAMP-mediated signaling and calcium channel activity, increasing excitatory neurotransmission and neuron hyperexcitability, which may explain the pathogenesis of GNAO1-related epilepsy. On the contrary, GOF variants, near the ribose and phosphate moieties of the bound GDP, may reduce the release of neurotransmitters, leading to MD. However, gene function is still unknown in about half of the patients. Obviously, regarding the biological activity of the GNAO1 gene, the ability to suppress cAMP production may not be present in all cases. Regarding striatal pathways, another mechanism to explain MDs relies on modifying inhibitory and stimulatory G protein-coupled receptor signaling to cAMP in Galphao. In addition, a model has been proposed through a combination of two principal mechanisms in GNAO1 disease, loss of signaling ability and dominant-negative interference.\n\n    Brain MRI showed no structural alterations and displayed widened extracerebral space in many patients with GNAO1 encephalopathy. According to most findings reported in the literature, brain MRI in many patients demonstrated delayed myelination, corpus callosum dysplasia, and brain atrophy. Symptoms worsen with age in some patients, accompanied by progressive brain atrophy. An autopsy was performed on a deceased child with the findings of periventricular gliosis, suggesting that a chronic neurodegenerative process could happen in patients with worsening MD.\n\n    In the data analyzed in the present study, nineteen patients with epilepsy received treatment with a combination of multiple ASMs. The most frequent ASMs were valproate, levetiracetam, and topiramate. For most of the patients, seizure remission was obtained with varying degrees of efficacy. Because norepinephrine-induced calcium-current inhibition is mediated by Galphao, Nakamura et al. suggested that epileptic seizures associated with GNAO1 variants might be improved by calcium-channel modulators such as pregabalin and gabapentin, which act as selective calcium-channel blockers, and topiramate, which modulates high-voltage-activated calcium channels in dentate granule cells. On the contrary, almost all patients with MD did not respond well to treatment. It has been reported that tetrabenazine and DBS were effective therapies for the treatment of MD associated with GNAO1. Tetrabenazine can deplete multiple amine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin). Moreover, variable effects on MDs have been reported with gabapentin, topiramate, and levodopa. Based on the fact that Galphao has been implicated in the regulation of many signals involved in epilepsy and MDs, it has been proposed that different approaches to therapy for different variants (agonists for LOF and antagonists for GOF mutants) may be a new therapeutic target for patients with GNAO1 variants. Also, while several drugs have shown efficacy in controlling symptoms of epilepsy or MDs, none of these drugs appeared to be able to alleviate developmental delays.\n\n    Among the cases of GNAO1 encephalopathy reported in China, three patients were treated with DBS. Patient 26 was first reported to receive STN DBS, and the postoperative Burk-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale score improved by 32% compared with the preoperative score, suggesting that STN may be used as the target of DBS. It has been previously reported that it is difficult to control status dystonicus even after one or more doses of drugs or sedatives. The fundamental goal of DBS is to alter pathological neural activity within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit. About 20 patients reported a reduced frequency and severity of MD exacerbations after GPI DBS. Patients undergoing GPI DBS were followed-up for 8-10 years by Koy et al. and Benato et al.. The results showed that MD symptoms were controlled well and there were no more episodes of status dystonicus, which demonstrated that DBS had a potential role to control and prevent status dystonicus.\n\n    Patients with GNAO1 pathogenic variants showed poor prognosis with a high mortality rate (26%). Seven patients died of SD and respiratory complications in individuals with GNAO1 variants in China. To date, 14 patients with variants died because of MD exacerbations, respiratory failure, and neurological deterioration. Several cases with similar causes of death have also been reported in the literature. Hence, we believe that SD and respiratory complications may be the most common causes of death. Pyrexia/infection is the most provoking factor. Therefore, it is important to prevent infections in children with drug-refractory MD. The active intervention of severe dystonia may prevent death due to SD. DBS has been shown to control and prevent refractory hyperkinetic crises, which can improve prognosis by reducing the length of hospitalization and preventing complications associated with disease and treatment. However, generally accepted inclusion criteria for DBS included unequivocal diagnosis of dystonia, medical treatment failure, and sufficient disability to the patient with more than 7 years old. For young children (less than 7 years old), it is worth thinking about considering early DBS for patients with drug-refractory MD. Finally, particular attention should also be paid to motor and speech development, mental health, and nutritional status.",

        "Title": "    Phenotype and mutation expansion of the PTPN23 associated disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and structural brain abnormalities",
        "Abstract": "    PTPN23 is a His-domain protein-tyrosine phosphatase implicated in ciliogenesis, the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, and RNA splicing. Until recently, no defined human phenotype had been associated with alterations in this gene. We identified and report a cohort of seven patients with either homozygous or compound heterozygous rare deleterious variants in PTPN23. Combined with four patients previously reported, a total of 11 patients with this disorder have now been identified. We expand the phenotypic and variation spectrum associated with defects in this gene. Patients have strong phenotypic overlap, suggesting a defined autosomal recessive syndrome caused by reduced function of PTPN23. Shared characteristics of affected individuals include developmental delay, brain abnormalities (mainly ventriculomegaly and/or brain atrophy), intellectual disability, spasticity, language disorder, microcephaly, optic atrophy, and seizures. We observe a broad range of variants across patients that are likely strongly reducing the expression or disrupting the function of the protein. However, we do not observe any patients with an allele combination predicted to result in complete loss of function of PTPN23, as this is likely incompatible with life, consistent with reported embryonic lethality in the mouse. None of the observed or reported variants are recurrent, although some have been identified in homozygosis in patients from consanguineous populations. This study expands the phenotypic and molecular spectrum of PTPN23 associated disease and identifies major shared features among patients affected with this disorder, while providing additional support to the important role of PTPN23 in human nervous and visual system development and function.",
        "Introduction": "    The wider application of genomic sequencing technologies, either through whole genome or whole exome sequencing (WES), has enabled the study and molecular characterization of many disorders not previously described. Genomic sequencing of cohorts of patients with shared major clinical features, such as developmental disorders, intellectual disability and developmental delay, brain malformations, congenital heart disease, or pulmonary hypertension has successfully identified causative genes, while at the same time demonstrating the genetic heterogeneity of these broadly defined disorders. Furthermore, novel genes associated with such disorders may be identified in these cohorts; however, burden of evidence can be challenging for new candidate genes if only one patient is identified with potentially disease causing variants in a yet unreported disease gene. Ideally, evidence in support of a novel gene-disease association can be attained by identifying additional patients with overlapping clinical features and the same or functionally similar variants in the novel candidate disease gene, while further defining the phenotypic spectrum of such novel rare disorders.\n\n    PTPN23 encodes the 1636 amino acid non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase type 23 that appears to be essential for endocytic trafficking. It interacts with ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes to sort ubiquitinated proteins into multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs). Depletion of the protein has been shown to cause accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the endosomes and disrupt the morphogenesis of MVBs. PTPN23 has been proposed as a tumor suppressor gene due to its apparent role in cell migration and proposed role in negatively regulating RAS mediated mitotic proliferation through its catalytically inactive C-terminal protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, independently from any PTP activity. Finally, it appears to be important for the endurance of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex by maintaining its phosphorylation. In mice, PTPN23 appears to be essential for embryogenesis, with embryonic lethality occurring at around E9.5, and significant abnormalities and smaller size observed at E8.5 in homozygous knock out embryos (Ptpn23-/-). During early embryonic development, it is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, especially in the mid and hindbrain, the optic and otic vesicles, and the ventricular layer of the forebrain. As development progresses, PTPN23 expression becomes broader, with some detectable expression across most organs. In adult mice, PTPN23 continues to be expressed in several brain regions including the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus. In addition, it has been shown that the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN23, Myopic (mop), is involved in neuronal specification and central nervous system development in this organism. Myopic has been shown to regulate neuropeptide secretion in the neuromuscular junction of the fly by selectively participating in the exocytosis of neuropeptide containing synaptic dense-core vesicles (DCVs) without affecting the release of small-molecule neurotransmitters from small synaptic vesicles (SSVs).\n\n    Until recently, protein altering variants in PTPN23 had not been linked with any described human phenotype. In 2015, Alazami et al. reported PTPN23 as one of 69 novel recessive candidate genes identified through WES of multiplex consanguineous families segregating neurogenetic disorders. In 2016, Trujillano et al. identified a second patient with a rare homozygous variant in PTPN23 within a cohort of 1000 families. More recently, Sowada et al. and Smigiel et al., separately reported two unrelated affected female probands with compound heterozygous variants in this gene. Here, we report an additional seven patients with biallelic rare variants in PTPN23 identified through WES analyses and multi-center international collaboration. The molecular and clinical characterization of this cohort confirms the gene-disease association of PTPN23 with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay and structural brain abnormalities, and expands the range of clinical features that may be observed in patients with this novel rare genetic disorder.",
        "Methods": "    Patients and family members included in this report were consented for genetic and genomic studies, publication of clinical and genotype data, and photography through Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols of the corresponding institutions. Patients are numbered according to their age at evaluation.\n\n    Proband 1 was evaluated at Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) in Washington, DC, USA. Previous testing included chromosomal microarray that revealed a 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion (Table 1). This 512 kb deletion is common (seen in about 1% of patients in whom a microarray is obtained for neurological problems), has low penetrance of about 10%, and was deemed to possibly explain only his developmental delay, but not the rest of his multisystemic phenotype. Parental testing was not obtained, although it is known that ~50% of all cases with this microdeletion inherited it from a parent with no known health or learning problems. Exome sequencing was performed through a commercial laboratory (Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratories).\n\n    Probands 2 and 4 are from unrelated families and were evaluated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Canada. Proband 2 had clinical exome sequencing performed through GeneDx. Proband 4 had chromosomal microarray analysis that was non-informative except for multiple regions of absence of heterozygosity (AOH) consistent with consanguinity in the family. Clinical exome sequencing for proband 4 was performed as a singleton through GeneDx.\n\n    Proband 3 was evaluated at Ochsner Medical Center in Jefferson, Louisiana, USA. He had uninformative chromosomal microarray analysis and fragile X testing. Clinical exome sequencing was performed through GeneDx.\n\n    Proband 5 was evaluated at Schneider's Children Medical Center (SCMC) in Israel. Previous testing included normal 46XX karyotype and chromosomal microarray. Proband was also tested for Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), which was negative. Research-based trio whole exome sequencing in the affected child and unaffected parents was performed in collaboration with the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) and analyzed as previously described.\n\n    Proband 6 was evaluated at Greenwood Genetic Center (GGC) in Greenwood, South Carolina, USA. Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed and showed a 440 kb gain variant of unknown significance (Table 1). This copy gain is within the common 15q13.3 micro-duplication/deletion region encompassing CHRNA7, mapping between breakpoints 4 and 5. Common 15q13.3 microduplications involving the CHRNA7 gene are suggested to be of uncertain clinical significance and incompletely penetrant. Follow-up qPCR studies demonstrated maternal inheritance of this micro-duplication CNV. Other negative results included Rett and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes testing.\n\n    Proband 7 was evaluated at the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences (DIBS) in Durham, North Carolina, USA. Previous molecular testing included normal 46XY karyotype, muscular dystrophy panel, and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome FISH testing. Biochemical studies included normal amino acids, urine organic acids, lactate, pyruvate, and acylcarnitine profiles. Clinical exome sequencing was also performed through GeneDx.\n\n    Proband 1 had clinical exome sequencing performed by Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratories. The methodology employed for exome sequencing was as follows: genomic DNA was fragmented by sonication and ligated to Illumina multiplexing paired-end adapters. For exome target enrichment and capture, the pre-capture library was hybridized in solution to the VCRome 2.1 target probes. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform for 100 bp paired-end reads to achieve at least >70% of reads aligned to target, and >95% of target bases covered at >20x with a mean coverage >100x. Sequence data was aligned to the GRCh37 (hg19) human genome reference sequence. Variants were interpreted according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines and patient phenotypes.\n\n    Probands 2, 3, 4, and 7 had clinical exome sequencing through GeneDx as follows. Using genomic DNA from the proband and parents (when available), the exonic regions and flanking splice junctions of the genome were captured using the SureSelect Human All Exon V4 (50 Mb), the Clinical Research Exome kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) or the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v1.0. Massively parallel (NextGen) sequencing was done on an Illumina system with 100 bp or greater paired-end reads. Reads were aligned to human genome build GRCh37/UCSC hg19 and analyzed for sequence variants using a custom-developed analysis tool. Additional sequencing technology and variant interpretation protocol has been previously described. The general assertion criteria for variant classification are publicly available on the GeneDx ClinVar submission page (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/submitters/26957/). Candidate variants were confirmed by Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing.\n\n    For patient 5, exome capture was performed using the IDT xGen reagent (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using v4 chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to achieve a minimum of 85% of the target bases covered at 20x or greater coverage. Sequence data was mapped and aligned to the human genome reference assembly GRCh38 (hg38). Called variants were annotated for their functional effects and predictions, conservation, and allele frequency in public and internal population databases. Standard quality control filters were applied for read depth (>=10x), genotype quality (>=30), and allelic balance (>=20%). Variants were filtered to exclude common, likely benign variants present in population databases (MAF <= 1%) and prioritized based on functional effect, deleteriousness potential, and inheritance pattern and segregation.\n\n    For patient 6, clinical whole exome sequencing was performed using the SureSelectXT Clinical Research Exome (CRE) capture kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500  Sequencing System (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) per the manufacturer's protocol. Sequences were processed using NextGENe software (SoftGenetics, LLC, State College, PA), and mapped to the February 2009 human reference assembly (GRCh37/hg19). Variants in the coding regions of the reference (and within 25 bp flanking) were retained if they had a read depth of >3x and a variant allele frequency of >=20%. Variants were filtered and analyzed using the Cartagenia Bench Lab NGS software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Variants not in the Human Genome Mutation Database (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) were filtered based on population frequency in public SNP databases, functional effect prediction, and HPO phenotype. Quality and allele frequency filters were used to isolate variants with at least 20x read depth and 22% minor allele frequency. Candidate variants were confirmed by Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing.\n\n    All identified variants reported here have been deposited under submission ID SUB5492409 (accession numbers SCV000927107 through SCV000927118) for public access through ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).",
        "Results": "    Through a combination of genomic sequencing studies, community data sharing, and multi-institutional collaboration, we have identified and characterized the largest cohort of patients with biallelic disease causing variants in the PTPN23 gene. The major clinical features in these patients are summarized below and in Table 1.\n\n    Proband 1 is a male child that presented for clinical evaluation at CNMC at 14 months of age due to developmental and motor delay. Gross and fine motor skills at 12.5 months corrected age were at 9 months. Brain MRI showed mild to moderate ventriculomegaly and enlarged subarachnoid spaces with communicating external hydrocephalus and mild decrease in cerebral volume; myelination was observed to be appropriate for age (Fig. 1A1 and A2). Proband also showed dysmorphic features including a flat occiput with brachycephaly, metopic ridging, left esotropia, arched eyebrows, and mild micrognathia. He had deep palmar creases with palmar pads, tracheoesophageal fistula, and mild left pelviectasis. WES analyses identified compound heterozygous missense variants (NM_015466.4:c.[2680 C > T];[2747 A > G], p.[(His894Tyr)];[(Gln916Arg)]) in PTPN23. Sanger confirmation and segregation showed that he had inherited the p.(His894Tyr) variant from his unaffected heterozygous father and the p.(Gln916Arg) variant from his unaffected heterozygous mother (Supplementary Material). Although these two missense variants appear to have low functional prediction scores using common in silico algorithms, both variants have high conservation scores in vertebrates and are very rare in available population cohorts (Table 2). The p.(His894Tyr) variant has been observed in 1 heterozygous individual in gnomAD (MAF = 0.000004206), whereas the p.(Gln916Arg) substitution has been observed in 8 heterozygotes in gnomAD (MAF = 0.00003382), with no reported homozygotes for either variant. Comparison of the clinical and radiological features, namely ventriculomegaly and decreased cerebral volume, in Proband 1 with other individuals identified with disease causing variants in PTPN23 in this report and in the literature further strengthened the likely diagnosis of PTPN23-associated disorder. However, the possibility of an alternative diagnosis cannot be completely excluded until further experimental evidence is provided for the PTPN23 variants identified.\n\n    Proband 2 is a male child evaluated at 2.5 years of age at CHEO. He was late to walk independently (~18 months) and remains very clumsy with bilateral intention tremor and shuffling gait at times, but not wide based. Speech was delayed with about 30 words at time of evaluation. He had an abnormal EEG (frequent isolated right parietal spike discharges) without overt seizures. Brain MRI performed at 2 years of age showed diffuse enlargement of the cerebral sulci and ventricular system which was suspicious for brain volume loss with prominent perivascular spaces (Fig. 1B2 and B3). He was short for his age, albeit not significantly (height: 89.5 cm; 15%, Z = -1.03). He had a prominent forehead and his palpebral fissures appeared subjectively short, but they were not formally measured. He had a prominent nasal root and a smooth philtrum with a thin upper lip, and low set ears that are somewhat simple, protruding, and cupped (Fig. 1B1). Hands and feet were unremarkable. He has a hypopigmented area ~4 cm in diameter on the left side of his neck that is best observed with a Woods lamp. Cardiorespiratory exam was normal. At 4.5 years of age he attends speech and occupational therapy at CHEO. Reportedly, his tremor significantly impacts his ability to feed himself and perform other fine motor tasks. Speech development has not improved significantly despite intensive therapy; he uses an iPad with communication software to indicate his basic needs. He does not appear to have any visual complaints; however no formal evaluation has been performed by an ophthalmologist. He has not developed seizures. Clinical WES identified compound heterozygous variants in PTPN23, a missense (NM_015466.4:c.3748 G > A, p.(Glu1250Lys)) variant inherited from his unaffected father and an in-frame deletion (NM_015466.4:c.2878_2889del12, p.(Gln960_Pro963del)) that was inherited from his unaffected mother (Supplementary Material). The maternally inherited in-frame deletion variant is novel and has not been previously reported, while the missense p.(Glu1250Lys) variant inherited from the father has been observed in 21 heterozygotes in gnomAD but no homozygotes (MAF = 0.00007454) (Table 2). This missense variant affects a highly conserved amino acid residue and is predicted to be deleterious by multiple bioinformatic algorithms (Fig. 2, Table 2).\n\n    Proband 3 is a male individual evaluated at Ochsner Medical Center at 6 years of age. He presented with developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and apraxia. He had a history of ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus. He was noted to have speech dyspraxia, hyperlexia, and a sensory processing disorder. He is mildly dysmorphic with synophrys, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and full lips (Fig. 1c). He had an unremarkable brain MRI and unremarkable selective spectroscopy of the brain. Clinical exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous missense variants in PTPN23 (NM_015466.4:c.[1291 C > T];[2486 C > T], p.[(Arg431Trp)];[(Pro829Leu)]). Sanger sequencing and segregation in the proband and both parents showed that the variants were in trans in the proband, having inherited the p.(Arg431Trp) variant from his unaffected heterozygous mother and the p.(Pro829Leu) from his unaffected father (Table 2, Supplementary Material).\n\n    Proband 4 was a 7-year-old female from a consanguineous Syrian family. Family history was significant for a similarly affected brother who died at 6 years of age in Syria. She had severe growth restriction; at 7 years OFC was 47 cm (-3SD), length was not measurable due to contractures, and weight was 11.1 kg (-4SD). She had spastic quadriparesis, scoliosis, and multiple large and small joint contractures. She was confined to a wheelchair with little purposeful movement and no head control. She had cataracts and significant visual impairment with abnormal eye movements and poor pupillary reactions to light. She had not attained language skills. She also had a history of recurrent infections and aspiration pneumonia. Dysmorphic features were notable for a long and narrow face with very prominent ears. Brain MRI was performed in Syria and results were unavailable, but parents recalled findings consistent with atrophy and possible lissencephaly. The patient passed away at 7 years of age. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous in-frame variant in PTPN23 (NM_015466.4:c.2568_2594del27; p.(Val857_Pro865del)) that was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Material). This in-frame deletion of nine amino acids of PTPN23 is novel and has not been observed in the heterozygous or homozygous state in any publicly available databases. Seven of the nine deleted amino acids are highly conserved in mammals and the variant is predicted to be deleterious for protein function. Of note, another rare homozygous variant of unknown significance in EOMES (NM_001278182.1:c.692 A > G; p.(Tyr231Cys)) was identified in linkage disequilibrium with the PTPN23 variant within the same region of homozygosity.\n\n    Proband 5 is a 10-year-old female from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from Israel. She was evaluated at SCMC due to developmental delay and mild intellectual disability. She has difficulty with social interactions. Brain MRI showed insular and parietoocipital polymicrogyria with partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and hypoplasia of the optic nerves. She was noted to be different in appearance to her parents with dysmorphic features including a long face, prominent forehead, malar hypoplasia, a long and smooth philtrum, a broad and long mouth with full lips, hypoplasia of ala nasi, anteverted nares, bulbous nasal tip, low-hanging collumela, posteriorly rotated ears, and narrow and high-arched palate (Fig. 1 D1 and D2). She had fetal fat pads and pes planus, but no skeletal abnormalities. Trio WES analysis identified a homozygous in-frame deletion of one amino acid variant (NM_015466.4: c.3884_3886delAGA; p.(1295_1296delLys)) in PTPN23 as the main candidate for the phenotype in this proband. Although this variant is an in-frame deletion of one amino acid, multiple species alignment shows that this Lysine at position 1296 of PTPN23 is extremely well-conserved, suggesting it might be relevant for the function of the protein. This variant has been previously reported and observed in 159 heterozygous individuals in gnomAD (MAF = 0.0005721) but no homozygotes. This variant is most prevalent in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals (MAF = 0.01273) consistent with the reported ancestry of this patient and her parents.\n\n    Proband 6 is a female patient of European ancestry with no reported parental consanguinity. She was evaluated at GGC due to developmental delay with regression at 2 years of age and carried a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. She is nonverbal at 11 years of age. She has microcephaly with delayed myelination and enlargement of the posterior left lateral ventricle, optic atrophy, and optic nerve hypoplasia observed on MRI. She also has spastic diplegia, hypotonia, contractures at the knees, femoral anteversion that was surgically corrected, slow gait with bent knees, and hyperreflexia with multiple beats of clonus at the ankles. Other features noted were constipation and past sleep problems that were resolved. EEG was normal and no seizure disorder was noted or reported. She was mildly dysmorphic with strabismus, thin eyebrows, prominent and wide-spaced upper incisors, broad mouth and full lips (Fig. 1E1 and E2). Narrow hands and feet were also noted. A homozygous frameshift variant (NM_015466.4:c.4651_4652dup; p.(Leu1552Hisfs*33)) in the last exon was identified in PTPN23 through trio exome sequencing. Because of its location, this frameshift variant in the last exon is expected, and further predicted through in silico methods, to escape nonsense mediated decay and result in a truncated protein product. Both parents were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers for this rare variant, which has not been reported elsewhere. Of note, this rare variant in PTPN23 was found to be embedded within a 14.3 Mb region of absence of heterozygosity (AOH) at 3p21.31p14.2 (Table 1). Total autosomal AOH for the proband was only 0.8% consistent with reported non-consanguinity of the parents; however, it is suggestive of the haplotype carrying this variant being identical by-descent in both parents.\n\n    Proband 7 is a 13-year-old Hispanic male evaluated at DIBS. He has a history of developmental delay and intellectual disability with bilateral brain atrophy observed on MRI. He has short stature, hypotonia, areflexia, neuromuscular scoliosis, and joint contractures. He had precocious puberty, central sleep apnea, and expressive language delay. He remains nonverbal. He has a history of intractable seizures that started at 2 years of age and complicated by apnea with insomnia and frequent sleep arousals. He is not particularly dysmorphic but does have strabismus. WES analysis identified three rare missense variants in PTPN23 in this proband. Two variants (NM_015466.4:c.[1748A > G; 3051 G > C], p.[(Lys583Arg); p.(Gln1017His)]) are in cis and were inherited from his unaffected mother. Both maternally inherited variants are rare, and neither could be definitely excluded; however, the p.(Gln1017His) variant is more frequent (MAF = 0.0002481) and has been observed in one homozygous individual in gnomAD. The residue being altered is also less well-conserved and the substitution is predicted to be more tolerated. Conversely, the p.(Lys583Arg) has been observed in 21 heterozygous individuals but no homozygotes in gnomAD (MAF = 0.00007427), the affected residue is highly conserved across species, and the amino acid change is predicted to be deleterious (Table 2). The proband also inherited in trans a missense (NM_015466.4:c.695 G > A; p.(Arg232Gln)) variant from his unaffected heterozygous father. This variant is also present in gnomAD (MAF = 0.00003892) but with no reported homozygous instances (Table 2).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The main clinical findings and features for the patients reported here and in the four previously reported patients are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Overall, we observe some major features shared among the majority of patients with biallelic protein altering variants in PTPN23, namely developmental delay (100%), intellectual disability (100%), brain abnormalities (91%), mostly characterized by brain atrophy with cerebral volume loss, ventriculomegaly, and delayed myelination; tone or movement disorder (82%), language absence or delay (82%), microcephaly (63%), and optic atrophy (54%). Interestingly, although seizures were one of the main findings in the initially reported patients, in our cohort this is not a consistent feature; only 2 of the 7 patients in our cohort were reported to have a history of febrile or intractable seizures, with an overall 54% of all patients reported to date having epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, epilepsy should not be considered a cardinal clinical sign for the diagnosis of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Dysmorphic features were observed among patients including prominent forehead, deep set eyes, strabismus, prominent ears, broad and flat nasal bridge with a broad nose tip, and a broad mouth with full lips.\n\n    PTPN23 is located in chromosome 3p21.3 and is composed of 24 exons. The variation spectrum that we observe in our cohort of patients includes missense (N = 8), frameshift (N = 1), and in-frame deletion variants (N = 3) (Fig. 2). The identified missense variants occur in highly conserved residues supporting their candidacy for affecting PTPN23 function (Fig. 2c). We do not observe a clear correlation between identified protein altering variants and disease severity across our patients and the reported cases. However, some of the homozygous individuals, such as Patient 4 in this report and the first patient reported by Alazami et al., and individuals with one predicted loss-of-function allele in trans of another non-truncating allele appear to be more severely affected. Furthermore, although in some cases compound heterozygosity for predicted loss-of-function, either nonsense or frameshift variants, in trans with rare predicted deleterious missense variants has been observed, no homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals with biallelic predicted loss-of-function variants have yet been reported by us or others. The only homozygous frameshift variant (NM_015466.4:c.[4651_4652dup]; p.(Leu1552Hisfs*33)) identified to date in our Patient 6 occurs in the last exon of the gene and it is predicted to escape nonsense mediated decay producing a smaller truncated protein product lacking the last 51 amino acids, with an aberrant C-terminal region. The absence of patients reported so far with biallelic loss-of-function variants would be consistent with the early embryonic lethality reported in homozygous knockout mice and therefore suggests that the rare missense and in-frame deletion variants identified in patients are likely hypomorphic alleles that may retain some functional activity of PTPN23 protein. Characterization of these variants at the molecular and biochemical level will help elucidate the precise functional effects on the protein. For example, Sowada et al. performed in silico modeling of the reported variants in PTPN23 and propose that the p.(Pro532Leu) variant likely alters the structure of the protein reducing its stability and affecting its sorting function. The p.(Arg1332Leu) variant is also predicted to disrupt the structure of the protein, primarily of the PTPase domain, by destabilizing the molecular interactions of this domain with other structurally relevant amino acids and with its substrates. Finally, the p.(Met302Val) variant is predicted to have a milder effect, mostly reducing protein stability and potentially altering binding to other proteins and protein complexes. More recently, Smigiel et al. functionally studied fibroblasts derived from their patient, carrying a predicted protein truncating variant in trans with a rare p.(Asn634Lys) missense variant. While they observed expression of the PTPN23 protein, they reported strongly reduced SMN accumulation in Cajal bodies versus increased nucleoplasmic levels of SMN in the patient derived cells compared to unaffected parent and control fibroblasts, in spite of similar SMN protein expression. Altogether, these analyses and observations support the hypothesis that disease associated variants that affect PTPN23 function are likely hypomorphic and suggest that residual PTPN23 function is necessary for human viability and early development; whereas, similarly to mouse, complete loss of function due to biallelic truncating variants in PTPN23 is likely lethal in humans.\n\n    Smigiel et al. suggest abnormal SNM phosphorylation and localization or impaired maturation of uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs) as possible mechanisms of disease for PTPN23 protein altering variants. However, the multiple processes in which PTPN23 has been implicated suggest that defects in this gene can lead to the observed phenotype through abnormal processing and trafficking of a wider variety of protein complexes, in addition to SMN. For example, impaired ESCRT function has been associated with intracellular accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that may aggregate in the brain and cause neuronal degeneration and microcephaly. In addition, PTPN23 has been nominated as a tumor suppressor candidate gene due to its apparent function in regulating cell migration and possibly autophagy. These functions could very well play a role in the structural brain abnormalities and microcephaly observed in individuals with biallelic variants in this gene that affect correct protein function.\n\n    While four patients had previously been identified and reported in the literature, the work presented here details the genetic and phenotypic analyses of the largest series of patients with biallelic disease causing variants in PTPN23, enabling characterization of this novel genetic disorder. The majority of variants identified in patients with this genetic disorder are rare or have not previously been observed in population databases. However, as exemplified by Proband 5, some variants may be rare founder alleles in certain populations, such as Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, and should be considered in screening panels for intellectual disability. We have clinically characterized seven patients and expanded the phenotypic and disease associated variation spectrum of the PTPN23 associated disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, brain abnormalities including ventriculomegaly and brain atrophy, optic nerve abnormalities, spasticity, and variable seizures. Identification and characterization of these seven patients in the context of the previously reported patients help to further identify major clinical features and define the phenotypic spectrum of the disease. Once recognized molecularly, genotype-phenotype correlation and identification of shared clinical features can enable more accurate clinical diagnoses of this rare disorder and inform natural history of the disease for future patients.",

        "Title": "    Changes in the clinical management of 5alpha-reductase type 2 and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiencies in France",
        "Abstract": "    To examine the changes in diagnostic practices and clinical management of patients with 5alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) or 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (HSD17B3) deficiency since molecular diagnoses became available.\n\n    Clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data were retrieved from the medical records of 52 patients with a molecular diagnosis of SRD5A2 (n = 31) or HSD17B3 (n = 21) deficiency. Temporal trends regarding age at assessment and initial sex assignment over 1994-2020 were qualitatively analyzed. Age at molecular diagnosis was compared between two subgroups of patients according to their year of birth.\n\n    Fifty-eight percent (n = 30) patients were diagnosed during the perinatal period, 33% (n = 17) during infancy, and 9% (n = 5) during adolescence or adulthood. Over the studied period, the patients' age at initial assessment and diagnosis frankly decreased. The median (range) age at diagnostic confirmation was 10.5 (0-53.2) years for patients born before 2007 and 0.4 (0-9.3) years for those born in 2007 or later (P = 0.029). Genetic testing identified 27 different variants for the SRD5A2 gene (30% novel, n = 8) and 18 for the HSD17B3 gene (44% novel, n = 8). Before 2002, most patients were initially assigned as females (95%, n = 19), but this proportion dropped for those born later (44%, n = 14; P < 0.001). The influence of initial genital appearance on these decisions seemingly decreased in the most recent years. Therapeutic interventions differed according to the sex of rearing. Ten percent (n = 2) patients requested female-to-male reassignment during adulthood.\n\n    This study showed, over the past two decades, a clear trend toward earlier diagnosis and assignment of affected newborns as males.",
        "Introduction": "    Disorders/differences of sex development (DSD) in patients with a 46,XY karyotype may result from disorders of androgen synthesis such as 5alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency (SRD5A2) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency (HSD17B3). These two rare autosomal recessive conditions display a great heterogeneity at both the genotypic and phenotypic levels. Clinical presentations of external genitalia at birth range from a female appearance with or without clitoromegaly to hypospadias and micropenis. Both conditions are characterized by a marked virilization at puberty, as other enzymatic mechanisms allow complete steroidogenesis up to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Hence, they are associated with the highest, although highly variable, rates of gender change in patients with a 46,XY DSD who have been birth assigned as females. When suspected at birth, these conditions may raise ethical dilemmas regarding patients' sex of rearing, while a diagnosis made during infancy may lead to early change of sex of rearing.\n\n    Diagnostic practices have significantly progressed over the past two decades. Laboratory diagnosis used to be guided by the determination of the testosterone/DHT ratio (elevated at baseline and/or after human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) stimulation test in SRD5A2 deficiency) and of the testosterone/androstenedione ratio (low at baseline and after hCG stimulation test in HSD17B3 deficiency). However, since the publication of several studies in the 1990s, molecular analysis has proved to be the most effective method for diagnostic confirmation and has allowed the identification of a growing number of genetic variants underpinning the two conditions.\n\n    Over the same period of time, clinical practices have evolved in the wake of the 2006 Chicago Consensus and other recent professional guidelines. In particular, a clear trend has been observed in favor of rearing newborns and infants diagnosed with SRD5A2 or HSD17B3 deficiencies as boys, contrary to what was previously done. This trend has concerned a growing proportion of patients with 46,XY DSD since the late 1990s and is likely related to a shift in medical practices and attitudes. However, its relationships with wider changes in the medical management of these patients, such as changes in diagnostic practices, have not been specifically studied.\n\n    In France, these changes were fostered by the development, in the early 2000s, of a national DSD reference network, which aimed at centralizing and homogenizing the medical management of all patients with disorders of sex development. In 2006, it was structured as part of the first national plan for rare diseases ('Plan National Maladies Rares'), which widened its field of action. This network allowed a more systematic referral of children with DSD to specialized teams and laboratories and contributed to the local dissemination of international guidelines on the management of DSD.\n\n    Thus, the present study aimed to examine the various facets of the changes in the medical management of disorders of androgen synthesis, through a retrospective examination of the clinical, laboratory, and treatment characteristics of a cohort of patients with SRD5A2 or HSD17B3 deficiencies who have been followed and treated in France since the first molecular diagnoses of the conditions were made in the mid-1990s.",
        "Methods": "    Two national rare disease databases (CEMARA, created in 2005, and BAMARA, created in 2018) were initially searched to identify patients with code ORPHA 752 and 753 (corresponding to SRD5A2 deficiency and HSD17B3 deficiency, respectively), referred to all the hospitals working within the DSD National Reference Network (Centre de reference du developpement genital - DEVGEN - and Centre de reference des maladies endocriniennes de la croissance et du developpement - CRMERCD). This initial research was completed by direct solicitation of every leading physician of the teams of the Network in order to get access to the most exhaustive list of patients with these conditions and to their medical records.\n\n    Collaboration conventions were signed with each concerned hospital. An information note was sent to all the referring physicians, who forwarded it to their patients in order to obtain their agreement to have their medical data collected for the purpose of the study. The ethics committee of the Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL) approved this study on October 1, 2021 (number 21_269). The processing of personal data carried out for this study falls within the frame of the 'Reference Methodology number 4' (MR-004) of the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertes (CNIL, French commission for data protection) for which the HCL has signed a compliance commitment and respects the General Data Protection Regulation (CNIL registration number 21_5269).\n\n    All patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of SRD5A2 deficiency or HSD17B3 deficiency were included, except those who expressed their refusal.\n\n    Data were collected between October 2021 and September 2022. The paper and/or computerized files of 52 patients from 12 different hospitals were examined in order to extract the relevant data concerning clinical presentation, laboratory data, therapeutic management, and follow-up. The oldest included file dated back to 1994 and the most recent one to 2020.\n\n    All data were transcribed as they appeared in the medical records, except for the external masculinization score (EMS) that was calculated retrospectively on the basis of the initial description of patients' external genitalia, in order to homogenize and compare the phenotypic descriptions of the neonatal period.\n\n    Endocrinological investigations were performed at diagnosis. DHT, testosterone, and androstenedione levels were determined using either an immunological assay or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\n\n    Molecular analyses were performed at diagnosis. The first molecular diagnoses dated back to 1999 for SRD5A2 deficiency and to 1995 for HSD17B3 deficiency. These diagnoses were mostly made by two laboratories (in Montpellier and in Lyon) who were historically the first to perform these analyses, but three other laboratories developed these techniques later on. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes using standard procedures. Exons and exon/intron boundaries of the SRD5A2 or HSD17B3 genes were initially analyzed by Sanger sequencing (n = 39) and since 2013 by targeted next-generation sequencing (n = 12). The limited number of patients did not allow a detailed analysis of the correlation between genotype and phenotype to be performed.\n\n    Temporal changes regarding the timing of diagnosis and decisions on initial sex of rearing were qualitatively described. The whole cohort was represented on a graph indicating each patient's initial sex of rearing and age at molecular diagnosis according to the year of birth. Due to an insufficient number of patients, no statistical trend analysis was performed. However, regarding the timing of molecular diagnosis, a statistical comparison was made between two subgroups of patients according to their year of birth (before 2007, and beyond). This year was chosen for two reasons: it corresponded to the median year of birth of the cohort and it corresponded to the year immediately following the creation of the national DSD reference network in 2006, which supposedly fostered the changes of practices at a national level.\n\n    Categorical variables were expressed as count (percentage). Continuous variables were expressed as mean +- s.d. or median (range), according to their distribution. A graphical assessment and a Shapiro-Wilk test were used for the assessment of normality. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test due to the small sample sizes considered.",
        "Results": "    A total of 69 patients from 12 hospitals were assessed for eligibility; among them, 17 were excluded due to the absence of genetic confirmation of the diagnosis (n = 10) or due to refusal to participate (n = 7). Eventually, 52 patients (31 with SRD5A2 deficiency and 21 with HSD17B3 deficiency) were included in the present study (Fig. 1). Patients were born between 1966 and 2020, and their median (range) age was 15 (1-55) years. There were nine patients who were not born in France and who were sometimes first treated (even if not formally diagnosed) in their native country. Consanguinity was reported in 37% (n = 19) of cases. A familial history of DSD was reported in 37% (n = 19) of cases and concerned 13 different families; five of these cases also presented consanguinity (Tables 1 and 2).\n\n    For both conditions, patients' external phenotypic characteristics highly varied. For 58% (n = 30) of patients, the diagnostic process began during the perinatal period, as they exhibited atypical genitalia. Among them, seven had an antenatal diagnosis due to a discordance between external genitalia and the karyotype: two had SRD5A2 deficiency (cases 8 and 27) and five had HSD17B3 deficiency (cases 38, 41, 44, 46, and 52). Overall, 33% (n = 17) of patients were diagnosed during infancy, as they exhibited atypical genitalia or inguinal palpable gonads, and 9% (n = 5) of patients were diagnosed during adolescence or adulthood, due to virilization or primary amenorrhea (Table 3).\n\n    The age at assessment and diagnosis clearly decreased over time, with a shift in favor of early assessment from the late 1990s on. Since 1998, only 15% (n = 8) of the patients were older than 12 months at their first specialized consultation (Tables 1 and 2). This evolution was contemporary to the first molecular diagnoses that date back to 1995 for HSD17B3 deficiency and to 1999 for SRD5A2 deficiency, and it was followed by a generalization of early molecular diagnosis throughout the 2000s (Fig. 2). Patients born before 2007 were diagnosed at a median (range) age of 10.5 (0-53.2) years, while patients born in 2007 or beyond were diagnosed at a median (range) age of 0.4 (0-9.3) years (P = 0.029).\n\n    Sex of rearing at diagnosis was female in 60% (n = 31) of cases (15 with SRD5A2 deficiency and 16 with HSD17B3 deficiency) and male in 40% (n = 21) of cases (16 with SRD5A2 deficiency and 5 with HSD17B3 deficiency). The initial decisions on sex of rearing shifted over time from female to male assignment, contemporary to the generalization of early assessment and diagnosis. The trend to favor a male assignment of affected newborns began in 2002; before this date, all but one patient (patient 6, born in Turkey in 1997 and diagnosed at the age of 10.5 years when he arrived in France) had been assigned at birth as females (Fig. 2). This means that the proportion of female-assigned patients dropped from 95% (n = 19) for those born before 2002 to 44% (n = 14) for those born in 2002 or later (P < 0.001).\n\n    When the diagnosis was made in newborns, the degree of external virilization apparently influenced decisions on sex of rearing, as the median (range) EMS of patients assigned as females was significantly lower than that of patients assigned as males (females: 3.0 (1.0-3.5); males: 6.0 (2.0-9.0); P < 0.001; Fig. 3). However, since 2013, at least three patients with a low EMS have been assigned as males, suggesting that the influence of external virilization on the decision of sex of rearing weakened over time. In this cohort, when the conditions were diagnosed during the antenatal period, sex declaration was made at birth without delay, while the neonatal finding of atypical genitalia led to delayed sex declaration in seven cases. These seven patients were all reared as boys (Fig. 4), and their median (range) age at the time of declaration was 1.0 month (4 days-16 months). Among them, five had an EMS > 4, while the two others had an EMS < 4.\n\n    Among patients whose DSD had not been suspected at birth (n = 22), all but one (case 6, born in Turkey) were initially assigned as females. For two of these patients, change of sex of rearing (from female to male) was decided after diagnosis during infancy (cases 29 and 49).\n\n    Among patients reared as girls who were older than 15 years at the time of the study, only 10% (n = 2) had expressed gender incongruence and requested female-to-male reassignment. One had SRD5A2 deficiency and had not been gonadectomized during childhood (case 5), while the other had HSD17B3 deficiency and had undergone bilateral gonadectomy and feminizing surgery during infancy (case 39). This latter patient's sister (case 43), who had the same condition, never expressed gender incongruence.\n\n    The baseline testosterone/DHT ratio was available for 68% (n = 21) of patients. The median (range) baseline testosterone/DHT ratio was 8.8 (4.5-26.5). Among the 21 baseline ratios, 33% (n = 7) were greater than 20, and among the 12 ratios established during mini-puberty, 75% (n = 9) were greater than 7. The testosterone/DHT ratio after hCG stimulation test was available for 19% (n = 6) of patients, and the median (range) ratio was 14.6 (5.7-22.0). Among the six ratios determined after an hCG stimulation test, 83% (n = 5) were greater than 8.5 (Table 1).\n\n    Genetic analyses (NM_000348.4) identified SRD5A2 homozygous variants in 65% (n = 20) of cases and compound heterozygous variants in 35% (n = 11) of cases. A total of 27 different variants were identified: 74% (n = 20) missense variants and 26% (n = 7) frameshift variants, including eight variants that were - to our knowledge - not previously described (Table 4). All these variants were localized in exons, and most were located in exon 4 (Fig. 5; Supplementary Table 1, see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article). The pathogenicity of all variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) classification is reported in supplementary data (Supplementary Table 1).\n\n    The baseline testosterone/androstenedione ratio was available for 86% (n = 18) of patients. The median (range) baseline testosterone/androstenedione ratio was 0.2 (0.2-0.7). The testosterone/androstenedione ratio after hCG stimulation test was available for 43% (n = 9) of patients: the median (range) ratio was 0.4 (0.2-4.5) and 67% (n = 6) of ratios were less than 0.8 (Table 2).\n\n    Genetic analyses (NM_000197.2) identified HSD17B3 homozygous variants in 62% (n = 13) of cases and compound heterozygous variants in 38% (n = 8) of cases. A total of 18 different variants were identified: 72% (n= 13) missense variants, 22% (n = 4) splicing anomalies, and 6% (n = 1) frameshift variant; 78% (n = 14) of variants were located in exons and 22% (n = 4) were located in introns. The most frequent variant was located in intron 3 (c.277+4A>T) as 29% (n = 6) of patients harbored it, and it resulted in a splicing anomaly (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 2). To our knowledge, eight variants were not previously described (Table 5). The pathogenicity of all variants according to the ACMG classification is reported in supplementary data (Supplementary Table 2).\n\n    Hormonal treatment and surgical management were similar for both conditions but obviously differed according to the patients' sex of rearing. Overall, 71% (n = 22) of patients reared as girls underwent gonadectomy, which was bilateral in all but one case. The median (range) age at gonadectomy was 1.9 years (14 days-27 years). Since 2010, no gonadectomy had been performed during the neonatal period or infancy, with one exception (case 24, unilateral gonadectomy). Overall, 36% (n = 8) of girls underwent gonadectomy after 13 years of age; among them, six had experienced adolescent virilization, while this information was missing for two others.\n\n    Pubertal induction treatment was administered to 83% (n = 20) of adolescent or adult girls. An 11-year-old patient had not yet initiated estrogen therapy at the time of the study, while information was missing for the last three patients. The median (range) age at pubertal induction was 11.9 (10.3-36.0) years. No puberty blockade was reported in this group.\n\n    Overall, 23% (n = 7) of girls underwent clitoral or perineal surgery, at a median (range) age of 15.1 (1.9-36.0) years; 13% (n = 4) underwent vaginoplasty, at a median (range) age of 17.9 (14.4-36.0) years. Also, 23% (n = 7) of patients had vaginal dilatations during adolescence and one during infancy (for four patients dilatations were necessary for vaginal stenosis after vagina surgery; for four other patients, auto-dilatations were performed in order to develop a vagina without surgery). The median (range) age at first vaginal dilatation was 17 (6.0-18.6) years. In addition, breast prostheses were requested by 10% (n = 3) of patients, at a median (range) age of 18.0 (16.0-19.0) years. One patient who had undergone bilateral gonadectomy and feminizing surgery (clitoral reduction and perineoplasty but no vaginoplasty) during infancy expressed a gender incongruence during adulthood and requested a female-to-male reassignment treatment (case 39).\n\n    All patients reared as boys (n = 21) received androgen therapy: except for one patient (case 13), penile length before treatment was less than the 5th percentile. This treatment was initiated at a median (range) age of 5.0 months (18 days-10.9 years): 62% (n = 13) of patients were treated during their first year of life, 28% (n = 6) of patients between 1 and 3 years of age, and 10% (n = 2) of patients after 9 years of age (Supplementary Table 3).\n\n    Among the 16 male patients with SRD5A2 deficiency, 56% (n = 9) received transdermal DHT, 19% (n = 3) injectable testosterone enanthate, and 25% (n = 4) testosterone enanthate and DHT successively. A quarter (n = 4) received androgen therapy only, and 75% (n = 12) of patients underwent both hormonal treatment and penile surgery. All male patients (n = 5) with HSD17B3 deficiency received testosterone enanthate, with additional DHT for one of them (case 49); among them, four were also treated surgically (Supplementary Table 3).\n\n    Overall, 90% (n = 19) of patients underwent genital surgery, at a median (range) age of 1.5 (0.4-5.9) years: undescended testis surgery was performed in 42% (n = 8) of cases, at a median (range) age of 3.3 (1.3-6.0) years, and surgery of hypospadias was performed in 79% (n = 15) of cases, at a median (range) age of 1.5 (0.5-12.4) years, with a median (range) number of interventions per patient of 2 (1-10) (Table 6). Before hypospadias surgery, the penile length was between the 5th and 50th percentiles according to the patients' age in 53% (n = 8) of cases and under the 5th percentile in 14% (n = 2) of cases; these data were missing in 33% (n = 5) of cases. At the last reported visit, the penile length was over or equal to the 5th percentile according to the age in 62% (n = 13) of patients and lower than the 5th percentile in 33% (n = 7) of patients; data were missing in one case (Supplementary Table 3). None of the adult male patients (n = 3) had expressed desire of paternity nor underwent sperm analysis at the time of the study.",
        "Conclusion": "    This study provided the first description of a French cohort of patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of SRD5A2 deficiency or HSD17B3 deficiency. Besides bringing new insights on the genetic underpinnings of these conditions and detailed information on therapeutic trajectories, it clearly showed that the generalization of early diagnosis seemingly reinforced the growing trend in favor of patients' initial assignment as males. The overall presentation of disorders of androgen synthesis has thus changed, together with their clinical management. There is still a major need to assess the consequences of these transformations on patients' outcome, particularly regarding their psychosocial functioning and personal fulfillment.",
        "Discussion": "    This study was the first to describe a cohort of patients with a molecular diagnosis of SRD5A2 or HSD17B3 deficiency in France and clearly showed how the changes in diagnostic and clinical practices over the past two decades have impacted the general picture of these conditions. First, in contrast with previous studies, the majority of the cases reported herein were diagnosed in newborns, or prenatally. Since the beginning of 2000s, making a diagnosis during adolescence has become the exception rather than the rule. The generalization of early diagnosis has been accompanied by a radical change in decision-making regarding the patients' sex of rearing. Except for one case (patient not born in France), all patients born before 2002 were reared as girls, whereas a large majority of those born later were reared as boys. A major consequence of this evolution is the radical decrease in the number of early gonadectomies. However, the shift in favor of male assignment has increased the number of therapeutic interventions, either hormonal or surgical, throughout the patients' childhood.\n\n    These findings are in line with the international trend that has been clearly reported by Kolezinska et al. about patients with 46,XY DSD, and in particular those with disorders of androgen synthesis. These authors have noticed that several reasons may have led to changes in early sex-assignment policies for patients with 46,XY DSD, in particular the relatively better outcomes for patients initially assigned as males, the technical improvements of masculinizing surgery, as well as a more general shift in 'social attitudes'. They also evoked the greater emphasis placed by clinicians on the karyotype but reported that at the time of their study (2013), confirmatory genetic diagnosis was still 'rarely sought' but would likely play a greater role in assisting sex-assignment decisions in the future. The present study showed that this has in fact been the case in France over the last years. For more than half of the patients reared as boys, sex-of-rearing decisions benefitted from a longer time of reflection, as diagnosis was made during the antenatal period or as the sex declaration was delayed until diagnostic confirmation. Also, while decision-making regarding sex assignment at birth used to be guided, at least partly, by the degree of external virilization, this study reported three patients with a low EMS who were reared as boys since 2013. This was contemporary to a new step in the generalization of early molecular diagnosis, with the spread of next-generation sequencing. Thus, it seems that such molecular diagnosis has acquired a growing importance in sex-assignment decisions and reinforced the trend toward the systematic assignment of newborns with disorders of androgen synthesis as males.\n\n    Another consequence of the widespread availability of molecular diagnosis is the partial decline of the clinicians' reliance on steroid level evaluations and ratios. These evaluations encounter several limitations in current practice, as they should be performed at the same time and in the same laboratory to be interpretable and as the determination of DHT concentration can only be performed in a few laboratories. In this study, steroid evaluations were not always fully reported in patient files, for example for cases in which a familial history of the condition had oriented the diagnostic investigations. However, hormonal evaluations remained crucial when the molecular diagnosis was not available or conclusive. Excluding these cases was a limitation of the present study, although this does not question the relevance of the reported generalization of early genetic diagnosis.\n\n    The reliance on a retrospective calculation of the EMS was another limitation of the present study. This score is imperfect as it does not provide a complete clinical picture and as clinical descriptions may vary among clinicians, especially in case of partial fusion. Here, its calculation was based on clinical notes, which constitutes an additional limitation. Although approximate, this method remains useful to retrospectively compare patient phenotypes, and it has been used in the same manner elsewhere.\n\n    Finally, another limitation of the study lies in the paucity of data on patient medium- and long-term outcome, due to a focus on medical records in which information was often scarce regarding the psychosocial aspects and follow-up information after adolescence. It is however worth noticing that this cohort reported only two cases of adult patients who have requested female-to-male reassignment. The overall 10 % rate of post-pubertal female-to-male reassignment was thus relatively low, but similar to that reported in some other samples of patients with SRD5A2 deficency and HSD17B3 deficiency. The contrast with studies reporting high rates of sex reassignment in patients with these conditions may be explained by cultural factors but also by the fact that high rates of sex reassignment used to concern mostly patients who were not diagnosed during infancy and thus underwent unexpected virilization at adolescence. However, in this cohort, one of the patients who requested female-to-male reassignment had been diagnosed early and underwent gonadectomy during infancy, which confirms that the development of a male gender identity does not strictly rely on such virilization. The fact that this patient's sister, who had the same condition and treatment history, never expressed gender dissatisfaction also confirms the implication of several factors in the development of gender identity. The follow-up of an increasing number of patients with disorders of androgen synthesis reared as boys may certainly bring new insights to this area of research.",

        "Title": "    Nitrate supplementation of rations based on rice straw but not Pangola hay, improves growth performance in meat goats",
        "Abstract": "    Supplemental nitrate is known to be an effective tool to mitigate methane emission by ruminants. Based on theoretical considerations, supplemental nitrate can improve but also deteriorate the growth performance. The overall effect of supplemental nitrate on growth performance, however, is not yet known. The objective of the current study was therefore to evaluate the effect of a higher dose of NO3- on overall growth performance when feeding either Pangola grass hay or rice straw.\n\n    Thirty-two crossbred, 3-month-old Thai nativexAnglo-Nubian crossbred male goats were used. The experiment had a 2x2 factorial design with an experimental period of 60 days. Eight goats were randomly allocated to each dietary treatment, i.e. a ration containing either Pangola hay (Digitaria eriantha Steud) or rice straw (Oryza Sativa) as a source of roughage, supplemented with a concentrate containing either 3.2% or 4.8% potassium nitrate. The rations were formulated to be isonitrogenous. The animals were weighed at the start of the experiment and at days 30 and 60. Feces were collected during the last five days of each 30-day period.\n\n    High-nitrate increased overall DM intake by approximately 3%, irrespective the source of roughage, but only the goats fed a rice straw-based ration responded with an increase in body weight (BW). Thus, the overall feed conversion ratio (kg feed/kg BW gain) was influenced by roughage source xnitrate and decreased by almost 60% when the goats were fed rice straw in combination with a high versus a low dietary nitrate content. The digestibility of macronutrients was only affected by the source of roughage and the digestibility of organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fibre was greater when the goats were fed Pangola hay.\n\n    It was concluded that the replacement of soybean meal by nitrate improves the growth performance of meat goats fed rations based on rice straw, but not Pangola hay.",
        "Introduction": "    Enteric methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the emission that originates from ruminant production is considered relevant. The vast majority of CH4 production by ruminants is caused by the anaerobic fermentation of organic matter (OM) in the rumen because the synthesis of volatile fatty acids is inevitably associated with that of hydrogen and therefore of CH4.\n\n    Nitrate (NO 3-) has been shown to effectively suppress CH4 methane production because NO3- can be reduced to ammonia (NH3) and therefore acts as a hydrogen sink. Thus, in rations with limiting crude protein (CP) contents, supplemental NO3- can be considered as an alternative source of nitrogen for microbial protein synthesis. Supplemental NO3- can therefore potentially enhance animal production in CP limiting rations and at same time reduce methane emission. On the other hand, the process of NO3- reduction competes with ruminal propionogenesis because propionate also, can act as a hydrogen sink. There are indications that a NO3- induced redirection of energy to NH3 instead of propionate, would not favor animal production especially in the case where poor quality rations are fed. From this perspective, NO3- may not be suitable to mitigate methane emission because tropical roughages typically are of a poor quality. The overall net effect of supplemental NO3- on animal production, however, is difficult to predict.\n\n    To the best of the authors' knowledge however, there are currently no studies reporting on the effect of extra NO3- on the growth performance in meat goats. In Thailand, Pangola grass (hay) is the preferred type of roughage in goat nutrition because it is generally perceived as a high-quality roughage when compared to rice straw. The latter is typically fed during periods of feed scarcity. The objective of the current study was therefore to evaluate the effect of a higher dose of NO3- on overall growth performance when feeding either Pangola grass hay or rice straw.",
        "Methods": "    The current experiment was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Suranaree University of Technology Isan (approval number, RU3-303-55-01) and based on the Ethics of Animal Experimentation of the National Research Council of Thailand.\n\n    Thirty-two crossbred, 3-month-old Thai nativexAnglo-Nubian crossbred male goats were used. The experiment had a 2x2 factorial design with an experimental period of 60 days. Eight goats were randomly allocated to each dietary treatment, i.e. a ration containing either Pangola hay (Digitaria eriantha Steud) or rice straw (Oryza sativa) as a source of roughage, supplemented with a concentrate containing either 3.2% or 4.8% potassium nitrate (Table 1). The experiment was preceded by a 14-day pre-experimental period in which the animals were fed a ration based on Pangola hay. Throughout the experiment, the goats were housed in individual pens with slatted floors and the animals had free access to fresh water and a mineral block.\n\n    The roughages and concentrates were offered at 3.5% and 1.5% of body weight (BW), respectively, irrespective either source. The feedstuffs were offered daily in two equal portions at 08:00 and 16:00 h. Feed refusals, if present, were collected and weighed daily before the morning feeding so as to determine the actual daily feed intake. The animals were weighed at the start of the experiment and at days 30 and 60 so as to monitor BW and to adjust the amounts of feed offered. Within the two 30-day periods, each individual animal was therefore offered a fixed amount of dry matter (DM).\n\n    Pangola grass was harvested after 45 days of regrowth and sun dried for 5 days. After drying, the moisture content was found to be 125 g/kg and the DM had the following chemical composition (g/kg): crude ash, 84; CP, 73; ether extract (EE), 19; neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 734; acid detergent fiber (ADF), 359. The rice straw, with a moisture content of 78 g/kg, was chemically composited as follows (g/kg DM): crude ash, 123; CP, 33; EE, 10; NDF, 734; ADF, 523. The ingredient and chemical composition of the experimental rations is shown in Table 2. The values on the chemical composition in Table 2 are based on the actual mean DM intakes of the experimental feedstuffs as calculated over the 60 days.\n\n    The experimental feedstuffs were sampled on the last five days of each 30-day period of the experiment. Then, the feedstuff samples were dried at 70 C for 72 hours, ground to pass a 1 mm sieve, pooled across the 5 sampling days and subsequently stored in sealed plastic bags at ambient temperature (25 C) until analysis. Feces also were collected during the last five days of each 30-day period. The feces from individual goats were quantitatively collected with the use of a plastic sheet which was spread below the slatted floors. The daily feces production of each goat was stored at -18 C. At the end of the 5 days collection period, the stored daily feces collections were thawed, mixed thoroughly and sampled. The samples were dried at 70 C for 72 hours, ground to pass a 1 mm sieve and stored in sealed plastic bags at ambient temperature (25 C) until analysis.\n\n    The ash content of the experimental feedstuffs was analyzed by combustion at 600 C for 6 hours. Nitrogen contents were determined by the macro Kjeldahl method; a factor of 6.25 was used to convert nitrogen into CP. The EEs of the feedstuffs were prepared according to the AOAC; the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was weighed. The NDF and ADF contents of the rations were analyzed according to the method of and the values are expressed without residual ash.\n\n    All data were subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear model procedure in SAS, using the model:\n\n    where Yij = a response variable (e.g. growth performance, nutrient digestibility); mu = overall mean; RSi = roughage source (i = Pangola hay or rice straw); Fj = level of dietary nitrate (j = low or high); (RSxN)ij = interaction term between RS and level of nitrate; and eij = residual error. Both, the RS and level of nitrate (N) were set as fixed factors in the statistical model. Throughout, the level of statistical significance was pre-set at p<=0.05.",
        "Results": "    During the first 30-day period, DM-intake was similar between treatments (Table 3) but the goats fed Pangola hay versus rice straw had a significantly (p<0.05) greater gain in BW (Table 3). Next to the source of roughage, BW was also affected by the nitrate content of the ration (p<0.05) but the effect of a high dietary nitrate content was only observed in the goats fed rice straw (p<0.05). The growth rate of the goats was likewise affected by the dietary treatments (p<0.05). The lowest values (p<0.05) on the feed conversion ratio (FCR, g feed/g gain) were found when the animals were fed Pangola hay but the FCR was not affected by the high dietary nitrate content. In contrast, the FCR of the goats fed rice straw was found to be ~3 times lower when the ration contained the high nitrate content.\n\n    During the second half of the experiment (i.e. from day 31 to day 60) the DM intake (Table 3) was affected by an interaction between RS and the nitrate content of the ration (p>=0.05). The greatest DM intakes (p<0.05) were observed when the goats were fed Pangola hay and the ration contained a greater amount of nitrate. The rice straw fed goats had a ~11% lower BW at the start of the second half of the experiment and showed a lower gain in BW and growth rate compared to the goats fed Pangola hay (p<0.05). Compared to the first 30 days of the experiment, BW gain and growth rate were likewise affected by nitrate and the interaction between RS and the dietary nitrate content but the differences were only borderline statistically significant.\n\n    Overall, from day 0 to day 60, the DM intake was only af fected by both RS and the dietary nitrate content while the gain in BW, final BW and the growth rate were significantly affected by the interaction between RS and the dietary nitrate content. The overall FCR also was influenced by RSx nitrate and decreased by almost 60% when the goats were fed rice straw in combination with a high versus a low dietary nitrate content.\n\n    Throughout the experiment, the digestibility of macronutrients (Table 4) was not affected by the interaction between RS and nitrate (p<0.05). The digestibility of NDF tended (p = 0.073) to be affected by a high dietary nitrate content only in the second half of the experiment. The digestibility of ADF was likewise affected and across the two experimental periods, a high dietary nitrate content increased the ADF digestibility by almost 5 percentage units (p<0.05). The source of roughage significantly affected the digestibility's of OM, CP, and NDF and all values were found to be greater (p<0.05) when the goats were fed Pangola hay. In contrast, the digestibility of ADF was greater (p<0.05) when the goats were fed rice straw instead of Pangola hay.",
        "Conclusion": "    The replacement of soybean meal by nitrate improved the growth performance of meat goats fed rations based on rice straw, but not Pangola hay.\n\n    CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\n    We certify that there is no conflict of interest with any financial organization regarding the material discussed in the manuscript.",
        "Discussion": "    To the best of the our knowledge the current results are the first showing that a high versus a low dietary nitrate content improves the growth performance of meat goats fed rice straw. Interestingly, the high-nitrate induced improvement of FCR was not observed when the goats were fed Pangola hay (Table 3). Although FCR was systematically improved in goats fed the high-nitrate, rice straw-based rations, during the second half of the experiment the difference in FCR failed to reach statistical significance. The data however, are clearly in line with the FCR-values obtained from day 1 to 30 but the variation was aberrantly much greater when compared with the variation in FCR values during the first half of the experiment. It is therefore most likely that the probability of type-1 error was unfavourably affected by the high variation in FCR during the second half of the experiment.\n\n    The observed interaction between RS and high dietary ni trate is not easy to explain but the data are in line with the idea that nitrate enhances the growth of rumen bacteria and therefore renders a greater amount of microbial protein due to the reduction of NO3- to NH3 in the rumen environment. Although rations were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous within RS, the amount of N available for microbial growth was most likely not similar between the nitrate treatments because ~15% of the protein in soybean meal is not degraded in the rumen environment while virtually all nitrate is reduced to NH3. It is well established that there is a sharp increase in the growth rate of rumen microbes when the amount of available N becomes greater than 50 mg/L. Thus, in the case of the rice straw-based rations the latter might have been highly relevant. The current reasoning implies that in the Panola based rations, the issue of N supply to rumen bacteria was not relevant. Finally, the current data do not support the idea that nitrate negatively affects the growth performance with a nitrate induced reduction of rumen propionate formation. Needless to mention that the afore mentioned notions concerning the underlying mechanism on the observed nitrate induced improvement of FCR are speculative and that further studies are required for confirmation.\n\n    In the current experiment, neither DM-intake nor nutri ent digestibility was influenced by RSxN. Thus, it is difficult to see that the improved growth performance of the meat goats fed rice straw can be explained by DM intake or the total tract digestibility of nutrients. However, high-nitrate as such increased overall DM intake when the goats were fed rice straw, but quantitatively the effect was rather small when compared with low-nitrate (i.e. ~3%). It therefore appears that, with the exception of N, high versus low nitrate did not affect the amounts of nutrients available to support maintenance and growth of the meat goats. The current trial does not provide clues to explain the stimulatory effect of nitrate on DM intake but has reported that nitrate can cause a reduction in heat production. Since the current study was conducted under tropical conditions, it can be speculated that a reduced heat production explains the somewhat greater DM intake when high nitrate was fed.\n\n    With the exception of ADF, apparent nutrient digestibility was found to be greater when the goats were fed Pangola hay instead of rice straw. Clearly, these results are in line with expectation because it is widely accepted that the digestibility of Pangola hay is superior to that of rice straw. However, the ADF digestibility was found to be greater when the goats were fed rice straw. Surprisingly, NDF digestibility remained unchanged when high nitrate was fed. It can therefore be speculated that under high nitrate conditions, the fermentation of cellulose is enhanced. Perhaps, ingestion of the high-nitrate rations affected the rumen ecosystem and as such induced a greater fermentation of cellulose. Unfortunately, the current paper does not provide clues to substantiate the latter suggestion.\n\n    The current rations contained either 0.8 (low nitrate) or 1.2% of DM (high nitrate) and such values can be lethal in unadapted ruminants, but adaptation apparently enabled rumen bacteria to increase in numbers or increase their nitrite-reducing capacity. In the current study however, the animals were slowly adapted to increased levels of nitrate, 3.2% or 4.8% which most likely enabled the rumen bacteria to sufficiently increase their capacity to reduce nitrite. Moreover, in the case the current nitrate load is expressed as g/kg0.75/d, values are calculated to be 0.6 and 0.9 g NO3-/kg0.75/d for the low- and high nitrate rations, respectively. A considerably greater dosage (i.e. 1.6 g NO3-/kg0.75/d) in their methane mitigating rations and they reported slightly elevated levels of methemoglobin. It therefore appears that the nitrate levels used in the current study can be considered non-toxic.",

        "Title": "    Glucose Levels of the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (oGTT) Can Predict Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Women with Gestational Diabetes (GDM)",
        "Abstract": "    Objectives and Background: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication defined as a glucose intolerance diagnosis during pregnancy. GDM is strongly associated with adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. In Germany, to screen and diagnose GDM we use a 1 h 50 g oGCT (oral glucose challenge test) followed by a 2 h 75 g oGTT if the first was pathological. This analysis examines the correlation of 75 g oGTT glucose levels and fetomaternal outcome. Methods: Data from 1664 patients from a gestational diabetes consultation clinic at the Charite University Hospital in Berlin, Germany, were analyzed retrospectively from 2015 to 2022. The 75 g oGTT blood glucose levels were categorized into isolated fasting hyperglycemia (GDM-IFH), isolated post-load hyperglycemia (GDM-IPH) and combined hyperglycemia (GDM-CH), using the levels of the fasting, 1 h and 2 h values, after glucose application. These subtypes were compared based on their baseline characteristics as well as fetal and maternal outcome. Results: GDM-IFH and GDM-CH women displayed higher pre-conceptional BMI and required insulin therapy more frequently (p < 0.001). The GDM-IFH group was at higher risk of having a primary cesarean section (p = 0.047), while GDM-IPH women were significantly more likely to have an emergent cesarean section (p = 0.013). The offspring of GDM-IFH and GDM-CH women were born with a significantly higher mean birthweight (p < 0.001) and birth weight percentiles (p < 0.001) and were at increased risk of being large for gestational age (LGA) (p = 0.004). Women from the GDM-IPH group delivered significantly more neonates who were small for gestational age (p = 0.027) or with low fetal weight <30th percentile (p = 0.003). Conclusion: This analysis shows a strong association between the glucose response pattern in the 75 g oGTT and adverse perinatal fetomaternal outcome. The differences among the subgroups, specifically concerning insulin therapy, mode of delivery and fetal growth, suggest an individualized approach to prenatal care after a GDM diagnosis.",
        "Introduction": "    Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication during pregnancy. In Germany, the incidence of GDM rose from 4.6% of all hospital deliveries in 2013 to 6.8% in 2018. GDM is defined as an impairment of glucose tolerance that has been diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy. With its prevalence rising, and its well-known associations with other various pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, cesarean section (CS), macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, childbirth injury, postpartum hemorrhage or premature birth, understanding GDM fully is key to improve prenatal care and minimize the risks for mother and child. GDM is still, generally, treated as a homogenous disease during pregnancy, although research indicates that a more differentiated approach might be needed, as phenotypical subtypes of the condition seem to be associated with different perinatal outcomes. A possible approach that has been suggested is to focus on the extent of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion impairment or to differentiate between the two. Another, possibly more practicable, approach is to differentiate GDM subtypes based on the glucose levels observed in the three-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), which is conducted in the late second to early third trimester of pregnancy and comprises fasting blood glucose measurements, one and two hours after the ingestion of a 75 g glucose solution (Figure 1). These measurements are widely available through the prenatal file and are, therefore, easy to access. The HAPO study demonstrated an association of maternal plasma glucose levels with large for gestational age (LGA) offspring, primary CS, shoulder dystocia or birth injury, pre-eclampsia and other adverse outcomes. Therefore, the correlation of 75 g oGTT glucose values and fetomaternal outcome has been the subject of several studies. The aim of our study is to corroborate and add evidence to the recent findings by assessing the characteristics of GDM subtypes (isolated fasting hyperglycemia = GDM-IFH, isolated post-load hyperglycemia = GDM-IPH, combined hyperglycemia = CH based on oGTT glucose values) and their respective risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.",
        "Methods": "    Obstetric data from 3123 pregnant women visiting an expert gestational diabetes consultation clinic at Charite University Hospital, from January 2015 to September 2022, were collected and analyzed anonymously. The Charite University Hospital is a tertiary perinatal center in the metropole region of Berlin, Germany. A total of 1664 patients were eligible for the analysis (Figure 2). The patients were screened and diagnosed through the 75 g oGTT and in case of pathological results were referred to our consultation clinic. Inclusion criteria were women >=18 years with singleton pregnancies who were screened prior with a pathological glucose response in the 75 g oGTT and were subsequently diagnosed with GDM. The gestational week (GW) at the time of the pathological 75 g oGTT did not affect inclusion. High-risk patients who received early screening (before 24 GW) were included. Only women who delivered their babies at Charite University Hospital were eligible for the analysis. Exclusion criteria were multiple pregnancies, age < 18 years, missing or incomplete oGTT data, missing perinatal data and inconclusive documentation of GDM diagnosis. The oGTT data were considered incomplete if at least one glucose measurement of the three-point 75 g oGTT was missing and subsequently the categorization into one of the subtypes was not possible. Women who were diagnosed through random elevated blood glucose levels were excluded as well. Patients were categorized into three different groups using the three blood glucose values from the 75 g oGTT. Thresholds for pathological glucose levels were >=92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L) fasting, >=180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) one hour after glucose application and >=153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L) two hours after, according to IADPSG criteria. An elevation in fasting glucose only, which was measured immediately before the application of the glucose solution, was considered isolated fasting hyperglycemia (GDM-IFH). If just one or both postprandial glucose values were elevated, this was considered isolated post-load hyperglycemia (GDM-IPH) and an elevation in fasting glucose and at least one of the postprandial glucose values was categorized as combined hyperglycemia (GDM-CH). The primary aim of the analysis was to assess the likelihood of delivering via cesarean section based on the glucose values of the 75 g oGTT. The secondary objective was to analyze maternal and fetal outcome parameters, such as vaginal operative birth, shoulder dystocia, perineal tear grade 3  and the need for episiotomy, blood loss and postpartum bleeding, and pre-eclampsia. Fetal outcomes included gestational age at delivery, birth weight and percentiles, fetal growth abnormalities such as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), small for gestational age (SGA), LGA (defined as growth >= 95th percentile) and low fetal weight (defined as growth < 30th percentile), premature delivery before 37 GW, intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) and the need for intensive neonatal care admission after delivery. Cord pH levels and base excess were evaluated.\n\n    An analysis of the study population's underlying characteristics was conducted regarding maternal age, gravidity and parity, pre-conceptional BMI and the previous diagnostic process including GW at first presentation, the 50 g oGCT and the 75 g oGTT. Gravidity and parity were assessed as continuous as well as categorical variables (gravida 1, 2 and >=3; nullipara vs. >=primipara and para 0, 1, 2, >=3).\n\n    This study received ethical approval from the ethics committee of Charite University Hospital on 6 February 2023 (EA2/255/22).\n\n    Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics by IBM (version 28.0.1.0) (Armonk, New York, United States of America). Categorical variables were compared among the subgroups using chi-square-tests and binomial logistic regression, and numbers and percentages were reported. Binomial logistic regression was conducted for outcome variables which showed significant differences among the subgroups and included subtype (categorical), pre-conceptional BMI (<18.5 = underweight, 18.5-23.9 = normal weight, 24-27.9 = overweight, 28-31.9 = obese, >=32 = severely obese), age as a continuous variable and parity (nullipara vs. >=primipara) as co-variates. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and reported. Metric variables were compared using one-way ANOVA with subsequent post-hoc-analysis (Tukey and Games-Howell) and mean and standard deviation (SD) were reported. Results were considered statistically significant if the p-value was <0.05.",
        "Results": "    Of the 1664 patients, 553 were classified as GDM-IFH (33.2%), 418 as GDM-IPH (25.1%) and 693 as GDM-CH (41.6%) (Figure 1). Mothers from the GDM-IFH group were, on average, significantly younger (IFH: 31.89, IPH: 32.62, CH: 32.70, p = 0.024). Mean gravidity (IFH: 2.88, IPH: 2.92, CH: 3.32, p < 0.001) and parity (IFH: 1.31, IPH: 1.26, CH: 1.69, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the GDM-CH group. The analysis of gravidity and parity as categorical variables revealed that among all subtypes, multigravidity (gravida >= 3: IFH: 48.3%, IPH: 46.9%, CH: 59.8%, p < 0.001) was significantly more common than gravida 1 (IFH: 22.8%, IPH: 27.8%, CH: 17.8%) or 2 (IFH: 28.9%, IPH: 25.4%, CH: 22.4%). The rate of nulliparous women was significantly higher in the GDM-IPH group (IFH: 33.8%, IPH: 39.7%, CH: 25.0%, p < 0.001). GDM-CH women had the highest rate of pluriparity (para >= 3: IFH: 15.6%, IPH: 15.6%, CH: 26.2%). Primiparity and biparity were similarly common when comparing the subtypes (IFH: 32.2%, IPH: 26.6%, CH: 27.8% and IFH: 18.4%, IPH: 18.2%, CH: 21.0%, respectively). The pre-conceptional BMI differed significantly between all the subgroups: GDM-IPH women displayed the lowest mean BMI and GDM-CH women the highest (IFH: 28.63, IPH: 26.10, CH: 29.69, p < 0.001). The 50 g oGCT was performed on average at 26 GW, with no significant difference between the groups (IFH: 25.62 GW, IPH: 25.89 GW, CH: 25.89 GW, p = 0.362). The GDM-IFH group was less likely to receive the 50 g oGCT before the 75 g oGTT than the other subgroups (IFH: 43.9%, IPH: 60.3%, CH: 59.2%, p < 0.001) and less likely to show a pathological glucose response in the test (IFH: 85.7%, IPH: 93.4%, CH: 93.9%, p < 0.001). Mean glucose levels in the 50 g oGCT were 144.75 mg/dL (8.03 mmol/L) in the GDM-IFH, 157.69 mg/dL (8.75 mmol/L) in the GDM-IPH and 166.37 mg/dL (9.23 mmol/L) in the GDM-CH group (p < 0.001). Women with GDM-IFH received the 75 g oGTT earlier than women in the GDM-IPH or GDM-CH groups (mean: IFH: 25.78 GW, IPH: 27.23 GW, CH: 26.53 GW, p < 0.001). In the GDM-IFH and GDM-CH groups the 75 g oGTT was performed before 24 GW more often than in the GDM-IPH group (13.2%, 11.8% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.009). Mean 75 g oGTT glucose levels before glucose intake, 1 h after and 2 h after, were 99.02 mg/dL (5.50 mmol/L), 145.63 mg/dL (8.08 mmol/L) and 116.16 mg/dL (6.45 mmol/L) in women with GDM-IFH, 83.77 mg/dL (4.65 mmol/L), 188.11 mg/dL (10.44 mmol/L) and 147.28 mg/dL (8.17 mmol/L) in women with GDM-IPH and 105.84 mg/dL (5.87 mmol/L), 204.98 mg/dL (11.38 mmol/L) and 158.80 mg/dL (8.81 mmol/L) in women with GDM-CH, respectively, (Figure 3). The mean initial presentation at the GDM consultation clinic was at 31 GW (IFH: 30.22 GW, IPH: 30.72 GW, CH: 30.39 GW, p = 0.270). A complete overview of the results is provided in Table 1.\n\n    As provided in Table 2, the GDM-IFH group displayed the highest mean weight gain (IFH: 12.17 kg, IPH: 11.24 kg, CH: 10.90 kg, p = 0.008). GDM-IFH (17.5%, OR 1.946 [1.277-2.967], p = 0.002) as well as GDM-CH women were more likely to require insulin therapy (34.2%, OR 4.317 [2.915-6.392], p < 0.001) compared to GDM-IPH women (8.9%). GDM-CH patients had a higher likelihood of receiving insulin therapy (OR 2.218 [1.674-2.937], p < 0.001) compared to GDM-IFH. The use of long-acting insulin only was significantly more common in the GDM-IFH and GDM-CH groups (IFH: 13.0%, IPH: 5.3%, CH: 19.5%, p < 0.001) and the rate of combined insulin therapy was higher in the GDM-CH group (IFH: 3.8%, IPH: 1.4%, CH: 12.8%, p < 0.001). Two patients received treatment with metformin in combination with insulin.\n\n    The analysis showed no significant difference between rates of CS (primary and emergent, p = 0.811). However, there was a significant difference on primary and emergent CS specifically. GDM-IFH women were most likely to deliver via planned primary CS compared to GDM-IPH (IFH: 24.8%, IPH: 18.2%, CH: 21.5%, p = 0.047). The odds of delivering via primary CS were significantly increased only in GDM-IFH women (OR 1.376 [1.042-1.815], p = 0.024) vs. GDM-CH patients. Women categorized as GDM-IPH (23.9%, OR 1.643 [1.173-2.302], p = 0.004) or GDM-CH (21.7%, OR 1.48 [1.094-2.003], p = 0.011) were at higher risk of an emergent CS compared to GDM-IFH women (16.6%). The rate of vaginal operative delivery differed significantly with 10% in GDM-IPH patients vs. 5.5% in GDM-CH patients (IFH: 8.1%, p = 0.016). There were no significant differences concerning the rates of shoulder dystocia (IFH: 1.2%, IPH: 0.0%, CH: 2.0%, p = 0.081), episiotomy (IFH: 8.3%, IPH: 11.6%, CH: 8.9%, p = 0.389), third degree perineal tear (IFH: 1.9%, IPH: 1.2%, CH: 1.0%, p = 0.620), pre-eclampsia (IFH: 3.3%, IPH: 1.7%, CH: 3.8%, p = 0.143) and HELLP syndrome (IFH: 0.4%, IPH: 0.2%, CH: 0.1%, p = 0.739). The analysis of blood loss as a continuous variable showed no significant difference (p = 0.643), as well as the incidence of blood loss >= 1000 mL (p = 0.867) and >=1500 mL (p = 0.400). The risk of postpartum bleeding was similar throughout the subgroups (p = 0.893).\n\n    The distribution of the fetus's sex did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.760). The mean gestational age at delivery was slightly higher in the GDM-IFH group than in the GDM-CH group (IFH: 39.70 GW, IPH: 39.51 GW, CH: 39.41 GW, p = 0.008). The rates of premature delivery before 37 GW were similar among the subtypes (p = 0.054). APGAR scores at 1 min (p = 0.088), 5 min (p = 0.110) and 10 min after delivery (p = 0.061), arterial cord pH values (p = 0.446) and base excess (p = 0.906) did not differ significantly among the subgroups. Neonates of GDM-IFH and GDM-CH mothers displayed a significantly higher mean birthweight (IFH: 3470.71 g, IPH: 3327.59 g, CH: 3460.21 g, p < 0.001) as well as birth weight percentiles (IFH: 54.68, IPH: 49.43, CH: 57.51, p < 0.001) compared to neonates of GDM-IPH women. GDM-IFH (12.3%, OR 1.657 [1.020-2.692], p = 0.041) and GDM-CH women (13.5%, OR 1.671 [1.046-2.668], p = 0.032) were at higher risk of delivering neonates that were LGA compared to GDM-IPH (6.5%). The SGA rate was significantly higher among GDM-IPH women (IFH: 7.6%, IPH: 11.5%, CH: 7.1%, p = 0.027). In the logistic regression analysis, SGA did not reach statistical significance. However, GDM-IPH women (30.7%, OR 1.379 [1.029-1.847], p = 0.031) displayed an association with low fetal weight (<30th percentile) in comparison to GDM-CH women (21.6%, IFH: 26.3%). There was no significant difference in neonatal intensive care admission (p = 0.086) and the rate of IUFD (p = 0.104) (Table 3).\n\n    In the logistic regression model, not only the three 75 g oGTT subtypes were associated with fetomaternal outcome. In particular, parity and pre-conceptional BMI seemed to significantly affect the perinatal outcomes. Nulliparous women displayed smaller odds of primary CS (OR 0.435 [0.320-0.593], p < 0.001), but were at higher risk of delivering via emergent CS (OR 3.534 [2.700-4.625], p < 0.001). Their likelihood of operative vaginal delivery was higher as well (OR 6.353 [4.100-9.843], p < 0.001). Nulliparity increased the odds of delivering offspring that had low fetal weight (OR 1.583 [1.238-2.025], p < 0.001) or was SGA (OR 2.155 [1.484-3.129], p < 0.001), while it reduced the odds of delivering LGA neonates (OR 0.548 [0.365-0.823], p = 0.004). Pre-conceptional BMI was associated with emergent CS (p = 0.001), vaginal operative delivery (p = 0.007) and LGA (p < 0.001). A BMI categorized as overweight, obese or severely obese increased the likelihood of emergent CS (OR 1.451 [1.011-2.083], 1.585 [1.070-2.349] and 2.019 [1.385-2.941], respectively) and delivering an LGA fetus (OR 2.020 [1.145-3.565], 2.112 [1.172-3.805] and 3.639 [2.110-6.276], respectively). Underweight mothers (OR 2.911 [1.148-7.382]) were at significantly higher risk of delivering via vaginal operative delivery. Severely obese women (OR 0.425 [0.217-0.832]) on the other hand were at lower risk compared to normal weight women. Maternal age was associated with primary (OR 1.042 [1.019-1.067], p < 0.001 for the increase of 1 year) as well as emergent CS (OR 1.031 [1.007-1.055], p = 0.010 for the increase of 1 year).",
        "Conclusion": "    To conclude, we did observe significant differences between the GDM subtypes regarding their underlying characteristics and the course of their diagnostic process and were able to identify subtypes that were at higher risk of certain adverse perinatal outcomes. Women categorized as GDM-IFH or GDM-CH were more likely to need a type of insulin therapy, displayed a higher BMI, and their offspring had higher birthweight, birth weight percentiles and were more likely a LGA fetus, while neonates of women with GDM-IPH were at increased risk of low fetal weight. GDM-IFH was associated with primary CS, while GDM-IPH and GDM-CH were associated with emergent CS.\n\n    This analysis suggests that the categorization based on the 75 g oGTT glucose levels could be a practicable approach to adapt the prenatal care of women with GDM based on their risk factors. In the future, prospective studies taking the maternal risk factors into account should be conducted, possibly including interventions for women at risk.\n\n    Disclaimer/Publisher's Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

        "Discussion": "    Our analysis was able to corroborate the existence of three different types of metabolic phenotypes in women with GDM based on the 75 g oGTT levels. Each group revealed specific associations regarding the baseline characteristics as well as fetomaternal outcomes (Figure 4).\n\n    GDM-IFH women were the youngest but had the highest mean weight gain. GDM-CH women were the oldest and displayed the highest number of previous deliveries. Both groups presented with significantly higher pre-conceptional BMI than the GDM-IPH group.\n\n    GDM-IFH and GDM-CH women displayed an overall higher rate of well-established GDM risk factors, such as higher maternal age or BMI. This may explain, why GDM-IFH and GDM-CH women received the 75 g oGTT more frequently before 24 GW. The rate of a previous GDM was not assessable through our dataset, although it is an important contributing factor for the development of GDM and should be investigated in further studies.\n\n    Our results revealed a strong association of GDM-IFH and GDM-CH with the requirement of insulin therapy, which is corroborated by recent studies. Kotzaeridi et al. affirmed a \"worse metabolic profile\", higher BMI and an increased requirement for glucose-lowering medications in women with elevated fasting glucose, especially GDM-CH women. Their study additionally revealed a significantly higher BMI in GDM-IFH and GDM-CH patients compared to women without glucose intolerance.\n\n    It is well-established that GDM in itself increases the risk of neonates being LGA. We found that GDM-IFH and GDM-CH mothers delivered offspring with significantly higher birth weight as well as birth weight percentiles and increased odds of being LGA at the time of delivery compared to the GDM-IPH group. This aligns with findings of numerous studies, which previously demonstrated that maternal fasting glucose is strongly associated with LGA and higher birth weight. An analysis by Black et al. revealed higher rates of LGA and increased birth weight in women with fasting hyperglycemia, not only compared to patients with post-load hyperglycemia but to non-GDM patients as well. Uvena-Celebrezze et al. were able to establish a correlation of maternal fasting glucose and neonatal fat mass in a study that used the self-monitoring of glucose levels. Zawiejska et al. showed that maternal fasting hyperglycemia was associated with birthweight >= 4000 g.\n\n    The higher rate of LGA in GDM-IFH and GDM-CH groups possibly contributes to an increased rate of primary CS in these groups. The rates of primary CS were highest in the GDM-IFH group, however in the binomial logistic regression only the association of GDM-IFH with primary CS in comparison to GDM-CH reached statistical significance.\n\n    The risk of emergent CS was significantly increased in the GDM-IPH and GDM-CH groups compared to GDM-IFH, whereas we found no significant difference among the subgroups regarding cesarean section in general.\n\n    GDM-IPH women presented with a lower pre-conceptional BMI, were more likely nulliparous and required insulin therapy less often.\n\n    While we found a higher rate of vaginal operative deliveries in women with GDM-IPH, there was no association of the subtypes and vaginal operative deliveries in the logistic regression analysis. However, the odds of a vaginal operative delivery were significantly increased if women were underweight and/or nulliparous. These characteristics were more frequently displayed in the GDM-IPH group; therefore, this could explain the higher rate of vaginal operative delivery. This goes along with a recent analysis, that was able to demonstrate an association of vacuum extraction and nulliparity. Ramos et al. examined women requiring operative delivery assistance and found a decreased likelihood of vaginal operative delivery in women with pre-pregnancy obesity.\n\n    The rate of SGA was significantly higher in women of the GDM-IPH group; however, SGA did not reach statistical significance in the logistic regression. This may be explained by the strong association between nulliparity and SGA we found in our analysis, as well as the significantly higher rate of nulliparous women in the GDM-IPH group.\n\n    Previous studies found correlations of post-load hyperglycemia and gestational hypertension, hyperbilirubinemia and preterm delivery, whereas preterm delivery did not differ significantly among our subgroups and gestational hypertension and hyperbilirubinemia were not evaluated in this study.\n\n    Of note, IUFD and shoulder dystocia did not reach statistical significance, but all reported cases in our sample occurred either in women of the GDM-IFH or GDM-CH subgroups. Several other studies have previously shown associations of maternal fasting glucose and LGA or macrosomia with shoulder dystocia. They found fetal macrosomia to be a mediating factor between maternal fasting hyperglycemia and shoulder dystocia. A meta-analysis by Farrar et al. showed associations of fasting as well as post-load glucose levels with shoulder dystocia, although an increase in fasting glucose was more strongly associated.\n\n    A limitation of this study was the lack of healthy controls, as we collected the data solely from the gestational diabetes consultation without a control group. The inclusion of normal glucose tolerant women in previous studies, such as Kotzaeridi et al., has provided further insight and the advantage of contextualizing different pathological glucose response patterns. The study population consists of patients exclusively from one GDM consultation clinic in Berlin, Germany, which may have an impact on the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the sample sizes for the individual analyses of variables were not the same throughout the study, due to sporadically missing data. On the other hand, an important advantage is the large sample size and amount of different baseline and outcome parameters that were assessed in this study.",

        "Title": "    Cornea verticillata and acroparesthesia efficiently discriminate clusters of severity in Fabry disease",
        "Abstract": "    Fabry disease (OMIM #301 500), the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by enzymatic defects in alpha-galactosidase A (GLA gene; Xq22.1). Fabry disease has historically been characterized by progressive renal failure, early stroke and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a diminished life expectancy. A nonclassical phenotype has been described with an almost exclusive cardiac involvement. Specific therapies with enzyme substitution or chaperone molecules are now available depending on the mutation carried. Numerous clinical and fundamental studies have been conducted without stratifying patients by phenotype or severity, despite different prognoses and possible different pathophysiologies. We aimed to identify a simple and clinically relevant way to classify and stratify patients according to their disease severity.\n\n    Based on data from the French Fabry Biobank and Registry (FFABRY; n = 104; 54 males), we applied unsupervised multivariate statistics to determine clusters of patients and identify clinical criteria that would allow an effective classification of adult patients. Thanks to these criteria and empirical clinical considerations we secondly elaborate a new score that allow the severity stratification of patients.\n\n    We observed that the absence of acroparesthesia or cornea verticillata is sufficient to classify males as having the nonclassical phenotype. We did not identify criteria that significantly cluster female patients. The classical phenotype was associated with a higher risk of severe renal (HR = 35.1; p <10-3) and cardiac events (HR = 4.8; p = 0.008) and a trend toward a higher risk of severe neurological events (HR = 7.7; p = 0.08) compared to nonclassical males. Our simple, rapid and clinically-relevant FFABRY score gave concordant results with the validated MSSI.\n\n    Acroparesthesia and cornea verticillata are simple clinical criteria that efficiently stratify Fabry patients, defining 3 different groups: females and males with nonclassical and classical phenotypes of significantly different severity. The FFABRY score allows severity stratification of Fabry patients.",
        "Introduction": "    Fabry disease (FD; OMIM #301 500) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by an enzymatic defect of the hydrolase alpha-galactosidase A (AGAL-A), resulting in the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, mainly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacetylated form globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3), the latter being commonly used as a surrogate biomarker. FD has historically been characterized by acral pain, angiokeratoma, cerebral strokes, progressive renal failure and cardiomyopathy, with a diminished life-expectancy. However, the clinical presentation and incidence of FD are changing as the diagnostic approach is moving from clinicobiochemical algorithms to genetic screenings. Indeed, the first estimations based on clinical ascertainment before 2000 evaluated the incidence of FD between 1:40,000-117,000 live births, whereas three recent newborn screening studies observed incidences greater than 1:10,000. Since 1990, a nonclassical or late-onset phenotype of FD has been described, with higher residual AGAL-A activity and predominant, if not isolated, cardiac manifestations. The majority of the individuals detected by genetic screenings carry galactosidase A alpha (GLA) variants that are usually associated with this nonclassical phenotype of FD. The classical and nonclassical phenotypes have been empirically determined on the basis of the presence or absence of characteristic symptoms (usually neuropathic pain, angiokeratoma, and cornea verticillata (CV)), GLA enzyme activity and/or the GLA genetic variant, though without any consensus. As the prognosis of the different phenotypes is markedly different, there is a need to determine reproducible classification criteria to improve the reliability of therapeutic studies and to personalize the bedside management of FD. Some scoring systems already exist, and they have been elaborated with empirical considerations; these scoring systems include many nonobjective criteria with several items that make them difficult to use in a daily practice. Moreover, existing scoring systems do not differentiate nonclassical from classical phenotypes of the disease whereas a growing literature suggests the need for personalized management. In this study, we employed unsupervised multivariate statistics for clinical data to identify simple and objective criteria that would allow an effective classification of adult patients. Additionally, we propose a new and simple scoring system based on this classification to assess the clinical severity and facilitate the management of FD patients.",
        "Methods": "    We analyzed data from patients prospectively included in the multicenter cohort FFABRY with an enzymatic and/or genetic diagnosis of FD from December 2014 to May 2017. Written consent were obtained after written and verbal information. The present study was approved by the local ethics committee (Comite de Protection des Personnes VI:Pitie Salpetriere) and the Comite consultatif sur le traitement de l'information en matiere de recherche dans le domaine de la sante, according to the relevant French legislation. Clinical data were prospectively collected through a standardized online form. Cardiac hypertrophy was defined as diastolic interventricular septum thickness > 13 mm by cardiac echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Arrhythmia was defined as the presence of cardiac conduction defect or rhythm trouble. Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was based on the CKD-EPI equation. Glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as eGFR > 135ml/min/1.73m2. Proteinuria was positive if above 0.3 g/24 h or if the proteinuria/creatininuria ratio was > 50 mg/ mmol. Cornea verticillata was assessed via slit-lamp examination. If not mentioned in the medical records, the patients were considered to not have a history of the following items: cerebral stroke, movement disorder, seizure, renal or cardiac transplantation, dialysis, need of a pacemaker (PM), and cardiac failure. All other items were considered missing if not mentioned. The Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) was calculated automatically according to the scoring system established by Whybra et al..\n\n    Blood samples were collected at the time of inclusion. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation using BD Vacutainer  serum tubes with an increased silica act clot activator and BD Vacutainer  heparin tubes before storage at -80 C. All patients were screened for the presence of anti-agalsidase antibodies, as previously described. LysoGb3 concentrations were measured in available plasma samples (n = 36) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), as previously described.\n\n    Males and females were analyzed separately due to the known phenotype differences. We performed ascending hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) after multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) for the following categorical variables: presence or history of CV, angiokeratoma, history of Fabry acral pain, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmia, eGFR </> 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, renal transplant, ischemic stroke and hearing loss and GLA variant type (missense vs. others). All the categorical variables were used as active and included in the clinical clustering except the GLA variant type used as illustrative. Cerebral MRI abnormalities were excluded due to missing data. Age was considered an illustrative variable and was not included in the clustering. MCA and HCPC were performed with R software version 3.4.0 and the package FactoMineR. Patients with missing data were excluded from this analysis. The correlation between variable and dimension was considered significant at p < 0.02. We defined the best algorithm to meet the previous clusters using ROC curves. After verification for normal distribution and equality of variances with Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively, we employed parametric tests such as the t-test with and without Welch's correction for unequal variances, Pearson correlation and linear regression for Gaussian values, or nonparametric tests such as Kruskal-Wallis (KW) and Mann-Whitney (MW) comparison tests and the Spearman correlation test. We used the log-rank test with Kaplan-Meier to analyze the survival distribution. We applied logistic regression with stepwise selection based on p-values for discrete variables and Fisher's exact t-test for contingency. The p-value for the alpha-risk in all tests, except for MCA and HCPC, was 0.05. GraphPad Prism 5.0 and the EZR plugin version 1.35v packages for R software were used.",
        "Results": "    From December 2014 to May 2017, 104 patients (54 males) were prospectively included in the FFABRY cohort. Their general characteristics are described in Table 1.\n\n    Multiple component analysis (MCA) and hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) were performed with data for 41 male patients who had available complete data (Fig 1). Their mean age was 44.4 years-old. We assume that treatment with ERT or chaperone therapy does not modify the overall phenotype of patients. Six patients were untreated at the inclusion (mean age 34.6 years-old; min-max 17.1-58.1 y.). Mean duration of treatment was 6.5 years in treated patients (min:max: 0.26-15.5 y.). The first 2 dimensions of MCA expressed 53.7% of the total inertia. An ascending HCPC performed on the first 5 dimensions identified 3 different clusters (Fig 2). Group 1 (mean age = 50.5 +/- 11.2 years; n = 21) was characterized by the absence of CV (p<10-7), the absence of angiokeratoma (p<10-4), the absence of acral pain (p<0.001), a missense mutation (p<0.02), eGFR > 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p<0.02), and the absence of renal transplant (p = 0.02). Group 2 (mean age = 32.3 +/- 9.9 years; n = 13) was characterized by the absence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (p<10-3), the presence of CV (p = 0.001), the presence of angiokeratoma (p = 0.003), the presence of acral pain (p = 0.007), and eGFR > 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. Group 3 (mean age = 48.8 +/- 9.5 years; n = 7) was characterized by eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p<10-6), a history of renal transplant (p<10-4) and the presence of CV (p = 0.002). On the basis of these characteristics, we considered group 1 to be the nonclassical phenotype and groups 2 and 3 to be the classical phenotype, with younger and older patients, respectively. When considering the absence of acral pain or CV as criteria for the nonclassical phenotype, we met the previously defined clusters with a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 91.0%, a positive predictive value of 89.5%, a negative predictive value of 91.0%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.9.\n\n    We applied the same approach for females using the same variables for patients with complete data (n = 36). MCA and HCPC revealed 3 different clusters without any clinical significance (Fig 3). Therefore, we considered that clinical clustering was not appropriate for females.\n\n    As already mentioned, the morbidity of FD relies on renal, cardiac and central nervous system involvement. Hence, the prognosis of FD depends on the clinical phenotype of patients. Based on the results of the previous clustering, we introduce the first severity scoring system that takes into account the clinical phenotype of FD. The FFABRY score is therefore constructed with 4 variables: the overall clinical phenotype, the kidney disease score, the heart disease score and the central nervous system score as followed:\n\n    Males with the classical phenotype: past or actual acroparesthesia and cornea verticillata\n\n    Males with the nonclassical phenotype: no past or actual acroparesthesia or no cornea verticillata\n\n    Females\n\n    FD renal involvement is progressive and characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration and proteinuria followed by a decrease in glomerular function. We propose the scale as follows:\n\n    K0: No proteinuria and 90 > eGFR > 135 ml/min/1.73 m2\n\n    K1: Hyperfiltration such as eGFR >= 135ml/min/1.73m2 without proteinuria\n\n    K2: 60 < eGFR <= 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 OR proteinuria > 0.3g/24h or 50 mg/ mmol\n\n    K3: 30 < eGFR <= 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 +/- proteinuria.\n\n    K4: 15 < eGFR <= 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 +/- proteinuria.\n\n    K5: eGFR <= 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis or renal transplant.\n\n    FD is a cause of HCM, progressively leading to diastolic dysfunction, ischemia or obstructive cardiac failure. FD is also characterized by arrhythmia, which has become the leading cause of death. An interventricular septum thickness (IST) > 30 mm has been associated with a high risk for sudden death. Additionally, we propose the following staging:\n\n    H0: No HCM. No cardiac symptomatology.\n\n    H1: HCM such as 13 < IST <= 30 mm and/or QRS interval on ECG >= 200 msec and/or ventricular hypertrophy on ECG without cardiac symptoms and no need of antiarrhythmic or beta-blockers.\n\n    H2: H1 + need of antiarrhythmic or beta-blockers*.\n\n    H3: 35% < Left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) <= 50% and/or a need of pacemaker (PM) implantation and/or angina.\n\n    H4: Need of heart transplant or LVEF <= 35% or IST > 30 mm.\n\n    * according to guidelines on management of HCM\n\n    In a logistic regression model, we observed that chronic headaches were associated with a higher risk of stroke in males (OR 16.2, p = 0.01), independent of renal and cardiac diseases. Moreover, a trend toward a higher risk of cerebral stroke was observed in males with cochlear disorder defined by the presence of tinnitus or hearing loss (OR 7.8, p = 0.054), independent of age. Additionally, we propose the following staging:\n\n    N0: No chronic headache and no cochlear disorder and no history of stroke.\n\n    N1: Chronic headache and/or tinnitus and/or hearing loss and no history of stroke.\n\n    N2: History of cerebral stroke.\n\n    The total (T) score was defined as the sum of the K-, H- and N-scores.\n\n    Using our clustering criteria, we distinguished 29 males with the classical phenotype, 25 males with the nonclassical phenotype and 50 females. Their clinical and biochemical characteristics are described extensively in Table 2. Briefly, among males, those with the nonclassical phenotype were diagnosed at an older age (45.4 vs. 28.6 years; p < 10-3) and had a milder phenotype including a less steep eGFR slope (-1.7 vs. -2.4 ml/min/1.72m2/ years; p < 0.05), a lower risk of renal transplantation (log-rank, HR = 0.07; p < 10-3) and a lower risk of cerebral stroke (1/25 vs. 4/29; non-significant). Surprisingly, ENT involvement was frequent in both male groups, being observed in 70.0% of classical and 52.0% of nonclassical cases (p = ns). Of note, one of the most commonly reported symptoms was anxiety, which was observed in 70.3% of the male patients, with suicide attempts reported for 10.5% of the male cohort. Females exhibited a contrasting globally milder phenotype (Fig 4 and Table 2). However, 18.0% of them had a history of ischemic stroke, with a median age at diagnosis of 45.1 years, and the event was significantly associated with the existence of cardiac rhythm problems (OR: 15.3; p = 0.046). Such an association with rhythm problems was not observed in men.\n\n    Clustering appeared clinically relevant using both MSSI and FFABRY scores, with significant differences between groups stratified by classes of ages (Table 3). The classical phenotype was associated with a higher risk of severe renal events (K-score >= 3; Cox analysis: HR (classical/ nonclassical) = 35.1; p <10-3; HR (classical/ females) = 100; p < 10-5; Fig 4) and a higher risk of severe cardiac events (H-score >= 3; Cox analysis: HR (classical vs. nonclassical) = 4.8; p = 0.008; HR (classical/ females) = 16.7; p < 10-4; Fig 4), and there was a trend toward a higher risk of severe neurological events (N-score = 2) in males with the classical compared to the nonclassical phenotype (Cox analysis; HR = 7.7; p = 0.08, Fig 4). There was no significant difference among females (HR = 2.5; p = 0.2). T-score evolution illustrated that the overall severity increased with time in the classical group compared to the nonclassical group (Fig 5).\n\n    LysoGb3 plasma levels were higher in males with the classical phenotype compared to those with the nonclassical phenotype or females in both treatment-naive (respective medians 101.8, 5.8 and 3.2; Kruskal Wallis p < 0.04) and in treated (respective medians 18.9, 6.7 and 4.5; p < 10-4) patients. As expected, there was no correlation between lysoGb3 plasma levels and FFABRY scores after stratification by phenotype among treated patients. Two female and 18 male patients were positive for anti-agalsidase antibodies. If considering only males who had been exposed to agalsidase, the presence of antibodies was significantly associated with the classical phenotype (56% vs. 20%, p < 0.02). Their characteristics have already been reported.\n\n    Among the 30 different genetic variants observed in males, nonsense variants were associated with the classical phenotype (9/13 patients with nonsense variants). The four patients classified in the nonclassical group had no cornea verticillata: a c.802-3_802-2del carrier with a K1H3N0 score at 17.1 years, two c.847C>T carriers with K0H1N0 and K0H1N1 scores at 33.4 and 47.3 years, and a c.522T>A carrier with a K2H0N0 score at 47.7 years. Five variants were observed in both the classical and nonclassical groups: c.334C>T, c.847C>T, c.802-3_802-2del, c. 902G>A and c.1010T>C. Their characteristics are described in Table 4.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The nonclassical phenotype of FD has become the most prevalent. However, most clinical and fundamental research studies addressing with FD have not stratified patients based on phenotype. Here, we propose a simple algorithm to distinguish patients. We demonstrate that CV assessed by slit-lamp and acral pain, but not angiokeratoma, are statistically sufficient to distinguish males with the classical phenotype from those with the nonclassical phenotype, with significant differences in terms of severity. As expected, males with the classical phenotype have more severe renal disease than do males with the nonclassical phenotype, but the former also experience cardiomyopathy earlier, and some of them also have stroke early, independent of arrhythmia. Females cannot be separated into classical and nonclassical phenotypes, likely due to the X-inactivation status in the different organs.\n\n    Hemangiomas, which are frequent, can easily be misdiagnosed as angiokeratoma, which may explain the reduced specificity of angiokeratoma for the classical phenotype. In contrast, CV is a pivotal criterion in our classification. Although CV can be related to exposure to amiodarone, its association with the severity of FD has already been described, as observed in 94% of classical Fabry cases. A recent paper reported that CV is often underdiagnosed in FD using the slit-lamp approach. The present work concerned 4 males whose phenotype was not mentioned and 10 females. However, whether a more sensitive approach using in vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM) may reveal minimal deposits in nonclassical patients and females is not the question. Hence, we suggest that an unquestionable CV, with obvious deposits assessed by slit-lamp, is associated with a classical FD phenotype. Similarly, our second pivotal criterion is the existence past or actual of acral pain and not the proof of small fiber neuropathy assessed by paraclinical exams.\n\n    Our study was based on data for 104 adult patients; a small number of patients is inherent with the rarity of FD. However, FFABRY is a multicenter database including patients from different pedigrees, different medical specialties (nephrology, cardiology, internal medicine, and genetics) and different locations in France, which allows for clinical and genetic heterogeneity (42 different variants) that benefits analyses. We used a linear regression model to assess the slope of eGFR evolution in the cohort, which is limited by the heterogeneity of patients, especially females. Analysis of X-inactivation may allow for a better classification of the female phenotype and help in stratifying the risk of severe events; unfortunately, this analysis remains unavailable in routine practice. As experts managing lysosomal diseases in a dedicated tertiary center, we assume that treatment with ERT or chaperone therapy has not modified the overall natural history of the disease or the prognosis of patients. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, regression but no disappearance of CV has ever been reported.\n\n    In the era of evidence-based medicine, severity scores have become mandatory for evaluating therapeutics. With FFABRY, we propose a clinically and statistically objective severity scoring system for FD. The FFABRY score was developed based on the natural history of FD and the severe clinically relevant events we observed in our center of expertise for lysosomal diseases. Our N-score highlights the importance of cochlear disorders and headaches, which are associated with the risk of cerebral stroke in males, whereas white matter lesions (WMLs) were not related to any specific symptom.\n\n    FFABRY allowed us to establish a portrait of current Fabry patients, distinguishing males with classical and nonclassical phenotypes and females with their proper clinical specificity. Interestingly, we observed no systematic genotype-phenotype correlation. Some patients sharing the same genetic variant were classified into two different groups. The FFABRY scores as well as individual clinical criteria demonstrated that our classification performed better than genotype for describing disease severity. Other scoring systems have already been developed for FD. The MSSI, which has been the most commonly used scoring system, was developed on the basis of data from 24 males and 15 females registered in the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) database (Shire-Takeda). The MSSI includes 26 variables, empirically weighted, among which hemorrhoids, facial appearance and subjective fitness assessment are notable; however, the MSSI does not include renal transplantation. The Disease Severity Scoring System (DS-3), which was elaborated by experts from the Fabry Registry (Sanofi-Genzyme), also includes nonobjective items such as the \"patient reported domain\" or sweating capacity. WMLs are included, though they are asymptomatic and not associated with poorer outcomes. Finally, the different items and their weightings have been empirically and not statistically established in these two scoring systems. Moreover, the number of items makes them challenging to use and time consuming. The Fabry International Prognostic Index (FIPI) appears to be much more robust, as it has been developed on the basis of multivariate analyses of data from 1483 patients from the FOS registry. Although FIPI appears to be an effective prediction tool, it does not allow assessment of the actual clinical severity. Indeed, five of the six variables included in the cardiac item refer to extracardiac symptoms (eGFR, proteinuria, deafness, vertigo, and angiokeratoma). The online Fabry Stabilization index (FASTEX) was recently validated, and the authors established an attractive tool for personal follow-up of individuals. Nevertheless, clinical phenotypes are not distinguished in this system, which could be misleading for interindividual comparisons, making the scoring system useless in group studies. After stratification according to phenotype, FFABRY scores allowed a rapid and clinically relevant evaluation of disease severity. Analyses of the K score highlight the suboptimal management of FD females in our cohort. Our study also emphasizes windows of opportunity for the diagnosis and introduction of specific treatments, as follows: before 30 years old in males with the classical phenotype, 45 years old in males with the nonclassical classical phenotype and 50 years old in females. Regarding the obviously different prognoses observed with the FFABRY score, we believe that the classical and nonclassical phenotypes should be considered as two different subtypes of FD in males, with different management strategies. As for Niemann-Pick disease A and B or Gaucher types 1, 2 and 3, it would be useful to rename the phenotypes for male patients, with classical as type 1 and nonclassical as type 2, to fully take into account such obvious clinical differences and possible pathophysiological differences.\n\n    Identifying acral pain and cornea verticillata is a rapid and simple approach that statistically discriminates Fabry phenotypes.",

        "Title": "    Exome sequencing of families from Ghana reveals known and candidate hearing impairment genes",
        "Abstract": "    We investigated hearing impairment (HI) in 51 families from Ghana with at least two affected members that were negative for GJB2 pathogenic variants. DNA samples from 184 family members underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES). Variants were found in 14 known non-syndromic HI (NSHI) genes [26/51 (51.0%) families], five genes that can underlie either syndromic HI or NSHI [13/51 (25.5%)], and one syndromic HI gene [1/51 (2.0%)]. Variants in CDH23 and MYO15A contributed the most to HI [31.4% (16/51 families)]. For DSPP, an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was detected. Post-lingual expression was observed for a family segregating a MARVELD2 variant. To our knowledge, seven novel candidate HI genes were identified (13.7%), with six associated with NSHI (INPP4B, CCDC141, MYO19, DNAH11, POTEI, and SOX9); and one (PAX8) with Waardenburg syndrome. MYO19 and DNAH11 were replicated in unrelated Ghanaian probands. Six of the novel genes were expressed in mouse inner ear. It is known that Pax8-/- mice do not respond to sound, and depletion of Sox9 resulted in defective vestibular structures and abnormal utricle development. Most variants (48/60; 80.0%) have not previously been associated with HI. Identifying seven candidate genes in this study emphasizes the potential of novel HI genes discovery in Africa.\n\n    Whole-exome sequencing for 51 families in Ghana reveals 7 candidate genes associated with hearing impairment, 6 of which have previously been demonstrated to be expressed in the mouse inner ear.",
        "Introduction": "    Hearing impairment (HI) is a sensory disorder that can be mild to profound and has an incidence of 2-3 out of 1000 live births in developed countries and twice as high in developing countries. HI is often caused by acquired factors such as infectious diseases and antibiotic exposure. Genetic factors are known to cause ~50% of congenital HI, and to date, >120 non-syndromic (NS) HI genes have been identified. GJB2 is the most common gene associated with autosomal recessive (AR) NSHI among European populations.\n\n    Although connexin genes are the most widely reported HI genes, their contribution to HI in sub-Saharan African populations is negligible. However, Ghana is an exception with a high frequency of the founder GJB2-p.R143W variant, which accounts for at least 27% of HI in Ghanaian families segregating ARNSHI, 8% of isolated NSHI cases, and a population carrier frequency of 0.7%.\n\n    Considering the highly heterogeneous status of HI, next-generation sequencing platforms and particularly whole-exome sequencing (WES) have recently enhanced the discovery of novel HI gene variants. In the current study of families from Ghana, we used WES to investigate rare variants in GJB2-negative families segregating HI.",
        "Methods": "    We observed and adhered strictly to the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approvals were obtained from Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research Institutional Review Board (NMIMR-IRB CPN 006/16-17) and College of Basic and Applied Sciences, Ethics Committee for Basic and Applied Sciences (ECBAS 053/19-20) the University of Cape Town, Faculty of Health Sciences' Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 104/2018), and the Institutional Review Boards of Columbia University (IRB-AAAS2343). The study was clearly explained to each participant in the language in which they are fluent and informed consent was signed prior to participation. Parents/guardians provided signed consent for their children who were <=18 years of age. In addition, assent was obtained for children older than 7 years of age. Where applicable, informed consent was obtained from the study participants for publishing their images.\n\n    Patient recruitment procedures were previously described. The probands of Ghanaian families segregating HI were identified through nine schools for the deaf across the country (Fig. 1), and additional family members were recruited thereafter. Families with HI were also identified and recruited through our community engagement activities (Fig. 1). Medical records of all our participants were reviewed by a medical geneticist, and an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Detailed personal and family histories were obtained through a rigorous clinical interview. A structured questionnaire was used to interview each participant to rule out potential environmental causes of HI. The studied families had at least two members affected with HI that followed a Mendelian mode of inheritance. For those participants that were ascertained from schools for the deaf, before being admitted to the school they had undergone a systemic general and otological examination, that included pure tone audiometry.\n\n    A total of 5 ml of peripheral blood was obtained from each participant and genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from the samples using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit  (Qiagen, USA).\n\n    All hearing-impaired participants were first screened using targeted sequencing as described previously, and shown to be negative for PLP GJB2 variants including the del(GJB6-D13S1830) deletion. Allele-specific primers were used to amplify the coding region of GJB2 and GJB6. By the use of BigDye  Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), the amplicons were Sanger sequenced and resolved using ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A total of 88 families were ascertained altogether and 37/88 were found with GJB2 variants and excluded from the set of 51 families to be studied by WES (Fig. 1a).\n\n    gDNA samples from 51 families with at least two affected hearing-impaired family members (Fig. 1) underwent WES. The DNA concentration and quality checks were conducted using the QuantiFluor dsDNA System on a Quantus Fluorometer (Promega, Madison, WI). The exome library for 129 samples (batch one) was prepared using the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), 50 ng of gDNA was fragmented using the Nextera transposomes and the resultant libraries were hybridized with a 37 Mb probe pool to enrich exome sequences. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the use of the pair-end 100 bp run format. The exome library preparation of the rest of the samples (n = 51, batch two) was performed using SureSelect V4 + UTR 71 Mb All Exon Capture Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), ~3-5 microg of the DNA was fragmented with ultrasound using a Covaris  instrument (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and produced paired-end reads of 100 bp. The exome sequence data mapping and variant calling were performed using the Illumina BaseSpace app suite. The Illumina DRAGEN Germline Pipeline v3.2.8 was used to align the sequence reads to the human reference genome (hg19) and variants were jointly called using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATKv4.1.7) software package. Variant quality was assessed using variant quality score recalibration (VQSR) using the ApplyVQSR function of GATK.\n\n    An in-house pipeline that uses ANNOVAR, dbNSFP, and dbscSNV was used to annotate and filter single-nucleotide and insertion/deletion (indels) variants. Filtering was performed using Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) population-specific MAF of <0.005 [for AR and X-linked (XL)] and <0.0005 for AD with variants meeting these criteria being further ranked based on the bioinformatics prediction scores from SIFT; polymorphism phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2) MutationTaster; CADD; deleterious annotation of genetic variants using neural networks (DANN); and Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP++). Information from the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (HHL), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and ClinVar databases and deafness animal models were also used to prioritize identified variants. The MAFs of variants were further evaluated using the TOPMed Bravo database. In families for which candidate variant(s) were not identified exome sequence data were also analyzed for CNV using CoNIFER. These variants were assessed for their clinical significance based on the ACMG-AMP classification, considering CADD scores, and their allele frequencies in gnomAD and TOPMed databases (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).\n\n    Joint calling was performed on samples in each batch separately and two VCF files were generated that included only variants with read depth >8, genotype quality >20%, and that passed VQSR filters. Biallelic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) for both batches (176,820 for batch one and 326,250 for batch two) were then extracted into separate VCF files. Further quality control to remove variants that were present in only one batch was performed by applying a genotyping call rate of 95%. The phased batch one and two data sets were then merged using bcftools and contained 1,141,838 biallelic SNVs of the phased 1KGP3 data, that were polymorphic in the Mende population from Sierra Leone (MSL). The MSL population has been previously reported to harbor a large proportion of basal West African ancestry. Further quality control includes the removal of variant sites missing more than 5% of their genotypes and samples missing more than 10% of their data, as well as the removal of variants that failed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test at a threshold of 1 x 10-6, and SNVs with MAF < 0.05 was applied to the merged data set using PLINK2 leaving a total of 18,880 SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium-pruning including only SNPs with r2 < 0.2 within a 50 bp region (window size = 10 bp) left 14,987 high-quality SNVs for inclusion in the PCA, for which five PCs were computed using PLINK2.\n\n    Various publicly available RNA sequencing and microarray data sets were used for an in silico investigation of the expression of CCDC141, DNAH11, INPP4B, MYO19, PAX8, and SOX9 in the developing and adult mouse inner ear. To study the expression during mouse craniofacial development, series GSE55966 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database was evaluated. This data set includes RNA sequence data of CD1 mouse embryos at three stages: E8.5, E9.5, and E10.5. Craniofacial gene expression data were presented as a set of FPKM (fragments per kilobase million) values for 13 different tissue/stage pairs that were converted to TPM (transcripts per kilobase million) values for our analysis.\n\n    We also studied expression levels during mouse inner ear development in previously generated data sets present in the Shared Harvard Inner-Ear Laboratory Database (SHIELD). The first data set detailed expression over four developmental stages: E16, P0, P4, and P7. Data were obtained from the cochlea and utricles of mice that expressed EGFP under the Pou4f3 promoter. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to separate cells into hair cells (GFP+) and surrounding cells (GFP-) prior to RNA extraction. To supplement these data, a second data set was downloaded, which contained expression data for six developmental stages: E12, E13, E16, P0, P6, and P15. The expression data were produced by Affymetrix Mouse 420 v.2 GeneChips and subset into expression in spiral ganglion neurons and vestibular ganglion neurons.\n\n    Lastly, the gene Expression Analysis Resource (gEAR) suite was used to visualize expression in cells of the cochlear epithelium during mouse development. gEAR includes single-cell RNA sequence data obtained from CD1 mouse embryos at four developmental stages: E14, E16, P1, and P7. CCDC141, DNAH11, INPP4B, MYO19, and SOX9 expression was also grouped based on cell groups in four overarching classes: developing supporting cells, developing prosensory cells, developing sensory cells, and developing greater epithelial ridge cells of which each were further divided into subclasses.\n\n    Allele-specific primers (Supplementary Table 6) were designed using NCBI primer BLAST  and optimized for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the regions of MYO19 and DNAH11. The initial denaturation temperature was 95  C for 3 min and 30 s for subsequent denaturation. An annealing temperature was 60  C for 30 s and an extension temperature of 72  C for 1 min for 35 cycles was employed. The PCR amplicons were sanger sequencing using BigDye  Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The Sanger sequences were resolved using ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\n    The human INPP4B (ID: O15327), MYO19 (Q96H55), DNAH11 (ID: Q96DT5), CCDC141 (ID: Q6ZP82), and PAX8 (ID: Q06710) protein sequences were obtained from the UniProt database for homology modeling. To find appropriate structural templates for these proteins, PSI-BLAST was run against the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The crystal structure of PDB ID: 2Q5D, PDB ID: 5IOI, PDB ID: 3VKG, PDB ID: 3EDV, and PDB ID 4K6J were used as a template for the construction of INPP4B (residue 215-877), MYO19 (residue 30-804), DNAH11 (residue 1372-4515), CCDC141 (residue 36-562), and PAX8 (residue 120-398) protein models. Homology modeling was carried out for WT and mutant proteins using MODELLER based on the sequence alignment generated between the template and target sequences. The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver Electrostatics plugin of PyMOL was used for protein surface electrostatic potentials. PyMOL version 2.0.3 was used for visualization and the processing of figures.\n\n    Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
        "Results": "    The study participants were recruited across the country with the majority from the Eastern region of Ghana (Fig. 1a, b), which has the highest number of schools for the deaf. These are boarding schools with students mostly from the surrounding towns and villages. A total of 88 families were ascertained, of which 37 could be explained by GJB2 mutations leaving 51 families for further study (Fig. 1a). The number of affected females and males included in the study (from whom WES was performed) who are negative for GJB2 variants was 48 (46.2%) and 56 (53.8%) (Supplementary Fig. 1), respectively.\n\n    The analysis of the student records retrieved from the schools for the deaf showed that all the students had bilateral HI. For the 51 pedigrees for which exome sequence data were generated, 50 (98.0%) families have members with prelingual HI while one family (Fam18, Supplementary Fig. 1g) has affected members with post-lingual HI, that developed HI at >8 years of age. Except for the post-lingual family, none of the hearing-impaired participants have verbal communication and are only able to communicate through sign language.\n\n    Although the student records confirmed that all the students had sensorineural HI, we were only able to retrieve audiograms for 39 study participants. The audiogram for most of the participants could not be obtained from the schools' archives, and several of them had written audiological reports without an attached audiogram from the hearing assessment center. For the retrieved audiograms, the hearing threshold across all frequencies tested was 101.8 dB (standard deviation = 10.3) in the better ear. There was no significant difference in the pure tone average of the left and right ears for the hearing-impaired participants. Two unrelated families 2/51 (3.9%) included in the study clinically expressed phenotypes of Waardenburg syndrome (Supplementary Fig. 1f).\n\n    The analysis of the families enrolled in the study showed that the majority [37/51, (72.5%)] families) exhibited a likely AR mode of inheritance (Fig. 1c, Tables 1-3 and Supplementary Figs. 2-6). Six families showed a pattern of inheritance compatible with an autosomal dominant (AD) mode of inheritance (11.8%) (Fig. 1d, Tables 1, 3 and Supplementary Figs. 2-6). One family (2.0%) had a possible X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. The mode of inheritance in seven families was inconclusive since the pattern of inheritance is compatible with AR and X-linked recessive. None of the families segregated HI in a fashion that is compatible with mitochondrial inheritance. The average number of family members for whom a DNA sample was obtained is four. The maximum number of affected individuals per family was five (n = 2 families), with most families having two affected members (n = 38 families) (Supplementary Fig. 1). WES data were generated on DNA samples obtained from one affected member for two families, two affected members for 45 families, and three affected members for four families (n = 104; Supplementary Fig. 1). From all families, a total of 9 affected and 31 unaffected participants had available DNA but were not exome sequenced.\n\n    Principal components (PCs) constructed using genotype data obtained from families in this study were projected against data extracted from participants of continental ancestries in the 1000 Genomes reference panel (phase 3 version 5) showed that our samples clustered with other African populations, as expected (Fig. 2a). When projected only against African populations, our samples clustered between samples from Nigeria [YRI (Yoruba) and ESN (Esan)], and Sierra Leone [MSL (Mende)] as geographically expected, with closer proximity to the YRI population of Nigeria (Fig. 2b). Projecting all other family members against the coordinates of one member per family showed that members of the same family clustered close to each other (Supplementary Fig. 1h).\n\n    DNA samples from a total of 180 individuals from 51 GJB2-negative families underwent WES, including 104 hearing-impaired individuals and 76 unaffected family members. In these 51 families, variants in known human HI genes were found in 40/51 (78.4%) families, and highly likely candidate genes in 7/51 (13.7%). A total of 60 variants were found in 26 genes identified in the families studied (Fig. 2c, d and Tables 1, 2). The identified genes were randomly distributed across the territories of Ghana (Fig. 2c). Forty-four of the variants were missense variants and the remaining variants were insertion/deletion (1), nonsense (9), or non-coding variants (6) (Fig. 2e and Tables 1, 2). Of all the variants, 12 (20.0%) were not observed in dbSNP, gnomAD, Ensembl, and TOPMed databases. Thirty-eight of the 60 variants (63.3%) were present in databases but were not previously reported to be associated with HI, including 24 of 48 (50.0%) variants in known HI genes. Only 10 (16.6%) of the observed variants were previously reported to be associated with HI (Fig. 2f).\n\n    Most families investigated (30/51) had unique variants (Tables 1-3), confirming the high level of allelic heterogeneity for HI genes within the Ghanaian population. Variants in CDH23 (n = 8 families) and MYO15A (n = 8 families) accounted for the majority (31.4%) in this GJB2-negative group of families and represent 18.2% (16/88) of all families in the entire Ghanaian cohort initially recruited (Tables 1 and 2). GIPC3 and OTOF variants were found in three families each, while variants in ESPN and SLC26A4 were each found in two families, and variants in 20 other genes were only observed in one family (Tables 1, 2 and Fig. 2d). Thirty-one of the variants in known HI genes were classified as pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) and 32/51 families were found to segregate at least one pathogenic and likely pathogenic (PLP) variant (Supplementary Table 1).\n\n    Fourteen known NSHI genes were identified in 25 of the 51 families (49.0%). These genes included MYO15A that was one of the most common genes observed (n = 8 families: Table 1). For the NSHI genes, 13 compound heterozygote variants were identified, and each variant was unique to a family except for MYO15A c.6011C>T: p.(P2004L) and c.8340G>A: p.(T2780T) that were found in two families (Table 1). The other 12 NSHI genes were GIPC3, OTOF, ESPN, DSPP, GRXCR1, KARS, LOXHD1, MARVELD2, MYH14, OTOG, TMC1, and TRRAP (Table 1).\n\n    For DSPP, an ADNSHI gene, an AR mode of inheritance was detected in Fam37 (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\n    For MARVELD2, we found a post-lingual expression of ARNSHI in Fam18, with variable age of onset with two family members with onset at 12 years of age and a third family member with onset at 8 years of age. All the affected family members could efficiently read lips, and since the condition developed post-language acquisition, they were able to engage in verbal communications (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\n    Eight families segregated variants in CDH23 (OMIM: 601067) (Table 2), which has been implicated in Usher syndrome type 1D, ARNSHI, and age-related HI. All the variants (n = 6) identified in these families were classified as PLP based on the ACMG-AMP classification guidelines for HI (Supplementary Table 2). CDH23: c.4562A>G: p.(N1521S) and c.2746G>A: p.(D916N) were found in four and two families, respectively. The four families, which segregated the CDH23: c.4562A>G: p.(N1521S) variant, were ascertained in different geographical regions in Ghana. Three families were found to have compound heterozygote variants. In addition, Fam42 was found to have a CIB2 (OMIM: 605564): c.556C>T: p.(R186W) variant segregating with the HI phenotype (Table 2). The above variant was classified as likely pathogenic with a combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) score of 32, suggesting it is deleterious. The CIB2 [c.556C>T: p.(R186W)] variant was previously found in an Usher syndrome type 1J family, although it is currently questioned whether CIB2 is involved in Usher syndrome etiology. Moreover, MYO7A (OMIM: 276903) is associated with Usher Syndrome type 1B (OMIN: 276900), ARNSHI (OMIM: 600060), and ADNSHI (OMIM: 601317), and PLP variants in this gene were found in Fam8 (Table 2). Two families (Fam17 and Fam25) segregate SLC26A4 (OMIM: 605646) variants [c.2089+1G>A and c.1225C>T p.(R409C)]. SLC26A4 has been associated with ARNSHI and Pendred syndrome [(OMIM: 274600) (Table 2)]. Fam20 segregates ACTG1 (OMIM: 102560) variant c.94C>T: p.(P32S), ACTG1 has been associated with ADNSHI, and AD Baraitser-Winter syndrome 2 BWS2 [(OMIM: 614583); (Table 2)]. BWS2 is mostly likely always due to de novo variants, contrary to the Fam20 pedigrees that feature ADNSHI with an affected mother, four affected and two unaffected children of both sexes (Supplementary Fig. 4). For the families that segregate variants in genes associated with both NSHI and syndromic HI, there were no clinical signs observed during sample collection that would indicate that affected family members have syndromic HI.\n\n    HARS2 compound heterozygote variants were identified as the likely cause of HI in Fam16 (Table 2). HARS2 (OMIM: 600783) has been implicated in AR Perrault syndrome 2 (OMIM: 614926) that is characterized by HI in both males and females. Affected females also display primary amenorrhea, streak gonads, and infertility, while affected males show normal pubertal development and are fertile. Since the two HI family members are male, it is not possible to clinically diagnose this syndrome.\n\n    Six genes (INPP4B, CCDC141, MYO19, DNAH11, POTEI, and SOX9) whose variants segregate with NSHI were found in six families (11.8%). Five of the six families had compound heterozygote variants which segregated with ARNSHI (Table 3, Fig. 3, and Supplementary Table 3).\n\n    Two variants were intronic: In family 40, a splicing variant in MYO19 (c.2464-8T>C) segregated with HI but was found to be likely benign (Supplementary Table 4), but another biallelic missense variant in the same haplotype was classified as likely pathogenic (MYO19: c.949G>T). While a likely pathogenic splicing variant (SOX9: c.432-3C>A) was found in Fam45 segregated with an AD mode of inheritance (Supplementary Table 4). The gnomAD and TOPMed allele frequencies for these variants identified in candidate genes were either all zero or close to zero (Supplementary Table 3). CADD scores are also provided in Supplementary Table 3.\n\n    A variant in a candidate gene [PAX8: c.968C>G: p.(P323R)] was found in one of the two families clinically presenting with Waardenburg syndrome (Table 3 and Fig. 3). The patients presented with the typical features of Waardenburg syndrome: HI, striking blue eyes, and premature gray hair phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Because, in addition to HI Pax8 knockout mice model was reported to be athyroid, we investigated thyroid hormones profile in the family and found it to be normal in the affected mother and daughter, except for thyroid-stimulating hormone that was high in the affected daughter, suggesting a trend to hypothyroidism (Fig. 3f). Although the variant was not in gnomAD it was present with a low frequency in TOPMed (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 1.13 x 10-5) and had a CADD score of 14.55. In addition, it has been reported that Pax8-/- mice did not respond to sound when tested using auditory brain stem response (ABR). Moreover, abnormalities in the outer and middle ear structures were found in a high percentage of Pax8-/- mice. Maturation of the inner ear also appeared delayed by about 1 week with respect to euthyroid controls.\n\n    Additional variants were found in some of the families, but these variants either did not segregate with the phenotype, or a second heterozygote variant was not found for families with ARHI. One of such families was Fam26 (Fig. 3c) in which the LOXHD1 (OMIM:613072): c.4202C>T variant was found in the heterozygous state without a second variant. Fam39 (Fig. 3f) had only one affected family member positive for HGF (OMIM: 142409): c.776A>G; c.278G>C compound heterozygote variants. The same family member also had FOXI1 (OMIM:601093): c.776G>A heterozygote variant. In addition, a heterozygote COQ8A (OMIM: 606980): c.692A>C variant was segregated in Fam39 but a second variant was not identified. In Fam40 (Fig. 3b), a heterozygote MED12 (OMIM:300188): c.5348A>G variant was found. Compound heterozygote variants in GRXCR1 (OMIM:613283): c.74G>A; c.645G>T were found in only one affected Fam45 member. Other heterozygote variants observed in Fam45 were TECTA (OMIM:602574): c.545A>G and GREB1L (OMIM: 617782): c.2498C>A.\n\n    We investigated candidate genes in Ghanaian exomes data of non-familial/isolated HI cases (n = 153) and found two probands with compound heterozygous variants in DNAH11 and in one proband with MYO19 variants (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Using Sanger sequencing, we validated the variants found in DNAH11 and MYO19 in the three probands (Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\n    We investigated the expression of the six HI candidate genes in the inner ear via the interrogation of various expression atlases and found evidence of their expression. These genes all show expression in the inner ear hair cells, and in the spiral and vestibular ganglion during development [Fig. 4, Ccdc141 (panels a and g), Dnah11 (panels b and h), Inpp4b (panels c and i), Myo19 (panels d and j), Pax8 (panels e and k), Sox9 (panels f and l)]. In addition, there was evidence of expression in various other cell types of the cochlear floor epithelium (Supplementary Figs. 8-16). Myo19a shows a wide-spread expression in the cochlear epithelium throughout E14, E16, and P1, and is predominantly expressed in the inner hair cells at P7 (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 13-15). Sox9 shows a high and ubiquitous expression pattern across the entire cochlear epithelium, particularly during E14, E16, and P1. It displays a more restricted pattern during P7 with a predominant expression in the outer and inner pillar cells (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 13-15). Ccdc141 displays a wide-spread but low expression in the cochlear tissues throughout development, with high expression at E14 in the lesser epithelial ridge cells and the basilar membrane cells at P7 (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 13-15), Inpp4b and Dnah11 show a more restricted expression in the cochlear tissues throughout development, with Inpp4b expressed in the developing lateral great epithelial ridge cells at P1, the basilar membrane cells at P7; and Dnah11 expressed in developing inner hair cells and mature inner hair cells at P1 and P7 respectively (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12).\n\n    Moreover, five candidate genes i.e. Ccdc141, Inpp4b, Myo19, Sox9, and Pax8 also showed expression in various craniofacial tissues during early mouse development. Specifically, there was the greatest expression of Ccdc141, Inpp4b, Myo19, and Sox9 at E10.5, within the maxillary arch epidermal ectoderm for Ccdc141and Inpp4b; the lateral prominence neural epithelium for Myo19, and the central neural epithelium for Sox9 (Supplementary Fig. 15). The greatest expression of Pax8 occurs at E8.5 (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16), within the caudal brain neural epithelium (Supplementary Fig. 15). Dnah11 was not assessed in this latter data set and could not be interrogated.\n\n    In Fam6, compound heterozygous variants in POTEI: (c.1676G>C and c.409C>T) were found to segregate with ARNSHI. This gene does not have a mouse ortholog and expression data could not be investigated in the available data sets.\n\n    Homology modeling techniques were utilized to model the wild-type (WT) and the mutant missense variant(s) of three-dimensional structures of INPP4B, MYO19, DNAH11, CCDC141, and PAX8 proteins via the MODELLER program. In the case of INPP4B, the two mutated residues, I424 and Q616, reside at the helix and loop region, respectively (Fig. 5a). Both residues are located on the surface of the protein and do not interact directly with nearby residues. The substitution of nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid isoleucine into polar residue threonine at position 424 displays different surface patches of electrostatic potential (Fig. 5b). In the case of Q616H, the replacement of neutral polar charged glutamine into basic polar charged histidine causes a shift in electrostatic potential and surface area, as indicated by the arrow (Fig. 5c).\n\n    For MYO19, residue A317 is located at the surface of the protein in the myosin motor domain (Fig. 5d). The RMSD of WT (A317) and mutant (S317) MYO19 show a value of 0.52 A, suggesting a slight change in overall conformation (Fig. 5e). The electrostatic potential of mutant protein compared with WT displays a change in surface charge distribution as shown in Fig. 5f.\n\n    The mutated residue Q4323 in DNAH11 is located in the helix region of the AAA domain (Fig. 5g). The Q4323 residue is involved in an interaction with nearby residues, A4319, and S4302. The substitution of WT glutamine with a histidine residue changes the interaction network of nearby residues. We were unable to reliably model the I3744M variant for DNAH11.\n\n    For CCDC141, E68K and D235G both alter the nature of the side chain (Fig. 5h). The close views of WT and mutant CCDC141 protein display the change in the secondary structure and side chain of the nearby residues.\n\n    The superimposed structure of the WT and mutant structure of PAX8 structure displays a 0.52 A RMSD value suggesting the effect of the mutation on the overall conformation (Fig. 5i, j).\n\n    The POTEI p.(G559A) missense variant was modeled (Fig. 5k) and the predicted structure shows a minimal difference between the WT and mutated residues. The p.(R137X) variant in POTEI was not modeled as that one is predicted to lead to nonsense-mediated decay and there is likely no protein expression.\n\n    In four families (7.8%), a possible gene for HI was not identified. Although rare variants in HI genes were identified in the exome sequence data for these families, they were unlikely to be the cause of HI (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 17). An example is one family presenting with Waardenburg syndrome (Fam51) that had variants in three HI genes, but these variants did not segregate with the phenotype (Supplementary Table 5). Assuming an AD inheritance model (with a possible affected father), we did not find any variants in a known HI or Waardenburg gene. There are multiple possible candidate variants that will need confirmation in the future (Supplementary Table 5).\n\n    Fam4 segregates a previously reported BCORL1 (OMIM:300688) variant c.4079_ 4081del: p.(D1360_ L1361delinsV) with HI. BCORL1 causes Shukla-Vernon syndrome (OMIM: 301029), an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, variably impaired intellectual development, and behavioral abnormalities, including autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. This variant is unlikely to be responsible for HI because it has not been reported as part of this syndrome before. Moreover, Fam4 features NSHI. In addition, there is no inner ear expression data available for this gene. Fam4 segregates a heterozygous MYO15A variant that could have explained the HI, but a second variant could not be identified (Supplementary Fig. 17).\n\n    Fam48 had a heterozygous GJB2 p.(R143W) founder variant in one of the two affected family members, but a second GJB2 variant was not identified (Supplementary Table 5).\n\n    In Fam52, we identified compound heterozygous variants segregating with HI in DACT2 (c.796-12C>T and c.1021T>G). DACT2 is an important mediator involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways during development. DACT2 is expressed in the outer pillar cells of the inner ear, but its role in HI remains to be fully characterized. Moreover, the CADD score was low for one of the variants found in DACT2, and the other variant is located in the splicing region with no predicted impact on splicing. Also, for Fam52, compound heterozygous variants were found to segregate with HI in NCL [c.2065G>A: p.(G689S), and c.188A>G: p.(K63R)]. Ncl is widely expressed in the mouse and zebrafish ear. However, there is not enough evidence to support it as a good candidate and one of the variants was also found in the heterozygous state in three members of another family in this study, suggesting its frequency may be high in this population.\n\n    Last, no relevant copy number variations (CNVs) encompassing HI genes were identified in any of these families.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we investigated the largest exome sequence data set for sub-Saharan African families segregating HI. This study will inform and enhance genetic medicine practice locally in Ghana, and African populations in the diaspora, with putative West African/Ghanaian ancestry. The principal component analysis (PCA) plot shows the similarity between the data obtained from the studied families and those obtained for the Nigerian population (Fig. 2a, b). Our previous investigations identified GJB2: p.R143W variant as the most frequent cause of familial NSHI in Ghana. Putting together, the GJB2 positive rate from our previous studies and some additional families, we re-evaluated the contribution of GJB2 to 42.0% (37/88) among all families investigated (Fig. 1a). However, the majority of GJB2 positive cases originated from the same region (Eastern Region) where the village with a high prevalence of deafness (Adamorobe) is located. A frequency rate of 34.1% was estimated without the inclusion of cases from Adamorobe village.\n\n    The present data identified variants in 20 known HI genes of which CDH23 (8/88; 9.1%) and MYO15A (8/88; 9.1%) were observed to be the cause of NSHI in multiple families, supporting future prioritization of these two genes in clinical practice. Moreover, the overall combined frequency of 18.2 % (16/88) for CDH23 and MYO15A amongst hearing-impaired families in Ghana is likely underestimated due to an oversampling of GJB2 positive families, with the frequency amongst GJB2-negative families at 31.4% (16/51). Indeed, we probably oversampled families from the Eastern region of Ghana where the GJB2-p.(R143W) founder variant was first described and is more prevalent, and consequently where most schools for the deaf are established (Fig. 1b).\n\n    Similar to a previous study in Cameroon using a targeted panel sequencing, within the Ghana population there is a high degree of locus and allelic heterogeneity. Five out of the seven families (71.4%) solved in the Cameroonian study had compound heterozygote variants in the identified gene, likely due to the absence of consanguinity. In the current report, 22/47 solved (46.8%) GJB2-negative families display compound heterozygosity. This will pose a great challenge in the development of a single affordable diagnostic tool that can be widely used in clinical practice, specifically for compound heterozygotes, which are harder to detect than homozygous variants and also parents need to be investigated to ensure when two variants within a gene are on different haplotypes. Targeted sequencing panels are useful in diagnosing genetic HI, however, only known genes can be investigated. In addition, there is a need for constant upgrade and revalidation of the targeted sequencing panels whenever new HI genes are discovered. The above limitations, and the evidence illustrated by the present study advocate for the use of clinical WES and whole-genome sequencing. It is also worth noting that additional variants in known HI genes as found in this study (Tables 1 and 2) can complicate interpretation. In addition, the handling of incidental findings, in so-called actionable genes, and policies toward them is still to be implemented in African settings.\n\n    CDH23 has been implicated in ARNSHI and Usher syndrome type 1D (Table 2), and was reported as an important contributor to HI in several global populations with high frequencies in Eastern Asian countries such as Japan and Korea. Two of the identified CDH23 variants were previously associated with HI, c.5237G>A: p.(R1746Q) in Spain and Ireland and c.2206C>T: p.(R736X) in French Canadians from Quebec.\n\n    MYO15A has been ranked as the third to the fourth most common cause of severe-to-profound ARNSHI, worldwide. The global frequency of HI-associated MYO15A variants was calculated at 6.2% by Farjami et al. underscoring the importance of this gene in the development of HI. The frequency observed in Ghana is higher than what was previously reported for some African countries such as Nigeria (2.0%), South Africa (2.0%), Tunisia (2.3%), and Morocco (3.0%) using a custom capture panel (MiamiOtoGenes) and WES. On the other hand, one study of 61 Egyptian families reported a frequency of 15.3%. Recent WES data from a Cameroonian study identified variants in MYO15A in 22.2% of hearing-impaired cases of putative genetic origin; with three variants identified in multiplex families and one variant detected in a simplex family. These data suggest that MYO15A may be the most common gene underlying HI in Cameroon. A review on MYO15A has shown that the majority of studies reported novel variants, which is consistent with our study. To the best of our knowledge, we identified four novel MYO15A variants [c.4778A>G:p.(E1593G), c.6551G>C:p.(C2184S), c.9947A>G:p.(Q3316R), and c.6518C>T:p.(S2173F)]. The large number of exons in MYO15A coupled with the fact that more than 2000 missense variants have been identified in this gene, although not all involved in HI, makes routine screening of MYO15A variants in patients difficult.\n\n    An important novelty of this study is the identification of seven new HI candidate genes, six of which are associated with NSHI, and the AD variant, PAX8: c. 968C>G: p.(P323R), found in a family with Waardenburg syndrome. The involvement of these candidate genes in HI is also supported by clinical and segregation analyses (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Interestingly, variants in two of the candidate genes were also observed in unrelated HI patients from Ghana (i.e., DNAH11, MYO19). In the latest genome-wide association data browser from the FinnGen research project (Release 5; 218,792 individuals; https://r5.finngen.fi/), which aims to study genetic variation associations with various traits in the isolated population of Finland, we found variants in or near these seven novel candidate genes that are possibly associated to HI as well (+/- 100 kb). This includes variants in or near CCDC141 (rs144697379; p = 2.6 x 10-5; intronic); DNAH11 (rs2965393; p = 4.5 x 10-4; intronic); PAX8 (rs115708270; p = 3.6 x 10-4; upstream); and SOX9 (rs16977126; p = 5.7 x 10-5; downstream) for sensorineural HI, and in MYO19 (rs143245472; p = 6.6 x 10-6; upstream); INPP4B [rs184880581; p = 2.6 x 10-5; intronic) and POTEI (rs1337496945; p = 5.6 x 10-4; downstream) for sudden idiopathic HI. Although these results support our findings that these genes are involved in HI, without access to the data it is impossible to correct for multiple testing which may render the finding insignificant. Moreover, unlike congenital HI described in Ghanaian patients, most of these participants are adults suggesting these genes could be also associated with late-onset HI.\n\n    For six candidate genes, publicly available RNA sequence and microarray data sets were used for in silico investigation of gene expression in the developing and adult mouse inner ear (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 8-13, Ccdc141, Dnah11, Inpp4b, Myo19, Pax8, and Sox9) and also for protein modeling studies (Fig. 5).\n\n    Paired box gene 8, PAX8 (OMIM:167415), is located on chromosome 2q14.1 and encodes a transcription factor. Cloning and expression experiments have shown that PAX8 is mainly expressed in the thyroid gland and can cause hypothyroidism. In addition, in Pax8 mutant mice, major abnormalities of the outer and middle ear structures were found and an overall delay in the maturation of the auditory system of Pax8 knockout mice compared to the WT mice.\n\n    Previous studies have shown that SOX9 is part of a family of transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of inner ear development. In mice, Sox9 is required for invagination of the otic placode and the loss of Sox9 severely compromises expansion, differentiation, and remodeling of the otic fibrocyte compartment. Sox9-depletion also results in major defects in the development of vestibular structures, semi-circular canals, and utricle in Xenopus and in failure of otic placode invagination in the mouse. In humans, previous molecular studies showed that hair cell differentiation in humans was consistently present from 12 weeks, coinciding with downregulation of SOX9. Heterozygous variants in SOX9 cause campomelic dysplasia (OMIM: 114290) that can include HI as one of its clinical expressions. However, campomelic dysplasia is often lethal in the first year of age, due to respiratory insufficiency related to small chest size life and tracheobronchial hypoplasia. Moreover, the Ghanaian family with monoallelic variant in SOX9 only presented with HI and there was no evidence of shortness and bowing of long tubular bones, or sex reversal. Nevertheless, a careful follow-up with an evaluation of evolving discrete phenotypes of campomelic dysplasia could be considered in this family.\n\n    There is a relatively large number of HI genes that encode myosin superfamily members (MYO3A, MYO6, MYO7A, MYO15A, MYH14, and MYH9); therefore, it might not be surprising that MYO19 is a HI gene. Human myosin 19 functions as an actin-based motor for mitochondrial movement in vertebrate cells and promotes their localization to stress-induced filopodia. In mice, Myo19 is a high-duty ratio molecular motor moving to the plus-end of the actin filament.\n\n    A previous study in mice has indicated that Ccdc141 is required for radial migration and myosin II-mediated centrosome positioning during neuronal development. Loss-of-function analysis in primitive neural stem cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrated that Ccdc141 plays an important function in the regulation of early neural commitment. Ccdc141 mouse mutants have normal ABR thresholds, but there are other possible explanations for this, such as incomplete knockout of gene function. Ccdc141-deficient mice exhibited impaired recognition memory and spatial reference memory. In human, biallelic variants in CCDC141 was associated with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (a rare disorder characterized by an absent or ectopic posterior pituitary, interrupted pituitary stalk, and anterior pituitary hypoplasia); and in normonosmic or anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to neuronal migration disorders the results in a defect in the development of the GnRH and the olfactory system.\n\n    Dynein heavy chain 11 (DNAH11), an essential component of ciliary structure and function and left-right asymmetry in mice. Biallelic variants in the DNAH11 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia in multiple populations, and in heterotaxy syndrome, and laterality defect. The present study adds NSHI to the spectrum of pathologies associated with variants in DNAH11, likely due to the alteration of primary cilia in hearing function found in numerous ciliopathies.\n\n    INPP4B overexpression is associated with human achalasia, which is a rare motility disorder characterized by myenteric neuron and interstitial cells of Cajal abnormalities. Depleting INPP4B by in utero electroporation in mice suppressed medially directed callosal axon formation and significantly attenuated the formation of pyramidal neurons and axon polarization in cortical neurons during cortical development. However, the mechanisms of INPP4B dysregulation in hearing function will require further investigation.\n\n    In the future, it is desirable to perform in vitro functional analysis, particularly for the 17 missense and the one splice variants found in the novel candidate genes (Table 3), and if possible, to develop and investigate animal models when applicable, to complement the data provided in this study: families' variants segregations (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7), in silico analysis (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 4), and gene expressions profiles in the inner ear (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 8-16). It is also worthwhile to refine the phenotyping for the existing mutant hearing-impaired mice, i.e., Pax8, Sox9, and Ccdc141, with regard to the new clinical evidence described in this study that strongly supports their relevance to the genetics of human hearing.\n\n    In addition to the seven new candidate genes identified, a phenotypic expansion was seen for MARVELD2, and a family was found with a different inheritance model of DSPP. A high proportion of HI-associated variants that were not previously described was seen as well. Other strengths of this study are the number and the size of families and the ability to recruit a substantial portion of the family members. Exome sequence data generated for multiple family members facilitated segregation analysis and variant identification. There was no significant difference in the size of the solved versus unsolved families. The data set contributes to refining HI gene curation since most of the identified variants have not previously been associated with HI. The data will also contribute to available exomes from African populations, facilitate future exploration of pathogenic variants in actionable genes and refine their relevance and importance in African populations.\n\n    Using WES, this study of families from Ghana obtained a high-solve rate of genetic causes among GJB2-negative families segregating HI. WES should be considered for routine investigations in clinical settings. Six new genes were associated with NSHI: INPP4B, CCDC141, MYO19, DNAH11, SOX9, and POTEI; and one new gene, PAX8, was associated with Waardenburg syndrome. The study reveals and emphasizes the high level of allelic heterogeneity for HI genes. Most identified variants, 48/60 (80.0), had not previously been reported to be associated with HI, and to the best of our knowledge, 12 (20%) of the variants are also novel. Most of the GJB2-negative families that had variants in a known HI gene (29/48) had a unique variant segregating with HI, suggesting that future clinical diagnostic approaches should use next-generation sequencing, and ideally clinical WES for GJB2-negative families. This study will contribute to the global knowledge on the genetics of HI in understudied African populations and has provided the opportunity for novel HI genes discovery.",

        "Title": "    The effects of dietary Bacillus subtilis supplementation, as an alternative to antibiotics, on growth performance, intestinal immunity, and epithelial barrier integrity in broiler chickens infected with Eimeria maxima",
        "Abstract": "    The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary Bacillus subtilis supplementation on growth performance, jejunal lesion scores, oocyst shedding, and cytokine and tight junction protein expression in broiler chickens infected with Eimeria maxima. A total of 196 male day-old Ross 708 broilers were given a nonexperimental diet until 14 D of age. Then, all chickens were randomly assigned to one of seven dietary treatments: 2 basal diets (CON and NC); CON + virginiamycin (AB1); CON + bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD; AB2); CON + B. subtilis 1781 (PB1); CON + B. subtilis 747 (PB2); or CON + B. subtilis 1781 + 747 (PB3). At day 21, all chickens except those in the CON group were orally inoculated with E. maxima oocysts. At 7 D after E. maxima infection, the body weight gains of chickens fed PB2 and PB3 increased (P = 0.032) as much as those in chickens fed AB2. The body weight gain and feed efficiency of chickens fed PB2 were significantly increased (P < 0.001), and PB2 chickens showed (P = 0.005) the lowest lesion scores after E. maxima infection. Chickens fed PB2 showed (P < 0.05) lower mRNA expression of IL-1beta in infected chicken groups. Chickens in the AB1, AB2, PB1, PB2, and PB3 groups showed (P < 0.05) greater mRNA expression of junctional adhesion molecule 2 in jejunal tissue, whereas occludin expression increased (P < 0.05) in the jejunal tissue of chickens fed AB2 or PB2. Dietary B. subtilis supplementation significantly improved the growth performance of young chickens to a level comparable with that induced by virginiamycin or BMD without E. maxima infection. After infection with E. maxima, dietary virginiamycin and BMD significantly enhanced the epithelial barrier integrity, and the dietary B. subtilis 747 showed significantly enhanced growth performance, intestinal immunity, and epithelial barrier integrity. Together our results indicated that certain strains of B. subtilis provide beneficial effects on the growth of young broiler chickens and have the potential to replace antibiotic growth promoters.",
        "Introduction": "    The United Nations estimates that there will be more than 9 billion people on the planet by the year 2050; thus, the world population will be 32% higher than that in 2006. In addition, the meat consumption per person per year is predicted to increase by 26% in the same period and will primarily comprise chicken consumption. Because of increasing concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, growing consumer preference for antibiotic-free meat products will influence future directions in poultry and livestock production. As of 2017, about 40% of boiler feed in the U.S. was already antibiotic free under \"No Antibiotics Ever\" programs.\n\n    Consumer awareness of antimicrobial resistance and food safety and increasing understanding of the interaction of nutrients, intestinal microbiota, and the immune system in maintaining good gut health have resulted in the limited use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) and anticoccidials in animal agriculture and in a paradigm shift in the use of feed additives by commercial companies. Therefore, there will be an increasing need to understand how intestinal microbiota and the immune system can be modulated by dietary nutraceuticals and natural feed additives as alternatives to antibiotics in controlling enteric diseases. Notably, Eimeria spp. are the etiologic agents of avian coccidiosis, an intestinal disease responsible for an estimated annual economic loss of more than $3 billion worldwide. Increasing implementation of antibiotic-free poultry production system in the U.S. is making the control of some enteric pathogens such as coccidiosis-causing Eimeria species and NE-inducing Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) strains challenging. Because coccidiosis is a primary risk factor for NE, it will be more desirable if alternatives to antibiotics can reduce Eimeria as well as C. perfringens.. There is currently a wide range of feed additives available through the feed industry, including acidifiers, prebiotics, probiotics, phytochemicals, enzymes, osmoregulators, nucleotides, and zinc oxide.\n\n    Many strains of Bacillus subtilis have been selected as probiotics on the basis of their in vitro inhibitory effects on chicken pathogenic bacteria. Dietary supplementation with B. subtilis has been shown not only to improve growth performance and to beneficially alter the gastrointestinal microflora to decrease colonization by chicken pathogenic E. coli and C. perfringens but also to have a protective role against chicken coccidiosis. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary B. subtilis supplementation on posthatch growth, intestinal immunity, and epithelial barrier integrity in broiler chickens infected with Eimeria maxima during their early growth phase. To evaluate host immune function during coccidiosis, we also investigated growth performance, lesion scores, oocyst shedding, jejunal cytokines, and tight junction (TJ) proteins in broiler chickens infected with E. maxima.",
        "Methods": "    All experiments were approved by the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n    A total of 196 male day-old Ross 708 broilers were obtained from a local hatchery (Longenecker's Hatchery, Elizabethtown, PA) and were randomly housed in Petersime starter brooder cage units (Zulte, Belgium) and provided with normal feed (not the experimental diet) until they were 14 D old. All chickens were weighed and allocated to 7 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design at 14 D of age. The dietary treatments included a basal diet based on corn and soybean meal (CON), a second basal diet similar to CON (NC), CON + virginiamycin (Phibro Animal Health, Teaneck, NJ) at 20 g/ton (22 ppm) (AB1), CON + bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD; Zoetis, Durham, NC) at 50 g/ton (55 ppm) (AB2), CON + B. subtilis 1781 (PB1), CON + B. subtilis 747 (PB2), and CON + B. subtilis 1781 + 747 (PB3). B. subtilis strains were obtained from Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (Waukesha, WI). The dose of B. subtilis in the treatment was a total of 1.5 x 105 CFU/g feed. For PB3 (2-strain combination), each strain composed 50% of the total CFU count (each strain at 7.5 x 104 CFU/g feed). At the beginning of the study, each treatment contained 4 cages with 7 chickens (Figure 1). Each cage was 0.65 m in width and 0.75 m in length (14 chickens/m2). All cages were kept in the same room. Each cage was considered an experimental unit. The chickens were given ad libitum access to water and feed throughout the study. Figure 1 shows the experimental schedules.\n\n    Feed additions were weighed and recorded. The feeders were shaken once per day. The chickens and feed were weighed at 21 and 28 D of age for computation of growth performance. Dead chickens were removed and weighed daily to calculate mortality and adjust the growth performance data.\n\n    All chickens except those in the CON group were infected by oral gavage at 21 D of age with 1.0 x 104 oocysts of E. maxima Beltsville strain 41 A/chicken, as previously described.\n\n    Six chickens were randomly selected from each treatment and used for collection of intestinal samples at day 28. The chickens were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the intestines were removed immediately. From each chicken, a small section of the jejunum without contents was collected aseptically and stored in RNAlater (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at -20 C for further use.\n\n    Lesion scores from the jejunum in chickens euthanized for sample collection at day 28 were determined on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (high) by 4 independent observers in a blinded fashion, as previously described.\n\n    Fecal oocysts were collected daily between days 25 and 28 (4 and 7 D postinfection [dpi]). Oocyst numbers were determined as previously described, using a McMaster chamber as per the formula: total oocysts/chicken = [oocyst count x dilution factor x (fecal sample volume/counting chamber volume)]/number of chickens per cage.\n\n    Total RNA was isolated from the jejunum samples stored in RNAlater by using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Approximately 50 mg of jejunal tissue was homogenized in 1 mL of TRIzol using a handheld homogenizer (TissueRuptor; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Chloroform was added to the homogenized sample. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 C to allow phase separation. RNA present in the colorless upper aqueous phase was then precipitated with 100% isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO). The RNA pellet was then washed with 75% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.), air-dried, and resuspended in RNase-free water. The quantity of RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop (ND-1000) spectrophotometer (NanoDrop products, Wilmington, DE) according to the absorbance at 260 nm. RNA purity was evaluated as per the OD260/OD280 ratio. The eluted RNA was stored at -80 C until further use. Total RNA (1 mug) was then reverse transcribed to cDNA using a QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Briefly, the RNA sample was incubated with genomic DNA wipeout buffer at 42 C for 2 min to remove any genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription (RT) of the genomic DNA-depleted sample was then carried out by the addition of Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase, Quantiscript RT buffer, and RT primer mix (Qiagen Inc.). The reaction was carried out in a thermal cycler (Mastercycler EP Gradient S; Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY); the cycling conditions were 42 C for 30 min, followed by inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 95 C for 3 min. The cDNA samples were divided into aliquots and stored at -20 C.\n\n    The oligonucleotide primer sequences used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) are listed in Table 1. The various cytokines and intestinal TJ proteins whose differential expression was evaluated in the jejunum included IL-1beta, IL-2, and IL-6; interferon (IFN)-gamma; junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) 2; and occludin. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the reference gene. Amplification and detection were carried out using a Stratagene M x 3000P qPCR system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and RT2 SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Qiagen). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and nonspecific primer amplification was assessed through the inclusion of no-template controls. Standard curves were generated with log10 diluted RNA, and the levels of individual transcripts were normalized to those of GAPDH in the Q-gene program.\n\n    Data for each response were analyzed using Mixed Model (PROC MIXED) in SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary NC). The design was a randomized complete block design. Each cage was considered an experimental unit. Each cage unit was the block factor. The results are given as least squares means and pooled SEM. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered significantly different. In cases in which the overall effect was significant in growth performance, means were compared in a pairwise manner (PDIFF option). For other results, the PDIFF option was used to compare significance between groups.",
        "Results": "    The initial body weight of chickens measured before treatment did not show significant differences (P = 0.247) among the treatment groups (Table 2). At day 21, the body weights of chickens on dietary AB1 (875 g), AB2 (888 g), PB2 (873 g), and PB3 (885 g) (P = 0.063) tended to be higher than those of chickens (827 g) fed the basal diet. As expected, infection with E. maxima decreased (P = 0.038) the body weights of chickens (average 1,050 g) at day 28 (7 dpi) regardless of dietary treatment, relative to the weights of uninfected chickens (1,175 g). From day 15 to 21 (before infection), the body weight gains in chickens fed diets supplemented with AB1 (402 g), AB2 (395 g), or PB2 (391 g) increased (P = 0.032) beyond that of CON-fed chickens (345 g) (Table 2). After infection, from day 22 to 28, chickens infected with E. maxima showed (P < 0.001) lower body weight gains (average 187 g) than uninfected chickens (346 g). However, chickens fed PB2 showed (P < 0.05) greater body weight gains (205 g) than infected chickens (169 g) fed NC (Table 2). Overall, E. maxima infection decreased (P < 0.05) the body weight gains of chickens (average 546 g) regardless of dietary treatment, as compared with those (692 g) in uninfected chickens fed CON. Chickens fed AB2 (587 g) and PB2 (580 g) showed (P < 0.05) greater body weight gain than infected chickens (493 g) fed NC (Table 2). The feed intake during the experimental period did not differ among different treatments (Table 2). Before infection, from day 14 to 21, the feed efficiency of broiler chickens was not affected (P > 0.05) by the treatments. From day 22 to 28 (after infection), the feed efficiency of infected chickens (average 0.255), regardless of dietary supplements, decreased below that of uninfected chickens (0.494) fed CON (Table 2). However, among infected chickens, chickens fed PB2 had (P < 0.05) greater feed efficiency (0.318) than infected chickens (0.267) fed NC. Over the experimental period, the feed efficiency did not differ among treatments.\n\n    The E. maxima infection increased (P = 0.005) the lesion score in the jejunum of chickens at 7 dpi (Figure 2A). Among infected chickens, those fed PB2 had (P < 0.05) lower lesion scores (1.4) than chickens (average 2.2) fed other diets. The mean fecal oocyst shedding number per chicken is presented in Figure 2B. Chickens in the uninfected group (CON) excreted no fecal oocysts, but infection with E. maxima increased (P < 0.05) fecal oocyst shedding regardless of treatment group at 7 dpi. AB1 and AB2 did not decrease fecal oocyst appearance, whereas the fecal oocyst shedding in chickens fed a diet supplemented with PB1 (3,152,645 oocyst/chicken), PB2 (2,870,218 oocyst/chicken), and PB3 (4,236,793 oocyst/chicken) decreased (P < 0.05) below that of chickens (6,037,032 oocyst/chicken) fed NC.\n\n    In jejunal tissue, infection with E. maxima increased (P < 0.05) the transcript levels of IL-1beta (average 3.54 x 10-4; Figure 3A) and IL-6 (average 9.41 x 10-4; Figure 3B) regardless of dietary supplementation. Among treatment groups, chickens (2.06 x 10-4) fed PB2 showed lower (P < 0.05) transcript levels of IL-1beta than chickens (4.38 x 10-4) fed NC.\n\n    In jejunal tissue, infection with E. maxima increased (P < 0.05) the levels of IL-2 (average 1.02 x 10-4; Figure 4A) and INF-gamma (average 3.8 x 10-4; Figure 4B) regardless of dietary supplementation. Among the treatment groups, chickens fed PB2 had lower transcript levels of IL-2 and INF-gamma than chickens fed NC.\n\n    In jejunal tissue, infection with E. maxima did not affect transcript levels of JAM2 (Figure 5A) and occludin (Figure 5B). Chickens fed a diet supplemented with antibiotics (AB1: 8.19 x 10-2, and AB2: 1.09 x 10-1) and probiotics (PB1: 9.37 x 10-2, PB2: 8.60 x 10-2, and PB3: 1.08 x 10-1) had greater (P < 0.05) transcript levels of JAM2 than did chickens fed both basal diets (CON: 4.40 x 10-2 and NC: 3.94 x 10-2). The transcript levels of occludin in the jejunum in chickens fed AB2 (7.65 x 10-2) and PB2 (7.41 x 10-2) were higher (P < 0.05) than those in chickens fed other diets.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study was conducted to investigate the effects of B. subtilis 1781 and 747 on growth performance, intestinal immunity, and epithelial barrier integrity in broiler chickens infected with E. maxima compared with antibiotics. The doses of B. subtilis 1781 and 747 used in this study were based on the recommended level of Bacillus-based probiotics for the poultry industry and would cost approximately $2 per ton of feed for use under commercial conditions. This study included virginiamycin and BMD, 2 well-established AGP widely used in the poultry industry. The growth-promoting effects of these 2 antibiotics as AGP have already been demonstrated in numerous studies. In the present study, the effects of AGP was validated, and AGP improved body weight gain in chickens fed a diet supplemented with virginiamycin and BMD for 14 to 21 D during the noninfection period. Chickens fed a diet supplemented with B. subtilis 1781, 747, or a combination of 1781 and 747 also showed greater body weight gain than did chickens fed a basal diet. Notably, the degree of improvement in body weight gain in chickens fed a diet supplemented with these B. subtilis strains was not different from that of chickens fed a diet supplemented with virginiamycin or BMD. This finding is largely consistent with those of, who have reported that chickens fed a diet supplemented with B. subtilis 1781 grow better than chickens fed a basal diet. In addition, the beneficial growth performance of noninfected chickens fed a diet supplemented with B. subtilis has already been documented.\n\n    Eimeria spp. contributes to an estimated $3 billion annual loss worldwide, and 7 distinct species infect avian intestinal mucosa. In the present study, infection with E. maxima significantly decreased the body weight gain of chickens below that of noninfected chickens. Virginiamycin and BMD supplementation was not efficacious against coccidiosis because they are not anticoccidial medications. The results of this work thus showed beneficial effects of dietary B. subtilis supplementation to young chickens infected with E. maxima through its action on innate immunity by decreasing proinflammatory response and enhancing gut integrity by reducing intestinal damages caused by coccidiosis. In chickens that were fed B. subtilis-supplemented diet, the body weight gains of infected chickens fed B. subtilis 747 improved beyond that of infected chickens on a basal diet, whereas B. subtilis 1781 or a combination of 1781 + 747 did not affect body weight gain in infected chickens. have also demonstrated that only two of nine tested B. subtilis strains improved body weight gain in chickens infected with E. maxima. The beneficial effect on body weight gain was effective in improving feed efficiency in infected chickens fed a diet supplemented with B. subtilis 747. The reasons why certain strains of B. subtilis show beneficial effects on coccidiosis-infected chickens need further studies.\n\n    The body weight gain and lesion score are commonly used as clinical measurements for evaluating the severity of coccidiosis. In the present study, chickens infected with E. maxima exhibited high lesion scores, thus indicating severe extensive destruction of the gut epithelium in the area of Meckel's diverticulum, whereas infected chickens fed a diet supplemented with B. subtilis 747 showed lower lesion scores at 7 dpi. Infection with E. maxima increased the fecal oocyst output of chickens; however, B. subtilis 747 supplementation markedly decreased the fecal oocyst output. Therefore, in infected chickens, the growth-promoting effect of B. subtilis 747 supplementation was supported by the results of the lesion score and oocyst shedding.\n\n    Eimeria infection activates chickens' innate and acquired immune response, which involves the secretion of various chemokines and cytokines. Cytokines, small immune-regulatory peptides aid in cell-to-cell communication during immune responses. IL-1beta is an important proinflammatory cytokine that is produced mainly by activated macrophages and plays an important role in the innate immune responses through recruitment of inflammatory cells. IL-6, produced by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages, functions as both a proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine, and also promotes Th17-cell differentiation. Increased IL-6 expression has also been proposed to aid in defining populations of heterophils that are more capable of responding to and eliminating pathogens. In the present study, chickens infected with E. maxima showed increased expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 at 7 dpi, regardless of antibiotic or probiotic supplementation. Among the infected chickens, B. subtilis 747 decreased the expression of IL-1beta and IL-6. In addition to the changes in expression of various proinflammatory cytokines, this study also investigated the alterations in IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels. Chickens infected with E. maxima showed increased expression of IL-2 and INF-gamma, regardless of antibiotic or probiotic supplementation. Among the infected chickens, IL-2 and INF-gamma expressions were downregulated in chickens fed diets supplemented with B. subtilis 747. If an immune response occurs, cytokines or chemokines are released in sufficient amounts to suppress the immune responses. has reported that a cytokine storm induces metabolic changes, including increased protein degradation in skeletal muscle, thereby diverting nutrients from the muscle and other tissues, so that they are made available for the increased demands of leukocytes and the production of protective proteins. Ultimately, these responses decrease growth performance and directly influence the success of poultry production. In practice, under equalized feed intake, a vigorous acute-phase immune response in chickens has been estimated to account for approximately 10% of nutrient use. have reported that lipopolysaccharide-challenged chickens (1 mg lipopolysaccharide per kg of body weight at 14, 16, 18, and 20 D of age) show a 22% decrease in body weight gain during challenge; 59% of the loss is accounted for by decreased feed intake, and the remaining 41% is attributed to immune response-related factors.\n\n    Many factors related to disease and stress can damage intestinal epithelial integrity, thus decreasing nutrient absorption, increasing pathogenic invasion and inflammatory disease, and consequently decreasing growth performance. Therefore, the intestinal epithelium serves as a physical barrier against invading pathogens and intraluminal toxins. It is composed of a single layer of columnar epithelial cells that are tightly bound by intercellular junctional complexes. These junctional complexes maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier by regulating paracellular permeability and are composed of TJs, gap junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes. Tight junctions include 4 integral transmembrane proteins (occludin, claudin, JAM, and tricellulin) that interact with cytosolic scaffold proteins, which in turn bind the actin cytoskeleton. Junctional adhesion molecule-2 and occludin play important roles in the assembly and maintenance of TJs and the regulation of intestinal permeability, as evidenced by increased paracellular permeability to macromolecules in knockout mice. In the present study, the expression of JAM2 was elevated in all the supplemented groups regardless of infection with E. maxima, and occludin was elevated in the chickens fed a diet supplemented with BMD and B. subtilis 747. have suggested that increased TJ protein expression in chickens fed a diet supplemented with probiotics improves intestinal barrier function and provides optimal gut health.\n\n    Overall, dietary B. subtilis supplementation significantly improved the growth performance of noninfected chickens during the posthatch growth period similar to AGP supplementation. After infection with E. maxima, dietary virginiamycin and BMD supplementation enhanced epithelial barrier integrity, whereas B. subtilis 747 improved the growth performance, intestinal immunity, and epithelial barrier integrity of chickens in this study. Together, our results indicated that dietary B. subtilis supplementation has the potential to replace antibiotics fed to broiler chickens.",

        "Title": "    Added Value of Reanalysis of Whole Exome- and Whole Genome Sequencing Data From Patients Suspected of Primary Immune Deficiency Using an Extended Gene Panel and Structural Variation Calling",
        "Abstract": "    Knowledge of the genetic variation underlying Primary Immune Deficiency (PID) is increasing. Reanalysis of genome-wide sequencing data from undiagnosed patients with suspected PID may improve the diagnostic rate.\n\n    We included patients monitored at the Department of Infectious Diseases or the Child and Adolescent Department, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, for a suspected PID, who had been analysed previously using a targeted PID gene panel (457 PID-related genes) on whole exome- (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. A literature review was performed to extend the PID gene panel used for reanalysis of single nucleotide variation (SNV) and small indels. Structural variant (SV) calling was added on WGS data.\n\n    Genetic data from 94 patients (86 adults) including 36 WES and 58 WGS was reanalysed a median of 23 months after the initial analysis. The extended gene panel included 208 additional PID-related genes. Genetic reanalysis led to a small increase in the proportion of patients with new suspicious PID related variants of uncertain significance (VUS). The proportion of patients with a causal genetic diagnosis was constant. In total, five patients (5%, including three WES and two WGS) had a new suspicious PID VUS identified due to reanalysis. Among these, two patients had a variant added due to the expansion of the PID gene panel, and three patients had a variant reclassified to a VUS in a gene included in the initial PID gene panel. The total proportion of patients with PID related VUS, likely pathogenic, and pathogenic variants increased from 43 (46%) to 47 (50%), as one patient had a VUS detected in both initial- and reanalysis. In addition, we detected new suspicious SNVs and SVs of uncertain significance in PID candidate genes with unknown inheritance and/or as heterozygous variants in genes with autosomal recessive inheritance in 8 patients.\n\n    These data indicate a possible diagnostic gain of reassessing WES/WGS data from patients with suspected PID. Reasons for the possible gain included improved knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlation, expanding the gene panel, and adding SV analyses. Future studies of genotype-phenotype correlations may provide additional knowledge on the impact of the new suspicious VUSs.",
        "Introduction": "    Primary immune deficiency (PID) is defined as immune dysfunction due to a genetic cause, which causes either inhibition and/or gain of function of components within the innate and/or adaptive immune system. The prevalence of patients with PID is estimated to be as high as one out of every thousand individuals. Patients with PID have impacted quality of life and increased mortality primarily due to infectious complications. Currently the total number of different monogenetic PID disorders extends to over 400 and is continuously increasing. Nevertheless, targeted analysis of PID genes on whole exome- or whole genome sequencing (WES/WGS) data detects monogenetic pathogenic variants in less than 50% of patients suspected of PID. Due to the continuously increasing knowledge of genes and variants related to PID, a reanalysis of prior WES/WGS data with an extended PID gene panel in undiagnosed patients may improve the diagnostic performance. The potential benefit of performing reanalysis needs to be established, so that institutes can properly weigh up cost benefit.\n\n    There are wide ranging benefits of providing a genetic diagnosis for the individual patients. The confirmation or re-classification of a clinical diagnosis may provide the potential for treatment adjustments. In addition, a clarification of the inheritance pattern is important to provide genetic counselling for relatives at risk, as well as the opportunity for prenatal or preimplantation genetic tests in relevant cases. Furthermore, the gain in knowledge of the underlying causes of PID diseases can pave the way for the development of novel biomarkers in risk stratification and treatments. Therefore, reanalysis of WES/WGS data is important to consider in previously undiagnosed cases. In other disease groups, conducting a semiautomated reanalysis of WES/WGS data have been shown to increase the rate of genetic diagnoses, primarily due to the analysis of newly added genes.\n\n    In this study, we aimed to assess the increase in the diagnostic rate after reanalysis using an extended gene panel on WES/WGS data in a cohort consisting of patients over 16 years of age and suspected of PID. The reanalyses included a repeated analysis for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels in 94 patients and adding analysis for structural variants (SVs) in 56 patients analysed with WGS. We investigate the proportion of new genetic variants identified after the reanalysis due to either 1) improved knowledge of phenotype-genotype correlation leading to a variant re-classification 2) expansion of the PID gene panel or 3) addition of SV analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study conducting a WES/WGS data reanalysis in a PID population.",
        "Methods": "    Patients monitored at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, for a suspected PID between January 2016 and September 2020 were offered WES/WGS analysed with a targeted PID gene panel (PID-1), after clinical evaluation and most often also following immunological analyses. Patients who accepted the offer and gave informed consent were included in the study ( Figure 1 ). The study was approved by the national ethics committee. Patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) were subsequently excluded from this analysis, as a separate prospective study focused on CVID is ongoing. However, one child, who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CVID, was included as the child was part of a family including a parent and sibling with antibody deficiency. The excluded patients with CVID constituted approximately half of the patients suspected of PID and referred for genetic analysis at our institute.\n\n    Phenotype data were collected from patients records and assigned the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Patients enrolled between January 2016 and January 2018 were analysed with WES (n=37) and patients enrolled between January 2018 and September 2020 were analysed with WGS (n=58). One of the patients analysed with WES, who had a causal pathogenic variant and had died, was excluded from reanalysis. In total 94 patients had WES/WGS data reanalysed for SNVs and small indels. Two of the patients with WGS data were excluded from SV analysis, one of these had poor quality control of WGS data and one had a causal pathogenic SV reported in the initial analysis. In total, WGS data from 56 patients were analysed for SVs. The genetic analysis consisted of three different types of entities: 1) 18 Trio analysis (the analysis of a patient and the patient's parents), 2) 60 Singletons (one patient analysis) and 3) Seven Families (one patient and one or more relatives also presenting symptoms compatible with a PID).\n\n    The initial gene panel, PID-1, was developed in 2015 and contained 457 genes. PID-1 genes were primarily from the 2016 European Society for Immunodeficiencies online registry of diseases genes and Practice parameter for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiency. References included in the development of PID-1 are listed in  Supplementary . Based on a literature search in October 2020, 208 genes were added resulting in a total of 665 genes in PID-2. The majority of genes were added from Genomics England Panel App ( Supplementary ). PID-1 and PID-2 included both known disease-associated PID genes and candidate genes for which the association with PID needs further study. PID-2 was implemented for clinical use in our laboratory after 1 November 2020 ( Supplementary Table 1 ).\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood. 500 ng of DNA was fragmented to an average size of 300 base pairs using Covaris S2 (Woburn, MA, USA). Adaptor ligation was performed using the KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) on a Sciclone G3 robot (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Sequence capture targeting the exome was done with the SureSelectXT Clinical Research Exome kit (Agilent) and followed sequencing on HiSeq2500 or NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). For WES the sequencing protocol aimed to achieve at least 95% of positions within the capture covered by minimum 10x and average coverage of 50x.\n\n    Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples using the liquid handling automated station (Tecan Freedom EVO HSM 2.0 Workstation) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation, USA, ReliaPrep Large Volume HT gDNA Isolation System). Genomic DNA was subjected to WGS using Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit and sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). For WGS the aim was for at least 98% of mappable positions to be covered by minimum 10x and average coverage of 30x, which was achieved for nearly all samples. Four samples were borderline with a sequence coverage range of 95- 97% (28S, 36S, 57S, 83T). One patient (15FC1) was excluded from SV analysis due to low coverage.\n\n    Single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions were called with GATK Haplotype Caller version 4.1.3.0 in accordance with the GATK best practice guidelines developed by the Broad Institute. Structural variants were called by Manta version 1.5.0, Lumpy version 0.3.0, and CNVnator version 0.3.3. Thereafter, sequences called with at least two of three tools were manually inspected.\n\n    For both WES and WGS datasets variant filtering was performed using the Ingenuity Variant Analysis or QCI software (Qiagen Bioinformatics, Redwood City, CA). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) Genome Browser was used to manually verify findings in the aligned raw sequencing data. The variant calling was genotype driven as the PID gene panels were used for all patients. In a minor proportion of patients all exome or genome data was analysed, or disease specific search words were applied in Ingenuity. In the trios and families, the information of family members was included in the filtering and interpretation of variants. In SNV and small indels analysis only variants with a minor allele frequency of less than 2% in GnomAD data and variants in coding regions (+/- 20 base pairs) were selected for further analysis unless an established Pathogenic common variant, reported pathogenic in The Human Gene Mutation Database or ClinVar or predicted a splice effect by MaxEntScan. In the analysis of SNVs and small indels we reanalysed WES/WGS data from all patients with PID-2 and used the phenotypic information to evaluate the relevance of variants. For SVs, we used the same +/- 20 bp for intron boundaries and +/- 10 kb for the 1st exon of the genes for promoter/regulatory regions. By WGS-based SV-analysis we could pick up as small as 30bp SVs. SV analysis on WGS data was performed genome wide as an explorative analysis. Only SVs affecting genes included in PID-2 and/or genes related to key phenotypic findings were reported. As a standard laboratory procedure, the variants of interest were not verified by Sanger sequencing unless they did not fulfil the required quality measures (coverage, variant allele frequency etc.). The variants were classified in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines. For each patient, data was analysed and variants were classified by two molecular biologists and/or clinical geneticists.\n\n    The standard immunological analysis included flow cytometry-based leukocyte count and subtyping of maturation- and activation stages, somatic hypermutation (measuring in kappa light chain transcripts), T-lymphocyte proliferation (for patients between the ages of 0 and 10 or for adults suspected of a T-cell defect) and complement activation screen. Further specific immunological analyses were performed based on the patient's clinical presentation and results of the basic immunological analysis after conference with clinical immunologists.",
        "Results": "    In total, 95 individuals suspected of having PID in 85 entities consisting of 18 trios, 60 singletons and 7 families were included in the study. Patients were categorized and sub-grouped according to ESID (2019) clinical criteria based on the presentation at the time of the initial genetic analysis (PID-1). The patients  clinical and immunological phenotypes were assessed again prior to the reanalysis in order to include any additional information obtained between the initial- and reanalysis. Baseline characteristics are presented in  Table 1  and detailed phenotype data is in  Supplementary Table 2 . The major clinical subgroups in our PID cohort were unclassified antibody deficiencies and unclassified autoinflammatory diseases. The median time between the initial- and the reanalysis of WES/WGS data was 23 months (range 1-57 months).\n\n    The results of the initial genetic analyses (PID-1) and reanalyses (PID-2) are presented in  Supplementary Table 3  and  Table 2 , respectively. The number of patients with genetic findings identified before and after reanalysis are summarized in  Table 3  and described further below. In the initial analysis, a causal PID diagnosis was detected in eight patients, including likely pathogenic- (LP) and pathogenic (P) variants ( Supplementary Table 3 ). One of these eight patients was excluded from reanalysis. No new PID diagnoses were detected upon reanalysis. Seven of the patients with a genetic diagnosis had a SNV or small indel (11S, 25S, 44T, 45S, 46S, 48T, 74T) and one patient had a SV (63S). One patient (52S) had a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in NLRP3, which was compatible with the phenotype and segregated in the affected family members. Due to reduced penetrance of the phenotype this variant could not be classified as LP or P. Therefore, this patient was not counted as having a genetic diagnosis. Additionally, in the initial analysis eight patients (5S, 37S, 53S, 54S, 62FP, 62FC, 77S, 81S) had suspicious PID variants detected (LP/P), which were not explanatory for the PID phenotype (including heterozygous variants in PID genes with AR inheritance). Further, 28 patients had suspicious PID VUS(s) detected. In the reanalysis, five (5%) patients had new suspicious PID related VUS(s) identified. Four out of the five patients did not have any variant identified in the initial analysis. Due to the addition of VUSs, the reanalysis increased the total number of patients in the cohort with PID related VUS(s), LP, and P variant(s) from 43 (46%) to 47 (50%).\n\n    When the genetic data was reanalysed, a new suspicious SNV VUS was identified in five patients (5%). The genetic variant details are shown in  Table 2 . We divided the patients into four groups based on the category of the reanalysis responsible for the detection of the new finding, as shown in  Table 3 . Category 1) Three of the patients (19S, 49S, 59S) had a new VUS added due to improved knowledge of phenotype-genotype correlation in a gene also included in PID-1. Category 2) Two patients (29S, 31S) had a VUS added due to the expansion of the PID gene panel. Additionally, one patient had an incidental finding (7S). Of these five patients with new PID related VUS(s), two patients (19S and 59S) had a single VUS in an AR/autosomal dominant (AD) gene: FLG and SERPING1, respectively, and three patients (29S, 31S, 49S) had a single VUS in an AD gene: OAS1, TNFAIP3 and NFKB1, respectively. These five patients' phenotypes were compatible with the AR/AD or AD heritable disorder and functional immunological analysis in addition to genetic analysis of parents was recommended (where possible).\n\n    One patient had a pathogenic SV detected in the initial analysis (63S). Category 3) In the reanalysis we only detected SVs in either PID candidate genes and/or heterozygous in PID genes with autosomal recessive inheritance. These variants were included in Category 4 (below).\n\n    Category 4) We identified eight patients with SNV or SV VUS(s) in PID candidate genes (n=6) and/or heterozygous VUSs in PID genes with AR inheritance (n=2). Of the 56 individuals with WGS data, five patients (9%) had such a SV of uncertain significance identified (10FP, 27S, 32S, 33S, 39FA1). Four patients (9S, 16S, 27S, 75S) had a heterozygous VUS (SNV or SV) in a PID candidate gene. In one of these patients (27S) with Combined Immune Deficiency (CID), we detected a heterozygous, frameshift deletion in LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3), which is involved in T-cell receptor signalling . LAG3 was not included in the PID-2 gene panel. Further, one patient (75S) had a pathogenic incidental finding in addition to the new suspicious VUS in a PID candidate gene. In this patient, we detected a hemizygous pathogenic deletion in EDA, which was causal for the patient s hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia phenotype. EDA is not included in the PID-2 gene panel. The EDA variant was categorized as an incidental finding. Notably, during the initial WGS analysis of this patient, who also presented a phenotype of recurrent infections, genes related to ectodermal dysplasia were included in addition to the PID-1 gene panel. SV analysis was not implemented at the time of the initial analysis. Furthermore, Array CGH had been performed which could not detect the deletion. Two patients (33S, 39FA1) had two VUSs in a PID candidate gene. These patients both had a SV and a SNV of uncertain significance in the same gene and potentially in trans (these SNVs were not included in the results of SNV analysis above). Two patients (10FP, 32S) had a single VUS in an autosomal recessive (AR) gene. These two patients both had a heterozygous tandem duplication in DOCK8. One of the patients presented a phenotype compatible with Hyper IgE syndrome. We added analysis for DOCK8 deep intronic SNVs and small indels in these two cases due to prior reports of intron variants in patients with DOCK8 deficiency. We did not identify LP or P variants in this analysis. Finally, one patient (7S) had an incidental finding (VUS) detected at reanalysis.\n\n    Figure 2  shows the distribution of genetic results in patients across the different ESID (2019) subgroups. In this figure, the results of the initial and reanalysis (PID-1 and PID-2) are combined. Variants were identified in patients within most clinical subgroups.\n\n    All variants identified as part of the initial analysis with PID-1 were re-evaluated. The results of specific immunologic analysis and/or segregation analysis in the patients with variants detected in the initial analysis (PID-1) are presented in  Supplementary Tables 2, 3 , where these analyses had been performed. This led to a re-classification in two patients with Familial Chronic Mucocutanous Candidiasis (CMC), ID 45S and 46S, who both had a VUS in STAT1, which were reclassified to P and LP variants, respectively. These two patients were part of the original 9 patients with a genetic diagnosis causal for the PID phenotype after the initial analysis (PID-1). ID 45S had a heterozygous, gain of function variant (STAT1, c.1204_1205delinsTT, p.Ala402Phe). Subsequent analysis proved the variant to segregate with the phenotype in several family members. Additionally, functional immunological analysis confirmed the effect. Therefore, this variant was reclassified to a P variant. ID 46S had a heterozygous, missense variant (STAT1, c.823C>A, p.Gln275Lys), which was absent from controls. Subsequent analysis of the parents proved the variant to be de novo. Therefore, the variant was reclassified to a LP variant. We did not re-classify any VUSs to benign or likely benign variants.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study was conducted to investigate the value of performing a reanalysis of WES/WGS data in a PID population consisting of patients over 16 years of age, after an inclusion period of approximately 4 1/2 years. The re-analysis (PID-2) was performed a median of 23 months after the initial analysis (PID-1). Upon re-analysis new suspicious PID VUSs were detected in 5% of the patients. Since all new PID related variants (SNVs and SVs) were VUSs, the number of causal genetic PID diagnoses did not increase after the reanalysis. The total rate of patients having PID VUS(s), LP or P variant(s) increased by 4% to a total rate of 50%. Three patients had a VUS identified due to improved knowledge of genotype-phenotype interaction and two patients had a VUS in new PID genes added in PID-2. In addition, we identified five patients with new SVs of uncertain significance and three patients with SNVs of uncertain significance. These eight patients were described separately, as they have VUS(s) in either PID candidate genes or heterozygous in established PID genes with AR inheritance. Reasons for the identification of new variants include the updated tools for calling of SNVs/small indels and SVs as well as improvements of in silico analysis. Our findings indicate a possible diagnostic importance of analysing SVs in an adult PID population. Therefore, we aim to transfer the genetic analysis from WES to WGS to be able to perform SV analysis in selected cases with high suspicion of a PID. Furthermore, in selected cases presenting symptoms beyond a PID phenotype, a re-evaluation of the indication for adding additional gene panels or extending to full exome/genome analysis should be considered. The detection of VUSs in new PID candidate genes together with functional immunological analysis of affected pathway(s) can potentially improve the knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations underlying PIDs.\n\n    When comparing rates of genetic findings between PID cohorts, the selection of patients is crucial. Including patients with more severe phenotypes, patients with symptom onset in childhood and a positive family history will lead to a higher molecular diagnostic rate. Further, a proportion of PIDs with symptom onset in adulthood are suspected to be caused by polygenetic and/or multifactorial inheritance. Additional knowledge of mono- and polygenic variation underlying these PIDs remains to be gained. Methods beyond analysis of single cases and smaller cohorts are needed to detect new genetic variants contributing to PID phenotypes. In one relatively small cohort of six PID patients analysis of WGS data, including copy number variation (deletions and duplications), led to the detection of explanatory variants in all cases analysed.\n\n    Unclassified antibody deficiencies and unclassified autoinflammatory diseases constitute the major clinical subgroups in our PID cohort ( Table 2 ). The proportion of antibody deficiencies corresponds to the proportion in a large study of primarily adult PID patients. Furthermore, the proportion consisting of CIDs was relatively low (7%), whereas the proportion of pathogen specific immunodeficiencies was relatively high (9%). These deviations could be due to a larger proportion of children in the study by Smith et al. However, these subgroups contain small numbers of patients. Notably, in the subgroup of patients, who did not fulfil ESID clinical criteria, a variant was identified in six of the 13 patients, of which one had a homozygous, pathogenic variant in ERAP1 (74T) and five had VUS(s) in PID genes. In addition, three patients had familial chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) due to pathogenic gain of function variants in STAT1.\n\n    Two studies from the UK that investigated a semiautomated reanalysis of WES data in more than 1000 families with developmental delay and more than 2000 consecutive cases of WES, showed increases of molecular diagnostic rates of 13% (27 to 40%) and 11.5% (25 to 36%), respectively. However, different disease groups are clearly not directly comparable. The two studies both included children and the molecular diagnostic rates did not include variants of uncertain significance. In contrast, our findings of new variants in PID genes were solely VUSs. Notably, our cohort primarily investigated adult patients and few children included in families with a suspected PID. As well as developmental delay, PID phenotypes are very heterogenous, especially if milder phenotypes of PID are included. Also, PID patients can present with a symptom onset in adulthood, making it more difficult to determine the impact and pathogenicity of genetic variants, which may be inherited from an apparently unaffected parent. Finally, both PID and developmental delay can potentially arise due to variants with variable expression and/or reduced penetrance.\n\n    Data analyses and variant classifications were performed by six molecular biologists and clinical geneticists during the 5-year study period. To limit the effect of interobserver variability, all interpreters followed the ACMG international guidelines, and all findings were confirmed by two interpreters. However, inevitably there will be interobserver variability of variant interpretation, which can affect the rate of PID related variants identified. Additionally, when rates of genetic variants are compared between PID cohorts, there can be inter-laboratory variability. Further, over time some monogenic PID disorders known to be caused by autosomal recessive inheritance have been proven also to be caused by autosomal dominant inheritance. Therefore, during this study period, the number of heterozygous variants reported has increased. Finally, more patients were included as trio analysis in the beginning of the inclusion period, and more singletons were included towards the end. Trio analysis are often preferable for WES/WGS data interpretation since trio analyses can provide information on potential de novo variants or compound heterozygosity for two variants in the same gene. Therefore, the change to a predominant inclusion of singletons later in the inclusion period may also have led to an increase of heterozygous variants reported, where subsequent analysis of parents is needed to unravel de novo variants or compound heterozygosity for two variants.\n\n    One of the limitations of the study was, that analysis for low level of germline mosaicism (<20% of reads) was not performed, since WGS analysis is not ideal for identifying potential germline mosaicism. Another limitation of our study was in the analysis of genes known to have pseudogenes, e.g. IKBKG, NCF1, C4A, and C4B. For such regions specialized bioinformatics pipelines could be required to accurately call the variants in these genes, which was not applied in our study. This limitation is included as a disclaimer in the clinical reports. The targeted analysis performed in our study could also be considered as a limitation, since additional VUSs in new PID candidate genes may be detected by performing analysis of the entire exome or genome. Another limitation was, that we did not consider the deep intronic variants (located deeper then +/-20bp to the exons). However, as the performance of any kind of functional analysis for potential effect of splice- or other non-coding variants was not within our study scope, we decided to focus our analysis to the +/-20bp exon-flanking regions in order to simplify the clinical interpretation of the variants.\n\n    Performing a reanalysis of broad sequencing data is resource demanding. As such, a potential gain in diagnostic performance after data reanalysis needs to be balanced against the time and cost involved. In contrast to other studies including automated reanalysis, we did not detect new genetic diagnoses upon reanalysis. Yet our results showed that performing the reanalysis may improve genetic results in prior undiagnosed patients. Our findings included both SNVs and SVs in new PID genes (added in PID-2), which shows the importance of regularly extending gene panels for reanalysis in PID. The PID-2 gene panel contains many PID candidate genes (newly described in relation to PID) without prior reports in the literature of variants in patients. Therefore, until the knowledge of gene-disease interaction improves, variants identified in PID candidate genes within PID-2 will primarily be classified as VUSs. Within the Genomics England Panel App approximately half of the genes in the current PID gene panel (Primary immune deficiency Version 2.498) are categorized as red (not enough evidence) or amber (moderate evidence of gene-disease association), where additional evidence is needed to confirm the genotype-phenotype correlation. Thus, additional evidence of pathogenicity for the VUSs identified in our PID cohort may arise from individual, specific functional immunological analysis and segregation analysis.\n\n    Due to the high level of heterogeneity of PIDs, the interpretation of rare variants and planning of functional analysis, particularly of variants in PID candidate genes, can benefit from international collaborations, e.g. GeneMatcher. Due to costs of manual reanalysis an automated reanalysis of VUS and LP variants incorporating genomic, phenotypic, and pedigree data could ideally prioritize the variants in established PID genes for clinicians to review, in line with what has been implemented for other disease groups. Currently, new methods are being developed and implemented to improve automation of genetic reanalysis. In PID populations, where most genetic variants are VUSs, patients could benefit from regular semiautomated reanalysis of WES/WGS data with a reduced demand of time for manual variant interpretation. However, due to the large extent of PID candidate genes, VUSs detected by automated reanalysis methods in these genes will require additional evidence of pathogenicity from segregation studies, functional analysis and/or other reports of cases with similar phenotypes.\n\n    In conclusion, our reanalysis of WES/WGS data did not lead to novel genetic diagnoses causal for PID. We detected new suspicious PID VUS(s) in five (5%) patients suspected of PID. Additionally, eight patients had SNV/SV VUS(s) in PID candidate genes or heterozygous VUS(s) PID genes with AR inheritance. Our data indicate a possible diagnostic value of reassessing WES/WGS data with an extended gene panel and performing analysis of SV in a PID population of primarily adults. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of a WES/WGS data reanalysis and to include structural variation analysis in a PID population. Future improved knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlation in PID candidate genes may provide additional certainty of the effect of the identified VUSs.",

        "Title": "    SEVERITY OF GNAO1-RELATED DISORDER CORRELATES WITH CHANGES IN G-PROTEIN FUNCTION",
        "Abstract": "    GNAO1-related disorders (OMIM #615473 and #617493), caused by variants in the GNAO1 gene, are characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability, hypotonia, movement disorders, and epilepsy. Neither a genotype-phenotype correlation nor a clear severity score have been established for this disorder. The objective of this prospective and retrospective observational study was to develop a severity score for GNAO1-related disorders and to delineate the correlation between the underlying molecular mechanisms and clinical severity.\n\n    Sixteen individuals with GNAO1-related disorders harboring 12 distinct missense variants, including four novel variants (p.K46R, p.T48I, p.R209P, and p.L235P) were examined with repeated clinical assessments, video-EEG monitoring, and brain MRI. The molecular pathology of each variant was delineated using a molecular deconvoluting platform.\n\n    The patients displayed a wide variability in the severity of their symptoms. This heterogeneity was well represented in the GNAO1-related disorders severity score, with a broad range of results. Patients with the same variant had comparable severity scores, indicating that differences in disease profiles are not due to inter-patient variability but rather to unique disease mechanisms. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between clinical severity scores and molecular mechanisms.\n\n    The clinical score proposed here provides further insight into the correlation between pathophysiology and phenotypic severity in GNAO1-related disorders. We found that each variant has a unique profile of clinical phenotypes and pathological molecular mechanisms. These findings will contribute to better understanding GNAO1-related disorders. Additionally, the severity score will facilitate standardization of patients categorization and assessment of response to therapies in development.",
        "Introduction": "    Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a heterogeneous group of rare neurological disorders defined by early-onset refractory epilepsy, specific EEG abnormalities, developmental delay or regression, and intellectual disability. With the advancement of genetic testing, a total of 110 genes associated with DEEs have been identified to date (https://www.omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS308350). In addition to genetic heterogeneity, there is also a great deal of clinical variability. This is not only because the signs and symptoms are caused by a specific genetic variant but also because brain physiology is influenced by chronic seizures and prolonged drug exposure. The accurate and timely identification of the genetic etiology of DEEs has the potential to enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders and promote the development of targeted therapies .\n\n    DEE 17 (OMIM #615473), caused by variants in GNAO1, was initially identified by Nakamura et al. in 2013. Since then, our awareness of the condition has been improved by the extensive description of clinical cases  and a greater understanding of its pathogenesis. This has led to the description of two recognized OMIM phenotypes: 1) Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 17 (OMIM#615473) and 2) Neurodevelopmental disorder with involuntary movements (OMIM#617493). However, growing evidence suggests the severity of the disease lies on a spectrum with intermediate clinical phenotypes.\n\n    While a few studies have examined genotype-phenotype correlation in GNAO1-related disorders , natural history data or severity scores have not been developed, nor have prognostic factors been identified. Defining subgroups of patients with GNAO1-related disorders by severity is a prerequisite for designing more precise natural history studies to identify domains and windows for potential therapeutic interventions and to plan clinical trials.\n\n    The GNAO1 gene encodes the G protein Galphao subunit. Galphao plays an important role in the control of nervous system function. Among many things, it is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and firing of developing neurons, regulation of synaptic function, and neuronal excitability. Mechanistically, Galphao modulates both inhibitory and stimulatory neuromodulatory signaling to cAMP, a major determinant in the pathophysiology of movement disorders . From a molecular perspective, Galphao serves as a transducer of G protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) signals as a part of the heterotrimeric complex with Gbetagamma subunits . Understanding how specific variants affect Galphao ability to transduce GPCR signals will be key to the development of interventional strategies. Recent progress in this area suggests that GNAO1-associated variants perturb Galphao function by different mechanisms, including loss-of-function, dominant-negative, and debatable gain-of-function effects, which ultimately lead to GNAO1-related disorders . Yet, our understanding of the molecular pathology of GNAO1 and its relationship with the disease symptomatology is far from complete, and many disease-causing variants remain to be characterized.\n\n    In this study, we investigated 16 individuals carrying de novo missense GNAO1 variants and deeply analyzed their phenotype, culminating in the development of an all-encompassing disease severity score. We further delineated the molecular pathology of these variants using a molecular deconvoluting platform and mapped these results onto a disease severity score to facilitate prognosis and the development of precision interventions.",
        "Methods": "    This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain (PIC-77-21). Written informed consent was obtained from all guardians of participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n    Sixteen individuals with missense variants in GNAO1 were identified as part of the ongoing study \"Prospective and retrospective study of phenotypic and genotypic characterization of patients affected by GNAO1-related disorders\" at the Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain. This is a prospective three-year study that annually evaluates children with GNAO1-related disorders with a standardized protocol, in addition to retrospectively analyzing their evolution prior to inclusion in the study. In this article, partial data from the first and second years of assessment are utilized. A case report on one patient (P6) was previously published  and data from some of the cohort members were included in the caregiver survey by Axeen et al.\n\n    Fourteen of the 16 individuals were characterized by direct clinical examination, and in all 16, video recordings were independently reviewed by two movement disorder specialists, reaching a consensus agreement. We assessed the baseline movement disorders both at rest and when performing voluntary movements. During these assessments, the patients were taking their usual medications for epilepsy and movement disorders. Observed movements were classified according to established criteria and rated using specific and validated severity scales: the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) for dystonia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for chorea or stereotypies. We defined a dyskinetic crises as a sudden and marked exacerbation of abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias), which are distinct in onset and duration from the baseline dyskinetic movements of the patient, such as dystonia, chorea or athetosis. During a dyskinetic crises, alterations in facial expression may manifest, which are different from epileptic seizures as there is no loss of awareness or disconnection from the surrounding environment. Additionally, post-episode somnolence is not typically observed, unlike in seizures. These events are typically identified by parents or regular caregivers. Video 1 displays examples of patients with GNAO1-related disorders experiencing dyskinetic crises. As the physical examination of children with GNAO1-related disorders can be highly variable, we scored each item according to the highest severity observed.\n\n    Seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria. Ten of 16 patients underwent 24-hour video-EEG monitoring in an epilepsy unit during this study. Retrospective data on epilepsy history, seizures, previous video-EEG characteristics, antiseizure medication or other treatments used, and their responses were also collected.\n\n    Motor and language development were methodically assessed through the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Vineland-II), the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III), and the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88).\n\n    For each patient, a comprehensive retrospective review of medical records and clinical investigations was also conducted.\n\n    Brain MRI data were available for all patients. Ten patients underwent brain MRIs during this study. In addition, all previous MRIs available for 14 out of 16 patients were reviewed.\n\n    Available neurotransmitter data from lumbar punctures were collected in 5 out of 16 patients.\n\n    To develop the GNAO1-related disorders severity score, a team of expert pediatric neurologists specializing in movement disorders and epilepsy discussed the items for inclusion in the scale. Several iterations of the scale were constructed and tested, with input from other experts in the field, until the final version was obtained. The process involved a thorough review and analysis of other scales utilized in the assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy, with particular attention given to the unique characteristics and quality of life concerns of individuals with GNAO1-related disorders. The final scale reflects the severity of our patient population and was designed to be reliable and valid for clinical use. We have included the following items: 1) epilepsy; 2) movement disorders; 3) gross motor development; 4) language development; and 5) feeding. For items 1) epilepsy and 2) movement disorders, the average of four subitems was taken into account: a) frequency, b) intensity and duration, c) falls or injuries, and d) medication or therapy. Unless otherwise specified, the condition of the patient for the last year was used when calculating the score. Regarding item 3) gross motor development. Infants older than 3 months could be evaluated; otherwise, we computed 0 points. The same applies to item 4) language development. Infants older than 6 months could be evaluated; otherwise, we computed 0 points. The GNAO1-related disorders severity score is presented in Table 1. The scores range from 0 to 13. Finally, we categorize the phenotype as mild (total severity score ranging from 0 to 3.9 points), moderate (4 to 7.9 points), or severe (> 8 points).\n\n    All patients were diagnosed with GNAO1 missense variants as part of their routine clinical care using available testing, whether through 1) targeted GNAO1 gene sequencing, 2) a multiple gene panel for DEEs, or 3) whole exome secuencing (WES).\n\n    HEK293FT cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids, 1mM sodium pyruvate at 37 C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. At the time of transfection, cells were supplemented with 0.1% Matrigel (Corning).\n\n    For bioluminescence resonance transfer (BRET) assays, cells were seeded in 96-well flatbottomed white microplates (Greiner Bio-One) at a density of 5 x 104 cells/well. At the same time the cells were plated, they were transfected with expression constructs (total 0.09 mug/well), PLUS reagent (0.1 muL/well) and Lipofectamine LTX (0.5 muL/well). The expression constructs transfected were as follows (number in parentheses indicates the relative amount of DNA, where 1 = 0.015 mug): Flag-D2R (1), GalphaoA (2), Venus 156-239-Gbeta1 (1), Venus 1-155Ggamma2 (1), and masGRK3ct-Nluc-HA (1).\n\n    For NanoBiT assays, cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes at a density of 4 x 106 cells/dish. After 4 hr., expression constructs (total 2.1 mug/dish) were transfected into the cells using PLUS reagent (7.5 muL/dish) and Lipofectamine LTX (12 muL/dish) reagents. The expression constructs transfected were as follows (number in parentheses indicates the relative amount of DNA, where 1 = 0.42 mug): D2R-mycSmBiT (1), GalphaoA (0.1), LgBiT-Gbeta1 (1), and Ggamma2 (1). A calibration curve of wildtype GalphaoA cDNA was run and the amount of GalphaoA cDNA used in the assay was chosen so that the assay was not saturated.\n\n    BRET between Venus-Gbeta1gamma2 and masGRK3ctNluc-HA was used to measure trimer formation, agonist-induced G protein activation, and dominant-negative activity of Galphao mutants in living cells. 16 to 24 hr. post-transfection, cells were washed with once BRET buffer (Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.5mM MgCl2 and 0.1% glucose. Cells were harvested with centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min and resuspended in BRET buffer. The substrate for Nano luciferase (Nluc), furimazine (Promega), was diluted in BRET buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions and added to the cells. BRET measurements were made every 100 ms over a course of 1 minute using a microplate reader (PHERAstar FSX; BMG Labtech) equipped with two emission photomultiplier tubes. 100 muM dopamine (Sigma) was added after obtaining a baseline BRET value. All measurements were performed at 37  C. The BRET signal was calculated as the ratio of the light emitted by the Venus-Gbeta1gamma2 (535 nm +- 30 nm) over the light emitted by the masGRK3ct-Nluc-HA (475 nm +- 30 nm). The average baseline BRET value recorded prior to dopamine stimulation was subtracted from the experimental BRET signal values.\n\n    Measurement of bioluminescence caused by complementation between D2R-SmBiT and LgBiT-Gbeta1 was performed to examine the interaction between G proteins and the receptor. 16 to 24 hr. post-transfection, HEK293FT cells were washed once with BRET buffer and detached by gentle pipetting. Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 cells/well were transferred to a 96-well flatbottomed white microplate (Greiner Bio-One). The substrate for Nano luciferase (Nluc), furimazine (Promega), was diluted in BRET buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions and added to the cells. Luminescence measurements were made every 0.74 s for 172.66 s using a microplate reader (PHERAstar FSX; BMG Labtech) equipped with two emission photomultiplier tubes. 100 muM dopamine (Sigma) was added after obtaining a baseline luminescence value after 55s. All measurements were performed at 37  C.\n\n    For clinical studies, we used Spearman's rank correlation to establish the correlation between the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and Vineland-II, Bayley-III (cognitive, receptive language and expressive language sub scores), GMFM-88, the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. For functional studies, samples with only pcDNA3.1+ transfected in place of Galphao were used as baseline measurements. The max amplitude of these measurements was subtracted from the max amplitude of all other measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.4. All data are represented as mean +- SEM. Comparisons were computed using one-way ANOVA. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001, **** = p < 0.0001).",
        "Results": "    We detected many different GNAO1 variants, all of them de novo and classified as pathogenic according to the ACMG criteria. While several variants were previously reported in the literature, we found four novel variants: p.K46R, p.T48I, p.R209P, and p.L235P (Table 2). The variants p.T182I (P4 and P5), p.G203R (P11, P12, and P13), and p.R209C (P14 and P15) were identified in multiple patients in this study.\n\n    Patient ages ranged from 11 months to 15 years and 11 months (median 8.4 years, mean 7.3 years) within the cohort. Fifty-six percent of individuals were female. We collected retrospective data on P5, who died at the age of 3 years and 2 months due to status epilepticus. Additionally, P6 died during our study at the age of 7 years and 7 months in the context of respiratory failure resulting from pneumonia and a bronchospasm crisis. First symptoms were identified at an age ranging from the prenatal period (P4 and P5 mother described, subjectively, increased fetal movements) to 1.5 years, with hypotonia or motor developmental delay (6 patients, 37.5%), epilepsy (5 patients, 31%), and movement disorder (3 patients, 18.7%) being the most frequently reported (Table 3).\n\n    Abnormal involuntary movements were present in all patients, in the majority of cases by 12 months of age (14 patients, 87.5%). Generalized choreoathetosis and dystonia (13 patients, 81.3%) and stereotypies (3 patients, 18.8%) were the most frequent movement disorders (Video1, in Supplementary material). Ten patients (62.5%) presented with dyskinetic crises. Six patients (37.5%) were hospitalized specifically for management of their movement disorder. A number of medications were tried in our cohort, with no obvious benefit in many cases (Table 3). Four patients underwent globus pallidus deep brain stimulation that was partially beneficial: Dyskinetic crises in P4 were less frequent and severe, avoiding the need for further hospitalizations; generalized dystonia in P14 showed only a slight improvement; P6 demonstrated a significant but transient improvement in her dyskinetic crises; whereas P7 has a brief follow-up period after the DBS to draw a conclusion. The outcomes of the assessment of dystonia and chorea utilizing the BFMDRS and AIMS rating scales are presented in Table S1.\n\n    Eight patients (50%) were diagnosed with epilepsy, with several seizure types identified and heterogeneous video-EEG findings (Table 3). Of note, the patients with the highest scores on the GNAO1-related disorders severity score had abnormal background activity, with diffuse slowing during wakefulness (5 patients, 31.3%) and absence of physiological sleep elements and periods of diffuse low voltage activity during sleep (3 patients, 18.7%). Variable seizure frequency was observed, with one patient experiencing four seizures over five years and others experiencing multiple daily seizures. Six patients (37.5%) meet criteria for drug-resistant epilepsy. Based on interviews with caregivers and previous medical reports, it is not possible to determine which antiseizure medications are more effective. P6 was given a ketogenic diet, which produced a positive but temporary response. Other non-pharmaceutical treatments, such as vagal nerve stimulation, were not utilized in any patient.\n\n    Neurodevelopmental delay was present in all cases. Notably, five patients had a relatively mild phenotype, manifesting normal head growth, independent ambulation, limited spoken language, and purposeful hand function. In contrast, seven patients tended to be more severely affected, with a phenotype more consistent with the classically described GNAO1-related disorder (Table 3). Neurodevelopmental assessment scores of Participants (Bayley-III, Vineland-II, and GMFM-88) can be found in Table S2.\n\n    Five patients (31.2%) required gastrostomies, and one patient (6.3%) required a transpyloric tube, while the majority of patients were fed by mouth with food of normal or mashed consistency (Table 3).\n\n    Normal brain MRIs were reported for 11 patients (68.6%). Unspecific white matter lesions (1 patient, 6.3%) and global atrophy or widening of the extra axial spaces and ventricular system (2 patients, 12.5%) were frequent findings. Interestingly, P5 showed cortical cytotoxic edema, probably due to status epilepticus versus hypernatremia. No obvious radiologic abnormalities of the basal ganglia were detected.\n\n    CSF neurotransmitter analysis was previously undertaken in five patients. Abnormalities, namely low homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were seen in one patient (P15). This patient began L-dopa and 5-OH-thryptophan supplementation with doubtful benefit. It is currently unclear as to why this finding has been observed, and it is possible that this may be a coincidental occurrence.\n\n    The range of total severity scores was between 2 and 13 (Table 4). Five patients had a score of mild (from 0 to 3.9 points), four had a score of moderate (from 4 to 7.9 points), and seven had a score of severe (> 8 points). The mean score for each subcategory was as follows: 1) epilepsy 0.9 (range 0 to 3), 2) movement disorders 1.6 (range 0.3 to 3), 3) gross motor development 2.3 (range 0 to 4), 4) language development 1.8, and 5) feeding 0.3.\n\n    Patients with the same GNAO1 variant had comparable total severity scores (P4 and P5 with p.T182I variant (11 and 13, severe), P11, P12, and P13 with p.G203R variant (10.5, 8 and 9, severe), and P14 and P15 with p.R209C variant (2.5 and 2.8, mild) and were categorized as having the same severity. Video 2 displays examples of patients with varying degrees of severity in the GNAO1-related disorders severity score.\n\n    To understand the molecular mechanism behind the pathology of each uncharacterized variant, we began by mapping their locations onto the structure of Galphao (Figure 1A). We found several variants (p.G40R, p.K46R, and p.T84I) located in the P-loop region. Another variant, p.T182I, directly coordinates the Mg2+ ion. Several other variants include proline substitutions. These could be predicted to disrupt secondary structure in regions such as beta3, Switch II and Switch III, in the cases of p.L199P, p.R209P, and p.L235P, respectively. The remaining two variants, p.Y231C and p.Y391N, are both substitutions of tyrosine residues, with unclear implications for Galphao organization based on the structural considerations.\n\n    We have previously developed a pipeline for mechanistic evaluation of disease variants in Galpha using a suite of BRET assays that monitor transitions in the G protein cycle . We applied this approach to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the novel Galphao variants uncovered in this study.\n\n    We started our examination by assessing the overall ability of the Galphao variants to transmit signals using D2R as a model GPCR that prominently couples to Galphao and is involved in striatal motor control (Figure 1B). For each variant, we observed a significantly reduced maximum response amplitude in response to dopamine stimulation as compared to WT (Figure 1C). Five mutants (p.G40R, p.T48I, p.T182I, p.L199P, p.R209P) completely failed to respond to dopamine stimulation, while others displayed varying degrees of deficiency (Figure 1D).\n\n    To probe the mechanisms underlying the signaling deficits, we first tested Galphao variants for an ability to form heterotrimers with the Gbetagamma subunits. This was accomplished by comparing the baseline BRET ratio between NanoLuc-tagged GRK and the Venus-tagged Gbetagamma (Figure 1E). As BRET between these two molecules is precluded by association of Galphao with Gbetagamma, we determined the amount of heterotrimer formation based on changes in baseline BRET values induced upon the introduction of Galphao. This analysis revealed that all of the mutants that were completely unable to transduce GPCR signals (p.G40R, p.T48I, p.T182I, p.L199P) also had significantly reduced ability to form G protein heterotrimers (Figure 1F).\n\n    We questioned if there were any folding and/or stability defects in the variants that could cause their reduced ability to form heterotrimers. Western blotting of transfected HEK293FT cell lysates indicated that p.G40R, p.T48I, pT182I, and p.L199P were indeed expressed at significantly lower levels than WT Galphao (Figure 1G). This decrease in expression closely correlates with the reduction in heterotrimer formation observed in these variants, suggesting that loss of protein stability likely underlies the functional deficits in trimer formation and, consequently, transduction of GPCR signals.\n\n    We next tested GNAO1 variants for their dominant negative activity given that it was shown to be present in some previously reported variants . To test this, we expressed the variants alongside WT Galphao and measured any decrease in dopamine-induced BRET response (Figure 2A). Three variants (p.T48I, p.T182I and p.R209P) displayed a significant decrease in dopamine response, indicating that they interfere with normal activation of Galphao by D2R (Figure 2B, 2C).\n\n    We further interrogated possible mechanisms behind dominant negative effects by studying the recruitment of G protein heterotrimer to the D2R receptor upon its activation by an agonist. This was achieved using an assay that measures complementation between SmBit-tagged D2R and LgBit-tagged Gbetagamma which reconstitutes Nluc, producing luminescence upon Galphao- mediated interaction of Gbetagamma with the D2R (Figure 2D). Interestingly, with the single exception of p.L199P, we detected interaction with D2R for all mutants with a varying degree of efficiency (Figure 2E, 2F). The p.G40R, p.Y321C, and p.Y291N variants showed a significantly decreased interaction with the receptor compared to WT, likely explained by the decreased expression of the variants. On the other hand, the p.K46R and p.T182I variants displayed a significant increase in interaction with the receptor compared to WT, suggesting that these variants have more non-productive interactions with the receptor.\n\n    To assess the strength of our experimental measurements in predicting the clinical severity of the different variants, we gave each variant a score ranging from 0 to 3 in the categories of Galphao Expression, Heterotrimer Formation, Loss-of-function, and Dominant Negative phenotype, with 0 indicating no departure from WT values and 3 being the most severe departure from WT values (Table 4). We also gave a score ranging from -3 to +3 for Receptor interaction, with positive values indicating increased interaction with the receptor and negative values indicating decreased interaction with the receptor. These five categories were then combined into an overall Experimental Measurement score. The variants in Muntean et al. were also given an Experimental Measurement score.\n\n    Overall, there was a strong correlation between the Clinical Severity score and the Experimental Measurement score (R2 = 0.486) (Figure 3A). To further dissect what molecular mechanisms underpinned the clinical severity, we compared the overall Clinical Severity score with the scores of each individual functional experiment. We discovered a correlation between the Clinical Severity score and the variant Expression Levels (R2 = 0.301) (Figure 3B) and Trimer Formation (R2 = 0.685) (Figure 3C). The correlations for the Loss-of-function, Dominant Negative, and Receptor Interaction experiments were much weaker (R2 = 0.139, 0.079, and 0.001, respectively) (Figure 3D-F). We further analyzed relationship between the highest correlating functional metric of Trimer Formation and individual clinical traits that contribute to Clinical Severity score. This analysis revealed the greatest level of correlation with epilepsy measures (Figure S1 A-E) and weak, if any, correlation with other measures (Figure S1 F-M).\n\n    We used Spearman's rank correlation and found a significant negative correlation between the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and Vineland-II (r=-.553*, p=0.032), Bayley-III Cognitive (r=-.811**, p=0.008), Bayley-III Receptive Language (r=-.868**, p<0.001), Bayley-III Expressive Language (r=-.777**, p=0.002), GMFM-88 (r=-.955**, p<0.001). On the other hand, we found only a weak non-significant positive correlation between GNAO1-related disorders severity score and the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (r=.191, p=0.532), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (r=.127, p=0.680). Table S3 displays the correlations observed between the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and other standardized scales.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We report detailed phenotypic data for 16 individuals with GNAO1-related disorders harboring 12 distinct missense variants, including four novel variants (p.K46R, p.T48I, p.R209P, and p.L235P), thus expanding the genetic variability of the disease. Furthermore, we develop a clinical severity score system in order to standardize the assessment of individuals with GNAO1-related disorders. Additionally, we delineate the molecular mechanisms (receptor-mediated activation of the G protein, trimer formation, dominant negative activity, and receptor interaction) of each variant included in this study, develop an experimental measurement score for missense GNAO1 variants, and analyze its correlation with the clinical score.\n\n    Disease-causing missense variants in GNAO1 are associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome that ranges from mild to severe and is characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay or intellectual disability, hypotonia, and movement disorders . Using a disease-specific composite score to quantify the severity among different individuals is necessary for establishing truthful phenotype-genotype correlations. The GNAO1-related disorders severity score proposed here incorporates the most relevant aspects of this condition, including epilepsy, movement disorders, neurodevelopmental issues, and the need for a gastrostomy. Our team, comprised of pediatric neurologists specialized in both movement disorders and epilepsy, developed the GNAO1-related disorders severity score after conducting a thorough examination of the phenotype of individuals with GNAO1-related disorders. In addition, we carefully reviewed and analyzed other scales utilized in the assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy to inform our design process. In regards to items 1) epilepsy and 2) movement disorders, we have taken into account the most significant factors that influence how these conditions impact the quality of life. This encompasses the frequency, duration, and intensity of the condition, as well as the potential for disruptive events such as falls, sleep disturbances, pain, or injury. Furthermore, we have also considered the response of the condition to treatment. Despite the absence of falls related to movement disorders or seizures in our cohort, we have designed the scale to be universally applicable to all individuals affected by GNAO1-related disorders. Given the possibility that movement disorders and epilepsy may manifest or fluctuate over the clinical course of GNAO1-related disorders, it is necessary to undertake additional investigations to confirm the reliability and usefulness of the GNAO1-related disorders severity score in larger patient cohorts over an extended time frame. Nonetheless, we observed that in our sample, the severity score appropriately captured the heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and overall severity of each patient, with a wide range of scores and elevated scores consistently correlated with greater disease severity across all domains. Furthermore, we did not observe any substantial variations in severity levels during the follow-up period of our prospective study. The GNAO1-related disorders severity score obtained from our cohort did not exhibit any correlation with age, as we did not observe higher scores in older children. Additionally, in the retrospective analysis of different individuals, we did not identify any significant changes in the severity scores over time. This observation leads us to hypothesize that a significant modification in the severity score of the disorder is more likely to be associated with a therapeutic intervention rather than the natural progression of the condition. We here present an initial stage in the creation of the GNAO1-related disorders severity score. Our aim is to enhance this framework by testing it on a more diverse population, including individuals with varying GNAO1 variants, to improve the precision of scoring subscales. Additionally, we are interested in exploring the possibility of applying our severity ranking to individuals with other DEEs, which would be a fascinating avenue of investigation. Limited information on the natural history of specific DEEs , makes disease progression poorly traceable for the majority of DEEs. Yet, as more information becomes available, common severity scoring systems could delineate cross-disorder differences and similarities. Overall, we hope that our GNAO1-related disorders severity score will advance the development of therapies for this and related conditions.\n\n    The results of our analysis revealed significant correlations between the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and several standardized scales commonly used to assess developmental and movement disorders (Table S3). Specifically, we found a strong negative correlation between the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and the Vineland-II and Bayley-III (cognitive, receptive language, and expressive language sub scores). These findings suggest that as the GNAO1-related disorders severity score increases, individuals with GNAO1-related disorders tend to exhibit more severe cognitive and language impairments, as well as greater difficulties in adaptive behaviors. In addition, we observed a very strong negative correlation between the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and GMFM-88 scale, indicating that as the GNAO1-related disorders severity score increases, individuals with GNAO1-related disorders tend to have more severe gross motor impairments. Interestingly, we did not find a significant correlation between the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale or the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, suggesting that the severity of dystonia or involuntary movements may not be strongly related to overall disease severity in this population. In our study, we expected to find no correlation with the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale or the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, as we have previously observed in our natural history study that dystonia does not necessarily correlate with the ability to walk (Table S1). There are \"mild\" phenotypes that are highly dystonic but still have preserved walking ability. Additionally, we believe that axial hypotonia is a sign that influences motor development more significantly. Another finding that requires further confirmation in a larger cohort is that children with preserved walking ability and generalized dystonia exhibit fewer or no dyskinetic crises compared to hypotonic children with more severe motor impairment.\n\n    Remarkably, in our cohort, we have indeed identified three patients with a very severe phenotype, characterized by marked hypotonia (GMFM-88, 0%), similar to that observed in patients with neuromuscular disease. These patients have very poor voluntary motor control and profound intellectual disabilities, which hinder their ability to follow commands and participate in motor testing. These severe phenotypes are so debilitating that two out of the three patients have unfortunately passed away.\n\n    Our study is the first to utilize an integrative severity score for each individual with GNAO1-related disorders based on a comprehensive clinical scoring system. Similar disease-specific scores have been developed for other rare disorders that have allowed to guide the prognosis of the disease by recognizing clinical or molecular findings as well as establish causal relationships. Brock et al. found a significant inverse correlation between cerebral visual impairment and neurodevelopmental outcome in individuals with DEE 2 due to CDKL5 variants. Balagura et al. found that the age at the onset of seizures correlates with a poor developmental outcome, as measured by the STXBP1 (DEE 4) composite developmental score. In our study, we observed that video-EEG in patients with the most severe GNAO1-related disorders showed a remarkable absence of physiological sleep elements and periods of diffuse low-voltage activity during sleep. These characteristics have been identified in other severe DEEs , as well as in the previous report of P6 . Although more data are needed, this characteristic might be included in the assessment of the severity score for this disorder, or it may even be a potential neurophysiologic biomarker for the diagnosis of a GNAO1-related disorder. Along the same lines, the mother of P4 and P5, with a severe phenotype, described increased fetal movement. Although this is somewhat subjective, we believe that rather than epileptic seizures, these movements corresponded to dyskinetic episodes, as both patients with a severe phenotype (11 and 13 points in the severity score, respectively) experience daily dyskinetic episodes. Moreover, P5 died due to dyskinetic status. While this is a subjective symptom and needs to be interpreted with caution, this would be the first report of the prenatal onset of movement disorders in GNAO1-related disorders. Increased fetal movements suggestive of epileptic seizures have been reported in some neurological disorders, e.g., 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Given these observations, it is likely that increased fetal movement is associated with a more severe phenotype, making the application of prenatal exome sequencing  worth considering.\n\n    Regarding molecular findings, we have found that individuals with the same variant have comparable scores on the GNAO1-related disorder severity score (P4 and P5; P11, P12, and P13; and P14 and P15). Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the clinical severity score and the Experimental Measurement score of missense GNAO1 variants. It will be highly interesting if these findings are replicated with a larger sample size, or if genetic modifiers  or epigenetic factors  influence clinical expression as they do for other DEEs. Since we have not found significant changes in the severity of symptoms throughout the evolution, it does not appear that changes in the natural history of the disease can significantly modify the correlation with the pathophysiological findings. We have established three levels of severity, namely mild, moderate, and severe, in our GNAO1-related disorders severity score. This stratification takes into account the score variability and aims to group patients in the same range of severity, even if their symptoms may have fluctuated over time.\n\n    The results described here support previous findings that any variants in Galphao interfere with receptor-mediated activation of the G protein (Figure 4A). Specifically, it reinforces the assumption that the variants in the P-loop of Galphao reduce the stability of the G protein heterotrimer. Two previously uncharacterized Galphao variants reported here, p.G40R and p.T48I, are located near the P-loop and display decreased interaction with Gbetagamma. One exception to this observation is the novel variant p.K46R. Although this variant is located in the P-loop, it does not show any significant variation in heterotrimer formation from WT. This is likely due to the conserved nature of the lysine to arginine variant. Additionally, the variants p.T182I, which is located in the Switch I, and p.L199R, which is located on beta3, also display a significant decrease in heterotrimer formation. This indicates that in addition to the P-loop, variants in these regions also interfere with heterotrimer formation. These variants are related structurally to the P-loop, as changes in beta3 are passed via alpha1 to the nucleotide binding pocket. Intriguingly, variants in the switch II region that directly interact with Gbeta, such as p.G203R, p.R209C, and p.R209P, do not interfere with heterotrimer formation. Remarkably, among the categories that comprise the Experimental Measure score, Heterotrimer Formation showed the highest correlation with the Clinical Severity score (R2 = 0.685), thus making it really interesting for predicting the clinical severity of the different variants.\n\n    Notably, all the variants studied here interfere significantly with agonist-induced signal propagation. The amount of reduced signal propagation (loss-of-function) gave the strongest correlation with the amount of dominant negative activity presented by a variant (Figure 4B). Surprisingly, the dominant negative activity of a variant had little to do with how strongly it interacted with the receptor. This indicates that the molecular mechanisms of the dominant negative activity for many variants studied remain to be determined. Furthermore, according to our observations, the degree of dominant negative activity is a poor indicator of clinical severity. Indeed, the individual with the only variant showing the most pronounced dominant negative phenotype, p.R209P, only had a mild overall clinical severity score. It is also worth noting that in our study we used the D2 dopamine receptor to model the behavior of Galphao variants. Given the conserved mechanism of G protein activation by GPCRs, we expect similar behavior from Galphao variants with other Gi/o-coupled receptors; however, this assumption remains to be tested.\n\n    In our previous studies, we characterized the behavior of p.G203R and p.R209C variants in the endogenous neuronal setting. We found that p.G203R lowered the efficacy of dopamine signaling in indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) and increased the potency of dopamine signaling in direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs). Contrastingly, it reduced adenosine efficacy in dMSNs and increased potency in iMSNs. On the other hand, p.R209C exclusively affected iMSNs by lowering dopamine efficacy and exclusively affected dMSNs by lowering adenosine efficacy. This difference in response is intriguing because p.R209C has a mild clinical severity outcome while p.G203R has a severe outcome. It is conceivable that reductions in efficacy in dMSNs and iMSNs are not as pathogenic as increases in agonist potency in these neuronal populations.\n\n    Major limitations of our study include selection bias toward individuals with missense variants, the restricted number of individuals recruited, the limited number of different variants in the GNAO1 gene (12 out of the 60 described to date) included, and the relatively brief period of clinical follow-up. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate the GNAO1-related disorders severity score and verify its usefulness in a generalized clinical routine. Nevertheless, the prospective standardization of data collection and the utilization of the GNAO1-related disorders severity score allow us to address the heterogeneity of these individuals, compare clinical and molecular pathology data, and identify significant correlations.\n\n    The majority of current treatments for DEEs focus on individual symptoms, such as seizures or movement disorders, rather than the underlying disease mechanisms . Many individuals with GNAO1-related disorders do not achieve seizure or movement disorder control, and even in patients who achieve partial control, neurodevelopmental impairments and other comorbidities frequently continue to be severe . The GNAO1-related disorders severity score incorporates the most relevant aspects of this condition, including epilepsy, movement disorders, neurodevelopmental issues, and the need for gastrostomy, and it evaluates the most fundamental aspects of DEEs: epilepsy and movement issues, in a manner that is sensitive to the temporal evolution of these cardinal clinical signs. Our scoring system, together with our molecular findings, can contribute to the design of future trials and studies focusing on natural history. These studies should take into account all of the major aspects of the GNAO1-related disorders at different stages among the various subgroups, identify the beneficial endpoints and windows for therapeutic interventions, and determine the optimal timing for therapeutic interventions .\n\n    In conclusion, we found that each GNAO1 variant has a unique profile of clinical and functional phenotypes. Although there is overlap in the clinical outcomes of each variant, each appears to have a unique pathological molecular mechanism. Moreover, patients harboring the same variants have similar clinical outcomes, indicating that the differences in disease profiles are not due to inter-patient variability but rather to unique disease mechanisms. As posited previously, each variant lies on a spectrum of loss-of-function and dominant negative activity. Finally, it is likely that the present mechanistic findings will aid in the development of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of GNAO1-related disorders. Additionally, the GNAO1-related disorders severity score will facilitate standardization of the categorization of patients according to clinical severity and assessment of response to therapies in development.",

        "Title": "    Effect of drying methods on chemical composition and antioxidant activity of underutilized stinging nettle leaves",
        "Abstract": "    Stinging nettles provide low-cost quality nutrition for alleviating malnutrition. Previous research on stinging nettles focused mainly on the nutritional quality of fresh leaves. In this study, the effect of drying method on macronutrients, mineral content, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene content and total phenols content and antioxidant activity were investigated. The contribution of fresh, oven dried or freeze dried stinging nettle leaves to the required daily value for the nutrients were also determined. Oven drying of nettle leaves resulted in a higher loss of beta-carotene and ascorbic acid content compared to freeze drying. In contrast, the total phenols content and total antioxidant activity were higher in oven dried stinging nettle leaves compared to freeze dried leaves. Overall, freeze dried and oven dried nettle leaves can be considered as a rich source of Ca, Mg and vitamin A; a good source of vitamin C, Fe, and Mn; and a source for Mg and K. Stinging nettle leaves could potentially be used as a cheap natural source of antioxidants and for addressing micronutrient malnutrition.\n\n    Food Science; Agriculture; Stinging nettle; Ascorbic acid; beta-carotene; Antioxidant activity; Total phenols content; Dietary value; Oven drying; Freeze drying; Minerals",
        "Introduction": "    Stinging nettle, Urtica dioica L., provides vitamins and minerals needed to maintain health in humans. The plant may help to combat malnutrition or nutrition-related health problems due to its bioactive compounds. Fresh nettle leaves contain phenolic compounds and polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential amino acids and ascorbic acid (Ioana et al., 2013). Nettle leaves contain nine carotenoids of which lutein and lutein isomers, and beta-carotene are the basic carotenoids. Nettle leaves are good sources of minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, copper and selenium. investigated the application of contemporary extraction techniques for elements and minerals from stinging nettle leaves. The authors found that microwave and ultrasonically-assisted extraction techniques could possibly be used for obtaining extracts as a secondary source of minerals. Nettle leaves are good sources of protein and dietary fiber.\n\n    Fresh stinging nettle leaves are reported to contain phenolic acid (e.g. hydroxycinnamic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid), tannins and flavonoids (e.g. flavones, flavonols, iso-flavonols, anthocyanins, catechins, lignin). evaluated the antioxidant and phenolic content of 48 Portuguese herbal plants for their dependence on extraction features [e.g. powder infusion (dried leaves), fresh leaf infusion and fresh leaf boiling (decoction)]. The authors recommended infusion as the most effective mode of extraction of antioxidants from medicinal plants.\n\n    Stinging nettle leaves add variety to the menu, thus could be used as a supplementary, spinach-like vegetable in human diet. also emphasized that the need to include dark green vegetables at least one serving per day to reduce the burden of nutrition-related disease. Nettle plant is widely used as food in early spring when young leaves are added to soups, salads, herbal tea or decocted tea as well as in dried form for winter use.\n\n    Drying of stinging nettle leaves not only grants their use when the plants are not physiologically active but also extends their consumption period. Additionally, the irritating contents of the stinging hairs are dissipated upon drying.\n\n    The drying method chosen can have a major impact on nutrient degradation and retention. Ambient air-drying (such as well-ventilated air drying and sun drying) was mentioned as a common method of drying stinging nettle leaves. However, the slow drying process involved in ambient air-drying methods may lead to a loss of quality of the leaves (e.g. colour changes, losses of ascorbic acid and carotenoids). Freeze-drying is the most common method of drying nettle for medicinal purposes such as for the production of encapsulated nettle products. During freeze-drying, very few chemical changes occur whereas oven drying at 45  C-140  C can cause faster degradation of colour and loss of primary metabolites.\n\n    Drying processes involving high temperature such as oven drying result in protein denaturation, ascorbic acid and beta-carotene degradation and might affect antioxidants in food products. When drying herbs the amount of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of herb extracts increased. Differences in aroma, flavour and colour of leaf infusions and cooked leaves were noted when oven-dried leaves used compared to fresh leaves. Colour changes during oven drying of stinging nettle leaves were also reported. Ascorbic acid and beta-carotene are better retained in freeze-dried food products compared to oven-dried.\n\n    In general, the low temperature of the freeze drying process more likely slow down degradation reactions and preserves the nutrient content of food more efficiently than oven or solar drying. However, the cost of freeze drying equipment limits its application to pharmaceutical products and production of highly valued healthy products such as nettle leaves, nettle leaf powder; nettle leaf tea bags, etc. These products are expensive and therefore only affordable to high economic end consumers (developed market, rich) where such consumers demand a higher value and natural products.\n\n    Oven drying is used more often in food processing industries due to its lower production costs leading to products that are more affordable to consumers at the lower end of the market (developing market, poor).\n\n    However, information on the effect of oven drying and freeze drying on vitamins, total phenolics content and antioxidant activity of nettle leaves are lacking. This study was carried out to determine the effect of oven drying and freeze drying of nettle leaves on macronutrient, minerals, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid and total phenolics content, as well as antioxidant activity. The findings of this study could enable the consumers or food industry to choose either an oven drying or freeze drying method for maximum retention of nutritional properties of stinging nettle leaves.",
        "Methods": "    Stinging nettle young and tender shoots were produced and harvested in October (spring season) 2014 at the University of Pretoria Experimental Farm Station, South Africa. Spinach leaves (as a control) were purchased from a supermarket. Twenty units (500 g each) of young nettle and spinach leaves were sorted and washed. Treatments, each replicated three times, were prepared as follows. Oven dried leaves (70  C for 15 h) and freeze dried leaves (-40  C for 5 days) were prepared. Dried leaves were ground to a powder using a coffee grinder and sealed in polyethylene bags. All samples were kept frozen (- 4  C) until analysis.\n\n    methods were used to determine moisture (method 44-15A), fats (method 30-25), proteins content (N x 6.25) by Dumas combustion (method 46-30), ash (method 08-01) and crude fibre (method 32-10.01) while available carbohydrate content was calculated by difference.\n\n    method No.40-70.01 was used for mineral analyses (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, P, K, and Na) using Ion Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (SpectroAcros, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany).\n\n    The quantitative analysis of beta-carotene content of fresh, freeze dried, and oven dried stinging nettle leaves was done using an auto-sampler Shimadzu Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography.. Sample extraction and mobile phase preparation were done following the method of.\n\n    The detection of beta-carotene was performed at 450 nm and UV/Vis spectra of between 200 to 600 nm, 25  C on a YMC carotenoid-C30 column (250 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mum pore size) through isocratic elution with a methanol:methyl-tert-butyl ether (80:20, v/v) mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Identification of the all-trans-beta-carotene was carried out through the combined use of the retention time, visible absorption spectrum obtained with a photodiode array detector and co-injection with an all-trans-beta-carotene standard at four different concentration levels (calibration curve of the all-trans-beta-carotene standard, Figure 1)). The chromatogram is presented in Figure 2, and all-trans-beta-carotene (peak 1) was identified by comparing the spectrum (lambda max) (Figure 3) with those given in literature and retention time of the all-trans-beta-carotene standard. Vitamin A content of fresh and dried stinging nettle leaves was calculated using retinol activity equivalents (RAE) conversion factor of 12 mug beta-carotene to 1 mug retinol.\n\n    The quantitative analysis of ascorbic acid content of fresh, freeze-dried, and oven-dried leaves was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography-HPLC (Waters Alliance, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) equipped with 1525 Binary pump system, 2487 Dual lambda Absorbance detector (operated at 254 nm) and manual injection valve with 20-muL sample loop.\n\n    Sample extraction and mobile phase preparation was done following.The components were filtered through 0.45mum Nylon filters (Millipore) before analysis by the HPLC.\n\n    The separation of ascorbic acid was performed on a 4.6 mm x 250 mm i.d., 5mum pore size Phenomenex-C18 column by isocratic elution with a mobile phase consisting of 0.2 % metaphosphoric acid/methanol/acetonitrile (90:8:2, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The quantification of ascorbic acid was done using a calibration curve of L-ascorbic acid standard (Figure 4). The determination of ascorbic acid content was carried out by HPLC through the combined use of the retention time and co-injection with L-ascorbic acid standard (Figure 5).\n\n    Sample extraction was performed as described by. Fresh, freeze-dried, and oven-dried leaves (1 g each) were extracted in covered test tubes in a drying oven (PROLAB, Model: IDS 160, Switzerland) for 1 h at 50  C using 10 mL of 80 % methanol-water mixture. The extracts were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were recovered for analysis. Total phenolics content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau (FC) method. Total antioxidant activity of fresh, freeze-dried, and oven-dried leaves were determined using the DPPH Radical Scavenging Activity Assay according to.\n\n    The % contribution of a serving of fresh (100 g), freeze dried (15 g) or oven dried (15 g) leaves (see Table 1) to the daily value (DV) (i.e. Daily values of nutrients provided in Table 2) [based on a caloric intake of 2, 000 Cal for adults and children four or more years of age as described by of a specific nutrient including minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, P, K, and Na), protein, vitamin A and vitamin C was determined as follows (1):\n\n    Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in XLSTAT 2015 (AddinSoft  SARL, Paris, France) was applied to assess the effects of species (viz. stinging nettle, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) included as a control) and drying method (viz. freeze drying and oven drying) on macronutrients, minerals content, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene content, total phenols content and antioxidant activity. Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test was applied to separate statistically significant means (at the 5 % level).",
        "Results": "    Results for the proximate composition of the fresh, freeze-dried and oven-dried leaves are presented in Table 3. The moisture, fat, crude fibre, ash, crude protein and available carbohydrate contents were significantly affected by species and drying method, whereas only moisture and available carbohydrates were significantly affected by the species and drying method interaction effect. For fresh leaves, crude fibre and crude protein content were higher (p < 0.01) in nettle leaves compared to spinach. For freeze-dried and oven-dried samples; fat, crude fibre, ash, and crude protein were higher (p < 0.01) in nettle leaves compared to spinach, whereas available carbohydrates and moisture content were higher (p < 0.01) in spinach.\n\n    The concentrations of eight minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, P, Zn, K, and Na) determined in fresh, freeze dried and oven dried stinging nettle and spinach leaves are shown in Table 4. Nettle leaves were found to contain significantly higher (p < 0.01) Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ca and Zn compared to spinach leaves. The drying processes did not affect the mineral content of the leaves.\n\n    The result for the effects of drying on beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, total phenols content and total antioxidant activities of nettle and spinach leaves can be found in Table 5. Ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, total phenols content and total antioxidant activities were significantly (p < 0.01) affected by species and drying methods.\n\n    Stinging nettle leaves contained significantly (p < 0.01) more ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, total phenols content and total antioxidant activities compared to spinach. Oven drying of nettle leaves resulted in a higher loss of beta-carotene and ascorbic acid content compared to freeze drying.\n\n    The percent daily value of proteins from a serving of fresh (100 g) or dried (15 g) nettle leaves was found to be 9 % (Table 3). Similarly, a typical serving of fresh or dried nettle leaves provided approximately 30-32 % Ca, 14 % Fe, 26 % Mg, 19 % Mn, 4 % Zn, 9 % P, and 5 % K to the daily values of the respective mineral elements (e.g. 1000 mg Ca, 18 mg Fe, 400 mg Mg, 2 mg Mn, 15 mg Zn, 1000 mg P and 3.5 g K per day) (Table 4). The percent daily value of beta-carotene (calculated as RAE, vitamin A) and vitamin C to the daily requirement of these nutrients (870 mug/day for vitamin A and 60 mg/day for vitamin C) were found to be higher in fresh (83.7 %, 23.7 %), followed by freeze-dried (75.7 %, 19.6 %) leaves compared to oven-dried (72.9 %, 16.5 %) leaves, respectively (Table 5).\n\n    The fat, fibre, ash and protein content of freeze dried and oven dried nettle leaves were found to be significantly higher than spinach leaves. The variability in preharvest conditions (e.g. growth conditions, type of fertilizers, climatic conditions, and genotypic difference) could have an immense role leading to variability in nutrients accumulated by nettle leaves and spinach. For example, the same species of stinging nettle produced at different agro-ecological conditions were reported to contain different concentrations of nutrients. According to and, a food may be described as a part of a healthy diet if the food carries a statement describing the conditions (e.g. rich source and good source) of the nutrient content claims per 100 g or per serving as provided in the dietary guidelines. For vegetables, the recommendation for school children and adults is at least 400 g/day of vegetables (80-100 g per serving or 4 to 5 servings). Recommended serving sizes was reported to be 80-100 g for green leafy vegetables, 100 g for fresh nettle leaves and 15-18 g for dried nettle leaves.\n\n    Accordingly, a serving size of 100 g for fresh leaves and 15 g dried nettle leaves were used to determine the potential contribution of fresh or dried nettle leaves to the dietary intakes of the specific nutrient. As described by, a food product with 5 % DV or less is considered low for that specific nutrient, 6-9 % DV a source, 11-19 % DV a good source and 20 % DV or more indicates a rich source (Table 2). Fresh or dried stinging nettle leaves were found to be a source of proteins; one will need to consume at least two servings of fresh or dried nettle leaves to reach 10 % of the DV (300 g/day for protein).\n\n    The high ash content of nettle leaves explains their higher concentration of Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ca and Zn compared to spinach leaves. This could be attributed to differences in cultural practices such as frequency of irrigation, fertilizer type, rate and time of application as well as fertility status of the soil during production. reported that medicinal plants (such as nettle, senna leaves) strongly vary in mineral elements concentration (e.g. Fe, Zn, Mn, Mg, K, Na, P, and Ca) because of differing absorption of mineral elements from the soil. Other authors reported variation in macro and micro mineral contents of moringa leaves sampled from different areas.\n\n    Fresh and dried nettle leaves can be considered as a \"good source\" of Fe and Mn because the contribution from a serving of the leaves was more than 10 % of the DV for these nutrients and rich source for Ca and Mg. In developing countries, anaemia was reported to be a serious problem in pregnant woman and preschool children. Anaemia also contributes to 20 % of all maternal deaths. A nettle leaf in both fresh and dried forms was found to be a good source of iron. Therefore, integrating stinging nettle leaves in the diet could help to combat anaemia which was reported to affect more than 60 % of children in Africa.\n\n    A person will need to consume at least two to three servings of fresh or dried nettle to reach the 10 % DV for Zn, P and K. Fresh and dried stinging nettle leaves could be categorized as 'free' for sodium content of the leaves, as the contribution of the sodium per serving of the leaves to the daily value of sodium (e.g. 2.4 g per day) is not more than 0.005 g. The low level of sodium in stinging nettle leaves could be beneficial for persons on a restricted sodium diet. According to the an estimated 2.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if global salt consumption was reduced to the recommended level (2.4 g per day).\n\n    The high potassium/sodium ratio (K/Na ratio ranging from 381 to 494) of stinging nettle leaves could be also another potential indicator of the protective powers of the stinging nettle leaves foliage against cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases.\n\n    However, reported that stinging nettle leaves contained antinutrients such as alkaloids (0.6 mg/100 g), phytates (4.39 mg/100 g) and saponins (3.25 mg/100 g). The phytates in the green leafy vegetables can be reduced by soaking, boiling or frying. reported that cooking maize meal fortified with green leafy vegetable (porridge) resulted in a decrease in phytates content and concomitant increase in bio-accessibility of Fe and Zn in the porridge. pointed out that tannins have the ability to chelate Fe and Zn by binding with their hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, and thereby reduces the bioavailability of these minerals. Therefore, cooking of stinging nettle leaves could potentially decrease the phytates content and increase the bio-accessibility of Fe and Zn in the cooked leaves.\n\n    The beta-carotene concentrations determined in fresh stinging nettle leaves samples were higher than those reported by and (for fresh nettle leaves) and (for dried nettle leaves). Similarly, the concentration of ascorbic acid found in fresh stinging nettle leaves samples was higher than those reported by and (in fresh nettle leaves). This is because the accumulation of vitamins and minerals by the plant tissues is a function of its genotype, pruning and thining, frequency of irrigation, temperature, temperature, sunlight, fertilizers used and fertility status of the soil. For example, the vitamin C content in plant tissues is highly correlated with the intensity of sunlight and whereas it is negatively correlated with the frequency of irrigation and the rates of nitrogen fertilizer during the growing season of vegetables. Furthermore, the beta-carotene and ascorbic acid content of stinging nettle leaves could be influenced by postharvest practices (e.g. drying and cooking). Drying conditions could have a great effect on heat and light labile beta-carotene and ascorbic acid.\n\n    The ascorbic acid and beta-carotene content of freeze-dried nettle leaves were higher compared to oven dried leaves. This can be attributed to the higher temperature of the oven drier (>50  C). During the freeze-drying process the temperature of the product is low (-45  C), which limits degradation reactions.\n\n    The higher loss of beta-carotene during oven drying could be because of the highly unsaturated beta-carotene structure which can lead to photooxidation and autooxidative reactions . reported heating causes increase in conversion of trans-isomers to cis-isomers of beta-carotene by 50%. Previous research also confirmed that ascorbic acid and beta-carotene are better retained in freeze dried food products compared to oven dried.\n\n    The high loss of ascorbic acid during oven drying could be due to the two hydroxyl groups in its structure which could be oxidized to dehydro-ascorbic acid at high temperature.\n\n    The loss of vitamin C in food products can range from 10 % to 50 % depending on temperature of drying processes. This is in agreement with the findings of the present study where the loss of ascorbic acid was found to be 12 % in freeze dried and 22 % loss in oven dried nettle leaves.\n\n    Even though oven drying of stinging nettle leaves resulted in a higher loss of beta-carotene and ascorbic acid content compared to freeze drying, a serving of either fresh, freeze dried or oven dried nettle leaves provided more than 20 % of the DV of vitamin A (870 mug per day). Therefore, nettle leaves in all forms can be considered as a \"rich sources\" of vitamin A. In contrast, oven dried nettle leaves found to be a 'good source for vitamin C while fresh and freeze-dried nettle leaves can be considered as \"rich sources\" of vitamin C. This could imply that consumption of fresh or dried nettle leaves might help to reduce vitamin A deficiency, which has been estimated to affect about 2.5 million preschool children in Africa.\n\n    Furthermore, inclusion of beta-carotene-rich food in the daily diets, instead of costly synthetic vitamin A supplementation, may be a more successful strategy for improving vitamin A status of at risk or malnourished populations. Hence, integrating either fresh or dried stinging nettle leaves in the diet or utilization of dried nettle leaves for fortifying cereal-based foods would help address vitamin A and C deficiencies. The high beta-carotene content of fresh and dried stinging nettle leaves could also help to address health related problems due to their antioxidant activity.\n\n    Interestingly, the consumption of stinging nettle leaves could provide a double impact as a provitamin A, protein and vitamin C dietary source, and also as an enhancer of Fe absorption. emphasized that Fe bio-availability in dark green leafy vegetables is influenced by protein, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene and total polyphenols content in the plant tissues. The authors reported that the high content of ascorbic acid and beta-carotene in moringa leaves increased its Fe bio-availability.\n\n    The higher antioxidant activity of nettle leaves compared to spinach may be attributed to its beta-carotene, phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, Mn and Zn. Phenolic compounds, carotenoids and ascorbic acid, Mn and zinc are nutrient antioxidants.\n\n    Additionally, the higher total antioxidant activity and phenols content of nettle leaves compared to spinach leaves found in this study could also be due to variability in genotype and environmental conditions. Although genetic factors are the main determinants for the content of phenolics and antioxidants, these contents can also be affected by light and temperature conditions of the environment.\n\n    Genetic diversity in content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity was also reported in nettle leaves. For example, reported a wide variability in total phenols content (151-1941mg GAE/g DM) and antioxidant activity (ranging from 60.62 to 320.38 mg GAE/g DM) of fresh stinging nettle leaves collected from the Mediterranean, Aegean, Black Sea and Marmara coastal parts in Turkey.\n\n    The higher total phenols content of oven-dried compared to freeze-dried leaves could be linked to more efficient extraction of the insoluble phenolic compounds such as condensed tannins, and phenolic acids bound to cell wall polysaccharides or proteins. Because during oven drying processes phenolic-sugar glycosidic bonds may be cleaved with heat treatment leading to the formation of phenolic aglycons, which react better with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent leading to higher values of total phenolics.\n\n    Similarly, the higher total antioxidant activity in oven-dried nettle leaves compared to fresh and freeze dried leaves could probably be due to: 1) release of antioxidant nutrients by thermal (heating effects of the oven dryer) destruction of cell walls and subcellular compartments; 2) formation of antioxidants by thermal chemical reaction; 3) suppression of the oxidation of antioxidants by thermal inactivation of oxidative enzymes. As an example, the increase in total antioxidant activity after heat treatment could be due to the increased release of phytochemicals, such as lycopene, from the matrix. Various studies reported to that fresh stinging nettle leaves contain phenolic acid (e.g. hydroxycinnamic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid), tannins and flavonoids (e.g. flavones, flavonols, iso-flavonols, anthocyanins, catechins, lignin) using HPLC method. To this end, HPLC method could enable to accurately track the phenolic compounds as well as the changes in total phenol content and antioxidant activity of dried stinging nettle leaves using different parameters of the selected drying techniques.\n\n    The high total phenols content and antioxidant activity in both freeze-dried and oven-dried leaves could present dried nettle leaf powders as good natural antioxidants for application in health-promoting foods and as a food preservative. For example, natural sources of antioxidants are replacing synthetic antioxidants (such as butylated hydroxy anisole, butylated hydroxy toluene, teriary butyl hydroquinone, and propyl gallate) to reduce toxicological and carcinogenic effects. suggested that nettle leaves may not only be a good dietary source but could also be used as a natural antioxidant in the food industry. Applications of the use of extracts from herbs like rosemary and oregano and sage in meat and poultry products have been well demonstrated.\n\n    A voucher specimen of the plant materials used was not included in this research. Given that the focus was on investigating the effect of the drying methods on response variables and not on botanical aspects (such as identification of the taxon and location of the stinging nettle), priority was given to including an external reference sample (spinach). Nonetheless, in future research of this nature, it would be useful to include a stinging nettle voucher specimen if available.",
        "Conclusion": "    Even though, oven drying of nettle leaves results in a higher loss of beta-carotene and ascorbic acid content compared to freeze drying, approximately 90 % and 72 %, respectively, of the nutrients are retained in the oven-dried leaves. In contrast, oven drying increases the total antioxidant activity and phenol content of nettle leaves more than freeze drying does. Overall, fresh stinging nettle leaves can be considered as a rich source of antioxidants, Ca, Mg, vitamins A and C, a good source of Fe and Mn and a source of P and K. Whereas, freeze-dried and oven-dried stinging nettle leaves can be considered as a rich source of antioxidants, Ca, Mg, and vitamin A, while it is a good source of vitamin C, Fe and Mn. These benefits present possible avenues for utilization of dried nettle leaves or leaf powder by the food industry and consumers for addressing micronutrient deficiencies and for providing a healthy diet. Further research should consider more drying methods and/or different parameters of the selected drying techniques and determine/track the change in TPC and antioxidant activity using the HPLC method.\n\n    Tigist T.

        "Title": "    Intravenous branched-chain amino acid administration for the acute treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
        "Abstract": "    Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe complication of acute hepatic failure requiring urgent critical care management. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine have been investigated as potential treatments to improve outcomes in patients with acute HE. However, the effectiveness of BCAA administration during the acute phase remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intravenous BCAA (IV-BCAA) treatment on clinical outcomes in patients with acute HE by systematically reviewing and analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n    We conducted a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ICHUSHI), a Japanese database for medical literature. We included RCTs involving adult patients with acute HE who received IV-BCAA or placebo during the acute phase after admission (< 7 days). Two reviewers independently screened the citations and extracted data. The primary \"critical\" outcomes were mortality from any cause and improvement in disturbance of consciousness. The secondary \"important\" outcome included the incidence of complications such as nausea and diarrhea. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using random effects models with inverse variance weighting.\n\n    Among the 2073 screened records, four met the criteria for quantitative analysis. The analysis included 219 patients: 109 received IV-BCAA, and 110 received placebo. Improvement in the disturbance of consciousness and mortality were not significantly different between the two groups (RR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.66; RR, 0.90; 95% CI 0.70-1.16, respectively). Following IV-BCAA administration, the absolute differences of improvement in the disturbance of consciousness and mortality were 118 more per 1000 (95% CI 18 fewer-300 more) and 55 fewer per 1000 (95% CI 165 fewer-88 more), respectively. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of nausea or diarrhea between the two groups.\n\n    Our meta-analysis demonstrates that all outcomes were not significantly different between IV-BCAA treatment and placebo for acute HE. Further RCTs are required to better understand IV-BCAA treatment potential in patients with HE.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40560-024-00771-x.",
        "Introduction": "    Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome resulting from acute liver failure. It is characterized by symptoms ranging from subtle cognitive impairments to severe alterations in consciousness, significantly impacting quality of life and increasing mortality rates. The pathogenesis of HE involves a combination of metabolic disturbances, including elevated serum ammonia levels, which disrupt neurotransmission and neuronal function.\n\n    The development of HE marks a significant transition in the natural history of cirrhosis. Following a diagnosis of HE, the median survival for persons with cirrhosis is substantially reduced to 2 years, 1 year if over 65 years old. HE occurs in as many as 40% of patients with cirrhosis. Thus, cirrhosis was associated with 2.4% of global deaths.\n\n    Amino acids, particularly branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine, have been investigated for their potential therapeutic benefits in the management of HE. BCAAs are essential amino acids that are metabolized primarily in the muscles and influence brain function and neurochemistry. The role of BCAAs in HE management stems from the hypothesis that BCAAs can provide neuroprotective effects and counteract some of the adverse effects of elevated ammonia levels. An imbalance between BCAAs and aromatic amino acids (AAAs) is thought to contribute to the neurotoxic effects of HE. Thus, BCAAs may help restore balance by competing with AAAs for transport across the blood-brain barrier, potentially reducing the neurotoxic impact of AAAs.\n\n    Several studies have explored the efficacy of BCAA supplementation in improving HE symptoms, particularly cognitive function and overall clinical outcomes. Compared with placebo or no intervention, oral BCAA supplementation in the chronic phase is more effective in treating overt HE. However, evidence for this treatment in the acute resuscitative phase of HE with intravenous administration of BCAA (IV-BCAA) is lacking.\n\n    This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the existing evidence on the effectiveness of IV-BCAA administration for resuscitative acute HE treatment. By synthesizing data from multiple studies, we sought to determine whether IV-BCAA administration improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute HE, identifying potential benefits or limitations associated with this therapeutic approach.",
        "Methods": "    We organized a systematic review team in the Japan Resuscitation Council (JRC) Neuroresuscitation Task Force. The JRC 2025 Neuroresuscitation Task Force and the Guidelines Editorial Committee were established in 2024 and organized by the Japan Society of Neuroemergencies and Critical Care, the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the Japan Society of Neurosurgical Emergency, and the Japanese Society of Neurological Therapeutics. The JRC Neuroresuscitation Task Force established six clinically relevant questions and performed a systematic review.\n\n    The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards. This study was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry, the largest clinical trial registry in Japan (UMIN000054559).\n\n    P (patients): All adults (>= 18 years old) with HE.\n\n    I (interventions): Initial administration of IV-BCAA during the in-hospital acute phase (< 7 days or in the acute hospitalized phase, not in outpatient clinics). The doses of BCAA used were not limited.\n\n    C (comparisons, controls): Placebo or non-intervention.\n\n    O (outcomes): Primary, \"critical\" outcome was mortality from any cause and improvement in consciousness. Secondary, \"important\" outcomes were nausea and diarrhea, which are common side effects.\n\n    S (study design): Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n    T (timeframe): All published literature up to June 4, 2024.\n\n    Based on the discussion in the JRC Neuroresuscitation Task Force, the population intervention comparator outcome study design and timeframe to guide a systematic review search was set as follows:\n\n    We identified RCTs investigating the effects of IV-BCAA in patients with acute HE by searching PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ICHUSHI) web up till June 4, 2024. ICHUSHI web is the largest database of Japanese medical journals, containing approximately 10 million manuscripts from 6,000 journals.\n\n    We included studies that fulfilled the following criteria: (1) RCT, (2) full-text publications in English or Japanese, (3) included adult patients with acute, worsened HE, (4) included comparisons between IV-BCAA and placebo or non-intervention, and (5) initial administration of IV-BCAA during the acute phase (within 7 days after admission). The dose of administration and components of BCAA were not limited; however, the method of administration was limited to transvenous infusion because of the limitations of the acute resuscitation phase.\n\n    Two reviewers (TY and SY) independently extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of eligible studies. They reached a consensus on literature selection, resolving disagreements through discussion. Data extracted from each study included the first author's name, year of publication, number of study sites, number of patients, patient age, proportion of males, definition of HE, precipitating factors (infection, GI bleeding, and alcohol abuse), initial serum ammonia, administration of BCAA, dose of BCAA, and other treatments. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment tool, which assesses the randomization process, derivations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result. The two reviewers reached a consensus on RoB 2, and any discrepancy in judgment was resolved through discussion.\n\n    The grade of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach was also used to evaluate the certainty of the available evidence, such as inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. We provided an evidence profile table using the GRADE pro GDT (GRADEpro GDT: GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool [Software]) and McMaster University, 2015 (developed by Evidence Prime Inc.). The table is available at gradepro.org. To apply the GRADE system, we received guidance from the Medical Information Network Distribution Service (MINDS), a Japanese center for GRADE education. The two reviewers also discussed the results of the RoB and reached a consensus on the final decision.\n\n    According to the GRADE approach, the JRC neuroresuscitation task force determines the importance of each outcome as critical, important, or not important. We defined critical outcomes as hospital mortality and improvements in disturbance of consciousness, and important outcomes as common side effects such as nausea and diarrhea.\n\n    We performed the meta-analysis using Review Manager (version 5.3, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Comparative risk ratios (RRs) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We selected a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was determined by assessing values that were interpreted as follows: 0-40%, not important; 30-60%, moderate heterogeneity; 50-90%, substantial heterogeneity; and 75-100%, considerable heterogeneity.\n\n    Not applicable.\n\n    This manuscript has not been published or presented elsewhere in part or in entirety and is not under consideration by another journal.

        "Results": "    A total of 2469 studies were identified using the database search. After removing 396 duplicate studies, 2073 studies were eligible for the first screening. Based on the assessment of title and abstract, 2064 study records were excluded, and nine full-text articles were included for the second assessment as the full-text article assessment. After assessing the eligibility of the records, five reports were excluded for the following reasons; two studies were excluded because of different patient populations, one study was excluded because of different languages, one study was excluded because it was a conference abstract, and one study was excluded because of duplication. Thus, four RCTs were ultimately included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1). The search formulae and results are listed in Additional file 1.\n\n    The characteristics of studies included in this meta-analysis are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 219 patients selected from four RCTs were assigned to the IV-BCAA treatment group (n = 109) or placebo group (n = 110) for critical outcome analysis. Each study included 34-70 patients, with average age ranging from 45.3 to 58.9 years. The proportion of males was 56.0-88.6%. The largest RCT population was an open-label RCT published in 2023. Three studies were multicenter RCTs. In all studies, BCAA was administered intravenously. The most common precipitating factor was gastrointestinal bleeding (27.9%; n = 61).\n\n    Improvement in the disturbance of consciousness was evaluated in all four RCTs (Fig. 2a). The evidence profiles are shown in Table 2. This set of four RCTs had less publication bias with a symmetric distribution in the funnel plot (Additional file 2a). The forest plot of one of the critical outcomes, improvement in the disturbance of consciousness, is shown in Fig. 2a. During the observation period, 59 patients (57.8%) in the BCAA-treated group and 45 patients (45.5%) in the placebo group recovered their mental status. Although this difference did not reach significance (RR, 1.26 [95% CI 0.96-1.66], P = 0.09; Fig. 2a), the absolute differences in improvement in the disturbance of consciousness were 118 more per 1000 (95% CI 18 fewer-300 more) as a result of BCAA administration.\n\n    Mortality from any cause was evaluated in three RCTs (Fig. 2b). The evidence profiles are presented in Table 2. This set of three RCTs had less publication bias with a symmetric distribution in the funnel plot (Additional file 2b). During the observation period, 46 patients (50.0%) died in the IV-BCAA-treated group, and 51 patients (54.8%) died in the placebo group. Although this difference did not reach significance (RR, 0.90 [95% CI 0.70-1.16], p = 0.42), the absolute differences in mortality were 55 fewer per 1000 (95% CI 165 fewer-88 more) as a result of IV-BCAA administration.\n\n    The incidence rates of the adverse effects of IV-BCAA treatment, nausea, and diarrhea were determined for each RCT (Fig. 2c, d). With respect to nausea, three (8.6%) of the 35 patients who received BCAAs experienced nausea, and the same number (8.6%) of patients in the placebo group experienced nausea. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of nausea between the BCAA and placebo groups (RR, 1.00; 95% CI [0.22-4.62]; P = 1.00) (Fig. 2c).\n\n    Regarding the incidence of diarrhea, it occurred in four (11.4%) patients in the IV-BCAA group and five (14.3%) patients in the placebo group. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of nausea between the BCAA and placebo groups (RR, 0.80; 95% CI [0.23-2.73]; P = 0.72). (Fig. 2d). As a result of BCAA administration, the absolute differences in nausea and diarrhea were 0 fewer per 1000 (95% CI 67 fewer-310 more) and 29 fewer per 1000 (95% CI 110 fewer-427 more), respectively.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our meta-analysis demonstrates that all outcomes were not significantly different between IV-BCAA treatment and placebo for acute HE. However, improvements in the disturbance of consciousness in the IV-BCAA group tended to be higher. These findings highlight the need for further RCTs to better understand the potential benefits of IV-BCAA treatment in this population.",
        "Discussion": "    In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to clarify the efficacy of IV-BCAA administration compared to placebo in patients with acute HE. Several systematic reviews of BCAA treatment in HE patients have been published. However, in these meta-analyses, most RCTs did not mention acute HE, which requires urgent care and intravenous administration in the emergency room or intensive care unit. Therefore, this study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing IV-BCAA treatment and placebo in acute-phase HE care.\n\n    Our meta-analysis demonstrates that all outcomes were not significantly different between IV-BCAA treatment and placebo for acute HE. Therefore, the benefit of IV-BCAAs remains unclear. However, our meta-analysis indicated the possibility that IV-BCAA treatment might have potential benefits in this population because improvements in the disturbance of consciousness in the IV-BCAA group tended to be higher.\n\n    BCAAs, including leucine, isoleucine, and valine, play various roles in the body, which include supporting protein synthesis and energy production. With regard to the pathophysiology of HE, BCAAs play a crucial role in ammonia metabolism. In patients with liver disease, the protein breakdown in muscles leads to an increase in ammonia levels. BCAAs can provide an alternative nitrogen source that is converted into glutamine in muscles, thereby reducing the level of toxic ammonia in the blood.\n\n    In HE, there is often an imbalance between neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly a decrease in excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and an increase in inhibitory neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid. BCAAs can also help restore this balance by serving as precursors of excitatory neurotransmitters, potentially improving cognitive function. Additionally, patients with liver disease are often malnourished, and BCAAs are important for maintaining muscle mass and overall nutritional status. Several clinical studies have shown that oral BCAA supplementation can improve mental health and reduce the severity of HE symptoms via the above pathophysiological mechanisms. However, the benefits are often modest, and BCAAs are usually part of a broader treatment plan rather than a standalone solution. BCAA supplementation is often used as an adjunct therapy in the management of chronic phase HE, particularly in patients who are unresponsive to standard treatments such as lactulose or rifaximin. Thus, BCAA administration is usually transoral during the chronic phase of HE management. Recent guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend routine oral BCAA treatment for patients with overt HE. However, the effect of IV-BCAA on episodic bouts of HE has not been proven.\n\n    Our findings support the safety of IV-BCAA in clinical practice because of the equal incidence of side effects in the IV-BCAA and placebo groups. However, we found only one RCT that mentioned side effects (nausea and diarrhea). Generally, the adverse effects of BCAA treatment are listed as hypoglycemia, nausea, and diarrhea.\n\n    Indeed, prophylactic glucose administration may be applied; however, the incidence of these adverse effects is still not well understood.\n\n    Moreover, we could not find sufficient evidence to evaluate the benefit of IV-BCAA compared with other interventions because improvements in the disturbance of consciousness and mortality were not significantly different between the two groups.\n\n    We also could not discuss the cost-effectiveness of the interventions for the management of HE because all four RCTs did not evaluate it. An economic study revealed that the total cost related to HE in the United States increased from USD 4676.7 million in 2005 to USD 7244.7 million in 2009. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the cost-effectiveness of IV-BCAA treatment for HE from the standpoint of medical economics, benefits, and harm.\n\n    This meta-analysis has some limitations. First, only four RCTs were included in our systematic review, with limited information on a small number of patients because of the inclusion criteria of patients who received IV-BCAAs in emergency care. Second, the severity of HE differed across the four RCTs; that is, the definition of the inclusion of patients with HE may have differed across the RCTs. Thus, the features of the targeted patients may have been heterogeneous in our meta-analysis. Finally, the underlying conditions that precipitated HE varied, as shown in Table 1. However, we could not perform a subgroup analysis based on these underlying conditions because the four RCTs did not provide data for each of these subgroups. Therefore, the balance between the risks and benefits of IV-BCAA might differ depending on the underlying conditions that precipitate HE. Well-designed RCTs are needed in the future to determine the indications for IV-BCAA in acute HE care and support our findings.",

        "Title": "    A bi-kinase module sensitizes and potentiates plant immune signaling",
        "Abstract": "    Systemic signaling is an essential hallmark of multicellular life. Pathogen encounter occurs locally but triggers organ-scale and organismic immune responses. In plants, elicitor perception provokes systemically expanding Ca2+ and H2O2 signals conferring immunity. Here, we identify a Ca2+ sensing bi-kinase module as becoming super-activated through mutual phosphorylation and as imposing synergistically enhanced NADPH oxidase activation. A combined two-layer bi-kinase/substrate phospho-code allows for sensitized signaling initiation already by near-resting elevations of Ca2+ concentration. Subsequently, it facilitates further signal wave proliferation with minimal Ca2+ amplitude requirement, triggering protective defense responses throughout the plant. Our study reveals how plants build and perpetuate trans-cellular immune signal proliferation while avoiding disturbance of ongoing cellular signaling along the path of response dissemination.\n\n    Mutual activation of a Ca2+ sensing bi-kinase module potentiates NADPH oxidase activation to facilitate systemic immunity.",
        "Introduction": "    Initial to any immune response is pathogen perception by specifically committed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Elicitor sensing in the primary infected cells prompts auto- and transphosphorylation of involved receptor kinase (RK) and receptor-like protein (RLP) complexes that subsequently trigger local and systemically spreading Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals, of which the latter can be produced through activation of NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases (NOXs). NOX-dependent physiological generation of ROS for manifestation of systemic innate immunity is highly conserved across virtually all multicellular life. However, how distal cell-to-cell/trans-cellular propagation of these second messenger signals is perpetuated in the absence of elicitor stimulation remains largely enigmatic.\n\n    In plants, perception of molecular patterns by plasma membrane (PM)-localized PRRs induces responses termed pattern triggered immunity (PTI). In Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter Arabidopsis), perception of the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 through the RK FLS2 and its coreceptor BAK1 leads to phosphorylation and activation of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) BIK1. BIK1 functions in initiating subsequent Ca2+ and ROS signals. BIK1 and the Ca2+-activated kinase CPK5 directly phosphorylate the NOX RBOHD, thereby triggering apoplastic formation of superoxide (O2-) and consequently H2O2. Accordingly, rbohd, bik1, and cpk5 mutants exhibit compromised local and, as consequence, impaired systemic immune responses. Ca2+ signals are directly decoded through Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) and through a network of calcineurin B-like (CBL) Ca2+ sensor proteins and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) into downstream responses. Moreover, calmodulins (CAMs) and CAM-like proteins contribute to the deciphering of Ca2+ signals in plants. CBL/CIPK complexes regulate a multitude of crucial transcription factors, ion channels, and transporters and also activate the NOXs RBOHC and RBOHF. However, if and how CBL/CIPK Ca2+ signal sensors/decoders also function in systemic immunity signaling remain to be addressed.",
        "Methods": "    A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as WT, and T-DNA insertion lines cipk26-2 (GK-703D04), cipk26-3 (SALK_005859C), and cpk5 (SAIL_657_C06) were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre (http://arabidopsis.info). cipk26-2 (GK-703D04) and cipk26-3 as well as cbl1/9 were described earlier. rbohd (SALK JP65_4B03L) was obtained from J. Schroeder. cipk26/cpk5 double mutants were generated by crossing of cipk26-2 and cpk5. For Ca2+ analysis, plant lines were transformed by the floral-dip method with Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) harboring the plasmid pGGZ003-UBI10-R-GECO1-GSL-mTurquoise.\n\n    A. thaliana Col-0 WT and derived transgenic overexpressing and mutant plants were grown on soil with 8-hour light/16-hour dark cycle, 23 C, and 60% relative humidity. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown on soil in a greenhouse with 16-hour light/8-hour dark cycle.\n\n    Bacterial pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 was grown in King's B medium at 28 C overnight. For measuring bacterial growth, Arabidopsis leaves of 6-week-old plants were infiltrated with Pst DC3000 at 104 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml in 10 mM MgCl2 using a needleless syringe. Three days after inoculation, bacterial growth was monitored by serial dilution plating of ground leaf discs.\n\n    ROS production was monitored using a luminol-based assay. Flagellin-dependent oxidative burst in A. thaliana was conducted with 6-week-old plants grown under short day conditions. Leaf discs (0.3 cm) were floated overnight on 100 mul of H2O in a 96-well plate, and luminescence was recorded using a Berthold Tristar LB941 plate reader.\n\n    To analyze transcript levels, RNA was extracted from leaf tissue using the TRIzol method. RNA (2 mug) was treated with ribonuclease (RNase)-free deoxyribonuclease (DNase) (Fermentas) and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript III SuperMix (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed in a final volume of 10 mul according to the instructions of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using the CFX96 system (Bio-Rad). Amplification specificity was evaluated by post-amplification dissociation curves. ACTIN2 (At3g18780) was used as the internal control for quantification of gene expression.\n\n    For the analysis of Ca2+ signals evoked by flg22 in leaves, Arabidopsis plants were germinated on MS solid medium and transferred to soil ~1 week after germination and grown under long-day conditions. True leaves of ~1-cm length were cut off and incubated for 24 hours under constant light in incubation buffer (10 mM MES, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH adjusted to 5.8 with tris). Subsequently, leaves were mounted upside down on a microscope slide. At the petiole, a twofold barrier consisting of 1% low melting point agarose and a second layer of plasticine was created to separate the leaf blade from the petiole (see Fig. 4B). The purpose of this barrier is to prevent direct contact of the elicitor to the leaf blade. Finally, the sample was covered with a coverslide. After this mounting procedure, samples were again incubated for at least 6 hours under continuous light.\n\n    For R-GECO1-mTurquoise-based in vivo Ca2+ imaging, an inverted ZEISS Axio observer microscope was used (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Goettingen, Germany), which was equipped with a xenon short arc reflector lamp (Hamamatsu), a Zeiss EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 5x/0.16 dry objective, an ET436-20x T455lp ET480-40m filter set for mTurquoise, an ET560-40x T585lpxr ET630-75m filter set for R-GECO1, and a Retiga R6 camera, and operated by Visiview software (Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany).\n\n    An exposure time of 400 ms was used for both R-GECO1 and mTurquoise image acquisition with binning 2. Four areas of the leaves were consecutively analyzed every 10 s to cover most of the leaf area. After measurements for 20 cycles of 10 s each, 10 mul of a 4 muM flg22 solution was pipetted to the petiole. Ca2+ measurements were then proceeded for 30 min. For each measurement, after application of a Gaussian blur to each image, ratio images of the four leaf areas were combined to ratio stacks, and finally, the four ratio stacks were combined to a single stack using ImageJ. To determine the speed of the Ca2+ waves, ROIs with approximate size of an epidermal cell were defined in the proximity to the leaf's middle vein in each of the four leave areas (covering the length of the leave). The arrival of the Ca2+ wave manifested as a maximum in the R-GECO1-mTurquoise ratio. Through determination of the distance between individual ROIs and the time difference between the ratio maxima, the speed of the waves was calculated.\n\n    For the kymograms presented in fig. S4, 180-pixel-long (316-mum) line type ROIs were defined in the first and third quarter of the leaves in proximity of the midvein. Kymograms were generated using the Multi Kymograph function of ImageJ. The resulting kymograms were exported as text images, and the ratio of each pixel at each time point was normalized to the pixel's mean intensity before application of the flg22 stimulus. The resulting normalized kymograms were reimported into ImageJ, and the false color code was unified for all kymograms to allow comparison of ratio changes between the genotypes.\n\n    For transient expression in 5- to 6-week-old N. benthamiana epidermal cells, A. tumefaciens GV3101 (pMP90) carrying BiFC constructs were co-infiltrated with the p19 strain into leaves as described previously. The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) C-terminal fragment SPYCE(M) was fused to the N terminus of RBOHD, and the N-terminal YFP fragment SPYNE(R)173 was fused to the N termini of all 26 Arabidopsis CIPKs. Microscopic analyses of lower epidermal cells were conducted at 3 days after infiltration. An inverted fluorescence microscope, Leica DMI6000B, equipped with a Leica N Plan L 20x/0.4 CORR PH1 objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and a Hamamatsu Orca camera (model C4742-80-12AG, Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) and a YFP filter set, which was operated with Openlab 5.0.2 software (Improvision, Coventry, UK), was used for BiFC quantification at lower magnification. For subcellular localization studies at higher magnification, an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope, Leica DMI6000, equipped with a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal laser scanning device (Leica Microsystems) and a 63x/1.2 water immersion objective (HCX PL APO lambda blue 63.0 x 1.20 Water UV) was used.\n\n    For protein purification, the coding sequences (CDS) of the substrate proteins RBOHD N terminus (amino acids 1 to 372), the inactive CPK5D221A variant, and the inactive CIPK26K42N were fused with an N-terminal 2xStrepII-GST tag, and the CDS of active CPK5 was fused with an N-terminal 2xStrepII tag in the pET-24b vector (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The CDS of active CIPK26 was fused with an N-terminal 2xStrepII tag in the pIVEX-1.3WG vector (Biotechrabbit, Berlin, Germany). CIPK26 was expressed using the cell-free wheat germ RTS 500 system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biotechrabbit, Berlin, Germany). Active CPK5 and substrate proteins were induced and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) overnight at 18 C after induction with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cell pellets were harvested, solubilized using a French press (Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3; ATA Scientific, Taren Point, Australia), and subsequently purified using Strep-Tactin-Macroprep (IBA Lifesciences, Germany). For the preparation of the 2xStrepII-GST-RBOHD-Nt protein, after mechanical cell disruption using the French press, proteins were solubilized from inclusion bodies using 8 M urea. StrepII-tagged proteins were purified using Strep-Tactin MacroPrep (IBA Lifesciences, Gottingen, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    Purified proteins (50 ng of CPK5 and 200 ng of CIPK26, and 2000 ng of RBOHDs, 2000 ng of GST, 2000 ng of CIPK26K42N, 2000 ng of CPK5D221A) were mixed in reaction buffer [0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MnSO4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 muM adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and 4 muCi of [gamma-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol-1)]. Reactions were incubated at 30 C for 30 min, stopped by addition of 6 mul of 5x SDS-loading buffer [125 mM tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% (v/v) glycerin, 1% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (v/v) beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue], and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Protein bands were fixed by Coomassie staining, and gamma-32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography.\n\n    Vectors and methods for HEK293T cell transfection used in this study have been previously described. The coding sequence of RBOHD was amplified by PCR and integrated into the pEF1-2xStrepII-N vector and the pGGHEK vector. HEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA) until reaching about 40% confluency. Transfection with plasmids carrying the coding sequences of the indicated proteins was performed using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Forty-eight hours after transfection, ROS measurements were conducted as previously described. In brief, cells were subjected to a buffer containing horseradish peroxidase and L-012. Ionomycin was added to induce Ca2+ influx into the cells. ROS production was detected through luminescence measurements using either a Mithras2 LB943 (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) or a Tecan SPARK (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) plate reader.\n\n    HEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA) until reaching about 80% confluency. Before the measurement, the medium was aspirated from the cells and replaced with the Fura-2-loading solution [5 muM Fura-2-AM and 0.15% Pluronic F127 (Invitrogen, Waltham, USA) dissolved in DMEM/Ham's F-12 with 10% FBS]. After 1 hour of incubation at 37 C at 5% CO2, the loading solution and cells were washed with HBSS-Ca2+, -Mg2+ (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA). Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) with indicated Ca2+ concentrations was added to the wells. Fura-2 fluorescence was measured with a Tecan Safire-2 plate reader (Tecan, Mannerdorf, Switzerland). For the determination of absolute Ca2+ concentrations, Fura-2 fluorescence was calibrated with defined Ca2+ buffers generated with the Ca2+ Calibration Kit #1 (Invitrogen, Waltham, USA).\n\n    HEK293T cells were cultivated in individual T-75 flasks (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany). At 30 to 50% confluency, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the respective heterologous proteins using the GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After 48 hours of incubation at 37 C at 5% CO2, the medium was aspirated, cells were washed with HBSS-Ca2+, -Mg2+ (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA). After 5 min of incubation in HBSS supplemented with 0.125 mM CaCl2, 1 muM ionomycin was added to induce Ca2+ influx. After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer was added, and cells were collected using a cell scraper. After one wash step in ice-cold PBS, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated, and cell pellets were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C until further protein purification.\n\n    Proteins were extracted from cell pellets, and further sample processing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data acquisition were performed as described previously. Briefly, proteins were extracted and digested using a modified filter-assisted sample preparation protocol. After reduction and alkylation, proteins were digested using trypsin. For total proteome analysis, 10 mug of each sample was put aside and analyzed without further processing. For phosphopeptide enrichment, 500 mug of peptides was enriched on titanium dioxide (TiO2). LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by using an EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Separation of peptides was performed on 20-cm frit-less silica emitters (New Objective, 0.75 mum inner diameter), packed in-house with reversed-phase ReproSil-Pur C18 AQ 1.9 mum resin (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The column was constantly kept at 50 C. Peptides were eluted in 115 min applying a segmented linear gradient of 0% to 98% solvent B (solvent A: 0% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% formic acid (FA); solvent B: 80% ACN, 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Mass spectra were acquired in data-dependent acquisition mode according to a TOP15 method. MS spectra were collected by the Orbitrap analyzer with a mass range of 300 to 1759 mass/charge ratio (m/z) at a resolution of 60,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM), maximum injection time (IT) of 55 ms, and a target value of 3 x 106 ions. Precursors were selected with an isolation window of 1.3 m/z, and higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation was performed at a normalized collision energy of 25. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a target value of 105 ions at a resolution of 15,000 FWHM, maximum injection time of 55 ms, and a fixed first mass of m/z 100. Peptides with a charge of +1, >6, or with unassigned charge state were excluded from fragmentation for MS2, and dynamic exclusion for 30 s prevented repeated selection of precursors.\n\n    Processing of raw data was performed using the MaxQuant software version 1.6.17.0. MS/MS spectra were assigned to the UniProt Homo sapiens reference proteome supplemented with the sequences of the kinases used for transfection. During the search, sequences of 248 common contaminant proteins as well as decoy sequences were automatically added. Trypsin specificity was required, and a maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as fixed, and oxidation of methionine, deamidation, and protein N-terminal acetylation was set as variable modifications. A false discovery rate of 1% for peptide spectrum matches and proteins was applied. Match between runs and requantify options were enabled.",
        "Results": "    We pursued a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)-based interaction screen, combining all 26 CIPKs from Arabidopsis with RBOHD, and identified CIPK26 as most strongly interacting with RBOHD (Fig. 1A). Kinase-RBOHD interaction occurred at the PM, and active CIPK26 displayed stronger interaction than a kinase-inactive variant (Fig. 1B). Recombinant CIPK26 phosphorylated the N-terminal domain of RBOHD with similar efficiency as the known CIPK26 substrate RBOHF (Fig. 1C). To address if and how CIPK26 regulates RBOHD activity in a cellular context, we used reconstitution of the plant Ca2+ signaling/ROS generation module in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (Fig. 1D). While expression of RBOHD alone only allowed for minor ROS production, coexpression of CBL1/CIPK26 with RBOHD conferred readily detectable ROS production already at basal Ca2+ concentration, which was fivefold enhanced upon elicitation of Ca2+ signals. Moreover, CIPK2 and CIPK23, which also displayed considerable interaction in BiFC assays, but not CIPK22 and CIPK16, which displayed roughly half BiFC signal intensity with RBOHD, could activate RBOHD in HEK293T cells. Also, the most closely related kinase CIPK3, which only weakly interacted in BiFC assays, did not evoke RBOHD activation (fig. S1). RBOHD activation strictly depended on kinase activity and the presence of both the CBL1 Ca2+ sensor and the kinase. Moreover, impairing Ca2+ binding of CBL1 by mutating critical EF-hands or abrogating CBL1/CIPK26 PM targeting by mutating the CBL1 myristoylation motif attenuated ROS production back to levels observed by expression of RBOHD alone. Also, the Ca2+ sensor CBL9, which is closely related to CBL1, could in combination with CIPK26 provoke RBOHD activation, although to a much lesser extent than CBL1 (Fig. 1E and fig. S1). Together, these data identify CBL1/CIPK26 as a Ca2+ sensor/kinase module that can bring about Ca2+-dependent ROS generation through RBOHD activation.\n\n    Currently, the reasons for the coexistence of the two distinct Ca2+-decoding kinase networks, the CBL/CIPK system and the CPKs, remain enigmatic. The identification of CPK5 and CIPK26 as kinases phosphorylating RBOHD enabled us to investigate the functional interrelation of these two kinase classes. Coexpression of CPK5 with RBOHD in HEK293T cells revealed a similar degree of Ca2+-dependent RBOHD activation as conferred by CBL1/CIPK26 (Fig. 2A).\n\n    We next sought to assess the individual roles of both kinases in RBOHD activation and to quantitatively dissect their Ca2+ dependence. To this end, we devised a synthetic cellular Ca2+ signaling reconstitution system that allowed for quantitatively controlling the amplitude of Ca2+ signals and thereby for faithful parameter control of regulatory circuits in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). While ionomycin application at external Ca2+ concentrations of 0.125 mM triggered moderate cellular Ca2+ signals of ~150 nM (+-15) (moderate Ca2+, MCa2+), external Ca2+ concentrations of 1 mM elicited intracellular Ca2+ signals with an amplitude of 630 nM (+-60) (high Ca2+, HCa2+) (Fig. 2C). Application of this protocol to cells either expressing RBOHD alone or RBOHD combined with CBL1/CIPK26 or CPK5 uncovered a clear correlation between cellular Ca2+ concentration and resulting H2O2 production indicative for RBOHD activity (Fig. 2). For both CPK5 and CBL1/CIPK26, when expressed individually with RBOHD, we observed that stepwise increases in Ca2+ concentration incrementally increased RBOHD activity to comparable extent (Fig. 2D). While MCa2+ triggered a two to three times increase in H2O2 generation either with CBL1-CIPK26 or with CPK5, HCa2+ caused a drastically enhanced H2O2 production more than 15-fold higher compared to resting Ca2+ concentration (RCa2+, 87 nM). We next elucidated the combined effect of CBL/CIPK- and CPK-mediated regulation on RBOHD activity by simultaneously coexpressing RBOHD with CBL1/CIPK26 and CPK5 (Fig. 2D and fig. S2). HCa2+ triggered a notably enhanced ROS production that was doubled compared to activation by either CBL1/CIPK26 or CPK5 alone. Most remarkably, already at MCa2+, the combined function of both kinases caused eightfold increased RBOHD activity indicated by ROS production to a level that the individual kinases could not evoke even under HCa2+ conditions. This synergistic activation was not a consequence of increased quantity, since duplication of the amount of individually transfected kinases did not evoke such a marked activation of RBOHD (fig. S2). Collectively, these findings uncover a marked synergistic effect of combined CPK and CBL/CIPK function on the activity of RBOHD. Moreover, these results imply simultaneous sensitization to Ca2+ concentration as well as potentiation of phosphorylation-mediated RBOHD activation. Potential mechanisms could involve synergistic interdependences between the impact of Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands of CBL1, CPK5, and RBOHD (providing a combinatory Ca2+ code) and, on the other hand, enhanced phosphorylation efficiency of p-sites in RBOHD and/or in CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5 (providing a complementary phospho-code).\n\n    To address the physiological relevance of CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5-dependent RBOHD activation in immunity, we isolated the respective mutants and characterized their PTI responses and pathogen resistance. Scoring of Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 proliferation 3 days after infiltration indicated similarly increased bacteria abundance in cipk26 and cpk5 leaves and revealed substantially further enhanced bacterial proliferation in leaves of cipk26/cpk5 (Fig. 3A). Compared to wild type (WT), flg22 application evoked a clearly reduced ROS accumulation in directly exposed leaf discs of cpk5 as well as of two independent cipk26 alleles (Fig. 3B and fig. S3). This local immune response was not further reduced in cipk26/cpk5, but fully abolished in rbohD. Flg22 application triggers induction of the marker gene NHL10 locally, but also in distal leaves that have not experienced direct elicitor exposure. We found that local NHL10 up-regulation in flg22-challenged leaves was not impaired in cipk26 but substantially reduced in cipk26/cpk5 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, these analyses confirmed the reported contribution of CPK5 to local NHL10 induction. In stark difference, loss of CIPK26 notably reduced NHL10 up-regulation in distal leaves, and in cipk26/cpk5, this response was almost abolished. Collectively, these in planta investigations reveal an important individual role of CPK5 and CIPK26 in pathogen resistance and establish the indispensable requirement of their combined function for systemic immune signaling.\n\n    We next sought to use the flg22-triggered systemic Ca2+ wave as a proxy to illuminate the role of Ca2+/phosphorylation-mediated RBOH activation in systemic signaling. To this end, we devised a systemic bioimaging assay for whole detached leaves based on flg22 application onto petioles and Ca2+ reporter-based monitoring of the resulting Ca2+ waves throughout the leaf blade (Fig. 3D). In WT, application of flg22 induced a Ca2+ wave initiating from the leaf basis, subsequently expanding to the whole width of the leaf, and forming a front that traveled toward the leaf tip (Fig. 3, E and F, and movie S1). The amplitude (signal intensity) of this wave was reproducibly clearly less pronounced than that of recently described Ca2+ waves, e.g., in response to NaCl stress. We determined a speed of 21 +- 5 (mum/s) (averaged over the length of the leaf) for systemic Ca2+ signal propagation through epidermal cells in WT (Fig. 3F). The speed of this organ-scale flg22 response is substantially slower compared to 200 to 1000 mum/s that have been determined for systemic electrical, ROS, or Ca2+ signals propagating through vascular bundles in response to other stimuli. Therefore, this value likely defines the cell-to-cell transcellular propagation velocity of elicitor-triggered Ca2+/ROS signals. By increasing the resolution of our analysis and focusing comparatively on individual regions of interest (ROIs) in the basal as well as in a distal position of the leave, we noticed that the intensity and velocity of this systemic signal steadily decreased with distance (fig. S4). In rbohd, wave formation and propagation was hardly detectable, corroborating the essential role of this NOX in cell-to-cell communication (Fig. 3G). Accordingly, Ca2+ signal intensity was close to the detection limit in both basal and distal regions (fig. S4). In individual mutants of CPK5, CIPK26, or CBL1/9 (the two Ca2+ sensors that activate CIPK26), the speed of the mobile Ca2+ signal was substantially reduced (Fig. 3G). Notably, impairment of CIPK-mediated phosphorylation exerted a stronger effect than compromised CPK phosphorylation. Strikingly, in cpk5/cipk26, systemic Ca2+ signal propagation was similarly collapsed as in rbohd. Also, the signal amplitude of the propagating Ca2+ signal was differentially affected in the different mutants (fig. S4). While cipk26 and cpk5 displayed strongly reduced but clearly discernible Ca2+ signals in basal ROIs, their intensity was further dramatically diminished in cipk26/cpk5. Notably, the decline of signal speed and amplitude, when comparing these parameters in basal and distal regions of the leaves, was shared with all genotypes and correlated with their Ca2+ signal speed/intensity in the respective basal ROI. Collectively, these findings uncover an absolute requirement of Ca2+-dependent RBOHD phosphorylation for effective systemic Ca2+ signal formation and propagation. Moreover, since CPK and CBL/CIPK activity toward RBOHD are strictly Ca2+ dependent, we also conclude that this mobile Ca2+ signal is essential for forming the elicitor-triggered ROS wave and for evoking distal transcriptional responses like NHL10 induction.\n\n    To dissect the mechanistic principles underlying the sensitized and potentiated activation of RBOHD, we combined control of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration with mass spectrometric phosphorylation site identification and quantitation. To cover the conditions of sensitized hyperactivation of RBOHD, HEK293T cells expressing RBOHD alone, RBOHD combined with individual CPK5 or CBL1/CIPK26 or BIK1, or RBOHD together with CBL1/CIPK26 and CPK5 were ionomycin-treated to evoke MCa2+ cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals (150 nM). Then, total protein was extracted and subjected to phospho-proteomic analysis. This approach identified seven serine and one threonine in RBOHD located on six distinct peptides (hereafter \"p-sites\") as being principally phosphorylated upon kinase exposure (Fig. 4A and table S1). One p-site was almost exclusively targeted by BIK1 (Ser39), while the other p-sites were targeted by all three kinases to varying degree. Quantitative evaluation of the phosphorylation profile defined three distinct target site groups: (i) preferentially BIK1-addressed p-sites (Ca2+-independent: Ser39; Ser339), (ii) preferentially CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5-addressed p-sites (Ca2+-dependent: Ser8; Ser162/163; Ser692), and (iii) p-sites concurrently targeted by BIK1 as well as CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5 (Ser343/347). To address the functional relevance of Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation, we elucidated the activatability of RBOHDSer8/162/163/692A by CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5. Notably, in both MCa2+ and HCa2+ conditions, H2O2 production conferred by RBOHDSer8/162/163/692A was dramatically reduced to less than half of that of RBOHD (Fig. 4B). In contrast, this mutant version of RBOHD was not impaired in BIK1-mediated activation, thereby establishing the independent relevance of Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation for RBOHD activity modulation (Fig. 4B). Somewhat unexpectedly, mutation of BIK1-specific residues (RBOHDS39/339A) did not affect RBOHD activatability by BIK1 or CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5, revealing that modification (or modification-preventing mutation) of these p-sites is dispensable for RBOHD activity modulation (Fig. 4C). We discovered a surprising complex ROS generation pattern when analyzing the impact of the shared p-sites (RBOHDS343/347A). When RBOHDS343/347A was combined with CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5, ROS production at HCa2+ (630 nM) was reduced by about 40% to a level produced by nonmutated RBOHD at MCa2+ (150 nM). Even more strikingly, at MCa2+, RBOHDS343/347A produced only as much H2O2 as RBOHD alone (without any kinase) would produce at HCa2+ (Fig. 4D). This identifies Ser343/347 as mechanistic switch essential for allowing sensitized activation by Ca2+-dependent kinases at moderate Ca2+ signal intensity. Also, nonphosphorylatability of Ser343/347 rendered activation of RBOHD by BIK1 Ca2+ sensitive (Fig. 4D). While RBOHDS343/347A activation by BIK1 was already substantially reduced at HCa2+, this activation level collapsed down to ~20% of that of RBOHD at MCa2+ and was almost abolished at RCa2+. These findings reveal that Ser343/347, when phosphorylated, allows for maximal activation of RBOHD at resting Ca2+ concentration (RCa2+, 87 nM) solely through phosphorylation of other p-sites, while nonphosphorylated Ser343/347 necessitates higher Ca2+ concentrations (HCa2+, 630 nM) for efficient Ca2+ binding to RBOHD EF-hands as alternative means allowing for full NOX activation. In conclusion, the phosphorylation status of Ser343/347 likely regulates the Ca2+ binding affinity/efficiency of the adjacent EF-hands. Phosphorylation of Ser343/347 by either BIK1 or CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5 would therefore be a key step on the substrate level for enabling Ca2+-sensitized ROS generation. We also discovered that Ser343/347 as well as all other p-sites that are shared between CBL1/CIPK26 and CPK5 displayed substantially enhanced phosphorylation intensity when simultaneously exposed to both kinases as compared to the phosphorylation intensity conferred by individual kinases (Fig. 4A).\n\n    We therefore considered that CBL1/CIPK26 and CPK5 could mutually enhance their capability for substrate phosphorylation by, e.g., mutual trans-phosphorylation, reciprocally enhanced auto-phosphorylation, or both. Inspection of our phospho-proteomic dataset identified Ser158/161 in CIPK26 as being principally phosphorylated and displaying a higher degree of phosphorylation upon coexpression with CPK5 (Fig. 5A). Also, in CPK5, we found that intensity of Ser337/338 phosphorylation was enhanced by CBL1/CIPK26 coexpression (Fig. 5A). In vitro phosphorylation assays combining inactive CIPK26 (CIPK26KD, harboring a K42N substitution) with active CPK5 established that CPK5 efficiently phosphorylated CIPK26 (Fig. 5B). Vice versa, phosphorylation of inactive CPK5 (CPK5KD, harboring a D221A substitution) by active CIPK26 was also readily detectable. Notably, Ser to Ala conversion of either Ser158/161 in CIPK26KD or Ser337/338 in CPK5KD diminished the degree of their phosphorylation. This latter observation confirms these amino acids as phosphorylation targets. To molecularly detail the contribution of Ser158/161 (in CIPK26) and Ser337/338 (in CPK5) to conferring Ca2+ sensitization of RBOHD activation, we characterized their potential to activate this NOX at MCa2+. Mutation of Ser158/161 in CIPK26 (CIPK26S158/161A) did not substantially affect its ability to activate RBOHD, while mutation of Ser337/338 (CPK5S337/338A) reduced the individual capability of CPK5 to activate RBOHD (Fig. 5C). However, reciprocal combinations of nonphosphorylatable with phosphorylatable kinases (CPK5S337/338A + CBL1/CIPK26 and CPK5 + CBL1/CIPK26S158/161A) dramatically reduced the synergistic activation of RBOHD when compared to combination of mutually phosphorylatable kinases (CPK5 + CBL1/CIPK26) (Fig. 5D). Here, the effect of CPK5S337/338 appeared to be more pronounced than that of CIPK26S158/161A, coinciding with the high Ca2+ responsiveness (and a low half maximal kinase activity of 100 nM Ca2+) of CPK5. These data identify mutual phosphorylation of both kinases as being required for Ca2+-sensitized RBOHD activation (Fig. 5D). Additionally, combination of both mutant versions (CPK5S337/338A + CBL1/CIPK26S158/161A) even further diminished the synergistic RBOHD activation capability normally conferred by combined function of both kinases. Collectively, these results support the importance of mutual phosphorylation of CPK5 and CIPK26 for their ability to confer synergistic activation of RBOHD.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Systemic signaling in multicellular organisms involves organ-scale (trans-cellular) as well as organismic (trans-organ) propagation mechanisms. In plants, organismic signals transduce via vasculature wires and mechanistically involve electrical, chemical, and mechanical components, while in animals nerve cords and vasculature provide convergent solutions to serve the dissemination of electrical or hormonal signals. Trans-cellular signaling within an organ involves diffusion and/or propagation of second messengers and can serve dispersion of incoming signals within an organ but can also precede subsequent trans-organ signal dissemination. Mutually interdependent Ca2+ and ROS waves crucially function in both organismic and organ-scale signaling. Here, we identify and characterize the CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5 module as functioning in both processes by simultaneously conferring Ca2+-sensing and Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation for activating the NOX RBOHD, a key enzyme for mounting plant immunity and stress tolerance.\n\n    A first important insight emerging from our studies is that all components of the CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5 signaling module crucially contribute to organismic implementation of systemic immunity, because representative PTI responses are impaired in distal leaves after local elicitor application in individual cipk26 and cpk5 mutants. Abolishment of PTI in cipk26/cpk5 establishes the requirement of this module for interorgan proliferation of systemic immunity. The combined outcome of our marker gene induction analysis and Ca2+ signaling assays specifies this bi-kinase module as conferring both local (trans-cellular) and systemic (trans-organ) immune responses. We further focused on detailing the molecular mechanisms that define its function in organ-scale manifestation of trans-cellular Ca2+/ROS signal propagation. These investigations revealed that the PRR-activated but Ca2+-independent kinase BIK1 and the Ca2+-activated kinases CBL1/CIPK26 and CPK5 confer phosphorylation of distinct (\"Ca2+-independent\" and \"Ca2+-dependent\") but also of a shared set of target sites. Of these, the shared Ser343/347 p-site apparently brings about Ca2+ sensitization of RBOHD. Our experimental data do not allow to distinguish if this results from modulation of the Ca2+ binding efficiency of the EF-hands in RBOHD or if the Ser343/347 phosphorylation status brings about a conformational change mimicking Ca2+ binding to these EF-hands. In line with a central role of Ser343/347 as switch for sensitizing RBOHD activation is that Ser343/347 are the most strongly phosphorylated residues in the whole Arabidopsis proteome after flg22 treatment. Another most relevant discovery reported here is the mutual phosphorylation of CPK5 and CIPK26, which causes synergistically enhanced RBOHD substrate activation by both kinases already in response to delicate Ca2+ signals (MCa2+; 150 nM). This Ca2+ sensitization mechanism occurs at concentrations close to the resting level of the cytoplasm (RCa2+; 87 nM) and coincides with the high Ca2+ sensitivity of CPK5 (and its half maximal kinase activity at 100 nM). The critical Ser337/338 site in CPK5 resides in a loop adjacent to the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain of this kinase, while in CIPK26 the critical Ser158 residue locates in the DFG +2 position of the activation loop. Remarkably, previous studies on mammalian and yeast kinases have established that the identity and phosphorylation of the respective residues in these kinases modulate their substrate phosphorylation and preference, suggesting a potential mechanism for the mutual activation of CPK5 and CIPK26. This discovery solves the long-standing enigma of how trans-cellular second messenger waves can propagate through organs without interfering with intracellular signaling processes in individual cells along this path. The combined consequence of this two-layer Ca2+ sensitization and activity potentiation mechanism reported here allows for organ-scale dispersion of a low-amplitude Ca2+ wave (that we detected here in flg22-treated leaves) by \"sidling\" through individual cells without disturbing ongoing essential intracellular Ca2+ signaling processes. Notably, the activity regulating p-sites in CIPK26 and CPK5 is not unique to these kinases but appears to be conserved in several, but not all, members of both kinase families (fig. S5). The apparent conservation of this activation mechanism is suggestive for the occurrence of similar mechanisms in other systemic stress response processes in plants.\n\n    Collectively, our findings allow to deduce a model for switching from initial local to subsequent systemic signaling in innate immunity and for sustaining this long-distance signal after initiation (Fig. 6). In the primary elicitor-exposed cell(s), elicitor binding activates the PRR complex and confers direct activation of specific RLCKs, including BIK1. During defense signaling initiation, BIK1 in turn phosphorylates RBOHD at multiple sites including Ser343/347, resulting in NOX activation and local extracellular ROS production. These directly elicitor-stimulated cells also form primary Ca2+ signals that may or may not contribute to RBOHD activity via direct EF-hand binding and activation of Ca2+-dependent kinases. Paracrine signaling by apoplastic ROS activates Ca2+ channels in neighboring cells, allowing for subtle increases in cellular Ca2+ concentration, that suffice to activate the CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5 module in the absence of PRR activation. Both kinases synergistically phosphorylate and thereby activate RBOHD for maximal ROS production already triggered through minute elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. This allows signal propagation to the next distal cell eventually forming an iterative paracrine cell-to-cell signaling circuit manifesting as propagating Ca2+/ROS signal. In this way, the CBL1/CIPK26/CPK5/RBOHD module concomitantly confers organ-scale signaling initially within the primary challenged leaf, but also subsequently throughout the whole plant resulting in systemic immunity.",

        "Title": "    Systematic Quantitative Analysis of Ribosome Inventory Upon Nutrient Stress",
        "Abstract": "    Mammalian cells reorganize their proteomes in response to nutrient stress via translational suppression and degradative mechanisms using the proteasome and autophagy systems. Ribosomes are central targets of this response, as they are responsible for translation and subject to lysosomal turnover upon nutrient stress. Ribosomal (r)-protein abundance (~6% of the proteome, ~107 copies/cell) and their enrichment in arginine (Arg) and lysine (Lys) residues has led to the hypothesis that they are selectively used as a source of basic AAs during nutrient stress via autophagy. However, the relative contributions of translational and degradative mechanisms to the control of r-protein abundance during acute stress responses is poorly understood, as is the extent to which r-proteins are employed to generate AAs when specific building blocks are limited. Here, we integrate quantitative global translatome and degradome proteomics with genetically encoded Ribo-Keima and Ribo-Halo reporters to interrogate r-protein homeostasis with and without active autophagy. Upon acute nutrient stress, cells strongly suppress r-protein translation, but, remarkably, r-protein degradation occurs largely through non-autophagic pathways. Simultaneously, loss of r-protein abundance is compensated for by reduced dilution of pre-existing ribosomes and reduced cell volume, thereby maintaining ribosome density within single cells. Withdrawal of basic or hydrophobic AAs induces translational repression without differential induction of ribophagy, indicating that ribophagy is not used to selectively produce basic amino acids during acute nutrient stress. We present a quantitative framework describing the contributions of biosynthetic and degradative mechanisms to r-protein abundance and proteome remodeling during nutrient stress.",
        "Introduction": "    r-protein stoichiometry is controlled via both translation/assembly mechanisms and degradation of supernumerary r-proteins via the proteasome, while autophagy may facilitate en mass ribosome turnover. Previous studies examining the effect of AA withdrawal or mTOR inhibition on r-protein homeostasis in mammalian cells have primarily focused on autophagic r-protein turnover, employing either immunoblotting to measure r-protein abundance for specific subunits or Ribo-Keima to measure autophagic flux. However, a global view of how cells regulate net ribosome balance upon nutrient stress is lacking, as r-protein degradation via autophagy represents only one component of the ribosome homeostasis system. To decode r-protein control mechanisms during nutrient stress, we developed a quantitative framework for analysis of r-protein abundance, synthesis, turnover, and subcellular partitioning using methods applicable to ensemble or single cell measurements (Extended Data Fig. 1a).\n\n    We initially examined the net balance of r-proteins upon acute AA withdrawal or inhibition of mTOR with a small molecule inhibitor Torin1 (Tor1) using quantitative proteomics (Fig. 1a-e, Extended Data Fig. 1b-d). HEK293 (293) and HCT116 cells with or without ATG8-conjugation (ATG5) or signaling (RB1CC1, also called FIP200) arms of the autophagy system were subjected to AA withdrawal or Tor1 treatment for 10 or 24h followed by 11-plex tandem mass tagging (TMT)-based proteomics (Fig 1b). We also mined our published dataset using 293T WT, ATG7-/-, and RB1CC1-/- cells subjected to the same experimental pipeline (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1b). As expected, both treatments resulted in reduced levels of autophagy cargo receptors (GABARAPL2, LC3B, SQSTM1, TEX264) and endoplasmic reticulum proteins, dependent on ATG5/7 and RB1CC1 (Extended Data Fig. 1b-e and Table S1). In contrast, plots of the Log2 ratio versus -Log10 p-value for >=70 of 80 r-proteins reveal only a modest (4.6-11.6%) reduction of r-protein levels with both forms of nutrient stress that was largely independent of autophagy (Fig. 1c-f, Extended Data Fig. 1b-d), although variation in the extent of decrease across individual r-proteins was observed (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 1f). This reduction in abundance for several r-proteins was not observable using quantitative immunoblotting (Extended Data Fig. 1g-k).",
        "Methods": "    The absence of obvious autophagy-dependent r-protein loss by proteomics with normalization based on total protein input created a paradox, given ribophagic flux with similar treatments using Ribo-Keima reporters. Changes in r-protein abundance could reflect multiple mechanisms, including translational inhibition, degradation, or effects on ribosome dilution due to reduced cell division (Fig. 2a). To simultaneously examine new r-protein synthesis, the fate of pre-existing r-proteins, and dilution via cell division, we fused a Halo cassette with the surface-exposed C-termini of endogenous RPS3 and RPL29 genes in HCT116, 293T, or 293 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Halo-fused proteins can be covalently labeled in a temporally controlled manner using distinct fluorescent ligands, facilitating analysis of single cells by flow cytometry or imaging, and ensembles of cells using in-gel fluorescence. Halo-tagging did not affect r-protein abundance, translation rates, or the response to nutrient stress (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). We also optimized concentrations, wash conditions, and compensation protocols to ensure complete Halo labeling with individual red (TMR) or green (R110) fluorescent ligands (Extended Data Fig. 2e-i, see Methods).\n\n    We initially measured the effect of mTOR inhibition (14h) on total RPS3-Halo and RPL29-Halo abundance in single HCT116 cells by flow cytometry using an 1h pulse labeling with cell-permeable red Halo ligand (Fig. 2b). The mean fluorescence/cell was reduced by ~25% with both cell lines upon Tor1 treatment (Fig. 2c,d). In parallel, we found that Tor1 treatment reduced cell diameter by ~10% (~25% reduction in volume), as noted previously, as well as reduced rates of cell division, thereby maintaining RPS3 and RPL29 density in single cells (Extended Data Fig. 2j,k). Thus, changes in cell number and cell size likely underlie the discrepancy between effects of nutrient stress measured by Ribo-Halo versus total proteomics, since the latter method employs normalized total protein input.\n\n    To simultaneously measure dilution of pre-existing r-proteins and new r-protein synthesis, HCT116 Ribo-Halo cells were treated for 1h with red Halo ligand to irreversibly label pre-existing r-proteins, free ligand rapidly washed out, and cells then incubated in rich media with green Halo ligand for 8, 16 or 24h to label newly translated r-proteins (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 2l). As expected, the relative contribution of pre-existing RPS3 and RPL29 to the entire pool of these proteins in single cells decreased with time, representing dilution by cell division (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 2l). Fifty % of pre-existing r-proteins were observed at ~16h, consistent with cell proliferation rates measured independently (Extended Data Fig. 2k). The total r-protein abundance/cell was maintained via synthesis of new r-proteins labeled with green Halo ligand, consistent with a doubling in ribosome number during one cell cycle. Upon inhibition of mTOR during labeling with green Halo ligand (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 2m), we observed reduced dilution of pre-existing r-proteins at 8, 16, and 24h in parallel with reduced cell division, and a reduction in the production of newly synthesized (green) r-proteins, apparently reflecting translational inhibition. A reduction of total r-proteins (red + green) by 10-30% was consistent with single ligand labeling. Reduced new synthesis and dilution of pre-existing r-proteins was also observed via imaging or in-gel fluorescence in Ribo-Halo cells upon Tor1 treatment (14h) (Fig. 2g,h, Extended Data Fig. 2n-q). Consistent with residual mTOR activity in HCT116 relative to 293T cells, we observed differential repression of new RPS3-Halo synthesis by pulse-chase Halo labeling (40% versus 60%) (Extended Data Fig. 2o,r). Critically, r-protein abundance, dilution, new synthesis, or cell size changes upon mTOR inhibition (14 or 24h) were unaltered in cells lacking ATG7 or RB1CC1 (Extended Data Fig. 3a-n). Thus, the overall abundance of r-proteins in response to mTOR inhibition reflects reduced new r-protein synthesis and reduced dilution of pre-existing r-proteins, the magnitude of which may vary with cell type. Autophagic turnover of r-proteins and rRNA is unlikely to provide a mechanism to reverse translation suppression and cell growth under acute conditions.\n\n    We next developed a quantitative translatome approach to systematically examine r-protein synthesis during nutrient stress by employing azidohomoalanine (AHA) metabolic labeling (Fig. 3a,b). AHA activation by tRNAMet-synthetase allows incorporation of azides into proteins that can then be functionalized through click chemistry, thereby allowing measurement of ongoing translation using TMR alkyne for in-gel quantification or biotin alkyne for purification with streptavidin resin and TMT-based proteomics (Fig. 3b). We optimized AHA labeling (250 muM) to minimize effects on mTOR activity while allowing sufficient AHA incorporation (Extended Data Fig. 4a-g, and METHODS). As expected based on ribosome profiling and 35S-Cys/Met incorporation, overall translation was reduced by 60-70% upon mTOR inhibition or AA withdrawal (3h) as measured by TMR labeling (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4h). We then quantified translation of >8,200 proteins by AHA-TMT proteomics. The vast majority of proteins were translationally repressed upon mTOR inhibition or AA withdrawal (3h), a notable exception being eIF4EBP1 with mTOR inhibition (Fig. 3d,e; Extended Data Fig. 4i). Interestingly, the majority of r-proteins were translationally repressed beyond the median value, consistent with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs in their mRNAs. mTOR inhibition more selectively repressed r-protein translation than AA withdrawal, despite similar levels of proteome-wide translation suppression (Extended Data Fig. 4h,j). In addition, we identified proteins whose translation was more selectively suppressed (Group 1), largely unchanged (Group 2), or differentially affected by the two treatments (Groups 3 and 4) (Extended Data Fig. 4k-o). Surprisingly, the extent of translational suppression in ATG7-/- and RB1CC1-/- 293T cells was comparable to WT cells (Fig. 3e; Extended Data Fig. 4p-r). Thus, global translational suppression of r-proteins contributes to ribosome abundance control during acute nutrient stress, and this is not appreciably affected by the cells ability to recycle AAs through autophagy under acute conditions. Lastly, variation in the extent of translational suppression across individual r-proteins was observed (Extended Data Fig. 4s).\n\n    To directly examine r-protein degradation during nutrient stress and the contribution of autophagy to turnover (Fig. 3f), we pulse labeled WT, ATG7-/-, and RB1CC1-/- 293T cells with AHA, allowed 1h for turnover of short-lived proteins in rich media, and then compared the abundance of biotinylated AHA-labeled proteins with or without mTOR inhibition (12h) by TMT proteomics (Fig. 3g; Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). From >8300 proteins quantified, we found 3 patterns of turnover (Fig. 3h; Extended Data Fig. 5c,d): 1) Pattern 1 with autophagy-dependent degradation, including several autophagy receptors, 2) Pattern 2 with autophagy-independent turnover that is enhanced by mTOR inhibition, including several proteins known to be degraded by the proteasome upon mTOR inhibition, and 3) Pattern 3 proteins with autophagy-independent stabilization upon mTOR inhibition. Interestingly, r-proteins conformed to Pattern 2, and were degraded in a largely autophagy-independent manner, although degradation rates varied for individual r-proteins with a correlated rank order with or without Tor1 (R2~0.7) (Fig. 3i,j; Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). As expected, 326 ER proteins were degraded in an autophagy-dependent manner and serve as a positive control for this degradomics approach to detect autophagy substrates (Extended Data Fig. 5g-i). To confirm these results, we performed a time-course experiment examining global degradomics at 5, 10, and 15h post-mTOR inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 6a-g). Consistently, mTOR inhibition induced accelerated r-protein turnover in a time-dependent manner, which was largely independent of an active autophagy pathway.\n\n    Given that several ribosome assembly steps occur in the nucleus/nucleolus, we examined whether nutrient stress alters the nuclear to cytosolic ratio of r-protein (Extended Data Fig. 7a). After optimizing isolation of nuclei and cytosol (Extended Data Fig. 7b-f), we quantified cytosolic and nuclear protein and phosphoprotein pools with or without AA withdrawal (3h) (Extended Data Fig. 7g-l). We observed decreased FOXK1 nuclear abundance, decreased RPS6, FOXK1/2, CAD phosphorylation, and increased TFEB, MITF, and TFE3 nuclear abundance, indicating mTOR inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 7j-m). We also uncovered several nucleolar ribosome biogenesis factors (PWP1, SDAD1, and NVL) that accumulate in the cytosol upon AA withdrawal (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k,n-p). In contrast, r-protein distribution was largely unchanged after AA withdrawal. As expected, ~91% of 60S r-proteins and 95% of 40S r-proteins are cytoplasmic in untreated cells, consistent with the longer time required to assemble the 60S subunit at steady-state and the larger fraction of 40S subunits that are assembled in the cytosol (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Upon AA withdrawal, the nuclear r-protein pool was reduced by 20% (~1.5% of the total ribosome pool) (Extended Data Fig. 8b-d), indicating that r-protein redistribution plays a very minor role in ribosome homeostasis under these conditions.\n\n    Our finding that cells lacking autophagy have no obvious defects in the response to nutrient stress based on total proteome, Ribo-Halo, translatome, and degradome analysis led us to further quantify ribophagic flux. Using Ribo-Keima reporters, we estimated that 3-4% of ribosomes are degraded in the lysosome after Tor1 treatment (10h) (Extended Data Fig. 8e-h), consistent with prior studies. The magnitude of autophagic flux is such that RPS3 turnover measured via AHA-TMT proteomics, which is ~20% (SD < 0.1) in 12h, is not obviously sensitive to the deletion of ATG7 or RB1CC1 (Extended Data Fig. 8i). NUFIP1, a subunit of the nucleoplasmic R2TP pathway involved in 60S rRNA biogenesis, was reported to traffic to the cytosol in response to nutrient stress and to function as a selective ribophagy receptor for lysosomal delivery. The absence of NUFIP1 re-localization upon AA withdrawal by TMT proteomics (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k) led us to re-evaluate its role in ribophagy. First, NUFIP1-/- 293T cells display reduced r-protein levels in rich media, consistent with the previously defined role for R2TP in 60S biogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Second, NUFIP1 deletion had no effect on either total Ribo-Halo abundance and synthesis/dilution (Extended Data Fig. 9c-e) or on r-protein abundance as measured by TMT proteomics (Extended Data Fig. 9f-i) during mTOR inhibition. Third, RPS3-Keima flux was unaffected in NUFIP1-/- cells undergoing nutrient stress (Extended Data Fig. 9j). We conclude that NUFIP1 is not required for ribophagic flux under these stress conditions.\n\n    The ~2-fold enrichment of basic AAs in r-proteins relative to the proteome together with the fact that ribosomes are rich in rRNA has led to the hypothesis that ribosomes may be selectively used for autophagy in response to decreased levels of these building blocks. We employed our r-protein analysis pipeline to evaluate selective withdrawal of Arg, Lys, or Leu on ribosome homeostasis and ribophagic flux (Fig. 4a). When compared with Tor1 or AA withdrawal, Leu and Arg withdrawal resulted in only a partial loss of mTOR activity (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), as found previously. However, Arg withdrawal promoted stronger translational inhibition, as measured by puromycin incorporation assay (Extended Data Fig. 10b,c), two-color RPS3-Halo assay (Fig. 4b; Extended Data Fig. 10d), and translatome analysis (Fig. 4c,d; Extended Data Fig. 10e-h). The order of translational suppression was Arg>=Tor1>Lys>Leu for both the total proteome and r-proteins. However, ribophagic flux was <3.4% in all cases (Extended Data Fig. 10i), indicating that acute loss of basic AAs does not selectively promote ribophagy.\n\n    We also found that 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), an inhibitor of HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1) that blocks production of GMP and IMP (Extended Data Fig. 11a), dramatically suppressed proteome and r-protein translation (Extended Data Fig. 11b-d), and also suppressed both dilution and new synthesis in the two-color Ribo-Halo assay (Extended Data Fig. 11e,f). However, the reduction in r-protein abundance measured by TMT-proteomics was ATG5-independent (Extended Data Fig. 11g). Consistent with this, ribophagic flux as measured using the RPS3-Keima processing assay was not detectably induced during 6-MP treatment (24h) in stark contrast to arsenite treatment (Extended Data Fig. 11h), indicating that autophagy is unlikely to be a major driver in regulation of r-protein abundance in response to inhibition of purine biosynthesis.\n\n    Here, we develop an experimental pipeline for broadly probing the integration of biosynthetic and degradative mechanisms controlling signal-dependent proteome remodeling with a focus on r-proteins. The major contributors to r-protein abundance control with either mTOR inhibition or AA withdrawal were: 1) translation suppression of r-proteins, 2) reduced dilution of pre-existing ribosomes reflecting prolonged cell proliferation rates, and 3) non-autophagic r-protein degradation (Fig. 4e). In contrast, ribophagy represented a relatively small contribution to overall changes in ribosome abundance (3~4% in 10-12h). The finding that r-protein turnover parallels proteasomal targets by degradomics (Pattern 2, Fig. 3h) suggests proteasome involvement, but relevant ubiquitin ligases remain unknown.\n\n    We developed a quantitative framework (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 11i,j) which facilitates an understanding of the factors that contribute to the cellular concentration of ribosomes, taking into account ribosome number, cell division timing, and cell volume. A central element of the model is that ribosome abundance/cell increases by 2-fold over the course of the cell cycle and is re-set upon division. Under nutrient stress conditions, alterations in r-protein synthesis and degradation rates slow the increase in r-protein abundance (numerator), which is partially compensated for by changes in cell volume and the timing of division (denominator) (Extended Data Fig. 11i,j). Incorporation of our translational inhibition, degradation, cell volume and division rate data into this model accurately estimates the total change in ribosome concentration measured by total proteomics. However, the current model uses zero order kinetics for changes in translation, turnover, and cell division, and more precise models will require measurements of rates of change during the stress interval. Our framework highlights the importance of considering multiple r-protein homeostasis mechanisms simultaneously to fully understand the similarities and differences across cell systems that may respond to nutrient stress in distinct ways. In this regard, ribophagy in budding yeast has been proposed to be a major contributor to proteome remodeling in response to nitrogen deficiency. This apparent differential utilization of autophagy in yeast versus mammalian tissue culture cells could reflect the fact that r-protein abundance in yeast is an order of magnitude higher than that seen in mammalian cells, but is also complicated by the fact that the duration of nutrient stress applied (24h) is ~16 times the cell division time. Interestingly, approximately 10% of ER proteins are degraded within 10h of AA withdrawal in human cells, and this is blocked by genetic ablation of autophagy as verified here by degradomics (Extended Data Fig. 5g-i). Given that the contribution of ER proteins to total proteome mass rivals that of r-proteins, ER may constitute a major target for autophagic degradation in response to AA withdrawal or mTOR inhibition. Ribosomes may also be degraded to some extent by autophagy via association with rough ER, as visualized in situ by electron microscopy. It seems likely that in vivo and with chronic nutrient stress, autophagy will be responsible for generation of AAs such as arginine, as has been shown in the context of tumorigenesis.\n\n    HEK293 (human embryonic kidney, fetus, ATCC CRL-1573, RRID: CVCL_0045), HCT116 (human colorectal carcinoma, male, ATCC CCL-247, RRID: CVCL_0291), and HEK293T (human embryonic kidney, fetus, ATCC CCL-3216, RRID: CVCL_0063) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, high glucose and pyruvate) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 C.\n\n    gRNAs targeting C-terminus region of human RPS3 and RPL29 genes were designed using the CHOPCHOP website (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/). The guide sequences for RPS3 gene (5'- GACATACCTGTTATGCTGTGTTT-3') or RPL29 gene (5'-GAGATATCTCTGCCAACATG-3') were assembled into pX459 plasmid. Donor vectors were constructed by assembling HaloTag7 transgene with upstream and downstream homology arms (650 nucleotide each) into digested pSMART plasmid by Gibson assembly. HEK293, HEK293T, and HCT116 cells were transfected with donor and gRNA vectors (1 to 1 ratio) by Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). Five days after the transfection, the pool of transfected cells was treated with 100 nM Halo-TMR ligand for 1h, followed by three times of washing. Fluorescence positive cells were sorted into 96 well plates by flow-cytometry (MoFlo Astrios EQ, Beckman Coulter). Three weeks later, the expanded single-cell colonies were screened for the integration of the HaloTag7 transgene by immunoblotting with alpha-RPS3 or alpha-RPL29, followed by genotyping.\n\n    RB1CC1, ATG5, ATG7, and NUFIP1 knock-out on 293T, 293, and HCT116 cell lines was carried out by plasmid-based transfection of Cas9/gRNA using pX459 plasmid as described. Initially, six gRNAs for ATG5, ATG7, and NUFIP1 and four guide RNAs for RB1CC1 knock-out were designed using CHOPCHOP website. Puromycin selection was followed 24 hours after the transfection. 48 hours after the transfection, gene cleavage efficiency of each guide RNA was measured by Surveyor assay. The following gRNA was shown the best cutting efficiency among the tested guides: 5'- GTCCAAGGCACTACTAAAAG-3' (exon2) for ATG7, 5'-GATCACAAGCAACTCTGGAT-3' (exon5) for ATG5, 5'-GAAGAATCTGGGCGTCGAAG-3' (exon1) for NUFIP1, and 5'-GCTACGATTGACACTAAAGA-3' (exon7) for RB1CC1,. Single cell was sorted into 96-well plate using limiting dilution method, and expanded clonal cells were screened by immunoblotting with alpha-ATG7, alpha-ATG5, alpha-RB1CC1, NUFIP1, and alpha-LC3B antibodies.\n\n    RPS3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9538); RPL28 (Abcam, ab138125), RPS15a (Bethyl Lab, A304-990A-T), ATG7 (Cell Signaling Technology, 8558S), Keima (MBL international, M182-3), LC3B (MBL international, M186-3), ATG5 (Cell Signaling Technology, 12994), p70 S6K phospho-T389 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9234S), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein Ser253, 236 (Cell Signaling Technology, 4858), TEX264 (Sigma, HPA017739), RPL23 (Bethyl Lab, A305-010A-T), RPL7 (Bethyl Lab, A300-741A-T), RPL29 (Proteintech Group, 15799-1-AP), Tubulin (Abcam, ab7291), SQSTM1 (Novus Biologicals, H00008878-M01), Anti-puromycin antibody (EMD millipore, MABE343), NUFIP1 (Proteintech Group, 12515-1-AP), RPS6 (Cell Signaling Technology, 2217), 4EBP1 (Cell Signal Technology, 9644), Lamin A/C (Cell Signal Technology, 4777), TFEB (Cell Signal Technology, 4042), SDAD1 (Bethyl Lab, A304-692A-T), NVL (Proteintech Group, 16970-1-AP), c-Maf (RnD systems, MAB8227-SP), IRDye  800CW Streptavidin (LI-COR, 926-32230), IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG H+L (LI-COR, 925-32211), IRDye 680 RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG H+L (LI-COR, 926-68070)\n\n    Torin1 (Cell Signal Technology, 14379), SAR405 (APExBio, A8883), Azidohomoalanine (Click Chemistry Tools, 1066-1000), 5-TAMRA alkyne (Click Chemistry Tools, 1255-1), Biotin-PEG4-Alkyne (Click Chemistry Tools, TA105-25), HaloTag  R110Direct  Ligand (Promega, G3221), HaloTag TMR (5mM) (Promega, G8251), 6-Mercaptopurine monohydrate (Sigma, 852678-1G-A), Sodium ascorbate (VWR international, 95035-692), Poly-L-lysine solution (Sigma, P4832), FluoroBrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific A, 1896701), Benzonase Nuclease HC (Millipore, 71205-3), Urea (Sigma, Cat#U5378), SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) (Bio-Rad, Cat#1610302), SURVEYOR Mutation Detection Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies, 706025), REVERT  Total Protein Stain kit (LI-COR, P/N926-11010), 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol (Sigma, 52517), Dulbecco's MEM (DMEM), high glucose, pyruvate (Gibco / Invitrogen, 11995), Dulbecco's MEM (DMEM), Low Glucose, w/o Amino Acids (US Biological, D9800-13), TCEP (Gold Biotechnology), Puromycin (Gold Biotechnology, P-600-100), Formic Acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 94318), Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340), PhosSTOP (Sigma-Aldrich, 4906845001), Trypsin (Promega, V511C), Lys-C (Wako Chemicals, 129-02541), Rapigest SF Surfactant (Glixx Laboratories, Cat#GLXC-07089), EPPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#E9502), 2-Chloroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, C0267), TMT 11plex Label Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#90406 & #A34807), TMTpro 16plex Label Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A44520), Hydroxylamine solution (Sigma Cat#438227), Empore  SPE Disks C18 (3M - Sigma-Aldrich Cat#66883-U), Sep-Pak C18 Cartridge (Waters Cat#WAT054960 and #WAT054925), SOLA HRP SPE Cartridge, 10 mg (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#60109-001), High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#84868), High-Select Fe-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A32992), Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad,#5000006), Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23275).\n\n    DMEM powder (4.16 g, US biological) and 1.85 g sodium bicarbonate were dissolved in 400 ml H2O. To the solution, 1.75 g of glucose, 5 ml of 100x sodium pyruvate (final conc. = 1 mM) and 50 ml of dialyzed fetal calf serum were added. 150 mul of 6N HCl was slowly added to bring the pH to 7.4. The final volume was adjusted to 500 ml. The media was filtered through 0.2 mum filter and kept at 4  C.\n\n    Base-medium for the indicated amino acid withdrawal was prepared by dissolving DMEM powder (8.32g, US biological), 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 3.5 g/L glucose, 30 mg/L glycine, 63 mg/L cystine 2HCl, 580 mg/L glutamine, 42 mg/L histidine HCl-H2O, 105 mg/L isoleucine, 66 mg/L phenylalanine, 42 mg/L serine, 95 mg/L threonine, 16 mg/L tryptophan, 104 mg/L tyrosine 2Na 2H2O, 94 mg/L valine, and 105 mg/L leucine in 880 mL H2O, and pH titrated to pH 7.2 using 2M HCl. The base-media was filtered through 0.2 mum filter and kept at 4  C. Before each experiment, 0.9 equivalence (v/v) of the base-medium was added by 0.1 equivalence (v/v) of dialyzed bovine serum albumin, 0.01 equivalence (v/v) of 100 x sodium pyruvate (final conc. 1mM) and 0.001 equivalence of 1000 x amino acids (methionine stock: 37.5 mg/ml (final 37.5 mg/L = 250 muM), Lysine HCl stock: 146 mg/ml (final 146 mg/L), Arginine HCl stock: 84 mg/ml (final 84 mg/L) except the limiting amino acid.\n\n    Solubility of Leucine in H2O was too low to be added at the last step as a concentrate. Therefore, leucine free medium had to be prepared separately from the -Lys and -Arg medium. DMEM powder (8.32g, US biological), 3.7g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 3.5 g/L glucose, 30 mg/L glycine, 63 mg/L cystine 2HCl, 580 mg/L glutamine, 42 mg/L histidine HCl-H2O, 105 mg/L isoleucine, 66 mg/L phenylalanine, 42 mg/L serine, 95 mg/L threonine, 16 mg/L tryptophan, 104 mg/L tyrosine 2Na 2H2O, 94 mg/L valine, 146 mg/L Lys, and 84 mg/L Arg were dissolved in 880 mL H2O, and pH titrated to pH7.2 using 2M HCl. The base-media was filtered through 0.2 micron filter and kept at 4  C. Before each experiment, 0.9 equivalence (v/v) of the base medium was added by 0.1 equivalence (v/v) of dialyzed bovine serum albumin, 0.01 equivalence of 100X sodium pyruvate (v/v), and 0.001 equivalence (v/v) of 1000X methionine (final 37.5 mg/L = 250 muM) or 0.01 equivalence (v/v) of 100X AHA (final 250 muM).\n\n    Immunoblotting assay was performed based on previously reported method. Briefly, cells were cultured in the presence of the corresponding stress to 40~50% confluency in 6-well plates, 10 cm or 15 cm dishes. After removing the media, the cells were washed with DPBS three times, then in-house RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM sodium glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium biphosphate) containing mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), Phos-STOP, and 20 unit/ml Benzonase (Millipore) were added directly onto the cells. Cell lysates were collected by cell scrapers and sonicated on ice three times, followed by centrifugation (13000 rpm, 5 min). The concentration of the supernatant was measured by Bradford assay, and the whole cell lysate was further denatured by the addition of LDS sample buffer supplemented with 100 mM DTT, followed by boiling at 75 C for 5 minutes. 20 or 30 mug of each lysate was loaded onto the 4-20% Tris-Glycine gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by SDS-PAGE with Tris-Glycine SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or MES SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. The proteins were electro-transferred to PVDF membranes (0.45 mum, Millipore), and then the total protein was stained by Revert total protein stain kit (LI-COR) or Ponceau staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membrane was then blocked with 5% non-fat milk (r.t., 30 min), incubated with the indicated primary antibodies (4 C, overnight), washed three times with TBST (total 30 min), and further incubated either with fluorescent IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG H+L, IRDye 800RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG H+L, or IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG H+L secondary antibody (1:15000) for 1 hour. After thorough wash with TBST for 30 min, near infrared signal was detected using OdysseyCLx imager and quantified using ImageStudioLite (LI-COR). For quantitative immunoblotting of endogenously tagged Ribo-Keima reporter cells, at least 70 mug of total lysate was loaded on to SDS-PAGE gel due to low expression level of Keima construct and small amount of processed Keima level. 4-20% Tris-Gly gel was used to resolve the proteins.\n\n    Corresponding Ribo-Halo cells were plated onto 24-well plates one day prior to the nutrient stress. The cells were left untreated or treated with 200 nM Torin1 for the indicated hours. 1h before collecting the cells, 100 nM of TMR-ligand was added in addition to the Torin1 for HaloTag labeling. The cells were washed with fresh DMEM with or without Torin1, three times with 10 min duration each. After trypsin treatment, the collected cells were re-suspended in 250 mul FACS buffer (1x DPBS, 1 mM EDTA, 1% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, final pH 7.3-7.5), and analyzed by flow-cytometry (LSR-II Analyser, BD Biosciences). The data was processed by FlowJo software.\n\n    Corresponding Ribo-Halo cells were plated onto 24 well plates. 100 nM of TMR-Halo ligand was added and incubated for 1h to label the pre-existing ribosomes, then washed away. The cells were incubated with 2 ml of fresh DMEM for 10 min at dark to remove the remaining free TMR-ligand. This was repeated for three times in total. Then the cells were grown either in rich medium or in Tor1 treatment medium, both containing 50 nM R110 Halo ligand. In parallel, control Ribo-Halo cells were stained only with TMR-ligand or with R110 ligand, the signal of which represented 100% ribosome abundance and used as a normalization factor. The cells were than collected after trypsin treatment, re-suspended in 250 mul FACS buffer (1x DPBS, 1 mM EDTA, 1% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, final pH 7.3-7.5), and analyzed by flow-cytometry (LSR-II Analyser, BD Biosciences). The data was processed by FlowJo software. Briefly, the 488 and 561 nm intensities of individual cells (> 3000 cells) were exported to excel. Each fluorescence signal from the single cells were normalized by the signal intensity from the 100% Red or 100% Green ligand treated cells for the same duration. The old to young ribosome ratio distribution graph was processed by dividing the normalized red signal with the normalized green signal coming from the same single cells and plotted using Prism software.\n\n    Related to Figs. 2 and 4. Corresponding Ribo-Halo cells were plated onto 12 well plates. 100 nM of TMR-Halo ligand was added and incubated for 1h to label the pre-existing ribosomes, then washed away. The cells were incubated with 2 ml of fresh DMEM for 10 min at dark to remove the remaining free TMR-ligand. This was repeated for three times in total. Then the cells were grown either in rich medium or in Tor1 treatment medium, both containing 50 nM R110 Halo ligand. In parallel, control Ribo-Halo cells were stained only with TMR-ligand or with R110 ligand, the signal of which represented 100% ribosome abundance and used as a normalization factor. The cells were than collected after trypsin treatment, re-suspended in RIPA buffer, and sonicated three times on ice. Following Bradford assay, 15 mug of the lysates were taken from each sample and resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The in-gel TMR and R110 signals were detected by ChemiDoc MP (Bio-rad). The gel was then either stained with Coomassie blue staining for loading control, or proteins transferred to PVDF membrane for the subsequent immunoblotting analysis. Ratio change of the TMR and R110 signals were analyzed using Image Lab software (BIO-RAD)\n\n    Related to Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3. Cells were grown on a 24-well plate with or without Torin1 (200 nM) for 14 hours. Then, the cells were treated with trypsin for 3 min, followed by the addition of 1 ml DMEM. The cells were collected and spun down at 1000 rpm for 3 min, and the DMEM was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 mul of DMEM with or without Torin1 (200 nM) at room temperature. 75 mul of each sample (~ 2.0 x 105 cells/ml) was injected to Moxi Cassette and the size measured by Moxi GO II. The single cell size measurements were processed by FlowJo and plotted using Prism software.\n\n    Related to Figs. 2. Live-cell confocal microscopy was performed based on previously reported method. Briefly, cells were plated onto 35 mm-glass bottom dish (No. 1.5, 14 mm glass diameter, MatTek) pre-treated with poly-L-lysine, then pre-incubated in 100 nM TMR-ligand containing medium for 1 hour. Followed by the washing steps (three times for 10 min each), the cells were incubated with or without Torin1 in the presence of 50 nM R110 Halo ligand for 14 or 24 hours. The media was changed to FluoroBrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher) before the live cell imaging. The cells were imaged using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal with Spectral Applied Research Aurora Borealis modification on a Nikon Ti motorized microscope equipped with a Nikon Plan Apo 60x/1.40 N.A or 100x/1.40 N.A objective lens. Pairs of images for ratiometric analysis of TMR and R110 fluorescence were collected sequentially using 100 mW 488 nm and 100 mW 561 solid state lasers attenuated and controlled with an AOTF (Spectral Applied Research LMM-5), and emission collected with a 525/50 nm or 620/60 nm filter (Chroma Technologies), respectively. Wide-field fluorescence images of Hoeschst were collected using a Lumencor SOLA light source, 395/35nm excitation and 480/40nm emission filters (Chroma Technologies). Both confocal and widefield images were acquired with the same Hamamatsu ORCA-ER cooled CCD camera and MetaMorph software. For the analysis, the equal gamma, brightness, and contrast were applied for each image using FiJi software.\n\n    Related to Fig. 3. WT 293T cells were plated onto 10 cm dish with ~20% confluency 24 h before the experiment. Commercial DMEM media was replaced with in-house prepared DMEM media containing either 250 muM Methionine or 250 muM AHA in addition to the indicated nutrient stress medium. The cells were washed three times with DPBS and lysed by the addition of RIPA buffer and sonication (4  C, three times). Following Bradford assay, 30 mug of lysate was subjected to immunoblotting for pS6K, pS6, and 4E-BP1 for proper inhibition of mTOR activity quality control. From the remaining lysates, equal protein amount was collected across the samples, reduced by 5 mM TCEP (10 min, room temperature), then alkylated by chloroacetamide (20 mM final concentration, 15 min, room temperature). CHCl3/MeOH precipitation was followed to remove any remaining AHA in the cell lysates. White protein disk was then resuspended in 2% SDS (50 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl, pH7.2, 2.5 mM TCEP) and sonicated once with a tip sonicator. 10 mul of the resuspended lysate was added with 10 mul of 2X Click-master mix containing 2 mM CuSO4, 2 mM sodium ascorbate, 200 muM TBTA ligand, and 200 muM TMR-alkyne in H2O. The Click reaction mixture was then incubated at dark for 1 hour (with rocking, room temperature, final sample concentration: 0.825 mug/mul). The mixture was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and TMR signal detected by ChemiDoc MP (BIO-RAD) and analyzed by Image Lab software (BIO-RAD).\n\n    Related to Fig. 3. WT 293T cells were plated onto 10 cm dish with ~20% confluency 24 h before the experiment. Commercial DMEM media was replaced with in-house prepared DMEM media containing either 250 muM Methionine or 250 muM AHA in addition to the indicated nutrient stress. The cells were washed three times with DPBS and lysed by the addition of RIPA buffer and sonication (three times). Following Bradford assay, 30 mug of the lysate was subjected to immunoblotting for pS6K, pS6, and 4E-BP1 for proper inhibition of mTOR activity quality control. We also confirmed that AHA labeling (250 muM) without prior Met withdrawal minimized the effects on mTOR activity using pS6K band intensity. From the remaining lysates, equal protein amount was collected across the samples, then reduced by 5 mM TCEP (10 min, room temperature), and alkylated by chloroacetamide (20 mM final concentration, 15 min, room temperature). CHCl3/MeOH precipitation was followed to remove any remaining AHA in the cell lysates. White protein disk was then resuspended in 2% SDS (50 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl, pH7.2, 2.5 mM TCEP) and sonicated once with a tip sonicator. At least 1 mg of the lysates resuspended in 2% SDS was taken and reacted with the click reagents (final concentration: 1 mM CuSO4, 1 mM sodium ascorbate, 100 muM TBTA ligand, and 100 muM biotin-alkyne), and the mixture was incubated for 2 hours with rocking at room temperature. CHCl3/MeOH precipitation was followed again to remove excess amount of biotin-alkyne, the lysates resuspended with 200 mul of 2% SDS (TCEP 2.5 mM) and diluted with RIPA to make < 1 mg/ml concentration of the lysate (final SDS concentration is < 0.5%). Meanwhile, 10 mul of high capacity streptavidin agarose beads multiplied by the number of samples (ex. 100 mul for 10 samples, the bead has 10 mg/ml BSA-biotin capture capacity. Therefore, 10 mul bead can roughly capture 100 mug of biotinylated proteins when average MW was assumed to be 66 kDa) were washed with 1 ml RIPA and distributed to 10 x 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. The lysates were added to the beads, incubated overnight at room temperature. Flow-through was then stored for the quality control, and the beads were washed with RIPA X2, 1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2CO3, 2 M Urea in HEPES buffer x 2, and RIPA x 2. The beads were transferred onto hydrophilic PTFE membrane filter cups, washed with water two times. Completely dried beads were then resuspended in 50 mul of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), incubated for 5 min with shaking and eluted by spinning. 50 mul of HFIP was added to the beads again, the eluates combined, and dried in speedvac for 10 min. (bp of HFIP = 58  C, volatile). This sample was used for either WB or TMT-MS analysis. Note: as a quality control, we gathered the flow-through and blotted it for streptavidin-IRDye800 for equal capture. Also, the flow-through was precipitated with CHCl3/MeOH method followed by click reaction with TMR-alkyne (an orthogonal alkyne reagent to the biotin-alkyne) to check the efficiency of the click reaction. Based on this method, we concluded that the efficiency of initial click reaction was always over 90% when compared with the negative control that does not contain AHA.\n\n    Related to Fig. 3. Equal number of the WT 293T cells were plated onto 10 cm dish with ~20% confluency 24 h before the experiment. Commercial DMEM media was replaced with in-house prepared DMEM media containing either 250 muM Methionine or 250 muM AHA and the cells were incubated for 5 hours for AHA incorporation. The AHA containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed with rich DMEM. The cells were incubated in the rich DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 1 hour for the degradation of short-lived proteins with AHA incorporation. Then the control cells were collected immediately by addition of the RIPA buffer (containing 0.5% SDS instead of 0.1%), while the UT and nutrient stress samples were further grown in rich medium or Tor1 200 nM containing medium for 12 hours. To avoid the dilution factor of AHA labeled proteome through cell division, we collected the lysates from the entire dish and processed for quality control immunoblotting without normalizing the total proteome level using Bradford assay. The remaining lysates were reduced by 5 mM TCEP (10 min, room temperature), alkylated by chloroacetamide (20 mM final concentration, 15 min, room temperature), and proteins precipitated by CHCl3/MeOH method. White protein disk was then resuspended in 2% SDS (50 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl, pH7.2, 2.5 mM TCEP) and sonicated once with a tip sonicator. Small aliquot of the lysates was reacted with TMR alkyne for a quality check, and the rest was clicked with biotin alkyne followed by streptavidin capture. In this case, the beads were washed with more stringent buffers (RIPA X2, 2% SDS X2, 3M Urea X2, 0.1 M Na2CO3, RIPA x 2, ddH2O X3).\n\n    Related to Extended Data Fig. 7. The final protocol used in this study (Method 3 in Extended Data Fig. 7b) was modified from. HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10 cm dishes with ~20% confluency, 24h prior to the experiment. The cells were either left untreated or treated with -AA medium for three hours, then washed three times with DPBS. Then the cells were lysed by adding 800 mul of the lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 10 mM glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium biphosphate, protease inhibitor cocktail, 2.5 mM MgCl2) directly on to the dish, the lysates collected by scraping, and pipetted up and down 6 times. Over 90% of the cells showed cell membrane rupture with intact nucleus when observed under the microscope after Trypan blue staining. 50 mul was taken and snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen (whole cell lysate). The rest of the lysate was spun down at 7000 rpm for 30 sec, supernatant taken and snap frozen (cytosolic fraction). The remaining pellet was washed with 1 ml DPBS, spun again at 7000 rpm for 30sec, and supernatant was removed (pellet = nuclear fraction). Nuclear fraction pellet was resuspended in 300 mul RIPA buffer containing benzonase and sonicated for three times. The cytosolic fraction was added with 80 mul of 10X RIPA buffer to equalize the surfactant concentration as in nuclear fraction, and sonicated. Bradford assay was performed using the whole cell lysate, cytosolic fractions and the nuclear fraction. 100 mug of the proteins from both nuclear and cytosolic fractions were taken and processed for MS analysis. 15 mug of each fraction was taken and subjected to immunoblotting as quality control. This method resulted in 3.2~3.6 times more loading of the nuclear fractions compared to the cytosolic fractions when calculated back to the total protein level. This ratio was applied for the final calculation of the nuclear-cytosolic protein abundance in the TMT-MS analysis.\n\n    Methods in Extended Data Fig. 7b: Method 1) a. buffer: 1% TritonX, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 40 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2.5 mM MgCl2, protease inhibitor cocktail. b. lysis method: the cell lysates were incubated for 15 min at 4  C with rocking, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13K rpm.

The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer for nuclear fraction. c. total time: ~25 min\n\n    An extensive description of proteomics methods and detailed parameters are included in the first sheet of each Supplementary Tables.\n\n    Samples were reduced and alkylated followed by chloroform-methanol precipitated, reconstituted in 100 mM EPPS (pH 8.5), digested by Lys-C and then by trypsin. Samples were TMT labeled for 60 min at room temperature. After labeling efficiency check, samples were quenched, pooled and desalted for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. When indicated, pooled sample was first offline fractionated with bRPLC in a 96-well plate and combined for a total of 24 fractions before desalting and subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis.\n\n    Samples were analyzed on Orbitrap Tribrid Serie mass spectrometers coupled to a Proxeon EASY-nLC pump (ThermoFisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 35 cm column packed in-house using a 95 to 110 min gradient. MS1 data were collected using the Orbitrap (120,000 resolution). MS2 scans were performed in the ion trap with CID fragmentation (isolation window 0.7 Da; rapid scan; NCE 35%). Each analysis used the Multi-Notch MS3-based TMT method, to reduce ion interference compared to MS2 quantification, combined in some instance with newly implemented Real Time Search analysis software, and with the FAIMS Pro Interface (using previously optimized 3 CV parameters for TMT multiplexed samples). MS3 scans were collected in the Orbitrap using a resolution of 50,000, NCE of 65 (TMT) or 45 (TMTpro). The closeout was set at two peptides per protein per fraction, so that MS3s were no longer collected for proteins having two peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) that passed quality filters.\n\n    Mass spectra were processed using a Comet-based (v2018.01 rev.2) in-house software pipeline or Sequest-HT using Proteome Discoverer (v2.3.0.420 - Thermo Fisher Scientific). Database searching included all canonical entries from the Human reference proteome database (UniProt Swiss-Prot - 2019-01) and sequences of common contaminant proteins. Searches were performed using a 20 ppm precursor ion tolerance, and recommended product ion parameters for ion trap ms/ms were used. TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N termini (+229.163 Da for Amino-TMT or +304.2071 Da for TMTpro) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.021 Da) were set as static modifications, while oxidation of methionine residues (+15.995 Da) was set as a variable modification. For phospho-peptide analysis, +79.9663 Da was set as a variable modification on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. PSMs were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using linear discriminant analysis as described previously. Using the Picked FDR method, proteins were filtered to the target 1% FDR level. Phosphorylation site localization was determined using the AScore algorithm. For reporter ion quantification, a 0.003 Da window around the theoretical m/z of each reporter ion was scanned, and the most intense m/z was used. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for the isotopic impurities. Peptides were filtered to include only those peptides with a sufficient summed signal-to-noise ratio across all TMT channels. An isolation purity of at least 0.7 (70%) in the MS1 isolation window was used for samples analyzed without online real-time searching. For each protein, the filtered peptide TMT or TMTpro signal-to-noise values were summed to create protein quantification values.\n\n    Protein quantification values were exported for further analysis in Microsoft Excel and Perseus and statistical test and parameters used are indicated in the corresponding Supplementary Tables datasets. Briefly, two-way Welch's t-test analysis was performed to compare two datasets, using s0 parameter (in essence a minimal fold change cut-off) and correction for multiple comparison was achieved by the permutation-based FDR method, both functions that are built-in in Perseus software. For whole cell proteome analysis, each reporter ion channel was summed across all quantified proteins and normalized assuming equal protein loading of all samples. For AHA-derived translatome, as well as Nuclear/Cytosolic fractionation, no normalization based on loading was performed. For AHA-derived degradome normalization, we used a previously reported strategy, which is based on the assumption that there are stable proteins within the pool of proteins measured, whose amounts decay very little during the time course of the experiment.\n\n    Supplementary Tables list all quantified proteins as well as associated TMT reporter intensity and ratio change to control channels used for quantitative analysis.\n\n    Annotations for bona fide organellar protein markers were assembled using the proteins which had scored with confidence \"very high\" or \"high\" from the HeLa dataset previously published. Annotations for Ribosome and Autophagy Components were manually curated and assembled based on literature. Nuclear annotations are based on this paper's dataset (Supplementary Table 4).\n\n    All statistical data were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 or Perseus. Comparisons of data were performed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test; p-values <0.01 were considered significant.\n\n    All experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise indicated.\n\n    No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\n\n    Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.",

        "Title": "    The Keratinocyte as a Crucial Cell in the Predisposition, Onset, Progression, Therapy and Study of the Atopic Dermatitis",
        "Abstract": "    The keratinocyte (KC) is the main functional and structural component of the epidermis, the most external layer of the skin that is highly specialized in defense against external agents, prevention of leakage of body fluids and retention of internal water within the cells. Altered epidermal barrier and aberrant KC differentiation are involved in the pathophysiology of several skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD). AD is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by cutaneous and systemic immune dysregulation and skin microbiota dysbiosis. Nevertheless, the pathological mechanisms of this complex disease remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the participation of the KC in different aspects of the AD. We provide an overview of the genetic predisposing and environmental factors, inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways of the KC that participate in the physiopathology of the AD. We also analyze the link among the KC, the microbiota and the inflammatory response underlying acute and chronic skin AD lesions.",
        "Introduction": "    The skin is an organ in constant renewal that covers the body surface. Its total surface area is commonly calculated around 2 m2 considering variables such as height and weight; however, folds and invaginations, such as hair follicles and sweat ducts, substantially increase the surface area to 25 m2. The skin fulfills specific functions of protection, restraint, thermal regulation and sensitivity, which are carried out in the three layers that constitute the skin (from bottom to top): hypodermis, dermis and epidermis (Figure 1). The hypodermis is the deepest layer of the skin that lies below the dermis and adjoins the deep fascia that covers the skeletal muscle. It is made up of loose connective tissue and stored fat, and cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, and mainly adipocytes. Main functions of the hypodermis are to work as a caloric reserve, thermoregulation and shock absorber. The dermis is located above the hypodermis and is composed of two main extracellular matrix (ECM) components, i.e., collagen and elastin fibers, which are synthesized by fibroblasts. Afferent nerve endings and arteries also penetrate to the dermal deep region. The dermis has notable functions providing tone, strength, resistance, sensitivity and nutrients to the epidermis. In addition, this layer of the skin is of great importance since it contains innate immune cells such as dermal and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, mast cells, gammadelta T cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC), crucial in the function of defense in both human and mouse. The epidermis is located more externally and contiguous to the ECM and covers the dermis. It is a semi-permeable stratified keratinized epithelium highly specialized in defense against external agents. In addition to keratinocytes (KCs), which are the main functional and structural components of epidermal barrier, Langerhans cells, gammadelta T cells, resident memory T cells (mainly CD8+), melanocytes and Merkel cells are found in this layer, both in mice and humans.\n\n    Finally, on the epidermis, the microbiota has an important role in skin health, either modulating the immune response by generating an anti-inflammatory effect or inhibiting the colonization of multiple pathogens. Skin microbiota is highly diverse and mainly composed by bacterial, fungal, and viral populations, although microbial biomass is relatively reduced compared to that in the gut and airways. Bacterial skin microbiota is mainly represented by three genera: Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium, which represent over 60% of the bacterial species in the skin. Fungal population on the skin is composed by Malassezia, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Epicoccum, and Candida. Finally, the skin virome has been poorly studied and although respiratory and enteric virus transmission by hand contact is well documented, viruses are not normal inhabitants of the skin. Studies in healthy skin have demonstrated the presence of cutaneous human beta- and gamma-papillomaviruses (HPVs), polyomaviruses and circoviruses. All these data highlight the great complexity of the skin microbiota.\n\n    In the last decade, the KC has become a target of interest in various pathologies, due to its wide versatility. KCs have the capacity of differentiation, regeneration and interaction with various environmental components, as well as with other epithelial components, both structural and immunological, and they function to maintain a state of balance within healthy skin. Alteration of skin homeostasis can generate dermatosis conditions such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis (AD), among others. All these conditions significantly affect the quality of life of patients. Particularly, AD has aroused particular interest in recent years since records indicate that it affects 15% of the world population. This incidence has been recently altered in the general population, and mainly in health care workers, by the intensive hygiene habits adopted because of the pandemic by SARS-CoV2.\n\n    In this review, we summarize the roles of KCs in the context of AD. We first review the biology of the KC, and later review in detail the genetic and immunological profile of the cell that predisposes the beginning and progression of disease, highlighting its interaction with skin microbiota. Current knowledge about the use of the KC as an in vitro model to study AD is also reviewed. Finally, the pharmacological therapies target to restore KC properties in AD treatment is presented.\n\n    The KC is the main component of the epidermal barrier. This cell differentiates as it migrates through the different layers of the epidermis, by extension, from stratum basale (SB), through stratum spinosum (SS) and granulosum (SG) to stratum corneum (SC). During cell migration through these strata, the KC undergoes different processes, including proliferation, maturation (or differentiation) and cornification (Figure 2). In general, the differentiation processes of KCs are widely regulated by calcium, which is related with the fact that the highest calcium concentrations are found in the SB and SC.\n\n    The regeneration of epidermal cells takes place in the epidermal SB, a site where cells are dividing. The basal cells, the main components of this stratum, are cuboidal shaped cells with round to ovoid nuclei and evident tonofilaments within the cytoplasm. In the SB are also located melanocytes that are responsible for skin pigmentation, and Merkel cells that take part in mechanoreception and interact with neurons. Resident memory T cell and gammadelta T cells, both with dendritic morphology, are located in this stratum with important implications in local immune responses.\n\n    Basal cells are attached to the ECM of the basement membrane by focal adhesions, mainly beta1 integrins, and hemidesmosomes (HDs). The latter are composed of the alpha6beta4 integrin that extracellularly act as a laminin receptor that preferentially binds to laminin-332. alpha6beta4 integrin is coupled with the transmembrane element bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG)-2 (also known as BP180), which act as a functional unity that interacts inside the cell with two plakins, BPAG-1 (also known as BP230) and plectin/HD-1, that form that inner plaque of the HDs and are anchored to cytoskeletal keratin filaments (K)5 and K14. In turn, keratins modulate the location of the HDs. In vitro, it has been demonstrated that K5 and K14 play important roles in promoting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent cell proliferation and negatively modulating Notch1-dependent cell differentiation. To a large extent, the cell migration process begins with the activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), since it activates tyrosine kinase Fyn, which phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of beta4, causing the disassembly of HDs.\n\n    Basal cells undergo asymmetric perpendicular divisions that cause one daughter cell to maintain adhesion with the ECM and the other cell to continue stratification, probably in response to biomechanical signaling modulated by cell-cell contact. Adherent junctions, which are related to cell-cell adhesion, organization of the cytoskeleton and cell signaling, and desmosomes, which are adhesion joints that provide strength to the skin, are also present in this stratum. The former are composed by P-cadherin and E-cadherin, while the latter are constituted by the cadherins desmoglein (DSM) 2 and 3, and desmocollin (DSC) 3.\n\n    The maturation phase begins when the daughter cells that leave the SB lose the ability to duplicate and begin their migration through the different strata of the epidermis. This process is accompanied by biochemical and morphological changes before cells die in the SC.\n\n    Far from what was previously thought, HDs in conjunction with focal adhesions facilitate KC migration to the SS. The SS is characterized by a lower area consisting of several layers of polygonal KCs with a spiny appearance due to the increased amount of newly formed cell-cell junctions, and an upper area consisting of a layer of elongated and flattened KCs parallel to the epidermal surface. Both keratohyalin granules and lamellar bodies begin to appear in the last layer of the SS, although the latter can be only observed by electron microscopy. Content of both membrane-bound organelles are described later due to their importance in the cornification process. Langerhans cells are also located in the SS and play important functions in the uptake and processing of antigens. On the other hand, cells of the SG are elongated and parallel to the surface of the skin, as are their nuclei, with a high content of basic keratohyalin granules. These cells are connected to the SS and SC cells through desmosomes. Tight junctions (TJs), which are structures composed of membrane proteins from the occludin and claudin families associated with plaque proteins such as zonula occludens (ZO)-1 that facilitate the transport of ions and solutes between neighboring cells, are formed and overexpressed in this layer. Living SG cells gradually begin to reduce their viability, and once they reach the SC are known as corneocytes, which are dead cells devoid of nuclei and organelles.\n\n    In addition to morphological changes, the differentiation process is accompanied by structural modifications in cell-cell junctions. When KCs exit the basal layer and migrate upwards into the suprabasal layers, they stop expressing K5/K14 to express K1/K10 to form intermediate filaments, which participate in the dynamics of desmosomes and therefore in the stratification of the epidermis, as has been observed in K1 and K10 knockout mice. It has been observed that desmosomes are larger and more abundant in lower layers of the SS than in the upper layers, reducing even more in the SG. These variations, as well as the strength of these interactions, are conditioned by modifications in the homophilic (DSC: DSC) or heterophilic (DSC: DSG) expression of proteins, the latter providing greater strength. Furthermore, DSG 2 and 3 of the lowest epidermal layers are exchanged for DSG 1 and 4 in the most differentiated layers. On the other hand, DSC 2 and 3 are ubiquitously expressed in the epidermis, while DSC 1 appears from the SS. In relation to TJs, while claudin 1 has been detected in plaques of the epidermis from the SB to SG, with greater intensity in the suprabasal layers, occludin is present in the SG and partly, in the transition cell layer, while ZO-1 is expressed from the SG to the upper layers of the SS. Concerning adherent junctions, P-cadherin is distributed only in the SB, but E-cadherin is evenly distributed in all layers of the epidermis and is essential for TJ formation, but not for desmosome. On the other hand, gap junction connexin (Cx) proteins are transmembrane channels that communicate adjacent cells. The configuration of the union gap is also related to the differentiation of KCs. Thus, Cx43 is particularly expressed in basal cells, while in more differentiated stages there is a change to Cx26, Cx30 and Cx31.\n\n    Corneocytes are dead cells that present with electrodense, polyhedral, elongated and flattened morphologies, and are joined to each other by corneodesmosomes, serving as the first line of defense against external agents. In this layer, the cornified cell envelope (CCE) is formed and reinforced with a lipid envelope. The process of KC migration culminates in desquamation, i.e., the detachment of the corneocytes.\n\n    Cornification is mediated by substances stored in keratohyalin granules and lamellar bodies. The former contain proteins, such loricrin (LOR) and profilaggrin, which together with involucrin (IVL) give rise to the CCE. Lamellar bodies begin to be released before the establishment of TJs, in the SG. They store lipids, proteins, enzymes and their inhibitors that provide substrates to the SC during the final phase of cornification, and for timely desquamation. They also contain antimicrobial peptides, such as human beta-defensin (hBD) 2, hBD3, cathelicidin LL-37 and ribonuclease 7, that serve as part of the skin microbial barrier. The corneodesmosomes, junction structures that replace to desmosomes, are widely distributed over the entire surface of the corneocytes of the lower layer of the SC, and to a lesser extent in the superficial corneocytes. These arise when corneodesmosin released from lamellar granules in the SG binds to DSG1 and DSC1, giving rise to the corneodesmosome, which represents an important contribution for the CCE in the replacement of plasma cell membrane with the macromolecular deposition of proteins. On the other hand, the profilaggrin released from keratohyalin granules is proteolyzed into filaggrin (FLG) monomers that bind to K1 and K10 filaments of the cytoskeleton, providing mechanical strength and flattering of corneocytes in the most external skin layer. In the intercellular spaces of the SG and SC, large amounts of suprabasin (SBSN), a protein that serves as a substrate for the transglutaminase (TGM) 2 and 3, are deposited. By the action of TGM, the corneocytes are then heavily cross-linked and make up the CCE. Later, corneodesmosomes are degraded by kalikrein and other enzymes to initiate natural desquamation, which leads to the establishment of an effective epidermal barrier. Desquamation is essential to maintain the thickness and the self-renewal process of the epidermis. Likewise, in the more superficial cornified layer, nonapoptotic caspase 14 is essential in the catabolism of FLG into hygroscopic amino acids, which are, together with their derivatives, important constituents of so-called natural moisturizing factors (NMF). These FLG degradation products provide moisture, maintain acidic pH and protect from UVB-induced damage.\n\n    The SC is elemental in the prevention of transepidermal water loss, a marker of the inside-outside barrier; however, this function is favored by cohesion between the corneocytes and because the corneocytes are covered by a lipid sheet made up mainly of cholesterol, phospholipids, and glycoceramides. The production of this lipid envelope has been related to the decrease in pH that characterizes this stratum. A healthy SC has an average pH of 4.7 that is maintained by different mechanisms, among them microbiota colonization. Differential distribution of moisture and water retention in the skin favors the establishment of a suitable niche for differential colonization of microorganisms.\n\n    It has been reported that in the last stages of KC differentiation, and the first stages of cornification, there is an increase in the expression of enzymes and antioxidant elements, which together with the structural proteins are fundamental to the homeostasis of the epidermis. The main enzymes detected in the epidermis are superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase; however, lipophilic and hydrophilic nonenzymatic antioxidants, such as alpha-tocopherol and ubiquinol, or ascorbic acid, uric acid and glutathione, respectively, are also found.\n\n    AD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin characterized by eczematous lesions and a sensation of intense itching. It originates from alteration of the integrity of the epidermal barrier as a consequence of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Due to skin barrier defects, there is an increase in the permeability to antigens, both of chemical and protein nature. Penetrating antigens interact with KCs, which are described as hyperactive in people with AD, generating exaggerated responses characterized by an excess of cytokines and chemokines that promotes local inflammatory processes. At the onset, lymphocyte T-helper (Th) response is predominantly via Th2/Th22 with slight Th17 participation, but after chronic allergen exposition, Th1 cells join this enhanced response. The cocktail of cytokines released increases deterioration in the epidermal barrier, inducing disease progression, which is known as the outside-inside-outside hypothesis. In the following sections, we review the participation on the KC in different stages of AD, including genetic alterations in the cell that predispose to disease onset, and the KC responses to different stimuli that favor the development, maintenance and progression of AD.\n\n    It is widely accepted that AD is a multifactorial disorder. As aforementioned, the inclination to develop the disease results by the interaction of genetical and environmental factors. Although environmental factors play an important role as triggers of AD, genetic factors stand out for predisposition. Family history strongly impacts on the tendency to develop AD. A study in Hungary demonstrated that 65.5% of children with AD had an ascendency of atopic diseases, while in Sweden, parental history of asthma and/or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and allergy to furred animals and/or pollen increased the odds ratio (OR) to 2.0 for AD in children up to 4 years. Genetic predisposition is a highly determinant factor to increase the susceptibility of developing AD. Genetic alterations related to AD, and in which the KC has important participation, include those that represent epidermal barrier dysfunctions and dysregulation of innate immune response.\n\n    The human FLG gene (FLG) is located in a locus named epidermal-differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21 and, as summarized in Table 1, many polymorphisms and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in FLG generate a high risk of developing AD. In homozygotes or compound heterozygotes LOF mutations of the FLG gene, the expressed FLG is impaired, which leads to compromised integrity of the epidermal barrier. Although many mutations have been described worldwide, Asian populations have high frequency of the distribution of these genetic variations on AD patients. Commonly, a LOF mutation in FLG acquires more importance in AD onset in the first two years of life, while AD development in childhood or adults may be influenced by other factors. It is surprising that some mutations do not affect the levels of NMF, which may indicate that type 2 skin inflammation causes NMF reduction.\n\n    Other genes also expressed in KCs and involved in the innate immune response have been associated with AD development. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 have an important role in the activation of the innate immune response on AD. For the TLR2 receptor, two clinically relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with missense changes have been documented, namely R753Q and R677W, and for TLR4 two SNPs, D299G and T399I, have been described. Another member of the innate immune response secreted by KCs is hBD2. In the DEFB1 gene some SNPs have substantial effects on the function of hBD2,with direct impacts on AD onset, namely A692G and G1654A. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is produced by KCs and induces generation of Th2 cells with consequences in the pathogenicity of atopic diseases. Although polymorphisms have been shown to increase the risk for AD (rs2289276), some others have a protective effect (rs11466749 and rs10043985).\n\n    Continuous improvement of knowledge concerning polymorphisms that participate in the development of AD, and technological advances in genotyping, will provide better tools to establish strategies for decision making, even before the appearance of the symptoms of AD.\n\n    Some authors indicate that patients in the first stage of the disease present nonlesional skin that is visibly normal and devoid of clinically apparent disease but presents abnormalities in relation to a normal skin. Nonlesional AD skin is characterized by increased epidermal thickness and proliferation index, T-cell infiltration, type-2, -22, -17 cytokine and epidermal S100 protein expression, but a reduction in the expression of proteins of KC terminal differentiation, such as LOR, FLG and IVL, as compared to normal skin. Anther protein affected in AD development is SBSN, which is also expressed in the epithelial differentiating layers during cornification. Although its function is not fully understood, it is known that shRNA-mediated SBSN knockdown promotes poor formation of keratohyalin granules and affects the development of the SG. In intrinsic AD patients, SBSN is substantially decreased, particularly in those with a nickel allergy. These cutaneous abnormalities are exacerbated in lesional skin; thus, nonlesional skin shows an intermediary phenotype between normal and lesional skins, though closer to the latter as immune and epidermal alterations in nonlesional skin are associated with disease extent and severity. On the other hand, Th2 cytokines are related to some cutaneous characteristics reported in nonlesional skin of AD patients. Nonlesional skin shows a higher expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in basal epidermal cells compared to skin biopsies of healthy individuals. However, when the latter are stimulated with interleukin (IL)-4 there is an increase in expression of ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion protein (VCAM), two adhesion molecules which have been associated with the attraction of leukocytes in the lesion area. Gene expression profiling of lesional and nonlesional AD skin has identified signature genes with remarkable roles in physiopathology of AD. An analysis of 127 samples from five different studies demonstrated several differentially expressed genes involved in AD grouped in: (i) epidermal development and barrier function (up-regulated in AD: KRT16, COL6A6; down-regulated in AD: LOCE2B, LOR, FLG, SCEL, AQP9); (ii) growth factors and inflammation (chemokines CCL17, CCL18, CCL22 are commonly upregulated in AD, while growth factors such as PGF2, EREG, OGN, are down-regulated); (iii) epidermal proteases (KLK5, SERPINB3, SERPINB4, SERPINB7, TMPRSS4, are up-regulated in AD); (iv) antimicrobial function (MSMB, LTF, SCGB2A1 are down-expressed; however, DEFB4 that codifies beta-hBD2 is usually up-regulated likely in response to bacterial infection); and finally, (v) epidermal lipids metabolism (FADS1, FAR2, FABP7, GPD1 are down-regulated in AD). Furthermore, human KCs stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13 reduce the expression of the barrier proteins LOR and IVN, that are also diminished in nonlesional skin of patients with AD. However, there is still a lot of controversy about the primary origin of AD, since most of the studies related to this first stage in humans were carried out in areas of nonlesional skin from patients with chronic AD. For this reason, an attempt to explain these mechanisms using human KC cultures or murine models has been made.\n\n    In addition to the genetic factors mentioned above, environmental factors such as UVB radiation or pollutants have been associated with the deterioration of the skin (Figure 3). UVB radiation induces the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) by KCs, which are involved in apoptosis and cell death, and the synthesis of inflammatory mediators and enzymes, such as IL-6, IL-8, prostaglandin (PG)E2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), mainly through MAPK, NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways. Furthermore, studies in other cell populations have shown that ROS also have an important role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent activation of caspase-1 needed for IL-1beta secretion. UVB radiation also stimulates TSLP expression in KCs through HIF-1alpha-dependent mechanisms via the JNK and ERK pathways. Meanwhile, particulate matter (PM) present in air pollutants and mainly composed of a mixture of metals, organic compounds, materials of biologic origin and ions, has been associated with the incidence of AD in young people. Jin et al. demonstrated that PM can enter into human KCs in vitro and induce the synthesis of IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 in a ROS-dependent manner. However, for PM to penetrate the epidermis, barrier-disrupted skin is necessary, as demonstrated in murine models. KCs can be also activated by air pollutants through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), contributing to TSLP and artemin expression. On the other hand, antigens or sensitizing agents of an electrophilic nature activate KC signaling through interaction with cysteine residues (thiol groups) of the cell membrane, producing ROS that induce cell death, ATP release and the degradation of skin hyaluronic acid in compounds of low molecular weight that have been reported as endogenous TLR ligands in inflammatory cells. As the activation of KCs by endogenous ligands through TLR4 induces the synthesis of IL-23, a cytokine that stimulates the shift from T CD4 lymphocytes to Th22, it might trigger the development of a specific T-response to antigens passing across the deteriorated epidermis and induce AD development. Activation of KCs by house dust mite (HDM) allergens may also contribute to AD onset. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a ROS and ATP-independent, but cysteine protease-dependent manner, stimulating KCs to release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18. In human KCs and murine models, Dermatophagoides farinae extract induces TLR1 and TLR6 activation and promotes the synthesis of the innate proallergic cytokines IL-25 and IL-33 through IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK 1), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta activated kinase-1 (TAK1), IkappaB kinase and NF-kappaB pathways, thus conditioning a Th2 response.\n\n    In murine models, it has been observed that deterioration of the skin by itself induces the production of TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33 by KCs. In recent years, TSLP has been proposed as a possible serum marker of AD in humans, together with thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC; chemokine ligand (CCL) 17). In this context, the production of TSLP can be induced from human KCs by ligands of TLR3 (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly I: C]), TLR5 (flagellin) or TLR2/6 (diacylated lipoproteins or Staphylococcus aureus), and this effect is enhanced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, Th2 cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). The importance of KC-derived cytokines (namely, TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33) is as follows (Figure 4). TSLP actives CD11c DCs, inducing its survival and overexpression of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 and the chemokines TARC and macrophage derived chemokine (MDC o CCL22). Furthermore, in murine models, TSLP, IL-33 and IL-25 activate ILC2, which is overexpressed in damaged skin. TSLP-activated DCs together with ILC2 induce allogenic naive CD4+ T cell proliferation and their Th2 polarization to produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-alpha, which could trigger atopic march, as shown in murine models. Likewise, in response to IL-4 and IL-13, B cells carry out isotype change of the Ig heavy chain to produce allergen-specific IgE antibodies, which collaborate in allergen up-taken by skin DCs to amplify T cell activation.\n\n    Acute skin lesions are usually presented as erythematous, itchy papules with serous exudation. As a consequence of continuous scratching, secondary lesions are generated, which include excoriation and crusted erosion. Subacute lesions may also appear as erythematous scaling papules and plaques. These clinical conditions are similar in humans and dogs, thus dogs are used to understand the inflammatory changes underlying AD skin lesions. A transcriptome study carried out in dogs sensitized with HDM showed that, as a result of epicutaneous challenge with an allergen, acute skin lesions were accompanied by a marked genic expression of Th2 and Th22 cytokines, particularly IL-5, IL-13, IL-31 and IL-22, together with the Th2-promoting chemokines CCL5 and CCL17. In addition to the pruritogenic cytokine IL-31, other genes encoding pruritogenic pathways were also upregulated in dog biopsies, including several proteases (chymase, tryptase, cathepsin S), enzymes involved in leukotriene-synthesis, neuromedin-B, and nerve growth factor (NGF). This Th2 and Th22 dominance coincides with that manifested in acute AD lesions of patients, which are also characterized by an increase in the levels of expression of a subset of epidermal differentiation complex gene products, mainly S100A7 and S100A8 proteins, in the KCs from the upper SS and SG layers. In humans, robust Th2/Th22 activation is accompanied with some IL-17 skewing, which is significantly higher in children than in adults; however, no up-regulation of Th17 cytokines has been detected in acute AD lesions in dogs.\n\n    This inflammatory environment influences KC structure and, at the same time, the KC-derived mediators create feedback during inflammation (Figure 4). It has been shown that IL-22 increases the proliferation of KCs and inhibits their differentiation through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and the decrease in the expression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein-alpha, a transcription factor that regulates the development, proliferation and differentiation of KCs. Th2 cytokines have a negative effect on the integrity of the KC, since they can induce spongiosis by decreasing E-cadherin expression and increasing the intercellular accumulation of hyaluronic acid and inducing cell apoptosis. The loss of E-cadherin from the KC surface is generated by an increase in the activity of metalloproteases such as ADAM-10. Elevated levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9 in the SC from the AD acute lesion, might also contribute to the tissue remodeling process. In the acute inflammatory stage associated with AD, increased serum levels of hBD2 correlated with a high level of IL-22 have been described. Particularly, IL-22 enhances hBD2 production by KCs through activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, and hBD2 increases IL-22 production by CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells via JNK and Akt pathways. hBD2 functions as a chemoattractant of immature DC, memory T cells, macrophages, monocytes and mast cells when binding to CCR6 or CCR2 receptors, with a potential role in the development of the inflammatory and adaptive responses associated with AD. In mice, KC-derived IL-25 induces the release of high levels of IL-13 from ILC2 during AD acute lesions. Finally, in a mice model mimicking human acute AD lesions, the expression of KC-derived IL-33 was augmented and this cytokine was related to an anti-inflammatory effect on the disease; however, in an AD-model in mice overexpressing IL-33, the levels of epidermal claudin 1 were reduced and IL-33 was also able to down-regulate the expression of this TJ protein in KCs assayed in vitro, which suggests a possible dual role of IL-33 in AD pathogenesis.\n\n    One of the most prominent clinical manifestations of the AD acute phase is pruritus. In this stage, Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, together with mechanical damage, act synergistically to produce IL-31, a cytokine related to the activation of afferent fibers of neurons in the skin through the IL-31RA receptor. In addition, the KC-produced TSLP has the ability to sensitize afferent nerve endings of the skin through the transient receptor potential channels V1 and A1, which trigger a constant itching sensation that induces an increase in the severity of the lesions. NGF, produced by KCs and mast cells, is also involved in pruritus, both directly by peripheral nerve sensitization and indirectly by inducing the expression of neuropeptides such as the gene related to calcitonin peptide (cGRP) and substance P. Deeper studies are needed to decipher the exact role of cGRP in AD because recently cGRP has been described as a central negative regulator of ILC2-mediated allergic inflammation. Furthermore, it is known that TJs in the SG are involved in the protection of epidermal nerve endings from external stimuli by nerve pruning, a mechanism that is dysregulated when the epidermal barrier is impaired in an AD lesion, promoting the exposure of nerve endings to itch-inducing agents.\n\n    If there is a repetitive and persistent exposure to allergens, and the rash and itch of acute lesions progress uncontrolled, patients may develop chronic AD with skin lesions characterized by lichenification and dry fibrotic papules that presents hyperpigmented skin marks. Even, patients with moderate to severe AD can experience acute and chronic lesions simultaneously. In chronic stages, the inflammatory process becomes difficult to control. An augmentative and vicious circle is generated in which the damaged epidermis and the activated KCs induce skin dysbiosis and generate a cutaneous inflammatory response, accompanied by the sensation of itching, that triggers the desire to scratch, which subsequently enhances barrier disruption and closes the loop. At this stage, there is an intensification of the pre-existing inflammatory response. Th2 and Th22 cytokines are over-expressed, although a notable decrease of IL-4 and IL-4R is detected, accompanied by an upregulation of markers of the Th1 response, mainly IFN-gamma and, in a lower degree, of Th17. In this regard, it has recently been shown that the IL-4alpha receptor blockade upregulates IFN-gamma-producing cells after activation of lymphocytes from AD patients with staphylococcal enterotoxins B.\n\n    As shown in Figure 4, the large amounts of IL-25 released by KCs in chronic lesions maintain the production of IL-13, mainly by skin accumulated CD4+ T cells, which contributes to the remodeling processes of the epidermis and hyperplasia development. Mediators released from Th22 cells have also been associated with skin remodeling mechanisms by in vitro assays. The constant lesions generated by scratching induce the production of IL-23 by KCs, which have been shown to induce endogenous expression of IL-23 by DCs that, in turn, shift naive CD4+ T cells to Th22 differentiation, which releases high levels of IL-22 causing hyperplasia of the epidermis and chronicity. In addition, epidermal hyperinnervation, which is thought to underlie pruritus, has been observed in patients with AD. Analysis of skin biopsies from patients with chronic AD suggests that this may be due to an increase in NGF production and a decrease in the expression of the epidermal innervation regulatory protein semaphorin A3. Thus, experimental models of dry-skin, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that a decrease of epidermal nerve densities generates antipruritic effects. In relation to Th1 and Th17 cytokines, little information exists about their effects on KCs in chronic AD. Recently, IFN-gamma has been shown to inhibit claudin 1 expression via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in normal human KCs, which is reflected in the loss of TJ function in a model equivalent to human skin. Strikingly, IL-17A, which is also abundant in chronic lesions of AD, is able to revert TJ dysfunction induced by IFN-gamma. On the other hand, it has been observed that after KC damage, large amounts of ROS are expressed in skin biopsies, intensifying inflammatory responses and aggravating skin pathologies such as AD. In summary, all these mechanical and immunological stimuli cause hyperplasia of the epidermis and prominent hyperkeratosis with minimal spongiosis, shaping the characteristic lesions of chronic AD. However, more studies are needed to understand the predominant cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying AD chronic lesions, which will allow a better clinical follow-up of the patient and more efficient treatments.\n\n    Intercommunication of the KC with the complex microbiota that inhabit the skin is a relevant factor in maintaining the balance between health and disease. More than a commensal relation, microbiota and KCs work in a dynamic manner to generate a favorable ecosystem for both parties. However, when this relationship is interrupted, the normal functions of the skin are altered, making it prone to developing skin diseases.\n\n    Members of the genus Staphylococcus are common inhabitants of the skin; however, staphylococcal infections are frequent in impaired skin in AD. Colonization with S. aureus is present in 70% of AD patients with skin lesions and 39% in those with nonlesional skin. S. aureus exacerbates the inflammatory process in AD patients by direct interaction of its structural components and released exotoxins with molecular receptors of KCs (Figure 5). In human primary KCs, TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer activation by diacylated lipopeptides of S. aureus induces mRNA expression and release of TSLP. Moreover, Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit KC mobilization of hBD3 from the cytoplasm onto the bacterial surface of S. aureus, which, in turn, favors the continuous activation of TLR2/TLR6 and, consequently, sustained production of TSLP and more Th2 immune milieu. On the other hand, S. aureus produces and secretes toxins (exotoxins) that damage target cells (cytotoxins) or induce exacerbated cytokine production by stimulation of T cell (superantigens). For example, secreted alpha2-toxin, also known as phenol-soluble modulin-alpha2, triggers a potent induction of cell toxicity in KCs isolated from mice. In addition, staphylococcal epsilon-toxin is cytotoxic to KC and causes a proinflammatory reaction by induction of IL-8 by the cell, as well as delaying the proliferative capacity of immortalized human KCs. Superantigens have also been found to activate KCs. In cultured KCs from lesional skin of AD patients, increased expression of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and TNF-beta is induced after staphylococcal enterotoxins A or B, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 stimuli, as compared to those from nonlesional skin or from normal skin of nonatopic patients. Altered cytokine secretion in superantigens-challenged KCs may explain the increased inflammation in staphylococcal lesional skin. It is worthy of note that intracellular S. aureus invasion is a critical factor that promotes the persistence of chronic infections, since it allows evasion to antibiotic treatments. Bacterial adhesins in S. aureus allow bacterial adhesion to KCs and eventually internalization. Exposure of primary KCs to the secreted extracellular adherence protein from S. aureus favors bacterial adhesion and internalization, a mechanism that might be mediated by fibronectin as a bridging factor, and integrin alpha5beta1 in KCs.\n\n    Staphylococcus epidermidis, a member of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, together with the species Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis and Staphylococcus warneri, is one of the most prevalent components of the skin microbiota ubiquitously distributed. Although S. epidermidis is considered a commensal of the skin, eventually it may act as an opportunistic pathogen, and can even act in a mutualist manner with KCs. Once S. epidermidis has colonized external KCs, they stablish a commensal habitat by competing for substrate with other potential pathogens, such as S. aureus. Direct production of antimicrobial metabolites has been reported in S. epidermidis. The so-called inhibitory-type S. epidermidis, isolated from half of volunteer nasal cavities, can reduce biofilm formation of S. aureus. This inhibitory capacity is attributed to the S. epidermidis serine protease (Esp), which possess serine-protease activity. Remarkably, the microbicidal activity is most observed when combined with hBD2 secreted by KCs. In an experimental model of nasal infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), preinoculated mice with Esp-secreting S. epidermidis prevented the nasal colonization by MRSA. In addition to interfering with the colonization of other bacteria on the KC, S. epidermidis can modulate the inflammatory response of the KC. It has been demonstrated that the stimulation of primary human KCs by poly I:C through the TLR3 receptor induces the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha. Noteworthy is that poly(I:C)-treated KCs reduce the production of TNF-alpha when exocellular lipoteichoic acid from S. epidermidis (LTA-Se) is added. Moreover, in vivo experiments have demonstrated that LTA-Se prevents wound-induced IL-6, TNF-alpha and inflammation in wild-type mice, but this effect is missed in Tlr2-/- mice, suggesting that TLR2 stimulation by LTA-Se prevents inflammatory responses in KCs. Another important relation between KCs and S. epidermidis is the capacity to provide an adequate substrate and provide metabolites that improve protection. Autologous application of S. epidermidis on the skin of healthy subjects helped to improve skin moisture retention and to keep low acidic skin conditions through the secretion of glycerin, and lactic and propionic acids. These results open the possibility of evaluating S. epidermidis application as a new therapy in AD patients.\n\n    The main representative of the fungal flora of the skin is lipophilic yeast of the genus Malassezia spp.. However, Malassezia spp. can behave as opportunistic pathogens and are commonly presented in skin lesions of adult AD patients. Of the nine species found in healthy patients, four of them are frequently presented in patients with mild and severe AD, such as Malassezia globosa, Malassezia restricta, Malassezia sympodialis, and Malassezia furfur. Skin inflammatory processes in AD can be also mediated by the interaction of KCs with Malassezia species due to these fungi modulating the production of proinflammatory mediators. In vitro interaction of the human KC cell line HaCaT, (human, adult, low calcium, high temperature) with Malassezia species (M. furfur, M. globosa and M. restricta) induces the expression of IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1alpha, and this effect is mediated by the activation of TLR2. Some Malassezia species are responsible for the production of type 2 cytokines in KCs. The human primary KCs exposed to M. globosa result in an increment of IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 secretion, whereas M. restricta induces IL-4 secretion. As previously mentioned, TSLP has an important role on the induction of the type 2 inflammatory response, and its production has been demonstrated to be induced by M. globosa and M. restricta in KCs, which might be mediated by the activation of lysophosphatidic acid receptors 1 and 3 of KCs by the lipid layer of Malassezia.\n\n    The impaired skin barrier and the type 2 inflammatory response are important factors that allow higher susceptibility to viral infection in patients with AD. For example, skin from AD patients is characterized by overexpression of the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and, conversely, production of type 1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma is reduced, which in turns reduce the expression of the human cathelicidin LL-37. This condition makes KCs highly susceptible to experimental infection with the vaccinia virus, which is why AD patients are commonly excluded from smallpox vaccinations since the risk developing eczema vaccinatum is significantly increased. Moreover, eczema herpeticum results from the dissemination of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 or -2 in AD patients. In vitro studies have demonstrated that, in the presence of LL-37, the replication of HSV-2 in primary human KCs is reduced in a dose-dependent manner. An altered antiviral innate immune response in KCs has been proven to be due to reduced levels of the transcription factor specificity protein 1, which is related to an enhanced replication of vaccinia virus and HSV in AD patients and leads to the overexpression of TSLP and six members of the family of human kallikreins in the KCs. The frequency of AD is also potentially related to the susceptibility and persistence of high-risk HPVs. Certainly, compromised epithelial barrier function in AD makes an easy target for viral infection, and some viruses express proteins able to induce changes toward atopy. In transgenic mice (K14.E7), the expression of the oncoprotein E7 from HPV16 driven by the K14 promoter, which restricts the E7 expression to epithelial cells in the skin, results in the characteristic lesions of AD accompanied by increased production of TSLP and total IgE. Viral dsRNA and a Th2 cytokine milieu might promote type 2 inflammation through an induction of TSLP expression by KCs, suggesting the existence of a vicious cycle between AD and viral infections. In the case of the measles virus, some studies have described an increase in the incidence of AD after vaccination, while others have shown a decrease in the risk of AD after measles infection, or an improvement in skin lesion or immunological parameters after natural infection or vaccination. This controversy was addressed considering the role of KCs in the induction of atopy. When HaCaT cells were exposed to the measles virus, the expression of TSLP and CCL26 (eotaxin-3, a chemotactic factor for eosinophils and basophils) was diminished, while TGF-beta was overexpressed. In the same report, a clinical protocol in which patients with moderate AD received a measles vaccination demonstrated that lesional skin reduced the expression of TSLP and CCL26, which was accompanied with reduction of clinical scores of AD.\n\n    Although growing evidence about the interaction of skin with microbiota is more available every day, complete understanding of this complex relationship remains one of the major goals in the field. Undoubtedly, the discover of all mechanism generated by KC-microbiota interactions will provide insight into immunomodulatory activity in AD.\n\n    The great versatility of KCs has allowed their use as a model to study multiple pathological processes, including AD. These models are highly variable, but can be grouped into two- or three-dimensional groups.\n\n    Two-dimensional monolayer cultures are based on the adherence of cells to a glass or polystyrene surface that provides a mechanical support for the cells. In this way, the response of KCs to any damage can be specifically and easily evaluated. The sources of these cells are usually primary human KCs from a healthy patient or with AD, or immortalized human KCs. Monolayer cultures of KCs are achieved due to epidermal differentiation of KCs as a consequence of confluence, cell-cell interactions, or specific factors such as calcium or EGF under conditions of subconfluence.\n\n    The advantage of working with KCs from patients with AD as in vitro model of the pathology, is that these cells are already genetically modified and conditioned for the development of pathology. However, the pathological status of AD can be mimicked using normal human epidermal KCs (NHK) or immortalized cell lines. The most widely used cell line for this type of model is HaCaT cell line, that harbors nononcogenic mutations in the TP53 gene, and retains its differentiation properties. It is known that the exposure of KCs to type 2 cytokines, mainly IL-4 and IL-13, induces their differentiation to the pathophysiology conditions of AD. Accordingly, HaCaT cells exposed to both IL-4 or IL-13 attenuate the expression of genes that regulate epidermal cell structure and barrier function in the terminal stage of KC differentiation, such as proteins highly expressed in the SS and SG of healthy skin: K1, K10, DSM 1 and DSC 1. The effect is mediated through mechanisms dependent on the receptor IL-4Ralpha and STAT-6 at early stages of KC differentiation. Furthermore, human primary KCs treated with both IL-4 and IL-13 reduce the gene and protein expression of FLG; contrary to up-regulated expression generated by IFN-gamma exposure. Likewise, Dang et al. demonstrated that the silencing of FLG in NHKs in vitro causes a reduction in the protein expression of K5, K10 and K14, IVL, and TGM 1, along with an increase in LOR, altering the function of the cutaneous barrier mainly at the SC layer level. Furthermore, FLG silencing was accompanied by an increase in the generation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-2, as well as a decrease in IL-12 and IFN-gamma. In response to cytokines, NHK and HaCaT cells modify in a different manner the gene expression of proteins associated with the CCE. Thus, NHK cells stimulated by IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17A, or to a lesser extent with IL-22, decrease the expression of FLG, LOR and K10, and only when stimulated by IFN-gamma a significant increase in TGM 1 and TGM 2 is detected. HaCaT cells diminish the gene expression of K10 and IVL only in response to IL-4, and show an increase in FLG and TGM 2, suggesting that HaCaT cells might be a poor model to study the integrity of the epidermal barrier under a cytokine-dependent environment. However, hBD2 transcriptional profiles in response to IFN-gamma, IL-17A or IL-4 were similar between HaCaT cells and NHKs, being up-regulated in response to the first two cytokines and down-regulated upon stimulation with IL-4.\n\n    As previously mentioned, various in vivo experimental studies have shown that AD is a very complex pathology. Although it is characterized by the prevalence of a Th2 environment, IFN-gamma has been identified as a crucial cytokine in AD patients with chronic lesions. Therefore, it has been proposed that several in vitro models based on KC stimulation with cytokines can be used for a greater approximation to what really happens at molecular level in AD. Thus, the stimulation of HaCaT cells with IFN-gamma together with TNF-alpha for 6 h induces the expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, CCL17, CCL22 and IL-33 at the gene and protein level. Furthermore, after 24 h of exposure with the same cytokines, the up-regulated expression of CCL17, CCL22 and IL-33 is maintained, and a reduction in FLG and LOR mRNA levels is observed. When cells are stimulated with IL-4, only an increase in IL-13, IL-5 and IL-25 is shown, a phenomenon that is reversed when IL-4 is combined with TNF-alpha. Therefore, as long as the characteristics of the problem are adequately defined, the stimulation of cultured HaCaT cells with cytokines is a good approach for studying the cellular and molecular aspects of AD. Thus, as the experimental conditions get closer to the real pathophysiology, a better understanding of the disease will be obtained. However, the monolayer models present various limitations, prime among which is their lack of stratification; therefore, the interest in the development and characterization of the three-dimensional models is growing.\n\n    Three-dimensional models of human reconstructed epidermis arise from the differentiation of normal human KCs in a chemically defined medium under exposure to an air-liquid interface. There is a variant where the differentiation of KCs starts in a matrix formed by fibroblasts and collagen. Both models emerge as possible strategies in the study of pharmacological treatments for lesions of various origins. Particularly, addition of inflammatory molecules enables the creation of a compromised RE model presenting many AD-like characteristics, such as abnormal differentiation, higher secretion of proinflammatory molecules by KCs and a specific gene expression pattern. In this context, both the IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, TNF-alpha and the IL-4, IL-13, poli I:C, TNF-alpha inflammatory cocktails induce edema, better known as spongiosis, within the lower layer of the epidermis of a human reconstructed epidermis model, as well as TSLP secretion by KCs and the down-regulation of FLG gene expression. In relation to lipid composition, TNF-alpha alone or combined with Th2 cytokines and IL-31 only affects SC lipid composition, mimicking changes observed in AD patients.\n\n    The use of topical agents is still the strategy of choice for the treatment of AD. Although severe cases require a combinatory regimen with phototherapy, systemic antibiotics, immunomodulatory drugs or monoclonal antibodies, the modulation of the KC response in AD is key for patient recovery. Mostly, systemic therapies are directed to achieve a systemic immunomodulation of the cellular and molecular elements involved in the type 2 response. However, the KC is a cell that may actively induce exacerbation of the AD symptoms by the production of proinflammatory and prurigenic/pruritic mediators, so many of the topical treatments are focused on reducing this response.\n\n    Moisturizer products are highly recommended to improve moisture content in the SC, which is decreased in AD, as they help to treat xerosis and prevent allergen invasion and relapse of dermatitis, as well as suppression of itching by recovering and maintaining skin barrier functions. In a randomized controlled trial of infants with moderate to severe AD, it was revealed that regular emollient use reduced the need for topical corticosteroid use and improved symptoms. The use of topical corticosteroids together with emollients is a valuable therapeutic approach to reduce inflammation and pruritus. Hydrocortisone increases the activity of fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme in fatty acids synthesis in KCs in the SG that promotes the secretion of free fatty acids. Topical betamethasone was shown to normalize epidermal differentiation and reduce epidermal hyperproliferation, although it led to epidermal thinning. Betamethasone also promoted a diminution of the transepidermal water loss in AD patients. However, in a post-treatment phase, an impairment of skin barrier function was measured as the rates of water accumulation returned to initial levels. Although these results indicate the effect of betamethasone on skin hydration, it might also modify the induction of the type 2 cutaneous response since it is able to downregulate TSLP expression in NHK. Although antihistamines are not recommended, they still represent the therapeutic regimen of choice among dermatologist for the treatment of pruritus. Particularly, sedating antihistamines are used in the pediatric population to help patients with a negative impact of AD on sleep. Cetirizine, a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, has shown an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro that is mediated by the reduction of IL-8 production on the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-stimulated human KC A431 cell line. Moreover, in a direct form, cetirizine also inhibits MIF production in A431 cells. However, no evidence of improvement of clinical signs of AD was observed in patients treated with oral H1 antihistamines, included cetirizine, as an adjuvant therapy alongside topical agents.\n\n    Although topical corticosteroids are the standard treatment in AD, inhibitors of calcineurin topically applied, mainly tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are broadly used since few adverse effects have been reported. Although tacrolimus (FK506) has a relatively high molecular weight (822 Da) and shows good skin penetration activity, it is commonly used topically in conjunction with paraffin-based ointments. The immunomodulatory effect of tacrolimus is mediated after binding immunophilins (mainly FK506-binding protein-12, FKBP-12) and the formed complex (tacrolimus - FKBP-12) then binds to the phosphatase calcineurin and inhibits phosphatase activity, which in turn prevents the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) dephosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus. Hence, it suppresses the activation of T cells by reducing the production of IL-2 and other proinflammatory cytokines. The anti-inflammatory activity of tacrolimus has been observed in KCs. When NHKs are exposed to UVB, the secretion of TNF-alpha is significantly increased, as in the milieu of AD. However, when KCs are treated with tacrolimus, the activation and translocation of NF-kB is reduced in a dose-dependent manner that downregulates the production of TNF-alpha. Moreover, in TNF-alpha-stimulated NHKs, the secretion of TGF-beta is incremented by tacrolimus and, conversely, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is downregulated, which probably is associated with its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of AD. The chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) is a potent inductor for eosinophils that is increased in lesional skin of AD patients and is produced by KCs after stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. In Korean AD patients, daily treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment for 8 weeks significantly reduced the number of RANTES-positive cells in lesional skin. In human KCs, the overexpression of RANTES induced by IFN-gamma and IL-4 is significantly reduced by 10-8 or 10-6 M of tacrolimus, indicating its possible role in the amelioration of AD through KCs targeting. On the other hand, the pimecrolimus (DZ ASM 981) immunomodulatory mechanism of action is similar to that of tacrolimus, although less information is available concerning its effects on KCs. In a model of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD in NC/Nga mice, topical treatment with pimecrolimus reduced the expression of TSLP, which, as previously mentioned, is an IL-7-like cytokine highly expressed in KCs after stimuli. In addition, pimecrolimus impaired the activation of NFAT2 in human KCs from the outer root sheath and some of the inner root sheath of the hair follicles.\n\n    Finally, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is an enzyme degrading cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Among PDE4 inhibitors, apremilast and crisaborole have been broadly used in the treatment of AD, proving to be modest to highly effective in cases of moderate to severe AD. In AD patients, PDE4 is highly active in mononuclear leukocytes. Moreover, in IL-1alpha-stimulated primary human KCs, the mRNA expression of IL-8 and TNF-alpha is reduced in a dose-dependent fashion in presence of the novel and selective PDE4 inhibitor DRM02. However, posterior evidence has demonstrated that mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha and CXCL8 in PGE2-treated NHKs treated with apremilast is reduced, without changes in phosphorylation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway, suggesting an alternative cAMP-independent mechanism that down-regulates these mediators. In human KCs, apremilast reduces the expression of the inflammatory mediators IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-31, CCL5, and alarmins S100A7, S100A8 and S100A12, under stimulation of the type 2 cytokine IL-4. Then, PDE4 inhibitors demonstrate favorable improvement on the severity of AD by targeting the response of KCs.",

        "Conclusion": "    AD is a heterogeneous skin disease characterized by skin barrier dysfunction, skin inflammation and intense pruritus. Although great advances in the understanding of this cutaneous disease have been achieved over the last years, its pathogenesis is still enigmatic, resulting in a lack of specific treatments. This is further complicated by the lack of data to address whether acute and chronic AD represent progressive stages across a continuum of inflammatory responses, or if each has distinct immunologic mechanisms and diversity among individual patients. However, it is evident that the complex interplay of KCs with environmental agents, skin microbiota, inflammatory cells, and nerves is critical in AD onset, development, progression and chronicity. Current advances in understanding the accurate participation of KCs in AD pathogenic mechanisms may facilitate new drug development, as KC restoration improves local immune dysregulation and avoids cutaneous infection.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

        "Title": "    Colostrum-supplemented transition milk positively affects serum biochemical parameters, humoral immunity indicators and the growth performance of calves",
        "Abstract": "    Transition milk supplementation with colostrum improves calves growth.\n\n    Extending colostrum feeding period positively affected multiple blood variables.\n\n    Supplemented calves had lower disease incidence.\n\n    The aim of this study was to determine the effect of colostrum-supplemented transition milk on the growth rate of newborn calves. Thirty-six day-old female Holstein calves with a birth weight of 43.4 +- 5.5 kg were randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group. On day 1, all calves received one portion (3 kg) of colostrum within 2 h after birth. Between the second feeding and the age of 5 days, control calves received only transition milk that had been collected from dams shortly before feeding, and the treatment group received 1.5 kg of colostrum collected from dams on day 1 and 1.5 kg of transition milk from subsequent milkings. Monthly body weight and average daily gain were used to measure growth performance. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at multiple time points to evaluate the biochemical and immune status of calves. Colostrum-supplemented transition milk increased the concentrations of serum immunoglobulins, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and total protein. The activity of lactate-dehydrogenase and ceruloplasmin decreased, whereas lysozyme activity increased with time in the control group. It can be concluded that additional five days of colostrum feeding positively influences non-specific humoral immunity indicators and serum biochemical parameters in dairy calves.",
        "Introduction": "    High morbidity and mortality rates of calves can cause significant economic loss and reduce the profitability of milk production. Thus, proper calf management and rearing are important considerations in livestock production. Newborn calves are agammaglobulinemic and susceptible to infection. To prevent health problems, calves acquire immunity from colostrum which is a natural source of immune factors and nutrients. In this paper, colostrum will be defined as a secretion collected from the first milking, while milk from subsequent milkings is referred to as \"transition milk\".\n\n    It has been suggested that calves should be fed only high-quality colostrum containing at least 50 g/L of immunoglobulins (IgG). However, IgG concentrations in bovine colostrum can vary. Several factors have been shown to affect IgG concentrations in colostrum, including parity, breed, age, the metabolic status of dam, and the length of the dry period. Inadequate colostrum intake and its poor quality can result in the failure of passive transfer (FPT) which is a commonly encountered problem whose causes and consequences have been well documented. FPT is diagnosed when IgG serum concentrations drop below 10 g/L during the first 24 h after birth. Serum IgG levels higher than 10 g/L point to successful passive transfer of immunity. In calves, morbidity and mortality are minimized when IgG serum levels exceed 16 g/L. Immunoglobulins are absorbed most effectively during the first 24 h postpartum; therefore, calves should receive 2 to 4 L of colostrum during the first feeding within the first 6 h postpartum. Importantly, the volume offered to the calf should depend on the quality of colostrum. Ideally, the portion should provide at least 200 g of IgG, which is regarded as sufficient for reaching IgG serum concentration higher than 10 g/L. Additionally, colostrum contains more vital ingredients such as maternal leukocytes, growth factors, hormones, cytokines and nonspecific antimicrobial factors. These immunological and biochemical components also protect agammaglobulinemic calves and support the establishment and development of the gut microbiome. Despite the benefits of colostrum, artificial feeding (for example, with the use of an oroesophageal tube) is the method of choice in calves that experience problems with colostrum drinking to prevent FPT. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the supplementation of transition milk with colostrum could improve the immune status and blood biochemical parameters of calves and, consequently, their growth performance.",
        "Methods": "    The study was conducted on a commercial free-stall dairy farm located in the north-eastern region of Poland (Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship), where approximately 370 Polish Holstein-Fresian lactating cows were housed and fed according to the recommendations of the German Agricultural Society (Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft, DLG). During the dry period, all cows were vaccinated against colibacillosis and rota- and coronaviruses. Cows in maternity pens were monitored until calving. After birth, female calves born within two months (mean birth weight 43.4 +- 5.5 kg) to primiparous and multiparous dams [(the average parity of the dams was 2.47 +- 0.47, Mean +- SEM for control group (CR) and 2.39 +- 0.36, Mean +- SEM for treatment group, (TRT)] were assigned to a CR (n = 17) or a TRT (n = 18). After parturition calves were separated from dams and kept in individual pens until transfer (at the age of 3 months) to another building within the farm where they were placed in group pens. Additionally, after parturition, colostrum was harvested from each dam within 1 h post partum. In the TRT group, all colostrum collected on the first day (two milkings) was pooled in 1 kg bottles separately for each calf, and kept in the freezer (-20 C). Calves were fed only from colostrum and/or transition milk milked from their dams. Before feeding to calves, colostrum was thawed in a warm water bath (not exceeding 40 C). Colostrum temperature was checked before feeding. The target temperature of colostrum was approximately 39 C.\n\n    Until 5 d of age, all calves were fed twice a day (3 kg/feeding; 0800 h and 1600 h) according to the described regimen. On d 1, all calves received one portion (3 kg) of colostrum within 2 h after birth. Between the second feeding and the age of 5 days, CR calves received only transition milk that had been collected from dams shortly before feeding, whereas TRT calves received 1.5 kg of colostrum collected from dams on day 1 and 1.5 kg of transition milk from subsequent milkings (6 kg/d in total). Beginning on d 6, all calves were placed on an identical feeding regimen. All calves received milk replacer (MR; All Milk Protein; 21% of CP and 18% of fat on a DM basis; Polmass SA, Bydgoszcz, Poland) between d 6 and d 90, that was formulated to obtain 100 g DM/L. MR volume was decreased on subsequent days from 6.0 L/calf/day (between d 6 to d 10) to 4.0 L/calf/day (between d 11 and 30) and to 3.0 L/calf/day (between d 31 and d 90). Calves had unlimited access to fresh water from d 1.\n\n    Between d 11 and d 30, calves were fed solid feed (textured starter (CS); ground triticale and straw) ad libitum. From d 31, corn silage was introduced to the diet at 0.5 kg/d, whereas CS and triticale meal were limited to 1.0 kg/d. Between d 61 and d 90, calves received 2.0 kg of CS, 1.0 kg of ground triticale and 1.5 kg of corn silage. At 91 d of age, all calves were fed a diet that met their nutrient requirements according to DLG recommendations and contained soybean meal (0.5 kg/d), rapeseed meal (0.3 kg/d), triticale (1.5 kg/d), vitamin premix (0.2 kg/d) and molasses pulp (0.5 kg/d). The MR and CS used in this study contained no antibiotics, and the quality of feedstuffs was controlled by a licensed nutritionist. The trial lasted until 180 d of age, and it was conducted from September 2012 to April 2013 (Table 1 ).\n\n    Blood was collected from the jugular vein of each calf on d 1, 3, 5, 15, 30 and 60 of age, into 9 mL Vacuette  Serum Separation probes. Sampling was done 2 h after morning feeding. Blood was left to clot at 36 C and subsequently centrifuged (10 min x 3000 rpm; MPW 223e centrifuge, MPW Med. Instruments, Warsaw, Poland). The serum was collected and frozen at\n\n    -20 C until analysis. Immunological parameters (total IgG (IgG) content, activity of lysozyme (lys) and ceruloplasmin (cp)) and biochemical parameters (liver enzymes: aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase (AST, ALT), cholesterol (chol), glucose (gluc), urea (urea), alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides (TAG), creatinine (crea) and total protein (TP) content) were analyzed. The concentrations of IgG and TP were measured according to the colorimetric micromethod (Sigma, Diagnostic Kits) proposed by and modified by. Lysozyme activity was determined by the turbidimetric method developed by and modified by, and cp activity was evaluated according to the method of. The activity (U/L) of ALT, AST, AP and LDH was determined by the kinetic method proposed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC). The concentrations (mg/dL) of crea, urea, TAG, gluc, and chol were measured by the modified method of Jaffe (crea), the urease-glutamate dehydrogenase UV method (urea), the glucose oxidase-peroxidase method (gluc), the glycerokinase peroxidase-peroxidase method (TAG), and the cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase method (chol). All biochemical parameters were determined using the MINDRAY BS-120 automatic biochemistry analyzer (Mindray Medical International Ltd., Shenzhen, China) and diagnostic kits (Alpha Diagnostics, Warsaw, Poland).\n\n    Additionally, IgG concentration was estimated with commercial Bovine IgG ELISA test (Cat. No. E11-118; Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, 100 microL of standards and samples were loaded onto a 96-well plate and left for\n\n    1 h. The plate was then washed four times, followed by addition of detection antibodies into each well and incubated for 1 h. After the incubation plate was washed, streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP) was loaded to each well. After 30 min of incubation substrate was loaded into the wells and left for 30 min. Next, the reaction was stopped with addition of sulfuric acid, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm with Tecan Sunrise microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland). Samples were analyzed in duplicate and all steps were performed at room temperature.\n\n    Each calf was examined daily by one of the team members who was at the farm during the experimental period. All records were collected after morning feeding. Diarrhea was diagnosed according to the protocol given by. Scoring included fecal fluidity (from 1 to 4; 1 = normal, 4 = watery) and consistency (from 1 to 5; 1 = normal, 5 = constipated). Diarrhea was diagnosed if calf scored at least 3 in fluidity but no more than 3 in consistency for two days in a row. Respiratory disease was diagnosed if at least two of given symptoms occurred simultaneously (coughing, serious nasal and lachrymal discharge, increased respiratory rate, increased breath sounds, and pyrexia), as described by. Additionally, the effect of colostrum-supplemented transition milk on the growth performance of calves was determined based on changes in body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG). Starting on d 1, all animals used in the experiment were weighed on a monthly basis until 6 months of age.\n\n    The data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure developed by the SAS Institute (2018), using repeated measures with a first-order autoregressive covariance structure in time. The model included the fixed effects of treatment, time (d or week), and the interaction between treatment and time. The Bonferroni correction method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. The results are presented as least squares means and SEM. The threshold of significance was set at P <= 0.05.",
        "Results": "    The mean concentration of colostral IgG in dams was 82.7 g/L in the CR group and 71.7 g/L in the TRT group (P < 0.05). Twenty-four h after calving, only one out of 35 calves enrolled to the study failed to reach the 10 g/L serum IgG threshold. In contrast, 35% of CR calves (6/17) and 22% of TRT calves (4/18) had IgG below 16 g/L. In TRT calves, average serum IgG levels were higher than in the CR group (Fig. 1 a) throughout the experiment. Despite lower average IgG concentrations in colostrum, one day-old TRT calves had 12% higher serum IgG concentrations relative to CR calves. It should be noted that serum IgG concentrations on d 1 exceeded 16 g/L in both groups. At the end of the transition milk feeding period (d 5), serum IgG levels were 57% higher in TRT calves than in CR animals (P < 0.05). However, on d 60 the difference decreased to 18% in favor of TRT calves (P < 0.05). Of note, in TRT group compared with CR, we recorded lower incidence of diarrhea (6 vs 10 cases, respectively) and respiratory disorders (2 vs 3 cases, respectively).\n\n    Colostrum-supplemented transition milk decreased lys activity in TRT calves (P < 0.05) compared with CR calves (Fig. 1b). Although on d 1, lys activity was 51% lower in TRT calves than in CR calves, the difference between groups was minimized to 34% on d 5 (P < 0.05). At the end of the experiment, lys activity was 27% higher in CR calves than in TRT calves. Most importantly, TRT calves had lower overall lys activity throughout the experiment (P < 0.05). Although cp concentration was higher in TRT calves than in CR calves, significant differences were observed only at 3 and 30 d of age (6% and 9%, respectively).\n\n    The effect of colostrum-supplemented transition milk on selected serum biochemical variables (ALT, AST, AP, LDH, gluc, chol, TAG, urea, crea and TP) is presented in Table 2 . The treatment influenced LDH activity and the blood concentrations of chol, TAG, TP and urea (P < 0.05), but not the activity of ALT, AST and AP, or gluc and crea levels. All analyzed biochemical parameters were affected by sampling time (P < 0.05). The time x treatment effect was observed for AST, AP, chol, TAG, urea and crea (P < 0.05).\n\n    In comparison with calves from the CR group, calves from the TRT group had lower ALT activity between d 1 and d 15, but the noted difference was not significant (Fig. 2 a). AST activity was 15% higher in TRT calves on d 1, but it decreased on d 15 and d 30 relative to CR calves (P < 0.05) (by 10% and 17%, respectively) (Fig. 2b). On d 60, average AST activity was similar in both groups. AP activity varied throughout the experiment. On d 1, AP activity was 31% higher in TRT calves, whereas on d 3 and d 5 it decreased by 13% and 10%, respectively (P < 0.05). On subsequent days, AP activity increased in TRT calves to reach 142% of the average value determined in the CR group, but on d 60, the difference fell to 14% in favor of TRT calves (P < 0.05). Although LDH activity was lower in the CR group throughout the experiment, differences between groups were observed only on d 1 and d 60 (Fig. 2d) (P < 0.05).\n\n    The effect of colostrum-supplemented transition milk on the serum concentrations of gluc, chol, TAG and TP at different time points is presented in Fig. 3 a-d. TRT calves had higher average concentrations of chol and TP compared with CR calves (by 28% and 8%, respectively; P < 0.05) at each time point, but colostrum-supplemented transition milk had a significant effect only on chol levels. In TRT calves, average TAG concentrations were 49% higher between d 1 and d 15, and 16% lower on d 30 and d 60 relative to CR calves (P < 0.05). Colostrum-supplemented transition milk had no significant effect on serum gluc concentrations in calves.\n\n    In contrast, urea and crea levels were affected by colostrum-supplemented transition milk (Fig. 4 ). On average, the treatment led to a 10% decrease in serum urea concentrations in the TRT group (P < 0.05). The treatment also lowered crea concentrations (Fig. 4b) in TRT calves between d 3 and d 60, but a significant treatment effect was reported only on d 1, 3 and 5.\n\n    Colostrum-supplemented transition milk influenced BW and ADG (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5 a-b). The average birth weight was 43 kg (42 kg in the CR group and 44 kg in the TRT group), without significant differences between groups. Between weaning and 3 months of age, CR calves were characterized by higher ADG than TRT calves. However, after weaning, ADG was 30% higher in the TRT group between 3 and 6 months of age (P < 0.05). Differences in BW were not observed between groups until 5 months of age. However, at 6 months of age, TRT calves were 9% heavier than CR calves (205 kg vs. 188 kg; P < 0.05).",
        "Conclusion": "    In conclusion, this study revealed the benefits of transition milk supplementation with colostrum. Additional volumes of colostrum in the diet positively influenced non-specific humoral immunity indicators and serum biochemical parameters in Holstein calves. Colostrum-supplemented transition milk decreased the prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhea incidence. An alternative strategy of calf feeding when high-quality colostrum is unavailable was also proposed in the study.",
        "Discussion": "    Blood IgG concentrations in newborn calves are closely related to the quality of colostrum. According to the current industrial recommendations, colostrum should contain at least 50 g/L of immunoglobulins to prevent FPT. In the present study, average IgG concentration in colostrum determined for the entire herd was 77.2 g/L, which points to its high quality. The calculated average concentration of IgG was higher than that noted by (65.5 g/L) but lower than that reported by (79.5 g/L). According to several authors, FPT is diagnosed if serum IgG falls below 10 g/L within 24-32 h after birth. In our experiment, only one CR calf failed to reach the recommended threshold within 24 h after birth. Moreover, despite lower colostrum quality, colostrum-supplemented transition milk increased serum IgG concentrations in calves receiving the treatment. In this study, colostrum-supplemented transition milk seem to offer more effective immunological protection due to increased serum IgG concentrations on d 60. In the CR group, 60% of calves were treated for diarrhea. Additionally, the incidence of respiratory disorders in this group reached 18%. Our results correspond with those reported by, but are higher than those noted by and. In contrast, the incidence of diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections in TRT calves was 40% and 33%, respectively, supporting a positive effect of colostrum-supplemented transition milk on the health status of calves. Although IgG are absorbed most effectively within the first 20 h postpartum, the efficiency of this process drops rapidly 12 h after delivery, it seems that the applied treatment enhanced acquiring immunity in supplemented calves.\n\n    In our study, calves from the TRT group had lower lys activity than calves from the CR group. Lys is an antimicrobial enzyme that is found in cells and tissues and is involved in non-specific innate immunity; therefore, increased lys activity in early stages of life might be considered beneficial. Calves from the CR group were characterized by lower values of growth parameters than calves from the TRT group. The absence of clinical disease symptoms and improved growth in the TRT group point to reduced absorption of lys from colostrum, but are not indicative of subclinical infections. Previous research indicates that glycation, a posttranslational protein modification which requires the presence of proteins and sugars in the same matrix, significantly decreases lys activity. However, the above conclusions should be formulated with caution due to limited data on changes in lys activity in newborn calves.\n\n    The activity of cp, a non-specific humoral immunity indicator, is yet another health status parameter that was analyzed in this study. According to, an increase in cp activity during the first days of life is linked with liver function after birth. Thus, our observations of changes in cp activity, accompanied by higher IgG concentrations and lower lys activity, indicate that alterations in cp levels are associated with Cu release from the liver. The above phenomenon as well as the lower incidence of clinical symptoms of infection and a fast growth rate of calves can be attributed to the healthy development of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n    Multiple blood variables were measured during the experiment. The effect of aging on changes in biochemical parameters has been widely discussed. However, the aim of this study was to determine alterations in selected parameters associated with gastrointestinal function as a natural consequence of experimental diet manipulation. ALT, AST, and AP are non-specific enzymatic disease markers associated with liver function, growth and development of skeletal muscles and bone mineralization. In our study, colostrum-supplemented transition milk had no effect on ALT and AST activity (Table 2), which can be considered desirable. Any changes in the activity of those enzymes should be treated with caution and approached as a potential marker of liver dysfunction. It should be noted that increased AST activity in ruminants was associated with liver damage caused by high-grain diets. According to, increased AP and LDH activity in the first stage of life is related to colostrum ingestion. Our findings confirm this hypothesis. The average activity of AP and LDH was higher in TRT calves that gained weight at a faster rate. Rapid weight gain requires better bone mineralization which stimulates AP release. LDH is also considered as a non-specific marker of disease since there are many factors contributing to its activity variations. Additionally, LDH activity differ between tissues, cells, fluids and those differences can be enhanced depending on the disease the animal is suffering from. For instance, some authors link increased LDH activity with muscular dystrophy, but it was not the case in our study since we did not observe any symptoms of this disease. On the contrary, there are reports suggesting LDH fluctuations during respiratory diseases. However, we did not analyze each isoform separately, therefore any conclusion coming from our study should be drawn with caution.\n\n    Calves from the TRT group were characterized by higher values of Glu, chol, TAG, and TP. According to, in the first stage of life, glu levels are associated with colostrum intake, whereas in later stages, an increase in glu concentrations is linked with up-regulated corticosteroid secretion due to intensified growth. The latter increases chol and TAG levels. The concentrations of glu, chol, and TAG can be altered by infection or diet. This observation is consistent with our results because the incidence of diarrhea was higher in the CR group than in the TRT group (10 vs. 6 diarrhea cases, respectively). suggested that TP is a potential FPT diagnostic tool. In the proposed approach, serum TP levels should not decrease below 52 g/L 72 h postpartum. In our study, the average TP concentration in CR calves at 3 d of age was 51.3 g/L, which indicates that the suggested safety threshold was not reached. Indeed TP was correlated with IgG concentration (P < 0.001), however correlation coefficient indicated moderate link between both parameters (r = 0.437; Figure S1). In 8 out of 17 calves in the CR group TP was below the recommended level of 52 g/L. In contrast, only one TRT calf failed to reach the TP concentration of 52 g/L. These results corroborate previous research findings.\n\n    Urea and crea were monitored as the biochemical indicators of hydration. An increase in urea levels that is not accompanied by changes in crea levels is associated with diarrhea incidence rates. This observation is consistent with our findings. All cases of diarrhea were recorded until 21 d of age, thus reflecting changes in urea and crea. Interestingly, calves from the TRT group were diagnosed with diarrhea at an earlier stage of life, but the supplementation of transition milk with colostrum delivered health benefits at later stages. In previous studies, elevated crea levels were noted in calves when skeletal muscles were used as a source of energy. This is a highly undesirable situation which negatively affects the growth and development of calves. A decline in urea concentrations was also reported as a potential indicator of accelerated growth in calves.",

        "Title": "    Detrimental NFKB1 missense variants affecting the Rel-homology domain of p105/p50",
        "Abstract": "    Most of the currently known heterozygous pathogenic NFKB1 (Nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1) variants comprise deleterious defects such as severe truncations, internal deletions, and frameshift variants. Collectively, these represent the most frequent monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) identified so far. NFKB1 encodes the transcription factor precursor p105 which undergoes limited proteasomal processing of its C-terminal half to generate the mature NF-kappaB subunit p50. Whereas p105/p50 haploinsufficiency due to devastating genetic damages and protein loss is a well-known disease mechanism, the pathogenic significance of numerous NFKB1 missense variants still remains uncertain and/or unexplored, due to the unavailability of accurate test procedures to confirm causality. In this study we functionally characterized 47 distinct missense variants residing within the N-terminal domains, thus affecting both proteins, the p105 precursor and the processed p50. Following transient overexpression of EGFP-fused mutant p105 and p50 in HEK293T cells, we used fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and reporter assays to analyze their effects on subcellular localization, protein stability and precursor processing, DNA binding, and on the RelA-dependent target promoter activation, respectively. We found nine missense variants to cause harmful damage with intensified protein decay, while two variants left protein stability unaffected but caused a loss of the DNA-binding activity. Seven of the analyzed single amino acid changes caused ambiguous protein defects and four variants were associated with only minor adverse effects. For 25 variants, test results were indistinguishable from those of the wildtype controls, hence, their pathogenic impact remained elusive. In summary, we show that pathogenic missense variants affecting the Rel-homology domain may cause protein-decaying defects, thus resembling the disease-mechanisms of p105/p50 haploinsufficiency or may cause DNA-binding deficiency. However, rare variants (with a population frequency of less than 0.01%) with minor abnormalities or with neutral tests should still be considered as potentially pathogenic, until suitable tests have approved them being benign.",
        "Introduction": "    Heterozygous pathogenic sequence variants in NFKB1 have been identified as the most frequent monogenic cause in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)-like diseases. NFKB1 encodes the cytoplasmic transcription factor precursor p105, which undergoes limited proteasomal processing of its C-terminal half, whereby the shorter p50 subunit is generated. Both p105 and p50 are core molecules of the canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Additional members of the NF-kappaB transcription factor family are the non-canonical p52 and its precursor p100 (encoded by NFKB2), RelA (also known as p65), RelB and cRel. All NF-kappaB proteins share the multifunctional N-terminal Rel-homology domain (RHD), which mediates interaction with inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) proteins, dimerization, nuclear translocation and DNA-binding. The active NF-kappaB transcription factor complexes are composed of various homo- and hetero-dimeric combinations of the NF-kappaB and Rel proteins. Only the Rel-proteins are equipped with a transactivation domain. Hence, assembling a transcriptional activator requires p50 (as well as p52) to interact with one of the Rel proteins, whereas p50 homodimers are repressors of transcription. The regulation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor activity is mainly achieved by retention of the dimers within the cytoplasmic compartment through IkappaB proteins.\n\n    Routine sequencing and systematic genetic studies in patients with suspected inborn errors of immunity (primary immunodeficiency diseases, PID) enabled the identification of numerous NFKB1 sequence variants. The pathogenic potential of these genetic lesions comprises \"early\" truncating mutations, predicting the expression of severely shortened, non-functional proteins and internal deletions, causing profound protein defects. In both cases, mRNA and/or protein decay is assumed to lead to insufficiency of p105 and p50. In fact, a recent comprehensive study has confirmed a deleterious character of most of the 41 investigated variants in this category. In addition, frameshift variants in the central part of p105, predict immediate expression of p50-like proteins, which by-pass the precursor stage, as well as the sporadically occurring C-terminal truncations, are also considered to have a pathogenic effect, although the disease-causing mechanisms are still unknown for both entities. The pathogenic significance of most (51/54 and 31/33) of the identified NFKB1 missense alterations, however, remained uncertain unless experimental confirmation of their causality became available. Amino acid changes localizing to the N-terminal half (aa 1-433) affect both the p105 precursor and the p50 subunit. In contrast, missense alterations in the C-terminal half of p105 (aa 434-969) are removed once (if) the precursor proteins undergo processing, which would convert them into wildtype p50 proteins.\n\n    In a recent report, we used a standard cell culture model, based on transient transfection of HEK293T cells with EGFP-fused p105 and p50 constructs, enabling functional assessments of NFKB1 missense variants. Subsequent analyses, including expression and subcellular localization of the overexpressed proteins as well as p50-dependent DNA-binding and RelA-mediated reporter gene activation, confirmed a detrimental protein loss caused by a single amino acid change (p.Tyr350Cys) in a CVID family with p105/p50 haploinsufficiency.\n\n    In the current study, we assessed 47 distinct N-terminal p50 missense alterations, including 39 variants from the Tuijnenburg and Lorenzini cohorts, four variants described elsewhere and four previously uncharacterized variants. We found nine single amino acid substitutions within the Rel-homology domain causing protein-decaying defects. Two variants caused a loss of the DNA-binding function, while protein stability remained unaffected. Several variants showed subtle abnormalities indicating diverse, yet unspecified functional impairment. We reconcile our findings with previous cohort studies and with a recent elegant functional in vitro report, in which p105/p50 deficient HEK293T cells were used in combination with a homodimerization-defective RelA mutant, to test 170 N-terminal missense variants for p50-dependent reporter gene activation). A set of case vignettes is attached and confirms the known variability of the NFKB1 disease phenotypes.",
        "Methods": "    The missense variants analyzed in this study have mostly been identified in previous studies ( Table 1  and References therein). The majority of the selected variants remained of uncertain significance (VUS), although their pathogenic potential has been estimated using in silico prediction tools. We restricted our functional characterization to missense variants residing with the N-terminal half of the p105 precursor, which corresponds to the mature p50, because our experimental tests are not suitable for variants localizing to the processible C-terminal half (which generates wildtype p50 proteins in these cases). Each variant was manually assessed using commonly accessible platforms such as dbSNP ; Genome Aggregation Database , Mutation Taster , SIFT  Polyphen-2  and Ensembl Genome Browser .\n\n    All in vitro methods used in this study were previously described in extensive detail. Briefly, HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco`s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin under standard conditions and plated onto collagen-coated 48-well culture plates or glass coverslips prior to transfection with plasmid DNA constructs using X-tremeGENE HP reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Mutations were introduced into the cDNAs encoding N-terminally EGFP-tagged wildtype p105 or p50 by site-directed mutagenesis using overlap-extension PCR.\n\n    Cells were seeded onto collagenized glass coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with the indicated constructs. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma/Merck, Darmstadt Germany) and coverslips were mounted onto glass slides. Microscopic photographs were taken using a Zeiss Axio Observer (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a 40x/0.75 objective and processed with ZEN-blue software.\n\n    Crude cell lysates were prepared in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1% sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), 1% protease inhibitor cocktail) and separated on discontinuous 5%/9% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and processed for detection with an Odyssey CLx infrared scanner (LI-COR Biosciences, Bad Homburg, Germany). Primary antibodies were rabbit-anti-NF-kappaB1 #13586 (raised against residues surrounding Ile415 of mouse NF-kappaB1 to simultaneously detect p105 and p50) and mouse-anti-beta-actin #3700 (both from Cell Signaling; NEB; Frankfurt, Germany). Signals were detected with IRDye-coupled goat-anti-rabbit and goat-anti-mouse secondary antibodies (LI-COR).\n\n    Nuclear proteins were prepared from transfected cells following previously described procedures using a modified buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM KCl, 0.05% NP40, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1% protease inhibitor cocktail). Binding reactions with DY681-labelled annealed oligos (forward 5`- AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C - 3` and reverse 5`- GCC TGG GAA AGT CCC CTC AAC T -3`) were carried out in 1x binding buffer (10mM Tris pH 7.4; 1mM EDTA; 100mM KCl; 0.25mM DTT; 0.25% Tween-20; 5% glycerol; 0.01% BSA; 100ng/microl poly-dI:dC). Samples were separated on 6% polyacrylamide/1x Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) gels and visualized with an Odyssey CLx infrared scanner (LI-COR).\n\n    An NF-kappaB responsive red-fluorescence reporter was generated by replacing the CMV-promoter in the ptdTomato vector (Takara/Clontech; Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) with an artificial promoter composed of five NF-kappaB consensus binding sites, introduced via synthetic oligonucleotides at the 5`end of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) minimal promoter fragment. Expression vector constructs for N-terminally EGFP-tagged wildtype or mutant p105 or p50 (300ng per well each) and non-tagged RelA (5ng per well if not indicated otherwise) were transfected together with the reporter gene vector (100ng per well) into HEK293T cells grown on collagenized 48-well plates. Non-transfected, reporter-only and reporter-plus-RelA-only samples were included as controls. Fluorescence intensities were determined in live cells using a FluoroSpot Analyzer (CTL Immunospot, Bonn, Germany) with separate recordings of the tdTomato (red) and the EGFP (green) signals in each well. Plates were scanned repeatedly within 42-48 and 66-72 hours after transfection using variable magnifications and exposure settings. Fluorescence values were quantified with ImageJ and normalized to the \"reporter only\" baseline control which was defined as 1-fold.\n\n    NFKB1 constructs, cloned with N-terminal MAC-tags, were used to generate stable cell lines from Flp-In T-REx 293 cell lines (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, R78007). Cell lines construct expression was induced, at 70% confluency, with 2mg/ml tetracycline and for BioID samples, additional 50mM biotin was added. Cells were harvested 24 hours after induction. Two biological replicates were prepared for both affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and BioID, for each cell line, with 1.5*10^8 cells harvested per sample. Interaction analysis was done according to the previously described workflow. Each sample was analyzed twice as technical replicates.",
        "Results": "    In this study, we analyzed 47 NFKB1 missense variants for deleterious effects. All variants reside within the N-terminal half of the p105 precursor protein, which corresponds to the mature p50 ( Figure 1 ). We employed a previously introduced in vitro procedure, comprising transient overexpression of N-terminally tagged EGFP fusion constructs of mutant p105 and/or p50 proteins in HEK293T cells. The ectopically expressed proteins were subsequently analyzed for stability and sustainability, for their sub-cellular localization and DNA-binding activity and for their ability to activate a reporter gene. For a full-panel analysis including both p105 and p50 we selected 22 variants, which were either identified in our cohort or were previously confirmed or assumed to exert pathogenic effects ( Table 1 ,  Supplementary Table 1  and references therein). Additional 25 variants were included in functional analyses of the p50 subunit only. These were either obtained from the literature or identified in patients from collaborating institutions ( Figure 1 ).\n\n    All 47 missense variants were manually subjected to in silico analyses using various databases and effect prediction tools ( Supplementary Table 1 ). A total of 19 variants were consistently scored with high pathogenicity values, while 11 variants had variable but weak predictions and 17 had low scores or were classified to be benign. Of note, the effect predictions in the ENSEMBL genome browser, suggest the presence of two hot-spot subdomains within the Rel-homology domain of p50 gaining generally elevated scores (aa 40-90 and aa 235-310, respectively). All NFKB1 sequence variants listed in the ENSEMBL and gnomAD databases are heterozygous, although frequent variants with low prediction scores might sporadically occur in homozygosity, if protein function is not impaired.\n\n    Following overexpression of the EGFP-fused p105 proteins in HEK293T cells, conventional epi-fluorescence microscopy showed robust protein levels and almost exclusive cytoplasmic localization of the wildtype p105 and most of the analyzed variants ( Figure 2A ). In contrast, clearly overall reduced signal intensities and signal accumulation in highly intense spots were observed for the N-terminally located variants I87S, V98D and R157P. A strong reduction of EGFP-signals was obtained with three variants (Y286N, W295C, and the previously described Y350C) localizing to the C-terminal part of the Rel-homology domain. Quantification of the signal intensities in live cells using a Fluorospot reader, confirmed the microscopic observations (see below). As described previously severely reduced signal intensities upon forced expression of mutant p105 proteins indicate accelerated decay due to deleterious protein defects and predicts a pathogenic effect of the underlying genetic variant.\n\n    Although under physiological conditions the nuclear translocation of dimeric NF-kappaB transcription factors depends on the degradation of the inhibitory cytoplasmic component (IkappaB), overexpressed EGFP-p50 shows a strictly nuclear localization with a homogeneous distribution in vitro. In contrast, pathogenic variants causing deleterious p50 defects and accelerated protein decay, only gain limited expression levels and show a typical sub-nuclear accumulation of the fluorescence signals in high intense spot-like structures. The characteristic aberrant pattern with pathogenic sub-nuclear protein disposal was observed in nine of the 47 analyzed variants ( Figure 2B ). These again included N-terminally located variants (I87S, G92V, V98D, I142T, and R157P), and variants affecting the C-terminal region of the Rel-homology domain (R284P, Y286N, W295C and Y350C). All other variants had a uniform nuclear distribution indistinguishable from the overexpressed wildtype p50. These observations were confirmed by quantitative measurements of the signal intensities in automated microscopic fluorescence recordings (see below). Interestingly, although no devastating protein loss was detectable, several variants including R57C, Y90S and I281M, showed diminished fluorescence levels, suggesting subtle or less severe protein defects.\n\n    In cells overexpressing p105, an invariable amount of the ectopic precursor protein is converted into p50 via removal of its C-terminal half by endogenous mechanisms. Therefore, we tested next, whether p105 expression and p50 processing is affected in the mutant precursor proteins ( Figure 3A ). All 22 variants for which we generated p105 expression constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells and analyzed by Western blotting. For the variants I87S, V98D and R157P we observed both, markedly reduced p105 expression and diminished p50. The effects were even more pronounced when the p105 variants Y286N, W295C and Y350C were transfected. As previously described, immediate elimination of mutant p105 precursor proteins and inefficient or disabled conversion into (non-sustainable) p50 indicates deleterious missense defects. All other variants were indistinguishable from the wildtype control.\n\n    Western blotting of the complete set of 47 variants for which we generated p50 expression constructs, yielded a single protein band in each case ( Figure 3B ). Yet, only weak or very faint bands were obtained with nine of the variants (I87S, G92V, V98D, I142T, R157P, R284P, Y286N, W295C and the previously described Y350C). These results are consistent with the microscopic analyses and indicate the weak abundance of these proteins due to severe protein defects. In contrast to the clearly deleterious mutants, several variants presented with only mildly reduced p50 levels, including R57C, Y90S, R214Q and I281M. Here, less severe defects might be associated with moderately accelerated protein decay.\n\n    DNA-binding of NF-kappaB transcription factors is mediated by the Rel-homology domain. Since 36 of the 47 NFKB1 variants tested in this study localize to the Rel-homology domain, we next used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to assess the DNA-binding activity of the mutant p50 proteins ( Figure 4 ). Following transfection of p105, partial conversion of the ectopic protein into p50 by cell-intrinsic mechanisms yields a detectable DNA-binding activity, which however is considerably weaker compared to directly overexpressed p50. Upon transfection of all 22 precursor variants, only nine were indistinguishable from the p105 wildtype control, indicating normal processing, nuclear translocation and DNA-binding ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, all six deleterious p105 variants (I87S, V98D, R157P, Y286N, W295C and Y350C) produced almost undetectable or only weak DNA-binding, compatible with intensified decay and protein loss, as expected. However, seven normally expressed variants had undetectable or only weak (R57C, H67R, A245V and I281M) or mildly reduced (N103D, P246T and S372L) DNA-binding activities, suggesting the presence of non-decaying protein defects.\n\n    We then assessed the DNA-binding activities following transfection of the 47 mutant p50 constructs, aiming at immediate overexpression of nuclear p50 proteins, while skipping the precursor stage ( Figure 4B ). Among the nine deleterious variants within the p50 panel, eight showed only weak DNA-binding activity (I87S, G92V, V98D, I142T, R157P, R284P, W295C and Y350C), compatible with protein loss (rather than loss of DNA-binding activity per se). For the p50-Y286N variant, binding to DNA was reduced (indicated by an excess of the free probe), but clearly detectable. Remarkably, DNA-binding was almost absent in the non-decaying variants R57C and G64V, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism, which is not based on protein loss as observed in NF-kappaB1 insufficiency. Therefore, R57C and G64V represent loss-of-function missense variants (in the strict sense, i.e. loss-of-activity as opposed to loss-of-expression), characterized by normal stability of both p105 and p50, but absent DNA-binding ability of the mutant p50. DNA-binding was moderately diminished in the normally expressed H67Y, H67R and A245V variants and marginally altered (if at all) with the L140Q, R214Q, M216V and I281M variants. DNA-binding was normal in three p50 variants (N103D, P246T, S372L) but reduced upon overexpression of their mutant p105 precursor proteins, suggesting a functional defect that does not originate from impaired protein stability or DNA-binding.\n\n    In summary, the combination of expression analyses and EMSA can reliably detect both protein-decaying variants and DNA-binding defects, particularly upon direct expression of the nuclear p50 subunits. However, subtle protein defects such as impaired IkappaB-interaction, disturbed nuclear translocation or disabled transcription factor dimerization, remain unidentified.\n\n    To test whether NFKB1 missense variants can interfere with the RelA-mediated transcriptional activation, we used a reporter competition assay in which an NF-kappaB-responsive promoter drives the expression of a red-fluorescent protein. The assay is based on the p105- and/or p50-mediated inhibition of the RelA-dependent reporter activation and requires co-transfection of a RelA expression vector (to switch on the reporter) together with EGFP-fusion constructs of either p105 or p50 in addition to the synthetic reporter gene into HEK293T cells. In subsequent intervals, both the p105/p50 expression (green) and the reporter activity (red) were monitored in live cell cultures by fluorescence intensity measurements using automated microscopic imaging ( Figure 5 ;  Supplementary Figure 2, 3 ;  Supplementary Table 2 ).\n\n    Upon transfection of the 22 constructs encoding the EGFP-fused p105 variants, expression of all six deleterious variants was limited (green fluorescence), as expected ( Figure 5A ;  Supplementary Figure 2 ). Moderately reduced EGFP signals were observed with the N-terminal variants (I87S, V98D, R157P), whereas only low protein levels were obtained when the missense changes resided further downstream, within the C-terminal part of the Rel-homology domain (Y286N, W295C, Y350C). In addition, the Y90S variant caused a mild reduction whereas expression of all other variants was comparable to the wildtype control ( Figure 5A  bar graphs).\n\n    Co-transfection of RelA alone together with the reporter vector gained strong reporter signals (red fluorescence), most likely due to assembly of highly potent homodimeric transcriptional activators ( Figure 5A ). Upon co-transfection of wildtype or mutant p105 together with RelA and the reporter gene, RelA-mediated reporter activation can, in principle, be attenuated via two mechanisms. First, by means of the IkappaB-like activity mediated by the C-terminal half of the overexpressed cytoplasmic p105 precursor proteins and second, by its proteasomal processing products p50 which lacks a transactivation domain. The latter enables assembly of less potent p50:RelA heterodimeric transcriptional activators as well as p50:p50 homodimeric repressors. Of note, all missense changes analyzed in the current study reside within the N-terminal p50 half, whereas the IkappaB-like C-terminal half is wildtype in each case. In addition to the mere presence of p105 and p50, reporter competition might be variably modulated by loss-of-DNA-binding function and other undefined factors such as impaired protein-interactions or nuclear translocation.\n\n    Among the deleterious p105 variants only V98D and R157P gained a strong repressive effect, whereas the RelA-mediated reporter activation (red fluorescence) was moderately repressed by the I87S and the Y286N, W295C and Y350C variants, respectively ( Figure 5A ). Remarkably, the non-decaying but DNA-binding-deficient R57C variant almost completely blocked reporter activation (G64V has not been tested in the p105 panel). Among the p105 variants, which produced only limited DNA-binding activities when transfected alone (H67R, N103D, A245V, P246T, I281M and S372L; as described above), only H67R showed reduced reporter activation, whereas all others had reporter activities comparable to the overexpressed wildtype p105. These observations suggest, that the main inhibitory effect on RelA-dependent reporter activation in our assay is promoted by the IkappaB-like activities of the overexpressed p105 variants (mediated by the non-mutant C-terminal half), rather than by mutant p50 proteins.\n\n    Since the generation of p50 from ectopic p105 is dependent on cell-intrinsic processes, and reporter activation likely includes a complex involvement of endogenous NF-kappaB proteins, the reliability of these functional in vitro analyses is basically limited to the deleterious variants. The decaying variants can be easily discriminated by the simultaneous monitoring of the expression levels, whereas hypomorphic defects require more detailed analyses. Therefore, to analyze the direct, precursor-independent effect of the NFKB1 missense variants on the transcriptional activation/repression function of nuclear p50, we subjected the complete panel of our p50 expression constructs to the reporter competition test ( Figure 5B ,  Supplementary Figure 3 ;  Supplementary Table 2 ).\n\n    Expression levels of the EGFP-fused p50 proteins were determined by automated signal readings (green fluorescence) and were consistent with Western blotting results. Five of the nine protein-decaying variants (I142T, R284P, Y286N, W295C and Y350C) showed weakly impaired RelA-mediated reporter activation (red fluorescence), consistent with profound protein loss. Three of the deleterious variants (I87S, G92V and R157P) gained reporter activities, which were moderately above the p50 wildtype control levels, whereas the V98D variant was clearly below. Therefore, although devastating variants commonly lead to accelerated elimination of the mutant proteins, their enforced nuclear presence can have distinct effects on RelA-dependent reporter gene activation, e.g. when sub-nuclear disposal of mutant p50 aggregates consumes variable amounts of RelA. Interestingly, the two non-decaying but DNA-binding deficient variants had opposing effects, with complete loss of reporter activity (R57C) and marginally increased signal intensities (G64V) compared to the wildtype control. It appears possible that p50:p50 homodimers are differently affected by the loss of the DNA-binding function of both subunits (as tested by EMSA) than the heterodimeric p50:RelA transcription factors (as tested by reporter assays), which however has not been further pursued in this study. Reporter activity was also differently affected by the H67Y and H67R variants, with a clear reduction only with p50-H67Y, although both had comparable expression and DNA-binding activities.\n\n    Although G136S and Y405C were neutral in expression and DNA-binding analyses, both gained clearly increased reporter activities compared to the control, whereas reporter activity was only at baseline levels with the otherwise neutral M216V variant. Three variants (N103D, A245V and I281M), all of which had impaired DNA-binding activity when expressed as precursor mutants but which otherwise were normal (except for a slightly diminished expression of the p50-I281M), caused increased reporter activities compared to the wildtype control. This effect was most prominent with the A245V variant. Several variants had minor effects on the reporter activity such as the G393S variant (slightly reduced) and the R198C and R231C variants (both slightly increased), which we, however, did not consider as relevant defects.\n\n    In summary, our reporter assay with mutant p105 proteins primarily indicates deleterious variants by their RelA-mediated promoter activation below the p105 wildtype levels. In contrast, reporter assays with mutant p50 proteins can either yield increased or decreased signal intensities compared to the wildtype control. In both cases, the decaying variants are easily identified by their expression levels, whereas normal protein stability plus aberrant reporter activity indicates functional defects other than protein loss. Among these, only one of the two DNA-binding deficient variants was trackable. Subtle functional defects such as disturbed precursor processing, altered protein-protein interactions or impaired nuclear translocation cannot be further specified using transient overexpression systems. We therefore assume that many non-decaying pathogenic p105/p50 defects will remain unidentified, unless appropriate tests are conducted.\n\n    To circumvent the intrinsic drawbacks associated with protein overproduction upon transient transfection, we employed a stably transfected cell line model with tetracycline-inducible expression of wildtype or mutant p105. We then tested, whether NFKB1 missense variants cause alterations of protein-protein interactions. Therefore, we analyzed the interactome of wildtype NFKB1 and the NFKB1 missense variants using the used MAC-tag approach, which enables the analysis of both stable (AP-MS) and transient proximal interactions (BioID). The NF-kappaB family members (NFKB2, RELA, RELB and c-REL) and the inhibitors-of-NF-kappaB (IkappaB`s, including IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, IkappaBepsilon) form the majority of the p105/p50 stable interactome detected by the AP-MS. Compared to the wildtype NFKB1, several missense variants showed clear and quantitative interaction chances ( Figure 6A ), particularly weakened or lost interaction with RELB. Mutations in the N-terminal part of the Rel Homology domain (G64V, H67R, I87S, G92V) displayed moderately reduced interactions with RELB. Missense variants residing in the central or the C-terminal part of the Rel-homology domain (I142T, R157P, R284P, Y286N, W295C and G386R) showed mostly a complete loss-of-interaction with RELB and IkappaBepsilon. The two most proximally localized missense variants (W295C and G386R) additionally lost their ability to interact with IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta and c-REL. Many of the missense variants which caused weakened or complete loss-of-interaction with RELB, additionally showed reduced interactions with NFKB2 and RELA.\n\n    The BioID interactomes were used for MS-microscopy based analysis of the NFKB1 localization ( Figure 6B ). In nearly all cases, the highest localization score was given for intermediate filaments and some also had high scoring for exosome. The wildtype and G64V showed localization also in the nucleoplasm. Plasma membrane, ER and Golgi were also marked as possible localizations for many of the variants. Interestingly, the mutations residing on the C-terminal part of the Rel-homology domain clearly clustered as their own entity, possibly suggesting distinct cellular localization compared to the wildtype NFKB1.\n\n    Detailed clinical information is provided in the Supplement of this article but was not available for all individuals carrying the analyzed NFKB1 variants ( Supplementary Table 3  and case reports). As previously described, the phenotype and the age at onset (median: 7.5 years; age range: 0-61 years) of the symptoms in patients carrying pathogenic NFKB1 variants are highly variable. In line with this observation, the age at PID diagnosis in the current study ranged from 1 to 69 years of age. However, the median age at onset was 23 years, possibly indicating a delay in the PID diagnosis. No significant differences in the disease phenotype or the age at onset of the symptoms were identified among the individuals carrying NFKB1 variants with a defined functional defect and those without a specified functional defect.\n\n    Clinical information was available for 15 (13 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic) of the 16 individuals carrying deleterious NFKB1 missense variants (I87S, G92V, V98D, I142T, R157P, R284P, Y286N, W295C, Y350C). Seven of the 13 affected individuals presented with symptoms early in life (median 14 years) including lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Eleven of them were diagnosed with CVID, which explains the high incidence of bacterial infections in this group. Splenomegaly (n=7) and autoimmune phenomena (n=7) were also described. All of the CVID patients are under IgG replacement. One of the two unaffected carriers is a teenager, who may develop disease symptoms at an older age. The two remaining patients with a deleterious NFKB1 missense variant had splenomegaly and autoimmune cytopenias as common features and started at a young age with the first symptoms (1.5 and 12 years, respectively). Interestingly, the patient carrying the G92V variant had hypogammaglobulinemia and required IgG replacement while the patient carrying the I142T had slightly elevated levels of IgG and normal levels of the other immunoglobulins. He received IgG replacement with minimal response in his pancytopenia.\n\n    Two of the four individuals carrying variants with loss of the DNA-binding function (R57C, G64V) are still unaffected at the age of 18 and 75 respectively. The other two started with recurrent upper respiratory infections in childhood and were later diagnosed with CVID, requiring IgG replacement.\n\n    Nine of the eleven patients carrying the previously described pathogenic H67R variant (which however had ambiguous results in our tests) belong to the same family. Four of these were diagnosed with CVID and required IgG replacement therapy. Consistent with hypogammaglobulinemia, these patients had recurrent respiratory infections. In this family, skin infections and sepsis were observed and immune dysregulation, autoimmunity and gastrointestinal involvement were common features. Aphthous ulcers were present in six of these individuals, as well as in both members (father and daughter) of the second family carrying this variant. Both were diagnosed with antibody deficiency and had recurrent respiratory infections, with good response to IgG substitution. The father was additionally diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n    Four out of the ten individuals carrying variants with ambiguous functional test results (H67Y, Y90S, R214Q, M216V, A245V, I281M) were diagnosed with CVID. Three did not have a clinically evident immunodeficiency and were considered to be unaffected. Hypogammaglobulinemia was detected in eight subjects. The clinical manifestations were highly variable including infections of the upper respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract and the skin. Autoimmunity was also described in this group. Two individuals had autoimmune cytopenias, one had autoimmune thyroiditis and one presented with psoriasis.\n\n    The NFKB1 variants, which showed only a minor functional defect or for which no defect could be specified, were identified in patients with CVID (n=11), antibody deficiency (n=6), autoinflammatory disorder (n=2), CID (n=1) or in unaffected individuals (n=4). Two of the variants, for which no defect could be specified were somatic variants, which have previously been observed in samples of speckled leukemia and cervical cancer, respectively. The 20 symptomatic individuals in this subgroup presented with respiratory tract infections (n=16), skin infections (n=5), gastrointestinal infections (n=4), sepsis (n=2), meningitis (n=2), autoimmune cytopenia (n=6) and autoimmune thyroiditis (n=2). Twelve of the neutral variants were initially observed in control cohorts of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases study. As we do not have clinical information on these subjects, they were not counted as unaffected individuals.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Pathogenic NFKB1 variants are associated with highly variable disease phenotypes, among which antibody deficiency, hyperinflammatory lesions, and autoimmune phenomena are the most frequent manifestations, with a very variable age of onset of symptoms. Considering that most of the known pathogenic variants - mainly comprising severe protein truncations - cause p105/p50 haploinsufficiency, a genotype-phenotype correlation was expected but could not be demonstrated. On the contrary, not only the expressivity of mutations within families but also their penetrance is highly variable, pointing to additional factors influencing disease activity.\n\n    Here, we show that mutant p105 precursor proteins, harboring a deleterious missense variant within their Rel-homology domain, undergo immediate decay (without first being processed to p50). This appears to be an eligible mechanism to protect the cells from generating dysfunctional NF-kappaB transcription factors. While the C-terminal half of the p105 precursor comprises the inhibitory IkappaB-like domains, the N-terminal p50 half harbors the multi-functional Rel-homology domain. The latter functions are only employed by the mature p50, including the nuclear localization sequence and the domains for DNA-binding, dimerization with other NF-kappaB proteins and IkappaB binding.\n\n    Our standard in vitro transfection model predominantly assesses the activities of mature p50 while the functions of p105 largely remain untested. We therefore restricted our analyses to the N-terminal amino acid variants, which all were delineated from the coding DNA sequence changes identified by genetic testing. In silico analyses predicted 19 damaging variants, of which 9 were experimentally confirmed to have a decaying defect while two variants had a loss-of-DNA-binding defect ( Table 1 ;  Supplementary Table 1 ). Two of the variants gained inconclusive results, four had unclear results with weak evidence and only two were tested neutral. Among the 28 variants which had benign or weak in silico predictions, 26 had no effects in our test and the remaining two had only minor differences compared to the controls. Therefore, pathogenicity predictions correlated well with our experimental data, particularly when the prediction was \"benign\".\n\n    Two of the three missense variants classified as pathogenic in the Tuijnenburg study were confirmed to have a decaying defect (I87S, V98D) whereas the impact of the I281M variant remained unclear in our tests. In their study, the authors generally considered variants to have a near-zero probability of pathogenicity when they occurred in both their CVID cohort and in (rare diseases) control cohorts. In full agreement with this assessment, which included eleven missense variants localizing within the N-terminal p50 half ( Table 1 ), none of these variants showed a deleterious effect in our functional analyses. However, whether these variants are indeed unable to cause NF-kappaB signaling defects has yet to be confirmed experimentally.\n\n    The Lorenzini study lists 27 missense variants affecting the N-terminal p50 half, including five variants (H67R, I87S, V98D, R157P, I281M) with a known protein defect, one (G386R) with an unknown protein defect, and 21 \"candidate variants\" which have previously not been reported (;  Table 1 ). Lorenzini et al. tested five of the newly described variants using a classical luciferase reporter assay, which enabled the identification of one missense variant causing a protein defect (R57C). In the current study, we tested or re-analyzed all 27 variants of the Lorenzini report and found nine variants (including four previously reported mutants) to have a deleterious effect, seven had variable results, but eleven variants were indistinguishable from controls ( Table 1 ;  Supplementary Table 1 ). Therefore, our observations support the concept of the Lorenzini study to consider NFKB1 variants discovered in patients with immune dysregulation, particularly the rare heterozygous variants with a population frequency of <0.01%, as \"possible mutations\" unless proven otherwise.\n\n    In a recent report, Li et al. analyzed 170 N-terminal missense variants for p50-dependent reporter gene activation following co-transfection of constructs encoding the mutant precursor proteins together with a homodimerization-defective RelA into p105/p50-deficient HEK293T cells. The study also included 36 of the 47 variants analyzed in our report ( Table 1 ;  Supplementary Table 1 ) and, consistent with our results, identified the protein-decaying variants as loss-of-function (I87S; V98D; I142T; R157P; W295C; Y350C) or hypomorphic (Y286N) variants. The two non-decaying, DNA-binding-deficient variants which had opposite effects in our reporter assays, were assessed in the Li et al. study as loss-of-function (R57C) and hypomorphic (G64V), respectively, and thus, in both studies, indicate the presence of a unique defect. Similarly, the two non-decaying variants H67Y and H67R, which gained normal or reduced reporter activities, respectively, were both hypomorphic in the Li study. Several variants were inconspicuous in the Li et al. study but had variable effects in our assays (Y90S; N103D; R214Q; M216V; A245V; I281M) which could not be further specified. Thus, both approaches were equally efficient in detecting the deleterious (decaying, loss-of-function and hypomorphic) p50 missense variants, yet, have a limited capacity to characterize less apparent defects. This might particularly apply to missense variants localizing to the C-terminal half of p105 (data not shown), which only affect the precursor proteins and therefore might be indistinguishable from overexpressed wildtype p105 in p50-dependent assays.\n\n    Due to the limited sensitivity of our assays, we were unable to confirm or exclude hypomorphic functional defects for several of the missense variants (Y90S, N103D, R214Q, M216V, A245V, I281M, G386R). Here we obtained ambiguous results (data not shown), which might partially depend on even minor changes in experimental conditions. For instance, the amount of the co-transfected RelA was found to be critical ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) since it can mask the p50-mediated inhibitory effect in our reporter assays. A further drawback is the \"snap-shot character\" determined by the time-point(s) of the analyses, which disregards the dynamic parameters such as p105 precursor-processing or p50 nuclear shuttling. In addition, overexpression of p105 and particularly the experimental maneuver to directly overload the nuclei with mutant p50 (thereby by-passing the requirement of producing p50 from its precursor), yet a good attempt to \"insulate\" the mutant proteins from the context of the NF-kappaB signaling network, is a highly artificial approach. Therefore, stimulus-inducible or on-off-switchable B and T cell models would be a huge advantage and would resemble the physiological conditions and the cell type specific effects more closely than our transient HEK293T transfection system.\n\n    We do not consider rare variants, which were indistinguishable from controls in our assays as necessarily non-pathogenic. For instance, although we analyze mutant proteins, the primary defect of exonic sequence variants might originate from splicing defects, rather than from amino acid changes. In fact, a recent report described a silent NFKB1 variant (c.705G>A) leading to activation of a cryptic splice site. Three of the single base-pair changes analyzed in our study are located within the first or last codon of the respective exon (c.115A>G, T39A; c.260T>G, I87S; c.406G>A, G136S) and could therefore possibly interfere with the consensus splice sites. In addition, several variants could potentially lead to splicing defects e.g. due to cryptic splice site activation (delineated from the AG-GT rule), which however has not been pursued further.\n\n    Western blot data with patient-derived cells were also available from previous studies ( Supplementary Table 3 ) for four of the decaying variants (I87S; V98D; R157P; Y350C), which consistently demonstrated reduced p105/p50 expression levels, confirming (haplo)insufficient conditions. Whereas the role of the I281M remained unresolved, cells heterozygous for the non-decaying variant H67R had normal p105/p50 levels.\n\n    A future task will be to refine the available experimental models to enable the characterization of non-deleterious effects such as altered signaling dynamics, impaired binding partner interactions or defects of post-translational modification sites. For instance, the G430E variant, which was neutral in all of our tests, but is known as a somatic mutation in cervical cancer, might affect the Lys432 acetylation site. Other examples include the post-translational modification sites Cys62, Ser66, Ser329 and Ser338 which might be affected by amino acid changes in close proximity. Moreover, the neutral variant R192W showed a slightly reduced size of the EMSA band, yet because of unknown reasons. However, we cannot exclude posttranslational modifications to cause such effects. On the other hand, the H67Y variant, which has been reported to cause delayed p50 nuclear entry, showed less DNA-binding upon transfection of p105 (but not of p50) and reduced reporter activation upon transfection of p105 or p50, although expression and localization of both proteins were normal.\n\n    Therefore, we assume at least some of the minor abnormalities detected in our assays to represent a potentially pathogenic effect. A careful characterization of these variants, applying functional tests with higher sensitivity, will be a prerequisite to complete the emerging picture of the NFKB1 pathophysiology.\n\n    Individuals with variants in NFKB1 may fall into one of three distinct categories. (1) Pathogenic variants proved to be deleterious for cell biology, such as the nine decaying and the two DNA-binding deficient variants we present in this study. These patients should be counseled regarding disease penetrance and expressivity, family planning with an autosomal dominant trait, and first-degree relatives should be offered genetic screening and counceling. (2) If the variant in NFKB1 has a frequency in the respective population of >0.0001 (>0.01%; >1 in 10.000) we do not advise further work-up. (3) If the NFKB1 variant has a population frequency of <0.0001 (<0.01%; <1 in 10.000), but functional testing was either not done or inconclusive or revealed results similar to healthy controls, we advise to perform family screening of the variant in first degree relatives and a referral to a tertiary center for IEI for a further work-up and longitudinal follow-up. NFKB1 variants suggesting a splice defect need to be verified by cDNA sequencing.",

        "Title": "    The PROTAC selectively degrading Bcl-xL represents a novel Hedgehog pathway inhibitor with capacity of combating resistance to Smoothened inhibitors while sparing bone growth",
        "Abstract": "    Rationale: Primary and acquired resistance to Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors largely hampered their clinical efficacy. Given the important functions of hedgehog (Hh) pathway in bone formation and development, the permanent defects in bone growth caused by Smo inhibitors further restrict the use of Smo inhibitors for pediatric tumor patients. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins regulate Hh activity by engaging a Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain sequence found in suppressor of fused (Sufu). In this study, we tested the effect of SIAIS361034, a Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) specifically targeting B-cell lymphoma extra large (Bcl-xL) to the celeblon (CRBN) E3 ligase for degradation, on combating the resistance and reducing the toxicity of bone growth caused by Hh inhibition.\n\n    Methods: Fluorescence polarization, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay, immunoblot, and immunoprecipitation (IP) were used to evaluate whether SIAIS361034 is an appropriate Bcl-xL PROTAC. Dual luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), depilatory model, and SmoA1 model were established to assess the effect of SIAIS361034 on the activity of Hh signaling pathway and its ability to overcome drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. Molecular mechanisms of SIAIS361034 for inhibiting Hh activity were demonstrated by dual luciferase reporter assay, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence staining. PET-CT and histopathology of bone tissues were used to assess the effects of SIAIS361034 on bone growth.\n\n    Results: We observed that SIAIS361034 efficiently and selectively inhibits the activity of the Hh pathway in vitro and in vivo, by interrupting Bcl-xL/Sufu interaction, therefore, promoting the interaction of Sufu with Gli1. Moreover, SIAIS361034 possesses the ability of combating resistance to current Smo inhibitors caused by Smo mutations and Gli2 amplification and remarkably inhibits the growth of SmoA1 tumors in vivo. In contrast to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase, our result further reveals little detectable expression of CRBN in two types of cells critical for bone development, human articular chondrocytes and human fetal osteoblastic cells. Moreover, treatment with SIAIS361034 results in no impairment on the bone growth of young mice, accompanying no alteration of the expression of Bcl-xL and Gli1 proteins.\n\n    Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that selectively targeting Bcl-xL by PROTAC is a promising strategy for combating resistance to Smo inhibitors without causing on-target drug toxicities of bone growth.",
        "Introduction": "    Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a pivotal role in a variety of developmental events in mammals, such as embryogenesis and postnatal tissue homeostasis. In vertebrate organisms, three Hh ligands (Shh, Dhh, and Ihh) have been identified to bind to the same receptor Patched 1 (Ptch1), a multi-pass cell surface receptor. Without Hh ligands stimulation, Ptch1 suppresses the activity of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, Smoothened (Smo). Upon ligands binding, however, this inhibition is relieved, allowing Smo to accumulate in the primary cilium and positively regulating the mobilization of zinc-finger transcription factors Gli proteins to the nucleus. Ultimately, the activation of transcriptional factors Gli induces the expression of Hh target genes, which are involved in proliferation and apoptosis, such as Gli1, Ptch1, and Bcl2 .\n\n    Inappropriate activation of Hh signaling has been shown to be involved in several types of tumors formation, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma (MB). The mechanisms associated with constitutive activation of Hh pathway for cancer development can be classified into ligand-independent and ligand-dependent manners. Ligand-independent activation of Hh pathway is characterized by sporadic somatic mutations in Ptch1, Smo, and Suppressor of fused (Sufu) or genomic amplification of Gli2, which were found in the overwhelming majority of Hh-driven BCC and MB. In addition, the irregular elevation of Hh ligands from tumors or stromal cells, namely ligand-dependent manner, has been documented in a wide range of cancers. Larger scale efforts have been devoted in recent years to developing Hh inhibitors by targeting Smo for the treatment of tumors addiction to Hh pathway. GDC-0449, LDE-225, and PF-04449913 have been approved successively by the FDA for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic BCC and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. However, the high incidence of tumor recurrence with the clinical application of GDC-0449 and LDE-225 limits their enduring efficacy. Resistance to current Smo inhibitors can be acquired by Smo mutations as well as alterations in critical molecules downstream of Smo, including Sufu deletions and Gli2 amplification. Moreover, due to the importance of Hh signaling pathway in bone development, Hh inhibitors suppress proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and lead to a dramatic expansion of the hypertrophic zone and premature bone growth plate closure. The aberrant bone structures formed appear to be irreversible and may not be removed by bone remodeling. Following treatment with GDC-0449 and LDE-225, pediatric patients whose bones have not achieved full maturity were found to develop premature widespread growth plate fusions. Therefore, alternative strategies are highly needed to overcome resistance and reduce bone growth toxicity of current Hh inhibitors.\n\n    Wu et al. recently reported that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 families engage a Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain sequence discovered in Sufu, a critical negative regulator of Hh activity. This engagement promotes Sufu turnover and liberates Gli by interrupting Sufu-Gli interaction, thereby activating the Hh pathway and inducing the expression of Hh target genes. Hence, targeting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 families may be a promising strategy for inhibiting Hh pathway and countering Smo inhibitors resistance. Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) is an emerging protein degradation technology that degrades protein of interest through the ubiquitin proteasomes system (UPS) by recruiting the target protein to E3 ligase for ubiquitination and eventually degradation by 26S proteasome. Moreover, it has been shown that PROTAC is a good strategy for combating on-target toxicity, such as thrombocytopenia caused by Bcl-xL inhibition, by taking advantage of the differential context expression of E3 ligase, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and celeblon (CRBN). Therefore, it conceivably prompted us to develop PROTACs targeting Bcl-2 family proteins to inhibit Hh activity while sparing its target toxicity, bone growth.\n\n    Here we reported a selective Bcl-xL PROTAC degrader, termed SIAIS361034, targeting Bcl-xL to the CRBN E3 ligase for degradation, which is minimally expressed in bone tissues. We have shown that SIAIS361034 selectively degrades Bcl-xL and significantly inhibits the Hh pathway activity with the capacity of overcoming the resistance to Smo inhibitors caused by mutations in Smo and amplification of Gli2. In addition, we provided evidence that SIAIS361034 exhibits no influence on bone growth. These findings reveal a novel strategy to combat resistance and reduce the toxicities of bone growth associated with current Smo inhibitors.",

(Rosemont, IL 60018, USA). The results were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (NIH).\n\n    Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (#87787, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4  C overnight, followed by incubation with Protein A/G Plus-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4  C for 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with washing buffer. The complex was separated from the beads and then boiled for 10 min. The immunoprecipitates and inputs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using the antibodies as indicated.\n\n    Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h. After that, the cells were further incubated with rabbit anti-Gli1 antibody (#101156-T10, SinoBiological) at 4  C overnight. Then cells were stained with the Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated Goat Anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (red) for 1.5 h. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). The immunofluorescent images of cells were captured under a fluorescence microscope (Leica).\n\n    Competitive fluorescence polarization assays were carried out in black-walled plates in assay buffer (20 mM Na2HPO4  12H2O, 20 mM NaH2PO4 12H2O, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.05% PF-68). The use of protein/peptide probe pairs was as follows: Bcl-xL (5 nM) and FAM-Bad (5 nM), Bcl-2 (100 nM) and FAM-Bax (5 nM), Mcl-1 (100 nM) and FAM-Bim (5 nM).

The fluorescence polarization was measured on a Synergy 2 reader (BioTek).\n\n    Bcl-xL/CRBN ternary HTRF assay was used to monitor ternary complex formation between target protein, PROTAC and E3 ligase. Bcl-xL/CRBN PROTAC BINDING ASSAY KITS was purchased from Cisbio (#63ADK000CB37PEG). 200 nL compounds were transferred into 384 assay plate, followed by centrifuging at 1000 RPM. Then 5 microL Bcl-xL and CRBN protein were added into each assay well. After incubation at 25  C for 15 min, 10 microL Tag2-Eu&Tag1-d2 working solution was added into each assay well and incubated 25  C for 120 min. The Relative HTRF value was read with BMG (PHERAstar FSX).\n\n    Standard pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted using male ICR Mice. A single 2 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) injection, 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or 10 mg/kg oral (p.o.) administration of SIAIS361034 was evaluated. Plasma concentrations of SIAIS361034 at each of the 7 time points (0.25 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h post dosing) are the average values from 3 animals.\n\n    For Depilatory model studies, male C57BL/6J mice (7 to 8 weeks of age) were purchased from Shanghai Lingchang Biotechnology Co. (Shanghai, China). After 2 days of acclimation, only healthy mice were used in the experiment. The back skin of the anesthetized mice was shaved and depilated using the depilatory Nair (Church & Dwight Co., Inc.). After 4 days, the depilated mice were randomized into groups for treatments as indicated. The back skin phenotypes were recorded by taking pictures every 3 days. Skin tissues were harvested 6 h after the last dosage to examining Gli1 mRNA expression as well as Gli1 and Bcl-xL protein levels.\n\n    For in vivo SmoA1 MB allograft studies, SmoA1 spontaneous MB tumors were obtained from ND2:SmoA1 transgenic mice as previously described. Male nude mice (4 to 5 weeks of age) were purchased from Shanghai Lingchang Biotechnology Co. (Shanghai, China). Spontaneous tumors were harvested and subcutaneously allografted into nude mice. When the tumor volumes reached approximately 2000 mm3, they were harvested and further subcutaneously allografted into nude mice. When the tumor volumes reached about 150 to 200 mm3, the tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned into vehicle and treatment groups. Mice were weighed every 3 days. Tumor size was measured once every 3 days using microcaliper. Tumor volume (V) was determined using the following formula: V = (LxW2) x0.5, where L is length, and W is width in mm. Tumor tissues were harvested 6 h after the last dosage to examining Gli1 mRNA expression and protein levels. SIAIS361034 for i.p. administration was formulated in 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na). All in vivo studies above were approved by and conformed to the policies and regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Fudan University, China.\n\n    Skeleton Micro-CT images of mice were taken under anesthesia. The femurs were fixed and stored in 4% PFA at 4  C. Mice and femurs were scanned using Inveon PET-CT (Siemens). Bone tissues were computed with Inveon Acquisition Workplace (IAW). Image data were visualized and analyzed by Inveon Viewer.\n\n    Femurs were fixed in 4% PFA and decalcified in 14% EDTA for 2 weeks at 4  C. Bone tissues were embedded in paraffin. Thin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), paraffin-embedded sections of femurs were baked at 60  C for 20 min, deparaffinized by xylene for 25 min, rehydrated through ethanol series, and incubated with citrate buffer at 95  C for 20 min for antigen retrieval. Sections were incubated with the primary antibodies as indicated overnight at 4  C, followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The primary antibodies used in this study include Bcl-xL (1:2000, ab178844, Abcam) and Gli1 (1:100, 101156-T10, Sino Biological).\n\n    7 weeks of age C57BL/6J mice (Shanghai Lingchang Biotechnology Co.) were treated with single i.p. doses of SIAIS361034 (50 and 100 mg/kg) or single p.o. doses of ABT-263 (100 mg/kg). Blood was collected at different time points via retro-orbital bleeding in anticoagulation tube. Platelets or different blood cells were enumerated using BM800 blood analyzer (Bowlinman Sunshine).\n\n    All the statistical analyses in this study were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software (La Jolla, CA, USA). P values were calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (more than two groups) or two-sided unpaired Student's t-test (two groups).

        "Results": "    To assess whether Bcl-xL is a promising therapeutic target for inhibiting Hh pathway activity, we reasonably designed and synthesized a series of PROTAC degraders targeting Bcl-xL to CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase through linking a dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL ligand derived from ABT-263 to a CRBN ligand and also screened the linker length via structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. Among those degraders, SIAIS361034, which had an extremely valid and specific degradation effect on Bcl-xL, was selected as the compound for this study. SIAIS361034NC was synthesized as a negative control of SIAIS361034 by changing the CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand in SIAIS361034 from an active state to an inactive state (Figure 1A and Figure S1A-C). We first measured the binding affinity of SIAIS361034 with Bcl-2 family proteins using Fluorescence polarization. The results showed that SIAIS361034 bound Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 with Ki values of 37.27 nM and 15.09 nM, respectively, but exhibited little affinity to Mcl-1 (Figure 1B). Furthermore, the HTRF assay revealed that SIAIS361034 could form a stable ternary complex with Bcl-xL and CRBN E3 ligase (Figure 1C). These results suggest that SIAIS361034 functions as a PROTAC. We next evaluated the effects of SIAIS361034 on the expression of Bcl-xL in NIH-3T3 cells that respond well to the activation of the Hh signaling pathway. As shown in Figure 1D, SIAIS361034 dose-dependently degraded Bcl-xL with a maximum degradation (Dmax) of 88.09% and exerted almost no effect on the Bcl-xL mRNA levels (data not shown). SIAIS361034 did not affect abundance of all four known CRBN neo-substrates, including Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 (IKZF1) and 3 (IKZF3), developmental transcription factor SALL4, and the translation termination factor GSPT1, demonstrating that SIAIS361034 is a specific Bcl-xL PROTAC with minimal off-target degradation (Figure 1D and Figure S1D). Our analysis also revealed that SIAIS361034 significantly degraded Bcl-xL and did not change the levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (Figure 1E). Furthermore, SIAIS361034NC, which is not able to bind to CRBN, failed to degrade Bcl-xL (Figure 1E). SIAIS361034 degraded the Bcl-xL in a time-dependent manner, and this degradation may last around 48 h (Figure 1F-G). We also observed that preincubation with ABT-263 abolished the SIAIS361034-induced Bcl-xL degradation (Figure 1H). These results showed that SIAIS361034 is a specific PROTAC degrader targeting Bcl-xL. We used CRBN inhibitor Pomalidomide and proteasome inhibitor MG132 to further confirm that SIAIS361034 induces Bcl-xL degradation through CRBN and proteasome. We observed that both CRBN inhibitor Pomalidomide (Figure 1I) and proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 1J) obviously abolished SIAIS361034-induced Bcl-xL degradation, further confirming that SIAIS361034 acts as a PROTAC degrader using CRBN E3 ligase and proteasome system to degrade Bcl-xL. Co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that SIAIS361034 induce Bcl-xL ubiquitination (Figure S1E). Collectively, these data demonstrated that SIAIS361034 is a selective Bcl-xL PROTAC that potently degrades Bcl-xL via CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase and ubiquitin proteasome system.\n\n    Wu et al. have reported that BH3 mimetics inhibit Hh activity. To evaluate whether SIAIS361034 may inhibit the Hh pathway activity, we used SAG, a small molecule Smo agonist, to stimulate the Gli transcriptional factor activity in light II reporter cells, an NIH-3T3 cell line with stable expression of Gli-luciferase and TK-Renilla reporter genes. We found that SIAIS361034 obviously suppressed the activity of the Hh pathway provoked by SAG with an IC50 value of 120.1 nM (Figure 2A, 2C), while SIAIS361034NC exhibited no effect on the Hh signaling pathway, as reflected by its IC50 value of 3156 nM (Figure 2B-C). To further confirm the ability of SIAIS361034 on suppressing the Hh signaling pathway, we examined its effect on the mRNA expression of Hh target genes Gli1 and Ptch1, which served as readout of the Hh pathway activity, in NIH-3T3 cells. Consistent with the results of Gli-luciferase assays, SIAIS361034 significantly blocked the expression levels of Hh target genes, Gli1 and Ptch1, activated by SAG (Figure 2D). In vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that SIAIS361034 exhibited no toxic effects when it acted on light II and NIH-3T3 cells at a concentration of 10 muM for 72 h, suggesting the inhibitory effect of SIAIS361034 on Hh activity is not due to its cytotoxicity (Figure S2A). Collectively, our data indicated that SIAIS361034 may significantly inhibit the Hh signaling pathway in vitro.\n\n    To date, more and more evidence has shown the cross-talk between Hh signaling pathway and other tumor-related signaling pathways, such as NF-kappaB and Wnt signaling pathway, which in turn affect the activity of GLI transcription factor. To rule out the possibility that SIAIS361034 nonspecifically inhibits the Hh pathway activity, we next used the dual luciferase reporter assay to examine the effects of SIAIS361034 on other signaling pathways, such as NF-kappaB and Wnt signaling pathways. BAY 11-7082, a positive inhibitor of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, significantly impeded the activity of NF-kappaB luciferase activated by TNF-alpha, while SIAIS361034 exhibited no inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 muM (Figure S2B). We also found that SIAIS361034 failed to repress the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway activated by PGE2. In contrast, the Wnt signaling pathway positive inhibitor H-89 significantly inhibited the TCF/LEF luciferase activity, as shown in Figure S2C. Overall, these results indicated that SIAIS361034 may selectively inhibit the Hh signaling pathway.\n\n    Having demonstrated that SIAIS361034 may specifically inhibit the Hh pathway, we next set out to dissect its putative molecular mechanism for inhibiting Hh activity. Wu et al. previously reported that BH3 mimetics suppress Gli activity by disabling pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins/Sufu interactions, therefore, enabling the engagement of Sufu with Gli and consequently prohibiting the translocation of Gli into nucleus. In this context, we hypothesized that SIAIS361034 may suppress the Hh signaling pathway by disabling pro-survival Bcl-xL/Sufu interactions via degrading Bcl-xL, similar to BH3 mimetics. To this end, we first investigate whether the inhibitory effect of SIAIS361034 on Hh pathway is mediated by the degradation of Bcl-xL. As expected, preincubation of MG132 and Pomalidomide (Figure 3A-B) retained the decreased Gli1 protein level caused by exposure to SIAIS361034. However, MG132 and Pomalidomide failed to recover the reduced Gli1 protein elicited by the BET inhibitor JQ1 (Figure 3A-B), which inhibits Hh pathway activity by decreasing the transcription of Gli. These observations were further confirmed by Gli-luciferase assay, MG132 and Pomalidomide also abolished the suppressed Gli-luciferase activity elicited by SIAIS361034, whereas no significant differences were found in the Gli-luciferase activity when treated with JQ1 alone, in combination with MG132 or Pomalidomide (Figure 3C). Collectively, these data indicated that SIAIS361034 may inhibit Hh activity by a mechanism of degradation for Bcl-xL and consequently inhibition of Hh activity.\n\n    Considering that BH3 mimetics suppress Gli activity by disabling pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins/Sufu interaction as previously reported, we further addressed whether SIAIS361034 may interfere with the interaction of Sufu with Gli1. Co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that treatment with SIAIS361034 increased the interaction of Sufu with Gli1, whereas preincubation with MG132 abrogated this effect (Figure 3D). Immunofluorescence staining with Gli1 antibodies revealed that SIAIS361034 suppressed translocation of Gli1 from cytoplasm into nucleus (Figure 3E). These observations suggest that SIAIS361034 inhibits Hh activity by degrading Bcl-xL, thus relieving Sufu from Bcl-xL/Sufu interaction and allowing its binding with Gli1, therefore repressing translocation of Gli1 from cytoplasm into nucleus (Figure 3F).\n\n    Smo mutations within its ligand binding pocket or in its pivotal residue, as well as amplification of Gli2 are the predominant mechanisms responsible for the resistance to current Smo antagonists. Having demonstrated that SIAIS361034 effectively inhibits the Hh activity by degrading Bcl-xL, we thus tested whether SIAIS361034 may overcome the drug resistance caused by Smo mutants and Gli2 amplification. To verify this hypothesis, we first respectively transfected different Smo mutants plasmids into light II cells and tested the effect of SIAIS361034 on Hh activity provoked by these ectopic plasmids. The overexpression efficiency of ectopic plasmids was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure S3A). SIAIS361034 obviously inhibited the Hh activity provoked by wild type Smo plasmid and various Smo mutants containing mutations in its ligand binding pocket, D473H, H231R, and W281C (Figure 4A), or mutations in its pivotal residue, W535L, L412F, and F460L (Figure 4B) in a dose-dependent manner. However, little appreciable effect was observed with Smo inhibitor GDC-0449 (Figure S3B-D). What stands out in these results is that no significant IC50 shift was observed for SIAIS361034 inhibiting Gli-luciferase stimulated by ectopic expressions of Smo wild-type and mutations (Figure 4C-D). We also observed that SIAIS361034 exhibited significant potency against Hh activity evoked by ectopic expression of Gli2. By contrast, administration of GDC-0449 had no effect on the Hh activity in response to Gli2 amplification (Figure 4E). Taken together, these data suggested that SIAIS361034 is able to combat the resistance to current Smo inhibitors caused by Smo mutations and Gli2 amplification.\n\n    First, we assessed in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of SIAIS361034 in mice. Following a single 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) or 2 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) injection of SIAIS361034, good plasma exposure of the compound was observed over 24 h. However, SIAIS361034 has a poor pharmacokinetic property via 10 mg/kg oral (p.o.) administration (Figure 5A, Table S1). Hence, we used i.p. to deliver SIAIS361034 for further in vivo study.\n\n    Hh signaling pathway is essential for the onset of the anagen phase of hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and consequently for the formation of hair and proper control of HF morphogenesis. To examine whether the potent in vitro ability of SIAIS361034 to inhibit Hh activity can be translated into in vivo efficacy, we established a depilatory mouse model by using chemical depilation to damage the hair follicles (Figure 5B). As shown in Figure 5C, chemical cream-induced depilation significantly increased Gli1 expression by day 4, and this increase in Gli1 mRNA levels was maintained through day 14, indicating the Hh pathway activation during the hair growth. To determine whether SIAIS316034 can block Hh pathway activation and consequently retard hair growth in this model, SIAIS316034 and GDC-0449 were administered after 4 days of depilation. SIAIS316034 and GDC-0449 treatment significantly retarded hair growth during depilation-induced hair regeneration, and meanwhile, the hair of the vehicle group had completely returned to the level before depilation at the termination of administration (Figure 5D). Meanwhile, the inhibition of hair growth was comparable to the reduction in Hh activity, as evidenced by alterations in the expression of Gli1 mRNA (Figure 5E), suggesting that SIAIS316034 suppressed the Hh activity and consequently the hair growth. To further confirm the effect of SIAIS361034 on hair growth and Hh activity associated with its degradation on Bcl-xL, we tested the Gli1 and Bcl-xL protein levels in skin tissues. As is shown in Figure 5F, SIAIS361034 suppressed the expression of Gli1 and Bcl-xL, while GDC-0449 showed no effect on the levels of Bcl-xL. These findings supported that SIAIS361034 can block the Hh signaling pathway activation in vivo in the depilatory model by degrading Bcl-xL.\n\n    To further evaluate the potency of SIAIS361034 in combating the resistance to Smo inhibitors in vivo, we isolated the spontaneous medulloblastoma from ND2:SmoA1 transgenic mice, which carry a mutation of Smo W539L under the control of ND2 promoter, and allografted them into the nude mice. Nude mice harboring ND2:SmoA1 medulloblastoma were treated with SIAIS361034 or GDC-0449 as indicated in Figure 6A. The tumor growth was remarkably suppressed by administration with SIAIS316034, resulting in 93.56% mean tumor growth inhibition (TGI) ratio at the termination of the experiment. However, GDC-0449 at the dose of 50 mg/kg, a concentration that can achieve 100% TGI in medulloblastoma sensitive to Smo inhibitors, showed obvious resistance to the growth of SmoA1 tumors (Figure 6B-D). Moreover, consistent with the ability of SIAIS361034 and GDC-0449 against tumor growth, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that SIAIS316034 significantly inhibited the expression of Gli1 mRNA in tumor tissues, while no alteration of the Gli1 mRNA levels was observed in tumors exposed to GDC-0449 (Figure 6E). These observations indicated that SIAIS316034 suppressed the growth of SmoA1 tumors by inhibiting the Hh signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that the potent antitumor activity of SIAIS316034 corresponded well to its ability of inducing Bcl-xL degradation and repressing Gli1 expression (Figure 6F). Therefore, these observations revealed that SIAIS316034 possesses the ability of combating resistance to Smo inhibitors caused by Smo mutations in vivo.\n\n    It has been shown that Bcl-xL is essential for the survival of platelets, thus indicating the challenge of targeting Bcl-xL with small molecules due to on-target toxicity of thrombocytopenia. Zhang et al. recently reported that targeting Bcl-xL with PROTAC using CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase may combat this on-target toxicity of thrombocytopenia due to their rare expression in platelets. Hence, it is conceivable that plates should be spared when treated with SIAIS361034. As anticipated, distinct doses of SIAIS361034 resulted in no appreciable alterations in the number of platelets, whereas the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL dual inhibitor ABT-263 caused severe thrombocytopenia in mice after 8 h of administration (Figure 7A). In addition, SIAIS361034 showed no influence on other blood cells, such as neutrophils and red blood cells (RBC) (Figure 7A). These results indicated that SIAIS361034 is a platelet-sparing Bcl-xL degrader.\n\n    Osteoblast differentiation and endochondral ossification are responsible for bone formation and resorption and are regulated by Hh signaling pathways. The impact of current Smo inhibitors on bone growth largely restricts their use in children patients. By analyzing the RNA-sequencing data of human chondrocytes, we found that CRBN is rarely expressed in chondrocytes. This finding was confirmed by immunoblotting experiment, which revealed that CRBN expression was barely detectable in chondrocytes and osteoblasts (Figure 7B). However, VHL, another E3 ligase frequently used in PROTACs, was abundantly expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts (Figure 7B). These observations indicate the possibility that SIAIS361034 may spare permanent skeleton damage. To this end, we analyzed the effects of SIAIS361034 on bone morphology and structure after continuous administration of the young mice with SIAIS361034 from postnatal day 12 (P12) to postnatal day 16 (P16). At the termination of the experiment, the SIAIS361034-treated mice maintained a similar weight growth rate as control littermates. However, the reported Bcl-xL PROTAC degrader DT2216, targeting Bcl-xL to VHL E3 ligase, decelerated the rate of weight growth (Figure 7C). Moreover, the mice administrated with DT2216 and GDC-0449 exhibited noticeable and smaller body sizes when compared to vehicle mice and SIAIS361034-treated mice (Figure 7D). Micro-CT examination showed that no abnormalities in the skeleton were found in SIAIS361034-treated mice at 6 weeks of age (Figure 7E). The overall bone structure, especially the femur and tibia, of the administered mice was intact and normal. However, we observed an obvious shortening of the femur after treatment with DT2216 and GDC-0449 (Figure 7E). Micro-CT analyses of femurs indicated that in contrast to GDC-0449 and DT2216, SIAIS361034 exhibited no significant difference in the growth plate when compared with Vehicle (Figure 7F). Consistent with the Micro-CT analysis observations, histological investigations of cross sections of the femur showed that the columnar organization of chondrocytes in the growth plate was not destroyed in mice administered with SIAIS361034 when compared to those treated with GDC-0449 and DT2216 (Figure 7G). IHC assays showed that the expression levels of Gli1 were significantly suppressed in femurs after treatment with GDC-0449 or DT2216, while treatment with SIAIS361034 resulted in no alteration when compared with Vehicle. Moreover, levels of Bcl-xL were reduced in femurs following treatment with DT2216. No change of Bcl-xL was observed when treated with GDC-0449 and SIAIS361034 (Figure 7H). SIAIS361034 showed no side effects on the platelets and other indispensable blood cells at the end of the experiment (Figure S4A-C). Collectively, these results showed that compared with Smo inhibitors GDC-0449 and VHL-based PROTAC DT2216, treatment with SIAIS361034 had no influence on the bone growth of young mice.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Similar to other targeted cancer therapeutics, the drug resistance is a common phenomenon for Smo inhibitors. The primary and acquired resistance to current Smo inhibitors largely hampered their clinical efficacy, thus, raising the critical need to develop novel strategies with capacity of combating the resistance to Smo inhibitors. The mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to Smo inhibitors include mutations of Smo, amplification of Gli2, and upregulation of noncanonical Gli signaling. In this context, targeting the signaling components downstream of Smo, especially the transcriptional factors Gli, represents a promising strategy for combating the resistance to Smo inhibitors.\n\n    Wu et al. reported that BH3 mimetics may inhibit the Hh signaling pathway by disrupting the Bcl-2 family proteins/Sufu binding to suppress the Gli activity, thus overcoming the resistance of Smo inhibitors. In this study, we determined that the Bcl-xL specific PROTAC, SIAIS361034, significantly and selectively inhibited the Hh pathway activity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SIAIS361034 degraded Bcl-xL and disabled Bcl-xL/Sufu interaction, therefore, allowing the engagement of Sufu with Gli1. Specifically, SIAIS361034 possessed the ability to combat the resistance to current Smo inhibitors caused by Smo mutations or amplification of Gli2. Hence, this study indicates the possibility of using SIAIS361034 for the treatment of tumors driven by the Hh pathway, especially for those resistant to current Smo inhibitors.\n\n    In limb development, Hh pathway is required for normal skeletal development and plays a vital role in bone formation during endochondral ossification. It has been well documented that inhibition of the Hh pathway with Smo inhibitors may cause defects in bone growth and premature bone growth plate closure. Therefore, such on-target toxicity in bone growth limits the use of Hh inhibitors in pediatric patients. Here, we established that SIAIS361034 significantly suppressed Hh activity without causing defects in bone development because it targets Bcl-xL to the CRBN E3 ligase that is minimally expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. We also observed severe defects in bone growth and dramatic loss of body weight after treatment with DT2216, which could be due to the highly expressed VHL E3 ligase in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Besides similar ability in degrading Bcl-xL protein and sparing platelets in comparison with the previous reported Bcl-xL PROTAC DT2216, our PROTAC SIAIS361034 simultaneously possesses capacity of sparing bone growth due to the distinct E3 ligase we used. These results raise concerns about the use of VHL-recruiting PROTACs in pediatric patients and suggest that CRBN-recruiting PROTACs are considerably less toxic to bone growth than VHL-recruiting PROTACs.\n\n    Among the pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins, Bcl-xL is the most predominantly overexpressed protein in many leukemia cells and solid tumors. Additionally, acquired resistance to anticancer therapies in human cancers has been identified to be positively correlated with Bcl-xL expression. These findings identified Bcl-xL as a good target for the treatment of hematological malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Pediatric leukemia is the most common malignancy affecting children, accounting for 30% of all pediatric cancers. However, targeting Bcl-xL for the treatment of young children with hematological malignancies carries the risk of skeletal depression because of Hh inhibition. Therefore, our findings raise concerns about the potential toxicities in bone growth associated with cancer therapies targeting Bcl-xL with VHL-based PROTACs in children.",

        "Title": "    Effect of Staphylococcus aureus infection on the heat stress protein 70 (HSP70) level in chicken embryo tissues",
        "Abstract": "    Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are components of physiological biocenosis of skin or mucous membranes in some animals' genera but also they are dangerous opportunistic pathogens responsible for infections of various localization, course or manifestations. Proteins produced by these bacteria destroy tissues, leukocytes and cause haemolysis of erythrocytes. Host organisms respond by defence mechanisms. Production of heat stress proteins (HSPs) is one of defence responses of infected host organism. To evaluate infection and host defence mechanisms some animal models of experimental infection are reported. Use of chick embryo model allows demonstrating adequate differences in staphylococcal virulence depending on the strain genotype. The aim of the study was to examine the changes in heat shock protein HSP70 levels in chick embryo tissues after infection caused by S. aureus strains no. tu2, pa3, ch5, ch10, ch24, and ch25 isolated from chickens. The bacteria were injected directly into fluid of amnion cavity and incubated for 10 days. The mortality of particular chick embryos was reported and the tissues for further analysis were taken every day from day 13 to day 19. The levels of heat stress protein HSP70 were determined by dot-blot method. Results showed that the strains no. ch5, ch24, and ch25 were the most virulent. HSP70 levels increased in all groups of injected embryos at the same time the hatching process was started. The presented study showed that the infected chick embryos were characterized by higher HSP level from 12.3% up to 19.7% compared to the control group. The morphological analysis showed numerous erythrocytes with damaged cell membranes and morphological changes of erythrocytes. Changes in the level of HSP70 protein can be a useful indicator of infection caused by S. aureus bacteria. Additionally, chicken embryo is a helpful research model in studies of pathogenesis of diseases caused by bacteria.",
        "Introduction": "    The phenomenon of the transmission of Staphylococcus bacteria between animals and humans is found more and more often. For this reason, the search for an appropriate research model for experiments on the etiopathogenesis of infections with these bacteria is being carried out on a wider scale. The use of mammalian models (such as a rabbit or a domestic pig) is expensive and ethically ambiguous. Simultaneously, alternative models such as tissue cultures, cell lines or invertebrate animals were proposed. However, they did not meet the expectations placed in them due to significant discrepancies and the lack of compliance with the results obtained in experiments with vertebrate animals. In this context, it seems that the advantages of mammalian and alternative models are in the chick embryo. It is not only susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus bacteria, but it is also characterized by relatively low breeding costs and availability compared to mammalian or alternative models. Additionally, a chicken embryo develops outside the mother's organism, which facilitates observation and conducting experiments.\n\n    The course of systemic infection with Staphylococcus aureus is associated with the bacterial toxin alpha (alpha-haemolysin). It can induce rapid aggregation of platelets in the body leading to the formation of microclots which are mainly retained in the liver. In such a situation, this organ acts as a physical barrier responsible for the filtration of dangerous clots and harmful antigens reaching the body. Hepatic macrophages catch S. aureus and then platelets bind to them, preventing the pathogen from spreading further. This can disturb blood circulation within the liver and lead to blood clots. In addition, most acute phase proteins, complement components and cytokines involved in the response to bacterial infection are synthesized in this organ. Infection caused by S. aureus causes severe oxidative stress to the host cells, which leads to the formation of free radicals both in the entire body and in the liver. As a consequence, this results in further disturbances such as: damage to the mitochondria and inhibition of ATP production, disturbance of DNA repair processes or destabilization of lysosomal membranes.\n\n    An organism's exposure to environmental stressors starts a series of biochemical processes aimed at maintaining the homeostasis of the organism. Increased synthesis of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) under stress conditions in both Procaryota and Eucaryota is a mechanism of constant cellular response and is widely regarded as the leading endogenous manifestation of cell adaptation to environmental changes. They are synthesized in response to various stimuli such as: heat stress, hypoxia, ischemia, viral or bacterial infections, as well as the action of various toxic substances, including heavy metals.\n\n    HSP proteins belong to a family of polypeptides with a high degree of conserved primary structure and can be divided based on their molecular weight. One of the most precise classifications distinguishes: HSP 100 (> 100 kDa), HSP90 (~ 81-99 kDa), HSP70 (~ 65-80kDa), HSP60 (~55-64 kDa), HSP 40 (~ 35-54 kDa), sHSP (< 35 kDa), HSP10 (~10kDa) and Ubivectin (~8kDa).The main role of HSP is to protect intracellular proteins against proteolysis, as well as participate in the post-translational modification, stabilization and secretion of proteins by reorganizing the spatial structure of proteins with incorrect conformation in order to restore their native form. They also support the presentation of antigens and the biosynthesis of antibodies.\n\n    Regarding the functions in the body, the HSP70, present in cytosol and cell nuclei, is the most important one. The HSP70 is responsible for the dissolution of protein complexes and control of regulatory proteins and cell signalling, as well as translocation of precursor proteins in mitochondria and protection of mitotic cells against abnormal divisions caused by damage to the centrosome. HSP70 is encoded by HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA1L, and unlike other proteins of this subfamily, it undergoes a low constitutive synthesis, while it shows increased expression during stress, especially under conditions of hypothermia, oxidative stress and pH changes. The increase in HSP70 expression is also associated with the anti-inflammatory effect, as this protein reduces the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8), while stimulating the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10.\n\n    The aim of the study was to investigate the defensive reaction of a chicken embryo to S. aureus infection by analysing the survival rate of chicken embryos and changes in the haematological picture of blood and the level of heat stress protein HSP70 in the liver during subsequent stages of embryogenesis.",
        "Methods": "    According to Directive 2010/63/EU, the experimental and animal procedures used in this study did not need to be approved by the Local Animal Ethics Committee.\n\n    Hatching eggs (egg weight (mean +- SD) 60.3 +- 6.11 g) of Ross 308 broiler chicken parental flock (Aviagen) were obtained from a commercial farm (Slawomir Domagala, Golaczewy, Poland).The eggs were incubated in a Brinsea type OVA-Easy advance incubator under standard conditions, i.e.: temperature 37.8 +- 0.1 C, relative humidity (RH) 50% +- 2%. On day of incubation (E) 10th (E10) the eggs were candled with using an ovoscope lamp to determine embryo development, and infertile and dead embryos eggs were rejected. The remaining eggs with live embryos (n = 360, 60 eggs per group) were used in further procedures (Table 1).\n\n    Staphylococcal strains used in the experiment were stored at -80 C on TSB medium containing 10% glycerol, and after revitalization on solid TSA. Bacterial strains were grown overnight in TSB liquid medium at 37 C with shaking .\n\n    Approximately 2 hours before the planned injection, the optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) of the liquid cultures was measured and equated to the value 8.00 (DTP 8.0). In three consecutive series of centrifugations, bacterial cells were rinsed with the remainder of the culture medium and suspended in sterile 0.7% NaCl solution. At this stage of the study, the cells were stored on ice at 4 C. Then it was checked that all bacterial cell suspensions contained the same number of bacterial cells by plating 50 microl in duplicate on TSA solid medium and incubating overnight at 37 C. Colonies grown on the solid media for each dilution were counted in order to determine the value of the colony forming unit (CFU) corresponding to the number of dividing bacterial cells contained in the volume of 50 mul of each used suspension.\n\n    The first part of the study covered six S. aureus strains, which in previous studies showed low (strains: tu2, pa3, ch10, ch24) and high virulence (strains: ch5 and ch25) for chicken embryos (Table 1).\n\n    The injection procedure was made at E10 according to the recommendation from that chicken embryos show maximum susceptibility to S. aureus infection at this stage of embryogenesis.\n\n    The embryonated eggs were selected and divided into seven parallel groups (n = 60 eggs per group); the surface of every egg was disinfected with 70% ethanol. Next, a small hole in the shell (diameter of about 2 mm) was made using an 18G needle (NIPRONIPRO MEDICALPOLAND, Warszawa, Poland) at the egg blunt end. The previously prepared bacterial suspensions in 50 microL of 0.7% saline solution were injected into the amniotic sac according to the previously described method. The control group eggs were injected only with sterilized 0.7% saline solution. The injection was made using a 25G needle (NIPRONIPRO MEDICAL POLAND, Warszawa, Poland) and 1 mL syringe (ZARYS International Group Ltd, Zabrze, Poland). After manipulation, the holes were sealed with hot paraffin, and incubation was continued. The eggs were candled daily for seven days to evaluate the viability of embryos.\n\n    Dead embryos were distinguished by the absence of spontaneous movement (usually associated with haemorrhage), loss of vascular architecture, and abnormal morphology. Such eggs were removed from the incubator and the stage of development was confirmed by break out and analysed using. Incubation was terminated on the 19th day of embryogenesis (E19) and all live embryos were euthanized.\n\n    Every day, starting on 13th day of embryogenesis (E13), tissues (blood and liver) were collected from four embryos from each group. The collected liver samples were placed in Eppendorf tubes and stored at -80 C until further analysis. The blood was collected from the umbilical artery of the embryo based on the method described by. The egg shell was punctured from the air chamber side, and then the egg was gently opened in a shallow vessel with water at a temperature of about 40 C in order to isolate the embryo together with the foetal membranes, taking care not to damage the blood vessels to isolate the umbilical artery. The dissected artery was clamped with surgical tweezers and then cut. After releasing the clamp, the first clean drop of blood was placed on a glass slide and with one firm movement a smear was made with the bevelled edge glass slide at an angle of approximately 45  so that the blood was spread along its entire surface. Smears were made and stained using the hemactolor staining kit (Cat. No.111661, MERCK Polska Ltd, Warszawa, Poland). After drying, the smears were analysed using a Nikon microscope integrated with the photo camera at 60 x magnification.\n\n    To examine expression of stress proteins, dot-blot assays were performed in a 96-well plate format using a Bio-dot microfiltration manifold (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Homogenates of liver tissues were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocols (Roche Applied Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). First, protease inhibitor cocktail PMSF (Roche) was used to prepare tissue extracts. The amount of protein was determined by the BCA method (Sigma-Aldrich), and samples were adjusted to an equal concentration. Subsequently, 50 microl of samples (35 microg of protein) was added to each well of the microfiltration apparatus and the blotting was performed according to a standard (Bio-Rad). Then, the membranes were blocked for 60 min at 37 C in a blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat milk solution (Gostyn, Poland) dissolved in TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Next, the membranes were treated with primary monoclonal murine anti-Heat Shock Protein 70 Antibody (3A3) (Cat.No. MA 3-006, ThermoFisher Scientific) solution at a dilution of 1:750 (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% non-fat milk, and incubated overnight at 4 C. The second day of analyses, membranes were washed three times with TBST, and incubated again with the secondary rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Cat. No. 402335, Calbiochem) in dilution 1:1000 for 90 at room temperature. The HSP70 reaction was developed using DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) HRP substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) with addition of imidazole and 3% H2O2, followed by a colour reaction. After the reaction was stopped, the membranes were air-dried and a densitometric analysis of protein dots was performed using a Syngene Ingenius instrument using the GeneSnap software.\n\n    Due to the risk of cross-reaction or high background, in order to match the antibody dilutions, test determinations were made on 2 controls and 4 experimental ones.\n\n    The hatchability results were analysed by a z-test, while the results of the level of the HSP70 were subjected to a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple range test. The relation between level of HSP 70 protein and day of incubation was determined by polynomial regression and Spearman rank-order correlation. Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma-Stat 2.03 (SPSS Science Software Ltd.).",
        "Results": "    The embryo mortality was 27% of injected eggs at the control and 20 to 28% at tu2, pa2 and ch10 strains while 53 to 60% at ch5, ch24, and ch25 strains (P < 0.01). The vast majority of ones (71-100% of all death embryos) were dying within the first 72 hours after treatment (Table 2).\n\n    The level of HSP70 protein in the liver of chicken embryos from the control group was between E13 and E16 at a similar level from 7899 a.u. (in E15) to 10140 a.u. (in E13). A significant increase in the HSP70 level to the values of 13113 a.u. and 11874 a.u. was observed in E17 and E18, respectively (Figure 1). The above changes can be described by a regression equation:\n\n    y = -294.43x3 + 14,170x2-224,936x + 106 for R2 = 0.454, where y - level of HSP 70 protein, ax - day of incubation. Compared to the control group, embryos infected with S. aureus bacteria were characterized by a higher level of HSP proteins (for the entire period between E13 and E19) from 12.3% for the ch10 strain to 19.7% for the ch5 strain (P <= 0.05; Figure 2). Moreover, on the one hand, changes in the level of these proteins in the liver of a chicken embryo in the following days of incubation were in line with the pattern observed in the control group, and on the other hand, it was noted that the increase in the level of HSP proteins in the groups infected with S. aureus coincided with cases of embryo mortality (Table 3).\n\n    During the experiment, there were cases of deaths of embryos between E14-E19, which coincided with a jump in the level of HSP70. In the case of the group infected with the tu2 strain, on day 15 of incubation, the loss of 4 chicken embryos was found, which coincided with an increase in the level of HSP70 from 10565 a.u. (E14) to 13580 a.u. (E15), similarly in the group injected with the ch24 strain, where on day 15 the loss of 2 embryos was found, which also in this case increased the level of the tested protein from 9722 a.u. (E14) to 14387.22 a.u. (E15).\n\n    During the analysis of blood smears of the control group embryos, isolated cases of damaged or destroyed erythrocytes were found, most probably as a result of mechanical damage during preparation of the preparations (Figure 3A). However, in the blood of embryos infected with S. aureus, numerous changes were found in the blood count in the form of: lysed red blood cells (Figure 3B); erythrocyte swelling (Figure 3C), damage to erythrocyte cell membranes (Figure 3D) and morphological changes of erythrocytes (Figure 3E).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The obtained results of mortality of chicken embryos in the first 72 hours after injection of suspensions containing various strains of S. aureus confirmed the differences in the degree of virulence of individual strains previously described by. Tu2, ch10 and pa3 strains, showing low virulence for chicken embryos so far, caused embryo mortality at the level of 24%, 30% and 32%, respectively. The ch5 and ch25 strains, which were highly virulent for chickens, caused 65% and 60% deaths, respectively, despite being administered in a 10-8 suspension. The only strain that, contrary to the results obtained in previous studies, caused a high mortality comparable to highly virulent strains was the ch24 strain, which caused a mortality of 60%. Moreover, it is worth noting that such a distribution of mortality probably indicates a rapid growth rate of Staphylococcus bacteria after amniotic fluid infection, which results in the fall of the weakest chicken embryos. On the other hand, the observed cases of embryo death in the control group within 72 hours after injection may be the result of disturbed homeostasis caused by manipulation itself.\n\n    Studies have shown that the presence of HSP 70 is found in the liver of chicken embryos at least from the 10th day of incubation. The level of HSP70 protein in the liver of chicken embryos from the control group remained at a similar level between days 13 and 16. On day 17 of incubation, a significant increase in the level of HSP70 was observed in all study groups. It is probably the result of the initiation of a number of physiological processes leading to the hatching of the chick. The increase in HSP72 protein expression in the liver, but also in the heart and spleen during the subsequent hatching stages was also observed by. During this time, the metabolism of the embryo increases, and with it the concentration of many hormones. This is especially true of thyroid hormones and corticosterone. Thyroid hormones: thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) play an important role in the development of many systems of the embryo, e.g., they are responsible for heat production. Their level in the blood plasma of embryos during early embryogenesis is low, however, during the hatching period, when the organism is mobilized, their concentration increases rapidly, as does the concentration of corticosterone.\n\n    The change in the level of HSP70 protein in the liver of chicken embryos infected with S. aureus in the following days of incubation was in line with the pattern described above, with the provision that it assumed values higher than in the control group. The increase in HSP70 level is probably caused by a strong immune response many antigens derived from S. aureus bacteria.\n\n    Moreover, it appears that the virulence of the staphylococcal strain is positively correlated with the level of HSP70 protein in the liver of the embryos. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that its sharp increase coincided with the period of recorded death of embryos. In this case, an increase in the level of HSP70 in groups infected with tu2 and ch24 strains would indicate the activation of the immune system of the infected organism in response to the stress factor, which in this case is infection with S. aureus bacteria.This is in line with the results of, who observed a change in HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the spleen of chickens under heat stress conditions after administration of antistress compounds. However, in the case of low virulence strains like ch10, it can be speculated that the effects of the body's fight against infection are effective, resulting in low mortality and a slight increase in the level of HSP70 protein.\n\n    As a result of the stress factor acting in the cells, there is an increase in the amount of denatured proteins that bind to heat stress proteins. This results in the detachment of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) from the cytoplasmic complex of HSP. HSF1 is present in the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer unable to bind to DNA under conditions of the organism's homeostasis, while under stress it is activated by protein kinases. The released phosphorylated HSF1 monomers, once in the cell nucleus, bind to the DNA sequence in the promoter of the HSP gene, inducing an increase in transcription of these genes. If HSP synthesis is reduced, the number of damaged proteins in the cell increases due to genetic instability caused by mutations and disturbances in the cell cycle. Such an increase in HSP levels has been described in humans when infected with pathogens such as: Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. The results of blood counts correspond to the results described above. The damage to the cytoplasmic membranes of red blood cells, deformation of the shape of erythrocytes and spots after lysed erythrocytes observed in the microscopic image of blood smears seem to be caused by toxins produced by S. aureus bacteria. It is known that monomeric toxins of staphylococci have the ability to penetrate the cytoplasmic membranes, and this process takes place in two stages. The alpha-toxin plays a special role here, as it damages the lipid bilayer. It is a cytolytic exotoxin produced by most bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus. The alpha-toxin monomers are attached to the cell membrane surface, and the process is still reversible at this stage. Then, there is a gradual transformation of the hitherto hydrophilic monomers into hydrophobic molecules capable of penetrating the membrane, and the hemolysin, after attaching to cholesterol contained in the cell membrane, polymerizes to form pores. At this stage, the process is irreversible. In the case of a low concentration of toxins, metabolic disorders of the host cells are observed, resulting from a violation of the integrity of the cell membrane. However, when their concentration is high enough, cells die by lysis.\n\n    To conclude, among the studied S. aureus strains, the strains ch5, ch25, and ch24 were characterized by the highest virulence for chicken embryos, pa3 and ch10 lower, and tu2 the lowest. Infection of chicken embryos with selected strains of bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus caused changes in the level of heat stress protein HSP70 in the tissues of chicken embryos. The level of heat stress protein HSP70 increases significantly at the beginning of the hatching process on day 17. Infection of chicken embryos with selected strains of bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus causes changes in the haematological image of the blood of chicken embryos. The results obtained in the experiment indicate that changes in the level of HSP70 protein may be a useful indicator of the course of infection with S. aureus bacteria. It also seems that the chicken embryo model may constitute a convenient research model in the research on the pathogenesis of diseases caused by bacteria.",

        "Title": "    The Arabidopsis Protein Disulfide Isomerase Subfamily M Isoform, PDI9, Localizes to the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Influences Pollen Viability and Proper Formation of the Pollen Exine During Heat Stress",
        "Abstract": "    Plants adapt to heat via thermotolerance pathways in which the activation of protein folding chaperones is essential. In eukaryotes, protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) facilitate the folding of nascent and misfolded proteins in the secretory pathway by catalyzing the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds and serving as molecular chaperones. In Arabidopsis, several members of the PDI family are upregulated in response to chemical inducers of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including both members of the non-classical PDI-M subfamily, PDI9 and PDI10. Unlike classical PDIs, which have two catalytic thioredoxin (TRX) domains separated by two non-catalytic TRX-fold domains, PDI-M isoforms are orthologs of mammalian P5/PDIA6 and possess two tandem catalytic domains. Here, PDI9 accumulation was found to be upregulated in pollen in response to heat stress. Histochemical staining of plants harboring the PDI9 and PDI10 promoters fused to the gusA gene indicated they were actively expressed in the anthers of flowers, specifically in the pollen and tapetum. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that PDI9 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in root and pollen cells. transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutations in the PDI9 gene disrupted pollen viability and development in plants exposed to heat stress. In particular, the pollen grains of pdi9 mutants exhibited disruptions in the reticulated pattern of the exine and an increased adhesion of pollen grains. Pollen in the pdi10 single mutant did not display similar heat-associated defects, but pdi9 pdi10 double mutants (DMs) completely lost exine reticulation. Interestingly, overexpression of PDI9 partially led to heat-associated defects in the exine. We conclude that PDI9 plays an important role in pollen thermotolerance and exine biogenesis. Its role fits the mechanistic theory of proteostasis in which an ideal balance of PDI isoforms is required in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for normal exine formation in plants subjected to heat stress.",
        "Introduction": "    Pollen has the most structurally complex cell wall produced by plants and serves as a highly protective barrier for the male gametophyte. The composition of the pollen cell wall changes throughout development and is precisely regulated by a transcription factor cascade, and the coordinated synthesis of biosynthetic enzymes secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The pollen wall consist of two layers: an inner layer (intine) composed mainly of pectin and cellulose, and an outer layer (exine) that is primarily composed of the highly durable heterogeneous polymer, sporopollenin, which confers the pollen with formidable resistance to desiccation and degradation. Developing pollen is surrounded by a layer of highly metabolically active sporophytic anther cells designated the tapetum, which play a critical role in pollen wall biogenesis by synthesizing and secreting the sporopollenin monomers used to form the exine layer. The tapetum also supplies the developing pollen cell with nutrients, and regulatory molecules, such as phytohormones, which coordinate the process of pollen development. The programmed cell death of the tapetum detaches it from the pollen cell wall, simultaneously depositing the final layer of sporopollenin (and in some species, lipid), causing the dehiscence of mature pollen grains from the anthers.\n\n    Pollen development is highly sensitive to abiotic stresses, such as heat, with exposure to elevated temperatures resulting in pollen cell death, male sterility, and a decrease in attachment to the stigma. Pollen heat sensitivity is related to the increased demand for metabolic energy, and cell wall precursor and protein synthesis during the short phase of microspore formation and maturation into pollen grains. Defects in the development of the tapetum serve as the primary basis for heat stress-induced male sterility in plants. During the course of pollen formation, the tapetum ER must maintain an increased capacity to synthesize, fold, and secrete proteins, sporopollenin biosynthetic enzymes and cofactors, and monomeric sporopollenin precursors. When proteostasis is jeopardized, such as upon exposure to heat stress, unfolded proteins accumulate to higher levels than can be dealt with by the folding capacity of the ER, leading to ER-stress. In turn, ER stress-sensing proteins and transcription factors activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR attempts to restore protein homeostasis by inducing protein folding catalysts and chaperones, while also temporarily downregulating some metabolic processes. In addition, excess misfolded proteins are disaggregated to be folded or proteolytically degraded via ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) through either the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (ERAD-I) or the autophagy/lysosome pathway (ERAD-II).\n\n    With the heavy demands placed on the ER, secretory apparatus, and protein folding processes, it is not surprising that the UPR is constitutively augmented in the tapetum in non-stressed conditions. Moreover, studies on one of the three different ER membrane UPR sensors, inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), show that it affects pollen development in response to heat. The IRE1A/IRE1B complex is a ribonuclease-kinase that unconventionally splices bZIP60 messenger RNA (mRNA) to produce the active form of the transcription factor, bZIP60s, which subsequently activates the expression of downstream UPR genes. Interestingly, the IRE1A/IRE1B-mediated splicing of bZIP60 mRNA is enhanced at elevated growth temperatures. Arabidopsis ire1a ire1b double knockout mutants (KOs) are fertile when grown at room temperature, but exhibit abnormal tapetum development, aberrant pollen coat deposition, and partial male sterility during heat stress, indicating that UPR plays an important role in pollen thermotolerance.\n\n    As part of the protein folding apparatus in the ER, protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds that stabilize the native conformations of many secretory proteins. The classical PDI, represented by the isoform PDIp in yeast and PDIA1 in mammals, exhibits both disulfide oxidoreductaste/isomerase and molecular chaperone activities, and has been shown to be essential for viability in both yeast and nematodes. In plants, the classical PDI5 functions as a protein foldase in the ER, and a chaperone that inhibits cysteine proteases during trafficking to vacuoles, then releases the cysteine protease to engage in programmed cell death of the endothelium in developing seeds. PDI2 mediates protein folding in the ER and localizes to both the secretory pathway and nucleus, where it interacts with maternal effect embryo arrest factor. In plants, yeast and animals, classical PDI isoforms are characterized by a domain arrangement consisting of two \"a-type\" catalytic thioredoxin (TRX) domains (a, a'), separated by two non-catalytic \"b-type\" TRX-fold domains (b, b'), in the sequence a-b-b'-a'. Due to their important role in the proper folding of proteins, the UPR activates the expression of several PDI genes in Arabidopsis. Additionally, mammalian PDIA1 has been shown to be an activator of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), which mediates a UPR signaling pathway, the runs parallel to the IRE1/bZIP60 system.\n\n    There are six structurally distinct PDI subfamilies in plants, designated PDI-A, -B, -C, -L, -M, and -S, with the members of the PDI-L subfamily sharing the classical PDI domain arrangement. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 14 members of the PDI family, of which six are transcriptionally upregulated by UPR via the IRE1/bZIP60 signaling pathway. Among these UPR-induced genes are both members of the non-classical PDI-M subfamily, PDI9 and PDI10. Moreover, the UPR-transcription factor bZIP60 was shown to mediate PDI9 transcription in response to UPR. PDI-M isoforms possess two a-type domains and a single b-type domain, in the arrangement ao-a-b, with the tandem a-type domains often designated as ao and a to denote that they are not direct evolutionary counterparts to the a and a' domains of classical PDI. Molecular characterization of poplar PDI-M indicates that the ao domain preferentially catalyzes disulfide oxidation, while the a domain catalyzes reduction reactions. In rice grains, PDI-M strongly accumulates in ER-derived type I protein bodies (PB-I), and RNAi-mediated knockdown of the rice PDI-M gene PDIL2;3 inhibits the accumulation of Cys-rich 10-kD prolamin in PB-I. When transiently expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of PDI9 and PDI10 also accumulate in ER-derived protein bodies, and the ER lumen. Both PDI9 and PDI10 exhibit a strong capacity to catalyze disulfide bond formation, as demonstrated by their ability to functionally substitute for the major bacterial disulfide oxidase, DsbA, when heterologously expressed in an Escherichia coli dsba- mutant.\n\n    Interestingly, a transcriptomic analysis of anthers revealed that the genes encoding PDI9 and PDI10, as well as the classical PDI-L isoform PDI5, are expressed at multiple stages of pollen development. Although these genes are upregulated as part of the UPR signaling pathway, little is known concerning their role in pollen development or the UPR-mediated response to heat stress. Previously, the only Arabidopsis PDI associated with a pollen-related mutant phenotype was the PDI-S isoform, PDI11. Mutants expressing truncated versions of PDI11 exhibit disrupted pollen tube guidance, though pdi11 null mutants do not display a similar phenotype, indicating that the truncation mutants are likely neomorphic.\n\n    In this study, we report that PDI9 is an ER protein that is highly expressed in anthers and pollen and is upregulated in response to heat. Insertional mutations in PDI9 disrupt pollen viability and development in plants exposed to heat stress. In particular, the formation of the pollen exine is adversely affected, disrupting the reticulated pattern of the exine and leading to adhesion among pollen grains. Overexpression of PDI9 also resulted in partially disrupted exine patterning of heat stressed pollen. We propose that PDI9 plays a crucial role in the ability of developing pollen to withstand heat stress, and that an ideal balance of specific PDI isoforms is required in the ER at elevated temperatures for proper exine formation and the overall maintenance of proteostasis within the secretory pathway.",
        "Methods": "    The names and sequences of all primers used in this study are provided in Supplementary Figure 1.\n\n    Except for the plants used in heat stress experiments, all Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized and germinated on 0.5X Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1.5% (w/v) sucrose and solidified with 0.8% (w/v) Phytagel (Millipore-Sigma). For selectable marker screening, plants were sown horizontally on the agar medium containing the appropriate antibiotic, with a thin overlay of media also containing the antibiotic. All other seedlings were grown vertically on the agar surface. Liquid cultured plants were grown on the 0.5X MS, 1.5% sucrose medium without gelling agent. For plants grown in soil, Arabidopsis seedlings were initially grown on 0.5X MS, 1.5% sucrose medium, and then transferred at 1-2 weeks after germination to pots containing Fafard Super Fine Germinating Mix (Sun Gro Horticulture, Co. Agawam, MA, United States) supplemented with Miracle-Gro Plant Food (The Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.). Plants were grown at 22 C under a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/8 h dark cycle, 75 mumol photons m-2s-1). Various tissues were harvested from seedlings at 10-21 days except for flowers and siliques, for which plants were grown for 6-10 weeks, respectively.\n\n    For control and heat stress treatments, seedlings were grown on 0.5X Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) media (PhytoTechnology Laboratories Cat #: L473) supplemented with 3% sucrose for 7 days and transplanted to individual pots in a randomized design. All plants were initially grown at 22 C on a 16/8 h of light/dark cycle (approximately 75 mumol photons m-2s-1) for 2.5 weeks. Then, half of the plants were moved to a growth chamber for heat stress, while the other half (controls) remained in normal growth conditions. Heat stressed plants were exposed to 35 C 16 h light/27 C 8 h dark cycle according to, while the control plants remained at a constant 22 C. Pollen phenotyping took place after 2 weeks of heat stress. Siliques were returned to 22 C for 1-2 weeks to allow siliques to develop before phenotyping.\n\n    Arabidopsis thaliana L. wild type Columbia (WT, Col-0) plants were used in this study, and all transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants and transgenic plants are in the Col-0 background. The PDI9 and PDI10 genes have the identifiers At2g32920 and At1g04980, respectively, as previously reported. Three independent T-DNA insertion mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center: pdi9-1 (WiscDsLox445A08, progeny line CS864623 confirmed homozygous for the T-DNA), pdi9-2 (GK-637C09), and pdi10-1 (SALK_206219C). The position of the T-DNA insertion within each mutant allele is shown in Figure 1B. PDI9 and PDI10 both possess nine exons, and have gene lengths (from translation start to stop) of 2,905 and 2,252 bp, respectively. Relative to the translation start site, the positions of the T-DNA insertions are nt 1,612 (fifth intron) for pdi9-1, nt 2,821 (ninth exon) for pdi9-2, and nt 24 (first exon) for pdi10-1. The pdi9 pdi10 double mutant (DM) was created by crossing pdi9-1 x pdi10-1 and identifying double homozygous mutant progeny in the F3 generation by PCR and sequencing. Genotyping at the PDI9 locus was performed using primers PDI9g-F and PDI9g-R to detect the WT allele, PDI9 primer PDI9-TDNA-Check-F (and double confirmed with primer PDI9g-F), and PDI-9-TDNA-Check-R (and double confirmed with primer WiscDsLoxP745), to detect pdi9-1, and PDI9 primer PDI9g-F and T-DNA primer GK-8474 to detect pdi9-2. Genotyping of PDI10 was performed using primers PDI10g-F and PDI10g-R to detect WT PDI10, and PDI10-TDNA-Check-F2 (double confirmed with primer PDI10g_F) and LBb1 (double confirmed with primer Lba1) to detect pdi10-1. The absence of WT PDI9 or PDI10 mRNA in corresponding mutants was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), using primers PDI9g_F and PDI9g_R to detect the PDI9 transcript, and primers PDI10rt_F1 and PDI10rt_1R to detect the PDI10 transcript. Total mRNA for RT-PCR analyses were obtained from whole 7-day-old seedlings using the NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Machery-Nagel, Inc.).\n\n    The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter constructs for PDI9 and PDI10 promoter analysis were created by PCR amplification of the histological reporter gene, gusA, from pCAMBIA1304 using primers gusA-F-XhoI and gusA-R-BstEII, and the 5'-flanking sequences ~2.7 kb upstream of the start codons of PDI9 and PDI10 (containing the promoter regions) using the forward and reverse primers PDI9-Pr-F-KpnI and PDI9-Pr-R-NcoI for PDI9, and PDI10-Pr-F-KpnI and PDI10-Pr-R-NcoI-R for PDI10. The amplified sequences were inserted into the plant transformation vector pCAMBIA1302, with the gusA fragment digested with XhoI and BstEII and ligated between the vector restriction sites SalI and BstEII, and the PDI9 or PDI10 promoter fragment digested with KpnI and NcoI and ligated between the vector KpnI and NcoI restriction sites. The constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, and then introduced into Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, using the floral dip method. The T1 transformants were screened for hygromycin resistance (HygR) by germinating seeds on 1/2 MS + 0.8% Phytagel media containing 50 mug/ml hygromycin B (Millipore-Sigma). The intactness of the promoter-GUS fusion transgene was assessed by PCR and sequencing of the PCR product. Segregation analysis of the HygR marker was performed on T3 seedling populations to identify lines that were homozygous for the transgene (100% HygR). A total of 8-10 independent transgenic lines of each promoter-GUS fusion were selected for phenotype staining evaluation.\n\n    The PDI9 overexpressor (OE) line, 35S:PDI9, was created by replacing the GFP coding sequence of plant transformation vector pCAMBIA1302 with the PDI9 cDNA sequence. The PDI9 cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers, PDI9-F-PciI and PDI9-R-BstEII, purified and sequentially digested with the restriction enzymes PciI and BstEII, and ligated into the BstEII and NcoI sites of pCAMBIA1302, placing the PDI9 coding sequence under the control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. The T1 transformants were screened for HygR by germinating seeds on 1/2 MS + 0.8% Phytagel media containing 50 mug/ml hygromycin B, and segregation analysis performed on the T3 generation to identify homozygous populations.\n\n    beta-glucuronidase staining was performed as described. Briefly, the tissue samples were fixed in 90% ice-cold acetone for 20 min at 25 C, then washed with staining buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mM potassium ferricyanide] three times on ice, then submerged in staining buffer containing 1 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-beta-D-glucuronide cyclohexylammonium salt (X-gluc). The tissues were vacuum infiltrated briefly, and then incubated O/N at 37 C. After staining, the samples were incubated in 70% EtOH to extract soluble pigments. Images of GUS staining in floral buds were taken on an Olympus SZX-12 stereomicroscope. For inflorescence staining, tissue samples were collected from 6-week-old PDI9promoter:GUS and PDI10promoter:GUS flowering plants.\n\n    An affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antiserum specifically recognizing PDI9 was generated commercially through YenZym Antibodies, LLC, using a truncated version of PDI9 (Figure 1) as the antigen for both rabbit immunization and affinity purification of the antiserum. For production of recombinant tcPDI9 protein, a cDNA fragment encoding a 173 amino acid residue portion of the C-terminus of PDI9 (residues Val268-Leu440) was amplified with the following primers: tcPDI9-Nde-for and tcPDI9-BH1-rev (Supplementary Figure 1). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified on a GFX column (Amersham Biosciences) and was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET15b (EMD Millipore). The tcPDI9 sequence was placed in-frame with the 6X His-tag of pET15b and verified by DNA sequencing. Expression of tcPDI9 was induced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for 3 h at 28 C by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After induction, the E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (EMD Millipore). The His-tagged tcPDI9 protein was purified from the lysate by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography (EMD Millipore).\n\n    A 40 mg aliquot of total cell protein extracts from E. coli harboring either the pET-PDI9 expression construct or the pET-15b empty vector, with or without IPTG induction, were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Amersham Protran nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) by electroblotting. Immunoblot analyses were performed using the anti-PDI9 antibody at 1:500 dilution and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody at 1:3,000 dilution. The anti-rabbit secondary antibody and the reagents for chemiluminescent detection of HRP were supplied in the Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Kit (RPN2108; GE Healthcare Life Sciences).\n\n    For immunoblot analyses, proteins were isolated from the various plant tissues according to, from the WT, a constitutive 35S:PDI9 OE line, and the pdi9-1 T-DNA mutant. For experiments demonstrating the absence of PDI9 protein in pdi9 mutants, proteins were extracted from 7-day-old WT, pdi9-1, pdi9-2, pdi9 pdi10 double mutant, and 35S:PDI9 seedlings. For tissue-specific expression studies, roots were obtained from 2-week-old seedlings grown in liquid culture under constant agitation. All other tissues were obtained from soil-grown plants, including stems and rosette leaves (4-week-old), flower and pollen (6-week-old), and siliques (8-12-week-old). Comparison of PDI9 abundance in normally grown and heat stressed plants was performed using protein extracted from the pollen of 6-week-old plants. The proteins (10 mg/lane) were electrophoresed on a 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, were electro-transferred to Amersham Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham) and analyzed using the polyclonal rabbit PDI9-specific antiserum (1:500 dilution; except 1:100 for pollen samples) followed by an anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:2,000 dilution. The anti-rabbit secondary antibody and the reagents for chemiluminescent detection of HRP were supplied in the Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Kit (RPN2108; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). As a negative control, the PDI9-specific antiserum was substituted with pre-immune serum obtained from the host rabbit. Coomassie staining and probing with polyclonal rabbit anti-actin antibody (#SAB4301137, Millipore Sigma, Inc.) were performed as protein loading controls.\n\n    For roots, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on 0.6% Phytoagar-solidified 0.5X MS medium at 22 C under continuous light. For anthers, Arabidopsis plants were grown for 6 weeks as described above under \"Plant Growth Conditions.\" High-pressure freezing, freeze substitution, and immunogold labeling were carried out according to. In brief, root tips were excised from 5-day-old seedlings, whereas anthers and pollen were taken from floral buds of 42-day-old plants. Tissues were frozen rapidly with a HPM100 high-pressure freezer (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, United States). Frozen tissue samples were freeze-substituted in anhydrous acetone containing 0.1% uranyl acetate and 0.25% glutaraldehyde at -80 C and embedded in Lowicryl HM-20 acrylic resin (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA, United States). About 100 nm thick sections were prepared from wild-type and 35S:PDI9 tissue samples as described and immunolabeled with the anti-PDI9 antibody. Then, they were labeled with 15 nm gold conjugated goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L; #15727; Ted Pella, Inc.). TEM images were collected with a Hitachi H-7650 Transmission Electron Microscope at 100 kV (Hitachi America, Inc., Schaumburg, IL, United States).\n\n    Alexander staining was performed as described by. Individual flowers at stage 13 (anthesis) were harvested and placed in 1.5 ml microtubes, and 150 ml of Alexander staining solution was added immediately. The tubes were vortexed on high for 1 min to release the pollen from anthers, and then centrifuged for 2 min at 18,000 g. Flowers were carefully removed with a fresh pipette tip to avoid disturbing the pollen pellet. Hundred milliliter of solution was removed and 750 ml of ddH20 was added followed by brief vortexing (10 s) and centrifugation for 1 min at 18,000 g. This wash step was repeated once more with fresh 750 ml ddH20. After the last wash, all but 25 mul of solution was removed. Pollen was resuspended in the 25 mul and was used for imaging.\n\n    The pollen sample was resuspended in the remaining 25 mul of solution and was added to glass microscope slides with 1.6 mm deep wells (Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat #: 71878-01) for imaging. The slides were examined under an Olympus BHB light microscope and photographed using with an AmScope WF200 camera. Pollen was counted from photographs at 4X or 10X using the image analysis program FIJI with a custom Javascript utilizing FIJI macros. Each image was converted to a 16-bit image using default thresholds, and pollen grains were identified from a defined minimum pixel size. Each pollen count was overlaid on the original RGB image. Aborted and clustered pollen grains were manually counted from the processed image. Each pollen grain is classified as non-aborted (viable), aborted (non-viable), or ambiguous. One-way ANOVA was performed for statistical analysis, calculated using Microsoft Excel.\n\n    For qualitative imaging, anthers from stage 13 flowers from each genotype-treatment were harvested and gently dabbed directly onto the carbon mounting medium to release pollen. Pollen grains and anthers were gently moved on the mounting using a single hairbrush under a dissecting microscope and secured with conductive carbon tape (Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat. #: 77827-12) on aluminum stubs (Ted Pella Cat. #: 16111), then sputter-coated with gold/palladium (Anatech United States Cat. #: 1002021) in a Hummer 6.2 sputter apparatus. Specimens were viewed on a Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV at 4,000 and 11,000x magnifications.",
        "Results": "    The two PDI-M genes of Arabidopsis, PDI9 and PDI10, encode for highly similar proteins (79% sequence identity) with an identical domain arrangement consisting of two tandem catalytic domains (ao, a), followed by a non-catalytic TRX-fold domain (b), and a C-terminal acidic region (c; Figure 1A). This domain arrangement is shared by their mammalian ortholog, P5/PDIA6, and differs from the classical mammalian PDI domain arrangement, which consists of two catalytic domains (a, a') separated by two central non-catalytic TRX-fold domains (b, b'), and a C-proximal acidic c region (Figure 1A). Note that, the term b domain is commonly used in the literature to indicate any domain possessing a TRX-fold but lacking redox activity, regardless of homology. Pairwise BlastP comparisons revealed that the b domains of PDI9 and PDI10 are homologous to the b domain of mammalian P5, but do not share significant sequence homology to the b or b' domains of classical mammalian PDI, or the b/b' domains of Arabidopsis PDI-B and PDI-L isoforms. Whereas PDI9 and its mammalian ortholog P5 possess the C-terminal ER retention motif, KDEL, the C-terminus of PDI10 contains the variant sequence KDDL.\n\n    The PDI9 and PDI10 genes possess a similar arrangement of nine exons and eight introns, with exon and intron lengths being approximately similar between the two genes (Figure 1B). To gain further insight into the function of the PDI-M subfamily, T-DNA insertional mutants were obtained for both PDI9 and PDI10. Using the SIGnAL T-DNA Express Arabidopsis Gene Mapping tool, two independent T-DNA alleles for PDI9 were identified, located in intron 5 (pdi9-1) and exon 9 (pdi9-2), and a single T-DNA insertion mutant was identified for PDI10 (pdi10-1), located 24 nt downstream of the translational start site in exon 1 (Figure 1B). The PDI9 gene is the main subject of this study. Additionally, crosses were performed between pdi9-1 and pdi10-1 to obtain double mutants completely lacking functional PDI-M. And the two independent single pdi9 mutants, pdi9-1 and pdi9-2, were crossed to create the pdi9-1/pdi9-2 transheterozygote hybrid mutant containing a single copy of each mutant gene, which was used as a test for allelism of the pdi9-1 and pdi9-2 mutant genes. The absence of wild-type PDI9 or PDI10 transcript in corresponding homozygous pdi9-1, pdi9-2, and pdi10-1 plants and the transheterozygote mutant was confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 2).\n\n    No obvious phenotype was observed among the pdi9 and pdi10 single mutants, or pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant plants and the transheterozygote mutant, when grown under standard laboratory conditions (data not shown). Transgenic plants ectopically overexpressing PDI9 under the CaMV 35S promoter (35S:PDI9) also did not display any obvious phenotypic differences when compared to wild-type plants grown in parallel (data not shown). Thus, PDI-M does not appear to be essential for plant viability, and loss of both isoforms in Arabidopsis does not result in an overt mutant phenotype under normal growth conditions.\n\n    To compare the spatial expression patterns of the two PDI-M genes in various organs of Arabidopsis, multiple independent transgenic plants harboring the promoter sequences of PDI9 and PDI10 transcriptionally fused to the gusA reporter gene were generated. Histochemical staining of 14-day old PDI9promoter:GUS and PDI10promoter:GUS plants (Supplementary Figure 3) indicated that both promoters were active in petioles and leaves, with strong GUS staining observed in vascular tissue and apical meristem, and with weaker staining in sections of roots. GUS expression was also detected in trichomes (Supplementary Figure 3C). Most notably, in 6-week-old flowering plants, the PDI9promoter:GUS and PDI10promoter:GUS constructs are actively expressed during anther development in flowers (Figure 2), specifically during the formation of pollen grains and in the surrounding tapetum (Figures 2G-I). The prominent GUS staining in the pollen of post-anthesis flowers (floral development stage 13+) is consistent with transcriptomic data that indicated both PDI9 and PDI10 are expressed in pollen grains.\n\n    A PDI9-specific antiserum was generated against the last 173 a.a. of PDI9, which encompasses the b domain and acidic c region, while omitting the redox-active ao and a domains (Figure 1A). The ability of the antibody to detect PDI9 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of protein extracts obtained from 7-day-old WT, pdi9-1, pdi9-2, pdi10-1, and pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant seedlings, as well as the transgenic OE 35S:PDI9. No protein band corresponding to PDI9 was detected for the mutant lines, pdi9-1, pdi9-2, or the pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutants (27 and 60A), while the lane for 35S:PDI9 displayed noticeably more protein than WT (Supplementary Figure 2). Immunoblot analysis of proteins from various tissues of WT revealed that PDI9 was relatively abundant in flowers and roots, and was also present in rosette leaves, stems, and siliques (Figure 3A). The presence of PDI9 in pollen specifically was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of protein extracted from the pollen of WT plants, with pdi9-1 and 35S:PDI9 serving as negative and positive controls, respectively (Figure 3A).\n\n    Due to the relatively high abundance of PDI9 in roots and flowers indicated by the immunoblots, the subcellular distribution of PDI9 was investigated in these tissues. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on cryofixed thin tissue sections prepared from roots and anthers, which were immunolabeled with affinity-purified PDI9 antiserum and a 15 nm gold-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The subcellular location of the PDI9 protein was determined to be in the ER in both roots (Figure 3B) and pollen (Figure 3C) of WT plants. No significant immunolabeling by the PDI9 antiserum was observed in the root cells of pdi9-1 or the pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant, indicating that the antiserum exhibits minimal background cross-reactivity (Supplementary Figure 4). Although PDI-M isoforms were previously shown to highly accumulate in ER-derived protein bodies, no labeling of such structures by the PDI9 antisera was observed in either roots or pollen. This likely reflects the relative absence of protein bodies in these tissues, which are most commonly associated with protein storage in the seed endosperm, or the sequestration of high levels of recombinantly expressed protein.\n\n    The expression of PDI9 and PDI10 in anthers and pollen provided an opportunity to investigate the potential role of these protein folding catalysts in mediating plant responses to environmental stresses, such as heat stress, that perturb protein folding. Immunoblot analysis revealed that PDI9 abundance was substantially increased by 2.0-fold in heat-stressed pollen relative to pollen from plants grown under non-stressed conditions, with actin abundance serving as a protein loading control (Figure 4A). No PDI9 protein was detected in the pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant which served as a negative control (Figure 4A).\n\n    To determine if altered expression of PDI-M genes affects pollen sensitivity to heat stress, pollen viability under normal and heat stressed conditions was ascertained by Alexander's viability staining. Under this assay, viable pollen grains are visually stained purple, whereas non-viable pollen, which is typically shriveled in appearance, are stained blue (Figure 4B). Notably, heat stress resulted in some pollen grains failing to properly separate from tetrads, leading to clusters of adhering viable and/or nonviable pollen grains (Figures 4B-D). Quantification of pollen viability under normal growth conditions revealed that the two independent homozygous pdi9-1 and pdi9-2 mutants, and pdi10-1 mutants all possess pollen viability rates similar to WT (~99%), as do pdi9-1/pdi9-2 transheterozygote mutant, pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutants, and 35S:PDI9 transgenic OEs (Figure 4E). Upon heat stress, a significant decrease in viable pollen grains was observed across all genotypes. Statistically significant reductions in the average pollen viability percentages for pdi9-1 (68%), pdi9-2 (64%), pdi9-1/pdi9-2 transheterozygote mutant (72%), and pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant plants (61%) were observed relative to pollen viability of WT plants (87%) grown under identical heat stress conditions (Figure 4E). On the other hand, the heat stressed pollen viabilities of the pdi10-1 single mutant and 35S:PDI9 OE line did not differ significantly from WT.\n\n    The modified Alexander staining method described here combined with the ImageJ software allowed for the quantification of dehiscent pollen grains per flower (Table 1). Non-stressed Col-0 flowers at stage 13 (anthesis) have approximately 570-600 dehiscent pollen grains per flower, or 1,700-1,800 dehiscent pollen grains per sample (three flowers from one plant). Although all examined genotypes show a significant reduction in the number of dehisced pollen grains in plants exposed to heat stress (Table 1), the pdi9 loss-of-function single mutants and pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant exhibited a significantly lower number of dehisced pollen grains (97-98% reduction) than WT (88% reduction) under heat stress. Surprisingly, the heat stressed 35S:PDI9 OE also displayed reduced pollen dehiscence relative to WT, though to a lesser extent than any of the pdi9 mutants.\n\n    To determine if mutations in PDI-M genes affect pollen morphology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on pollen obtained from non-stressed (control) and heat stressed WT, pdi9 single mutants (pdi9-1, pdi9-2) transheterozygote mutant (pdi9-1/pdi9-2), pdi10-1 single mutant, pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant, and 35S:PDI9 OE plants. Pollen grains obtained from plants of each genotype grown in control conditions have essentially the same morphology consisting of three elongated colpi (furrows) and a reticulated surface pattern (column 1, Control Temperature, in Figure 5). The majority of pollen grains from heat stressed WT, pdi10-1, and 35S:PDI9 OE plants maintain a normal overall shape similar to that of non-stressed controls (Figures 5A2,D2,G2). In contrast, pollen grains from the pdi9-1, pdi9-2, pdi9-1/pdi9-2 transheterozygote mutant, and pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutants exposed to heat stress were severely deformed, having aberrant exine patterns (Figures 5B2,B4,C2,C4,E2,E4,F2) relative to pollen from non-stressed plants. The double mutant under heat conditions had the most disrupted exine pattern (Figures 5F2,F4) with no reticulation. Instead, various globular structures (possibly sporopollenin) formed on the exterior of pdi9-1 pdi10-1 pollen grains (Figure 5F4). The 35S:PDI9 OE also has a moderately disrupted exine pattern, but unlike the double mutant, the defect is visible in control temperature as well as heat stressed pollen grains (Figures 5G3,G4). OE pollen grains have a combination of large patches of normal exine reticula with smaller areas of broken reticula (Figures 5G3,G4).\n\n    High magnification SEM images of whole anthers from WT (Figure 6A) and pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutant (Figures 6B,E) plants exposed to heat stress revealed that the WT pollen had a distinct spherical shape (Figure 6A), whereas double mutant pollen were shriveled and stuck together in the anther (Figures 6B,E). Pollen adhesion or clustering was also seen in pdi9 single mutants exposed to heat stress, with a representative image of a tranheterozygous pdi9-1/pdi9-2 anther shown in Figure 6F. The areas of pollen adhesion are smooth, lacking a reticulate pattern. In addition, when the pollen was carefully removed before fixation to expose the underlying tapetum, differences were seen in the organization of tapetal cells in control (Figure 6C) relative to heat stressed flowers (Figure 6D). Tapetal cells from control anthers were organized in parallel striations, whereas in the heat stressed anthers, the cells were disorganized and fused. Based on mutant phenotype obtained with the transheterozygote mutant (Figures 5, 6), the two mutant genes pdi9-1 and pdi9-2 are allelic and fail to complement each other in the F1 hybrids. This further supports that the mutant heat stress phenotypes were caused by the disruption of the PDI9 gene by the T-DNA, and not caused by a T-DNA located somewhere else in the genome. Taken together, the external analysis of the pollen grains and anthers indicated that the absence of PDI9 in the single mutants, and both PDI9 and PDI10 in the double mutant, dramatically disrupted the development of the external exine and release of the pollen during heat stress.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The plant PDI-M subfamily is orthologous to mammalian P5/PDIA6 and has previously been shown to accumulate in ER-derived type-I protein bodies (PB-I) and the ER lumen. In rice, RNAi-mediated suppression of the PDI-M gene PDIL2;3 impairs the accumulation of Cys-rich 10-kD prolamin in PB-I. In Arabidopsis, the PDI-M subfamily is part of the UPR pathway. In this report, we have demonstrated a new function for this subfamily in facilitating the formation of viable pollen during heat stress.\n\n    Phenotypic characterization of mutants harboring T-DNA insertions in the two PDI-M genes of Arabidopsis, PDI9 and PDI10, revealed that the pollen of pdi9 loss-of-function mutants were hypersensitive to heat stress, as indicated by a pronounced decrease in pollen viability in comparison to WT control plants grown under identical conditions. Although GUS reporter experiments indicated that the promoters of both PDI9 and PDI10 were active in anthers and pollen, the pollen of pdi10-1 single mutants did not exhibit a similar susceptibility to heat stress as the pdi9-1 and pdi9-2 mutants. Thus, PDI9 plays an important role in pollen tolerance to elevated temperatures, and its loss cannot be compensated for by the paralogous PDI-M isoform, PDI10. Interestingly, whereas PDI9 possesses the canonical C-terminal ER retention motif, KDEL, the protein sequence of PDI10 ends with the variant sequence KDDL, which has previously been shown to be ineffective as an ER retention signal in tobacco. We speculate that the inability of PDI10 to functionally compensate for PDI9 may be due, at least in part, to differences in their abilities to be retained in the ER lumen.\n\n    At the morphological level, the pollen of pdi9 mutants display several heat stress-associated phenotypes, including collapsed pollen grains, disruption of the sculpted reticulate pattern of the exine, and severe cohesion of pollen grains obviating dehiscence (Figures 5, 6). Interestingly, although pdi10-1 single mutants do not display overt pollen defects under the heat stress conditions used in this study, pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutants exhibit a more severe pollen wall phenotype than pdi9 single mutants, including the absence of reticulation and appearance of globular structures on the pollen surface. Similar globular structures were observed in the pollen of transient defective exine 1 (tde1) mutants, which also exhibit defects in exine formation, and were caused by the accumulation of sporopollenin aggregates. The more severe pollen wall phenotype of pdi9-1 pdi10-1 double mutants suggests that while PDI9 is required for normal exine patterning during heat stress, PDI10 has some capacity to fulfill this function, as indicated by the milder disruption to the exine patterning observed in pdi9-1 and pdi9-2 single mutant pollen.\n\n    The tapetum plays a key role in pollen development by nourishing the microspore and supplying the precursors utilized in pollen wall formation. Impairment of the tapetum secretory pathway can have a severe impact on proper wall formation and the viability of pollen. For example, KOs of the tapetally-expressed SECRETORY31B (SEC31B) gene, which encodes a COPII protein and is required for proper ER-Golgi protein trafficking, exhibit severely reduced pollen viability and aberrant pollen exine formation. Similar pollen defects were observed in loss-of-function mutants of another tapetally-expressed gene, MALE GAMETOGENESIS IMPAIRED ANTHERS (MIA), which encodes a P-type ATPase cation channel pump that appears to be required for the proper secretion of vesicle cargo to the plasma membrane. Recently, mutation in a secreted non-specific lipid transfer protein of the plasma membrane of meiocytes disrupted the unique exine pattern of rice pollen.\n\n    Heat stress can lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins, thereby triggering UPR as a means of restoring proteostasis within the secretory pathway. IRE1, a dual protein kinase/ribonuclease of the ER, is a key component of UPR, and the loss of both Arabidopsis IRE1 isoforms in ire1a ire1b double mutants causes male sterility and irregular exine patterning in plants grown under modestly elevated temperatures. Mutations in another UPR gene, bZIP60, which transcribes the direct mRNA splicing target of IRE1, are also associated with heat stress-induced pollen defects.\n\n    Given the role of PDIs as protein folding catalysts, we hypothesize that the heat-related pollen defects observed in pdi9 mutants is the result of an impaired ability to respond to protein misfolding through the UPR pathway. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that PDI9 accumulation occurs in pollen in response to heat stress, as well as the strong connection of PDI9 expression to the UPR pathway that was previously established in which PDI9 transcription is upregulated in response to the UPR and this upregulation is mediated by the UPR-transcription factor, bZIP60. However, aberrations in tapetum development and the timing of tapetum degeneration are also known to cause defects in pollen viability and morphology, and thus it is possible that the defect in tapetum cell organization of pdi9 mutants during heat stress (Figure 6D) also contributes to the production of defective pollen.\n\n    While our characterization of Arabidopsis PDI-M mutants reveals an involvement in pollen tolerance to heat stress, it is interesting to note that GUS reporter experiments indicate that the promoters of both PDI9 and PDI10 are active in pollen grains under normal (non-stressed) growth conditions beginning at flower development stage 13 (anthesis). Although the UPR pathway is activated in response to stresses that cause protein misfolding, components of the UPR pathway are also known to be active during plant growth and development in the absence of external stresses, particularly in instances where there are heavy demands for secretion. The expression of PDI9 and PDI10 in pollen during and after anthesis may indicate a role for PDI-M isoforms in the folding of proteins involved in dehiscence and the later stages of pollen maturation, or may reflect an increased load on the secretory pathway of pollen during these processes leading to the general activation of UPR.\n\n    Here we have shown that PDI9 contributes significantly to the thermal tolerance of Arabidopsis pollen, and loss-of-function mutants of PDI9 display heat stress-related pollen phenotypes similar to those reported previously for UPR mutants. PDI9 is a member of the plant PDI-M subfamily, which has previously been implicated in the proper accumulation of storage proteins in rice. In animals, the zebrafish PDI-M ortholog PDI-P5 was revealed to be essential for specifying left/right asymmetries. The disparate phenotypes among eukaryotes currently associated with the loss of PDI-M/P5 may reflect the numerous potential substrates for PDI-M within different organisms at various stages of development, both as a disulfide oxidoreductase/isomerase and a molecular chaperone. Notably, the two identified PDI-M roles in plants are processes during which a heavy load is placed on the secretory pathway, and it may be the case that PDI-M genes are commonly expressed in plant cells undergoing rapid synthesis of proteins sorted through the secretory pathway. In vitro, mammalian P5 catalyzes rapid, but promiscuous disulfide bond formation in substrates, whereas classical PDI was found to be an efficient proofreader of incorrect disulfides. We hypothesize that a similar situation may occur in plants. PDI-M isoforms are expressed in plant cells producing large amounts of secretory proteins, or where misfolded proteins are present due to heat stress, to rapidly introduce disulfide bonds into these proteins. Subsequently, these disulfide bonds can be corrected into native disulfides, if necessary, by the proofreading action of classical-type PDI-L isoforms. The pollen defects observed in heat stressed pdi9 mutants demonstrate that PDI-M fulfills a distinct role in plant protein folding that cannot be fully compensated for by other members of the PDI family.\n\n    Interestingly, aberrant exine formation was observed in heat stressed plants overexpressing PDI9 under the CaMV 35S promoter. We speculate that this could be the result of an increase in PDI9-mediated promiscuous disulfide bond formation, which outpaces the ability of proofreading \"classical PDIs\" to shuffle substrates into native disulfide arrangements via their isomerase activity. Therefore, the correct balance of PDI-M and PDI-L activities is necessary for proteostasis. Furthermore, there is precedent for a UPR protein to have a homeostatic or \"Goldilocks\" level of expression in pollen. The ER protein, Tunicamycin Induced 1 (TIN1), is induced during ER stress and is abundant in pollen. Both knockout tin1 and pollen grains from the 35S:TIN1 OE line have an altered pollen surface morphology, including an especially sticky pollen coat. No enzymatic or structural function has been assigned to TIN1. It was suggested that TIN1 mutants have a defective ER quality control system in developing pollen, such that the misregulated secretion of proteins and perhaps lipids result in an abnormal exine. They suggested there is an amount of TIN1 in pollen that is homeostatically just right for proper development, with either too much or a deficiency of TIN1 adversely affecting the exine. By analogy, PDI9 overexpression and the pdi9 mutants all have reduced pollen counts and, to various degrees, disrupted exine patterns relative to WT in the heat treatments. Therefore, the role of PDI9 in pollen development arguably fits the mechanistic theory of proteostasis in which an ideal balance of PDI-M and PDI-L activities is required in the ER for normal exine formation in the heat.",

        "Title": "    High leucine levels affecting valine and isoleucine recommendations in low-protein diets for broiler chickens",
        "Abstract": "    Four experiments were conducted to estimate the optimal standardized ileal digestible (SID) level of branched-chain amino acids in low-protein diets during the starter, grower, and finisher periods, using the response surface methodology, and to study their effects on performance and mRNA expression of genes involved in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway of broiler chickens from 8 to 21 D of age. In experiments 1, 2, and 3, a total of 1,500 Cobb male broiler chickens were assigned to 15 diets of a central composite rotatable design (CCD) of response surface methodology containing 5 levels of SID Leu, Val, and Ile with 5 replicate pens of 20 birds each. A 3-factor, 5-level CCD platform was used to fit the second-order polynomial equation of broiler performance. In experiment 4, a total of 540 8-day-old Cobb male broiler chickens were distributed in a completely randomized 2 x 3 x 3 factorial arrangement with 2 SID Leu levels (1.28 or 1.83%), 3 SID Val levels (0.65, 0.90, or 1.20%), and 3 SID Ile levels (0.54, 0.79, or 1.09%) for a total of 18 treatments with 5 replicate cages of 6 birds each. High Leu levels impaired (P < 0.05) gain:feed when birds were fed marginal Val or Ile diets. However, gain:feed was restored when both Val and Ile were supplemented to reach adequate or high levels. High Leu levels increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of S6K1 and eEF2 genes only in birds fed high Ile levels. Dietary SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels required for gain:feed optimization in low-protein diets were estimated at 1.37, 0.94, and 0.87% during the starter period; 1.23, 0.82, and 0.75% during the grower period; and 1.15, 0.77, and 0.70% during the finisher phase, respectively. Higher Val and Ile levels are required to optimize the effect of Leu supplementation on mRNA expression of mTOR pathway genes in the pectoralis major muscle of broilers from day 1 to 21 after hatch.",
        "Introduction": "    It has been well known that branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) (Val, Leu and Ile) are not only substrates for building block protein but they are also involved in intracellular signaling pathways on protein anabolism and stimulatory effects on protein synthesis. Among the 3 BCAA, Leu has been considered most effective in stimulating muscle protein synthesis by modulating the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream effectors, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1), which are components of the translation initiation machinery. In addition to its role in promoting the activation of S6K1 and 4EBP1, mTOR increases protein synthesis through eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) activation, which is essential for translation elongation. High dietary Leu has been demonstrated to activate the mTOR signaling pathways in pigs and broilers. However, growth performance was not improved in a previous study with broilers fed high-Leu diets and graded Val levels, even though Leu supplementation increased the expression of genes involved in the mTOR signaling pathway of the pectoralis major muscle. The reduced blood availability of other amino acids than Val could have limited the protein synthesis. Positive Leu effects are limited by itself because in excess promotes its own oxidative degradation by stimulating the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex through its keto-acid, alpha-ketoisocaproate. The BCKD complex uses all 3 branched-chain alpha-keto acids as substrate and, once it is activated, promotes the irreversible catabolism of branched-chain alpha-keto acids to coenzyme A compounds. It was demonstrated that dietary Leu levels greater than recommended reduced the circulating concentrations of Val and Ile. Then, the assessment of Leu effects on mTOR pathway of protein synthesis should consider both dietary Val and Ile levels as BCAA could exhibit antagonistic interactions among each other.\n\n    Some feed ingredients have disproportionate high Leu levels compared with Val and Ile, which might create a BCAA imbalance in low-protein diets with a combination of some particular feed ingredients. Corn standardized ileal digestible (SID) Leu content is 11.6% relative to protein concentration, whereas it is 6.9% in soybean meal. Leucine concentration in sorghum is 3-fold higher than Val and Ile levels. In addition, corn gluten meal contains high SID Leu level in percentage of protein content (17%) but low values of Val and Ile (4%). Protein-reduced diets decrease protein source inclusion and increase the proportion of dietary cereal ingredients, some of which have a high Leu level in relation to their protein contribution. Hence, Leu antagonism effect on other BCAA could be more significant for birds fed low-protein diets.\n\n    Dietary BCAA imbalance may affect broiler performance, but other studies have indicated that excess Leu does not compromise broiler performance when protein levels are higher than broiler requirement. Then, the ideal BCAA ratio in low-protein diets should be different from high-protein diets and should be studied. In previous studies, we estimated the ideal Val/Leu ratio in starter and grower diets, but we did not consider the effect of Ile levels to estimate the optimal BCAA ratio in low-protein diets. Several reports have estimated the Leu, Val, and Ile requirements separately without considering the interactions between them. The interaction effects of the BCAA, such as synergism or antagonism, could be evaluated using the response surface methodology which is an experimental procedure used to evaluate the nature of the response variable (performance) obtained from the simultaneous variation of explanatory variables (dietary SID levels of BCAA) and define the relationships between them. In addition to analyzing the effects of the explanatory variables, this experimental methodology generates a second-degree model that can be used to estimate the ideal dietary level to optimize performance. Based on these statements, the objective of this study was to estimate the optimal SID level of BCAA in low-protein diets during the starter (1 to 14 D), grower (14 to 28 D), and finisher (28 to 42 D) periods using the response surface methodology and to study their effects on performance and mRNA expression of genes involved in the mTOR pathway of broiler chickens from 8 to 21 D of age.",
        "Methods": "    The broiler chickens were raised under standard husbandry conditions, and all experiments were performed in accordance with Brazil's National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation guidelines and were authorized by the Ethics Committee for Animal Use of the Universidade Estadual de Maringa, PR, Brazil (Protocol No. 6075180815-CEUA/UEM).\n\n    In all experiments, chicks were obtained from a commercial hatchery after being vaccinated against Marek's disease and Newcastle disease and infectious bronchitis. Temperature was maintained at 32 C at placement and was gradually reduced to ensure comfort by using exhaust fans and evaporative cooling pads. Ventilation was accomplished by negative air pressure. The lighting program throughout the study consisted of 23 h of light (25 lux) and 1 h of dark. Feed and water were available to the birds ad libitum.\n\n    Amino acid analyses (method 994.12) and CP composition (method 968.06) were performed for corn, soybean meal, meat and bone meal, and wheat bran, before feed formulation, and also on representative samples of the experimental diets, as per procedures. After that, SID amino acid values of the used feedstuffs were estimated by applying the SID coefficients suggested by. The basal diet with reduced protein content was formulated as per the nutritional recommendations for male broiler chickens, except for SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels (Table 1). The other experimental diets were obtained by supplementing the basal diet with L-Leu, L-Val, and L-Ile replacing the inert filler (kaolin).\n\n    A total of 1,500 Cobb male broiler chickens were assigned to 15 diets of a central composite rotatable design of response surface methodology containing 5 levels of SID Leu, Val, and Ile with 5 replicate pens of 20 birds each. Three time periods were evaluated independently, 1 to 14 D (starter), 14 to 28 D (grower), and 28 to 42 D (finisher) of age. A common corn and soybean meal-based diet was formulated to satisfy all nutrient recommendations and fed from placement to 13 D and to 27 D of age to evaluate the grower and finisher periods, respectively. Five dietary SID levels of Leu, Val, and Ile ranged as 1.10-1.70%, 0.81-1.21%, and 0.68-1.08% at the starter phase; 1.00-1.60%, 0.67-1.07%, and 0.59-0.99% at the grower period; and 0.98-1.58%, 0.52-1.12%, 0.41-1.01% at the finisher phase, respectively (Table 2). Broilers were raised on floor pens (2.0 x 1.0 m) with fresh wood shavings as litter (2.5 cm deep) and was equipped with 1 tube feeder of 48 cm and 1 nipple drinker (6 nipples/pen).\n\n    Growth performance was evaluated from day 1 to 14, 14 to 28, and 28 to 42 after hatch in the experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Broilers and experimental diets were weighed weekly for performance evaluation (feed intake, BW gain, and gain:feed). Broiler mortality was recorded twice daily.\n\n    At the placement, chicks were distributed across 25 floor pens (30 birds/pen), each floor pen (0.13 m2/bird) had fresh wood shavings and was equipped with 1 tube feeder and 3 nipple drinkers. On day 8, 540 birds were randomly placed into 90 grower battery cages (6 birds/cage) with raised wire floors (0.08 m2/bird), and each battery cage was fitted with an adjustable trough feeder and drinker. Birds were assigned 1 of 18 dietary treatments (5 replications/treatment) from 8 to 21 D of age with varying concentrations of SID Leu, Val, and Ile. A factorial arrangement of treatments consisted of 2 SID levels of Leu (1.28 or 1.83%), 3 SID levels of Val (0.65, 0.90 or 1.20%), and 3 SID levels of Ile (0.54, 0.79 or 1.09%). Growth was measured from day 8 to 21 after hatch. Chickens and experimental diets were weighed at 8, 15, and 21 D of age to evaluate the feed intake, BW gain, and gain:feed.\n\n    A factorial arrangement of 2 SID Leu levels (1.28 or 1.83%), 2 SID Val levels (0.65 or 1.20%), and 2 SID Ile levels (0.54 or 1.09%) was used for gene expression analysis. At 21 D of age, 5 birds per treatment (8 treatments) were slaughtered in the morning, and samples of muscle (pectoralis major) were collected immediately to determine the mRNA expression of mTOR, S6K1, and eEF2 genes. Total RNA was extracted with the use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) by following the manufacturer's directions in the proportion of 1 mL per 100 mg of tissue. The RNA concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 260 nm (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). RNA integrity was evaluated in a 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR safe (Life Technologies, CA) and visualized with UV light. From the concentration measured, 1 mug of total RNA was incubated with DNAse I (Invitrogen Corporation, Brazil), and subsequently, DNAse I was inactivated by adding EDTA and heating at 65 C for 5 min.\n\n    The preparation of cDNA was performed with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Super Mix kit and Oligo-d(T) (Invitrogen Corporation, Brazil) and RNAse-out (Invitrogen Corporation, Brazil) for mRNA degradation as per the guidelines of manufacturer. The reaction was performed at 42 C for 15 min, 50 C for 50 min, and 70 C for 15 min. The cDNA quantification was estimated using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The samples were stored at -80 until further analysis.\n\n    For the real-time PCR reactions, the cDNA was diluted to obtain a solution of 200 ng/mul. The fluorescent dye SYBR Green (SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems) was used. The real-time PCR analysis was performed by the StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Thermal cycling parameters for all genes were the following: hot-start, 95 C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation and annealing/extension, 95 C for 15 s, 60 C for 1 min, and then, melting curve, 65-95 C. All analyses were performed with 1 muL of cDNA (200 ng) and both sense and antisense oligonucleotides (1 muL of 5 mumol primer stock solution each) in a final volume of 25 uL. A duplicated with negative control was added to all the plates to control possible contamination in the reactions.\n\n    The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of target genes (mTOR, S6K1, and eEF2; Table 3) were based on the nucleotide sequences used by as per chicken sequences (GenBank access number: XM_417614; NM_001030721; and NM_205368, respectively). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was used as a reference gene as described by. The expression of target and reference genes of each sample was run simultaneously in duplicate on the same PCR plate, and the average of cycle threshold (CT) value was used to calculate 2-DeltaCT for analysis of relative quantification and data were expressed by arbitrary units (AU). The efficiency of target and reference genes was calculated from a standard curve plate of serial dilutions (from 25 to 400 ng) of cDNA pools.\n\n    A 3-factor 5-level central composite rotatable design was used in experiments 1, 2, and 3. Data were analyzed using the RSREG procedure of SAS software (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) to fit a quadratic response surface model. Linear and quadratic terms for the SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels and the interaction among these variables were evaluated. A second-order polynomial equation was generated as described by:where Y is the response variable, xi represents the input variables (SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels), beta0 is the constant term, betai is the coefficients of the linear parameters, betaii is the coefficients of the quadratic parameter, betaij is the coefficients of the interaction parameters, and epsilon is the residual error. The RSREG procedure displays the canonical coefficients, indicating the effect of each input variable on the curvature direction at the optimal response (stationary point) in the predicted model. The input variable with the largest influence on the direction of the stationary point was considered the more important factor during the modeling process. A ridge analysis was applied to compute the optimal response for performance using RIDGE MAX when the total model was significant (P < 0.05). A reduced model with significant terms was fitted when the total model and cross product (interactions) were not detected (P > 0.05). Recommended Leu, Val, and Ile needs were established by estimating 95% of the minimum or maximum responses. In experiment 4, data were analyzed using the GLM procedure of. Data were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA to determine the main effects (SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels) and their interaction. Differences among means were separated using a Tukey's multiple range tests by the LSMEANS procedure of SAS.",
        "Results": "    Linear, quadratic, cross product, and total model terms were not significant (P > 0.05) for feed intake of broilers fed SID Leu, Val, and Ile during the starter (1 to 14 D), grower (14 to 28 D), and finisher (28 to 42 D) periods (Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). Dietary SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels resulted in quadratic effects (P < 0.05) on BW gain during the starter and grower phases, but the cross product and total model were not significant (P > 0.05). Therefore, a reduced model was fitted without the interaction terms as follows:\n\n    BW gain (1 to 14 D) = -1,030.94 + 694.08*Leu - 247.79*Leu2 + 1,032.60*Val - 512.03*Val2 + 946.56*Ile - 535.28*Ile2, R2 = 0.71.\n\n    BW gain (14 to 28 D) = -2,314.75 + 1,966.92*Leu - 756.85*Leu2 + 2,766.99*Val - 1,588.92*Val2 + 2,324.22*Ile - 1,474.67*Ile2; R2 = 0.70.\n\n    Significant quadratic regressions, cross product, and total model were found (P < 0.05) for BW gain during the finisher phase and a polynomial equation was fitted to the data:\n\n    BW gain (28 to 42 D) = -1,621.31 + 3,392.27*Leu + 1,294.30*Val + 1,497.46*Ile - 2,570.22*Leu2 - 2,071.78*Val2 - 2,008.67*Ile2 + 2,113.33*LeuVal + 1,625.11*LeuIle -717.11*ValIle; R2 = 0.83.\n\n    In the canonical analysis (Table 7), all canonical coefficients (eigenvalues) were negative for BW gain in all growth periods; thus, the stationary points were a maximum response. Among the eigenvalues of greater magnitude for BW gain during the starter (-29.085437), grower (-90.142648), and finisher (-343.729259) phases, Leu was the amino acid with the largest eigenvector. Thus, Leu is the most important variable in the fitted models for BW gain; therefore, the direction of stationary point curvature was determined by Leu. Based on the fitted models, BW gain can be maximized with dietary digestible Leu, Val, and Ile levels of 1.33, 0.96, and 0.84% during the starter phase; 1.23, 0.83, and 0.75% during the grower period; and 1.16; 0.77, and 0.68% during the finisher phase, respectively.\n\n    Dietary Leu, Val, and Ile levels resulted in significant (P < 0.05) quadratic, cross product, and total model terms for gain:feed during all growth periods. Therefore, polynomial equations were fitted as follows:\n\n    G:F (1 to 14 D) = -3.99 + 2.14*Leu + 4.33*Val + 2.52*Ile - 0.64*Leu2 - 1.38*Val2 - 1.42*Ile2 + 0.73*LeuVal + 0.47*LeuIle - 0.61*ValIle; R2 = 0.73;\n\n    G:F (14 to 28 D) = -1.64 + 1.49*Leu + 1.38*Val + 1.91*Ile - 0.42*Leu2 - 0.99*Val2 - 0.88*Ile2 - 0.60*LeuIle + 0.09*LeuVal + 0.30*ValIle; R2 = 0.67.\n\n    G:F (28 to 42 D) = -0.80 + 1.55*Leu + 0.50*Val + 0.71*Ile - 0.97*Leu2 - 0.74*Val2 - 0.71*Ile2 + 0.67*LeuVal + 0.36*LeuIle - 0.14*ValIle; R2 = 0.82.\n\n    As canonical coefficients were positive for gain:feed, the stationary point was represented by a maximum response. The last eigenvalues presented the highest value for gain:feed during the starter (-0.078448), grower (-0.056847), and finisher (-0.114252) periods. Among the eigenvalues mentioned, the largest eigenvector corresponded to the Leu as observed in BW gain models, followed by Ile in grower and finisher phases and by Val during the starter period. As per the fitted models, the optimization of gain:feed can be achieved using dietary SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels of 1.37, 0.94, and 0.87% during the starter period; 1.23, 0.82 and 0.75% during the grower period; and 1.15, 0.77 and 0.70% during the finisher phase, respectively.\n\n    High Leu levels reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake and BW gain, but gain:feed was not affected (P > 0.05) (Table 8). Adequate Val levels resulted in better (P < 0.05) BW gain and gain:feed compared to high and low Val levels. BW gain and gain:feed were higher (P < 0.05) in birds fed high and adequate Ile levels than broilers receiving low Ile levels. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels on gain:feed. High Leu levels impaired (P < 0.05) gain:feed when birds were fed marginal Val or Ile diets. However, gain:feed was restored when both Val and Ile were supplemented to reach adequate or high levels. Interactions between SID Leu and Val levels and between SID Leu and Ile concentrations were found (P < 0.05) on BW gain and gain:feed. Levels of 1.83% Leu impaired (P < 0.05) BW gain and gain:feed in low and adequate Val levels but not in high Val concentrations (Figures 1 and 2). Likewise, high Leu levels did not impair BW gain and gain:feed in adequate and high Ile levels. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between SID Val and Ile levels on BW gain. BW gain did not respond to Val or Ile supplementation when 1 of these amino acids remain in deficient levels (Figure 3).\n\n    Higher Leu levels increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of mTOR and S6K1 genes in muscle tissue but not that of the eEF2 gene (P > 0.05) (Table 9). Main effects of dietary Val and Ile levels did not affect (P > 0.05) mRNA expression of the genes investigated. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels on mRNA expression of eEF2 gene. Higher mRNA expression of eEF2 gene was found (P < 0.05) in birds fed high dietary Leu, Val, and Ile levels than in those receiving low dietary levels of these amino acids. Likewise, there was an interaction (P < 0.05) between SID Leu and Ile levels on mRNA expression of S6K1 and eEF2 genes. High Leu levels increased (P < 0.05) on mRNA expression of S6K1 and eEF2 genes in birds fed high Ile levels but not in those fed low Ile levels (Figure 4).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Leucine was the most influential BCAA in the fitted models for BW gain and gain:feed as per canonical analysis. Thus, predicted optimal levels of BCAA were mainly affected by Leu levels in low-protein diets. However, several studies estimated Val and Ile requirements without considering dietary Leu levels, which may be the main factor of variation in Val and Ile requirement estimations. High Leu plasma concentration activates the metabolic pathway that oxidizes all of the BCAA. Then, Leu decreases plasma concentrations of both Val and Ile. Previous researches showed a strong interrelationship between Leu and other BCAA in low-protein diets where Leu levels greater than recommended values increased the optimal dietary levels of Val or Ile. Therefore, the interactions between BCAA are important to be considered in low-protein diets. As per the fitted models for BW gain and gain:feed, the optimization response can be achieved by using dietary SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels of 1.33-1.37%, 0.94-0.96%, and 0.84-0.87% during the starter period; 1.23%, 0.82-0.83%, and 0.75% during the grower period; and 1.15-1.16%, 0.77%, and 0.68-0.70% during the finisher phase, respectively. Using the predicted levels, the optimal average ratios for Leu:Val:Ile in low-protein diets were estimated at 100:69:62 from 1 to 14 D, 100:67:61 from 14 to 28, and 100:67:60 from 28 to 42 D. In the literature, the estimated Val and Ile to Leu ratios ranged from 67 to 78 and 58 to 69, respectively, as per the nutritional recommendations proposed by researchers who studied the combined BCAA requirements.\n\n    Branched-chain amino acid concentrations show a fast increase in the bloodstream after protein intake and are promptly available for protein synthesis in skeletal muscle as BCAA do not have hepatic first-pass metabolism as other amino acids. The initial step of BCAA catabolism takes place in the muscle owing to the high activity of BCAA aminotransferase, the first enzyme in the BCAA catabolism pathway, whereas BCAA aminotransferase hepatic activity is low. The BCAA aminotransferase reaction involves the reversible transfer of Leu, Val, and Ile to form the corresponding branched-chain alpha-keto acids, alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), alpha-ketoisovalerate, and alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate, respectively.\n\n    The second enzyme of BCAA catabolism, BCKD is a key multienzyme complex involved in the irreversible degradation of the 3 branched-chain alpha-keto acids and is regulated by the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism. Phosphorylation mediated by BCKD kinase results in inactivation, whereas dephosphorylation by BCKD phosphatase activates the enzyme. Dietary Leu increases the KIC formation, alpha-keto acid of Leu, which inhibits BCKD kinase. As a result of BCKD kinase inhibition, the BCKD phosphatase activates the BCKD complex activity by dephosphorylation of E1alpha subunit. Therefore, a high Leu level can stimulate the catabolism of Val and Ile by increasing the intracellular concentration of KIC and promoting the activation of BCKD complex. The BCKD complex activation by Leu could explain the fact that Leu was found to be the most influential BCAA in the fitted models and that optimal dietary Val and Ile levels rely on Leu levels in low-protein diets. The alpha-keto acids of Val and Ile, alpha-ketoisovalerate and alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate, also inhibit BCKD kinase but with lower efficacy than that of KIC. For this reason, excess Val or Ile leads to small reductions in plasma concentrations of the other 2 BCAA, indicating that Val, Ile, or their alpha-keto acids do not increase significantly the BCAA catabolism.\n\n    Levels of 1.83% Leu impaired BW gain and gain:feed in low and adequate Val levels, whereas growth performance of birds fed adequate Ile levels was not reduced by high Leu levels (1.83%). This result supports the affirmation that the antagonistic effect of Leu is more potent on Val than on Ile in birds. Dietary Leu levels of 1.83% reduced BW gain compared with birds fed diets with 1.28% Leu, probably because of reduced feed intake. Some studies pointed out that feed intake reduction is the main cause of lower growth performance of broilers and pigs fed high Leu levels or BCAA imbalance diets. High Leu levels mostly affected the feed intake in previous studies performed in our laboratory where SID Leu levels ranged from 1.0 to 1.96% from 1 to 21 D, and 1.0 to 1.80% from 22 to 42 D. In experiments 1, 2, and 3, feed intake was not affected by dietary Leu levels that ranged from 1.10 to 1.70%; 1.0 to 1.60%; and 0.98 to 1.58% during the starter, grower, and finisher periods, respectively. However, the increased SID Leu levels from 1.28 to 1.83% decreased the feed intake of broilers from 8 to 21 D (experiment 4). These results suggest that there is a breakpoint level where the SID Leu concentration may impair the feed intake in low-protein diets.\n\n    Levels of 1.83% Leu impaired gain:feed when birds were fed marginal Val or Ile diets. However, gain:feed was restored when both Val and Ile were supplemented to reach adequate or high levels. This finding supports the statement that the antagonistic effects of high Leu are more evident when the other BCAA are lower than the broiler requirement. Likewise, higher dietary levels of Val and Ile are required to optimize broiler performance in high Leu levels. Branched-chain amino acids share a structurally similar side chain and are actively transported into cells by the same carrier system, the system-L transporter, which it is primarily expressed as 2 different isoforms: LAT1 and LAT2 (L-type amino acid transporters 1 and 2) in organs that play an important role in BCAA homeostasis and utilization, such as the intestine, kidney, liver, and muscle. Therefore, higher levels of Val and Ile could compete with Leu for transport into cells and reducing the negative effects of high Leu levels on broiler performance. In addition, Val and Ile supplementation could restore plasma concentration of these amino acids already oxidized by BCKD complex activation as a result of high Leu and KIC concentrations. Broilers fed high dietary protein content with amino acid levels greater than their minimum requirement did not exhibit reduced performance by high Leu levels, whereas the Leu antagonism has been more evident in low-protein diets where some amino acids could be at minimal dietary levels. Then, the reduction magnitude of dietary protein may influence the bird response to SID Leu levels. Level inclusion of corn increases as soybean meal decreases in protein-reduced diets. Valine and Ile supplementation allows reduction of dietary protein and may decrease Leu levels, but special attention should be paid to the BCAA ratio in low-protein diets formulated with particular combinations of feed ingredients and marginally adequate levels of Ile and Val owing to disproportionally high Leu levels in some ingredients relative to other BCAA. In some cases, relative Leu content could be high (low Val- and Ile-to-Leu ratios) even in low-protein diets that might increase optimal dietary Val and Ile levels but broiler recommendations of Val and Ile are kept at the same levels in a least-cost feed formulation. Low-protein diets without Leu supplementation resulted in good broiler performance when Val and Ile requirements were fully met. This result indicates that Val and Ile supplementation with adequate Leu:Val:Ile ratios could be a strategy for supporting broiler growth by reducing dietary Leu content and improving BCAA balance in low-protein diets.\n\n    It has been known that Leu can enhance muscle protein synthesis by activating the mTOR and its downstream effectors, S6K1 and 4EBP1, which are 2 proteins involved in mRNA translation initiation into protein. Leu-supplemented diets increased mRNA expression of mTOR and S6K1 genes in muscle tissue, which is in accordance with data reported by other researchers in broilers and pigs. In addition to muscle tissue, Leu has shown to increase mRNA expression of genes related to the mTOR pathway in the small intestine. These findings are in contrast with the observations of where the mTOR pathway was not affected in broilers fed high-Leu diets. This might be due to their basal diets that had no marginal Leu levels, and some of them that had Leu content higher than the broiler recommendation, which could limit the impact of dietary graded Leu levels on broiler response.\n\n    In addition to the mTOR's role in stimulating the mRNA translation initiation through S6K1 and 4EBP1, mTOR promotes the elongation machinery of mRNA translation through eEF2 activation. Although an increased activity of mTOR with Leu supplementation has been reported, there is no evidence of Leu direct effect on eEF2 activity by phosphorylation at the post-translational or transcriptional level because we found no effect of Leu levels on mRNA expression of eEF2. Similarly, Val and Ile levels did not affect the mRNA expression of eEF2. Previously, we also found that neither Leu nor Val changed mRNA expression of eEF2.\n\n    The compiled results indicated that negative effects of higher Leu levels than recommended values are more pronounced in low-protein diets with marginal levels of Val and Ile. Higher dietary Val and Ile levels are required to minimize the antagonistic effect of excess Leu on broiler performance with an optimal ratio for Leu:Val:Ile in low-protein diets of 100:69:62 from 1 to 14 D, 100:67:61 from 14 to 28, and 100:67:60 from 28 to 42 D. Dietary amino acids at levels greater than broiler requirement in high-protein diets reduce the negative effect of high Leu levels, and hence, the ideal BCAA ratios in diets with excess protein levels are different from those in low-protein diets. Further studies are required to understand and estimate the BCAA relationships at different dietary protein levels. The concentration of SID Leu relative to protein content is almost 2-fold higher in corn than in soybean meal. As corn inclusion increases in low-protein diets, Val and Ile supplementation in these diets is important for supporting broiler growth by improving BCAA balance and counteracting the metabolic pathway activation that oxidizes all of the BCAA.\n\n    In conclusion, SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels required for gain:feed optimization were estimated at 1.37, 0.94, and 0.87% during the starter period; 1.23, 0.82, and 0.75% during the grower period; and 1.15, 0.77, and 0.70% during the finisher phase, respectively. For optimal BW gain, recommended SID Leu, Val, and Ile levels were estimated at 1.33, 0.96, and 0.84% for the starter phase; 1.23, 0.83, and 0.75% for the grower period; and 1.16; 0.77, and 0.68% for the finisher phase, respectively. Leucine was the most important BCAA in the fitted models for broiler performance, and it affects the dietary levels of Val and Ile. Consequently, dietary Leu content should be considered in estimation of the ideal level of Val and Ile in low-protein diets. Higher Val and Ile levels optimize the effect of Leu supplementation on mRNA expression of mTOR pathway genes in the pectoralis major muscle of broilers from day 1 to 21 after hatch.",

        "Title": "    Effect of Changes in Dietary Net Energy Concentration on Growth Performance, Fat Deposition, Skatole Production, and Intestinal Morphology in Immunocastrated Male Pigs",
        "Abstract": "    Nutritional requirements of heavy immunocastrated (IM) pigs and therefore appropriate feeding strategies have not yet been determined. Thus, the effects of changes in dietary net energy (NE) content were studied in 41 IM pigs, fed ad libitum diets with low, medium, and high NE content (LNE, MNE, and HNE diets, with 8.5, 9.3, and 10.0 MJ NE/kg, respectively), from 84 days of age until slaughter at an average age of 172 days and an average body weight of 122.5 kg. In the period from 143 to 170 days of age, there was a tendency for a greater NE intake (p = 0.08) in pigs fed the HNE diet along with greater (p < 0.01) backfat gain. Dietary treatment affected carcass composition, as lower backfat thickness (p = 0.01) and lower area of fat over the longissimus muscle (p = 0.05) were observed in the LNE and MNE pigs. In addition, greater lean meat content (p = 0.04) was observed in the LNE pigs. Reducing the NE of the diet by replacement of cereals and soybean meal with high-fiber ingredients resulted in lower indole production in the ascending colon (p < 0.01) and greater skatole production (p < 0.01) in the cecum. Greater villus area, width, height and perimeter, crypt depth, and thickness of the intestinal mucosa in the jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, and descending colon were found in the LNE group (p < 0.01) than in the HNE group, while those in the MNE group was intermediate. Cell proliferation was not affected by dietary treatment (p > 0.05). The present results show that a reduction in dietary NE concentration lowers lipid deposition, without affecting performance or energy efficiency in IM pigs. This technique provides an advantage in terms of improved leanness, without affecting growth rate in IM pigs after immunization, which is particularly important when the backfat thickness is a determinant of carcass value and IM pigs are fattened to higher weights (e.g., in heavy pig production) or when a longer delay between immunization and slaughter is practiced.",
        "Introduction": "    In many countries, male piglets are still surgically castrated shortly after birth as a preventive measure against the development of boar taint. Lately, the vaccination against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (i.e., immunocastration) has been proposed as an alternative to surgical castration that improves animal welfare and allows to benefit from lean tissue growth and feed efficiency of entire males (EM) for most of the growing period. When standard immunization protocols are used, the physiological effects of immunocastration become evident as early as 1 week after effective immunization [i.e., after applying the second dose of vaccine ]. However, after effective immunization, a substantial increase in daily feed intake (DFI) is observed in immunocastrated (IM) pigs, resulting in reduced feed efficiency and increased body fatness as compared with EM. These negative consequences can be limited either by restricting feed allowance after immunization or by shortening the time interval between immunization and slaughter, which gives pigs less time to deposit fat. Quantitative feed restriction has been shown to improve the performance of IM pigs but may also stimulate aggressive behavior and increase the level of stress, raising questions about welfare degradation. As an alternative, a reduced energy concentration of the ad libitum diet may be considered. Since the energy component of the feed accounts for most of the cost in pork production, replacing energy-rich starch from cereals with relatively inexpensive fibrous feedstuffs, such as cereal by-products, in the finishing diet may be of interest for IM pigs. Additionally, dietary fiber may be beneficial for physiological function and gastrointestinal health. Immunocastration has been shown to effectively prevent the accumulation of boar taint compounds (androstenone and skatole) in adipose tissue by reducing steroid hormones synthesis in the testes and also by preventing the inhibition of skatole degradation by steroids in the liver. However, skatole production in the intestine is influenced by numerous other factors including housing conditions, animal health, and dietary composition. Namely, by influencing the rate of apoptosis, diet can alter the availability of l-tryptophan, the precursor of skatole, in the colon and thus can affect skatole production, while skatole absorption can be reduced by accelerating the intestinal transit time.\n\n    Limiting (excessive) fat deposition after immunocastration by dietary measures may become a key factor for the economic sustainability of this alternative especially when pigs are slaughtered at a greater age and weight (e.g., in special production systems). Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of net energy (NE) concentration of the feed given to IM pigs during the prolonged period between effective vaccination and slaughter on growth performance, fat deposition, skatole production, intestinal morphology, and cell proliferation.",
        "Methods": "    As presented in Figure 1, the study included an experiment on informative digestibility and nitrogen balance (Exp. 1) and a growth experiment (Exp. 2). The experiments aimed to compare the utilization by IM pigs of three cereal-based diets differing in their NE content (Table 1). To this end, the NE content was reduced from 10.0 MJ/kg in the high NE diet (HNE) to 9.3 and 8.5 MJ/kg in the medium NE (MNE) and low NE (LNE) diets, respectively, by substitution of cereals (wheat, barley, and corn) and soybean meal with high-fiber ingredients (wheat bran, soybean hulls, and dried beet pulp) and reduction of the amount of added sunflower oil. The MNE diet was calculated as the mean composition of HNE and LNE diets.\n\n    To accurately calculate the NE content, a digestibility and nitrogen balance study was conducted with 4 IM pigs (Improvac  2 ml, subcutaneous application at 77 and 105 days of age, Zoetis Florham Park, NJ, USA). Pigs [Pietrain x (Large White x Landrace)] were housed individually in digestibility cages and fed the two extreme experimental diets (i.e., HNE and LNE) for two consecutive periods, such that there were two pigs per diet in each period. Each period consisted of an adaptation sub-period (14 days, allowing pigs to adapt to the feed, digestibility cage, and environmental conditions) and a subsequent total collection sub-period (7 days), during which feed intake was recorded and feces and urine were separately collected. Pigs were weighed at the beginning (at 77 days of age) of the trial and at the beginning and the end of each collection sub-period. During the collection period, feed allowance was restricted to 90% of predicted ad libitum NE intake [calculated according to INRA Porc software ]. Water was freely available. Pelleted feed was prepared daily and distributed in equal amounts 3 times per day (09:00, 12:00, and 15:00), whereas feed residues were collected each morning and stored at 4 C until analysis of dry matter (DM; 24 h in a ventilated oven at 103 C). A representative sample of each diet was collected during the collection period and stored at 4 C until analysis of DM and chemical composition. During the collection period, feces and urine (collected in a 10-L plastic container with 120 ml of 10% sulfuric acid) were collected each morning. Feces were stored at 4 C and accumulated during the collection period. On the day following the last collection, total collected feces were weighed and homogenized. Three representative samples were taken, two of which were dried for 48 h at 100 C for determination of DM, while the third sample was freeze-dried, ground (1-mm grind), and stored at 4 C until further laboratory analyses. The containers for urine collection were changed every morning, and the pH was measured and, if necessary, adjusted by adding 10% sulfuric acid, so that the value was below 2.0. Afterward, urine was weighed and homogenized, and a representative sample (1%) was taken, cumulated over the entire collection period, and stored at 4 C.\n\n    At 70 days of age, 45 male piglets [Pietrain x (Large White x Landrace)] from 12 different litters were transferred to the experimental stables (individual housing, concrete floor, and water freely available) and fed a commercial growing diet until the start of the experiment. Two vaccinations with Improvac  (2 ml, subcutaneous application, Zoetis Florham Park, NJ, USA) were given at 77 and 112 days of age. At 84 days of age, the pigs (within the litter) were allocated to 3 groups of 15 animals receiving one of the experimental diets (i.e., HNE, MNE, and LNE) in pelleted form, with a progressive transition that lasted for 5 days. During the experiment, pigs were fed individually 3 times per day at 09:00, 12:00, and 15:00 (manual feeding in the individual trough). Daily meals were prepared in buckets containing the expected ad libitum feed intake for 3 or 4 days plus 10% [calculated according to INRA Porc software ]. At the end of each 3- or 4-day period, accumulated feed refusals were collected and weighed. Feed refusals were not contaminated by urine or saliva and were therefore not dried, and their DM content was considered as for the offered feed, which was measured at each feed preparation.\n\n    Pigs were weighed weekly at the same time in the morning, without prior limitation of feed allowance. Ultrasound measurements (Noveko, VetkoPlus, 3.5 MHz) of the backfat thickness (BFT) at the level of the last rib (measured on the left and right sides of the back, 6 cm lateral to the spine and subsequently averaged per pig) were performed every 3 weeks from the first vaccination (V1) onwards to obtain 5 consecutive measurements on each animal during the experiment. The difference in BFT divided by the number of days elapsed between the corresponding measurements was calculated to assess the daily backfat gain in the total and interim periods.\n\n    Pigs were slaughtered (at an average age of 172 days) in two batches, balanced according to experimental groups and litter of origin, within a week in the experimental slaughterhouse of INRAE Saint-Gilles following standard slaughter procedures (approximately 20 h of feed withdrawal, electrical stunning, and immediate vertical bleeding). At evisceration, samples of the duodenum (at the caudal end of the pancreas), jejunum (the middle part), ileum (10 cm anterior to the ileocecal valve), cecum (the second haustrum distal to the apex), ascending colon (the top of the spiral colon), and descending colon (30 cm from the end of the intestine) were collected and stored in 5% buffered formalin. At the same time, the intestinal contents from the cecum, ascending colon, and descending colon were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -20 C until analysis. At the end of the slaughter line, hot carcass weight (HCW) was recorded, and testicles were removed, dissected, and weighed. The weight of both testicles (including epididymis) was recorded for each pig. Leaf fat was excised from both half-carcasses and weighed.\n\n    Carcasses were chilled overnight until the internal carcass temperature was below 7 C. Additional carcass characteristics were assessed the following day. Intermuscular neck fat (percent), longissimus muscle area (square centimeters), and fat over longissimus muscle area (square centimeters) were assessed by image analysis on pictures of carcass cross sections taken between the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebrae (for evaluation of intermuscular neck fat) and after the last rib (for evaluation of longissimus muscle area and fat over longissimus muscle), as described by Batorek et al..\n\n    Caudally from the level of the last rib, a 2.5-cm-thick slice of longissimus muscle was removed, vacuum-packed, and stored at -20 C to determine intramuscular fat using NIRS (NIR System model 6,500 Spectrometer, Silver Spring, MD, USA) and in-house developed calibrations (Agricultural Institute of Slovenia). For determination of boar taint compounds, samples of subcutaneous fat were taken at the level of the last rib, vacuum-packed, and stored at -20 C until further laboratory analyses.\n\n    Pooled feed samples from Exp. 1 and 2 were analyzed for DM, ash, nitrogen, starch, crude fiber, and ether extract contents according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC). Gross energy (GE) content was measured by an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (IKA, C5000, Staufen, Germany). The content of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of pooled samples of diets was analyzed according to Van Soest et al.. Samples of feces from Exp. 1 were analyzed for DM, ash, nitrogen, crude fiber, ether extract with prior acid hydrolysis, NDF, ADF, and GE contents using the same methods as for feed samples. Fresh samples of urine from Exp. 1 were analyzed for nitrogen content, while the GE content was evaluated after freeze-drying of approximately 30 ml of urine in polyethylene bags.\n\n    Androstenone and skatole concentrations were measured in subcutaneous fat samples from Exp. 2 by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and expressed per gram of liquid fat. The detection limits were 0.24 and 0.03 mug/g for androstenone and skatole, respectively. Skatole and indole concentrations in intestinal content samples from Exp. 2 were measured by a modified method of Denhard et al.. Concentrations were expressed per gram of sample, and the detection limit was 1.12 mug/g for skatole and indole.\n\n    Tissue samples from the intestinal segments collected in Exp. 2 were embedded in paraffin, and histological sections (5 mum thick) were cut and stained with H&E. Morphometric analysis was performed as described in detail by Bilic-Sobot et al. using a Nikon Microphot FXA microscope equipped with a DS-Fi1 camera and the Imaging Software NIS Elements D.32 (Nikon Instruments Europe B.V., Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands). For each tissue sample of the small intestine, 20 villi and 20 crypts were examined at x 100 magnification for villus width, villus height, villus perimeter, and crypt depth. Additionally, villus surface area, thickness of the intestinal mucosa, and the ratio between villus height and crypt depth were calculated. For each tissue sample of the cecum and colon, 20 crypts were examined at x 100 magnification for crypt depth. To assess the extent of cell proliferation of the intestinal epithelium, immunohistochemical staining with mouse anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (anti-PCNA) as described in detail by Bilic-Sobot et al. on all samples using the Dako REAL  EnVision detection system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was performed. In the small intestine segments, the number of PCNA-positive enterocytes was counted at the level of the villus-crypt boundary, which encompasses the upper crypt/lower villus region at a length of 150 mum (10 villus-crypt units per animal) at x 40 objective magnification. In the colon segments, the number of PCNA-positive enterocytes was counted in 10 well-oriented crypts per animal at x 20 objective magnification.\n\n    DM feed intake and apparent digestibility coefficients of organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), GE, ether extract, crude fiber, NDF, and ADF were calculated from the values obtained in Exp. 1 using the total collection method. The NE content of the diet was calculated for HNE and LNE according to Noblet et al. (using the average of the values obtained by equations 3, 4, and 5, with digestible energy (DE) as predictor), and the NE content of the MNE diet was assumed to be the average of values calculated for HNE and LNE diets. In Exp. 2, average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were calculated for each of 4-week experimental periods: day 84 to 114, day 115 to 142, and day 143 to 170. Additionally, DE, metabolizable energy (ME), and NE intake were calculated from DM feed intake and corresponding energy concentration of experimental diets as estimated in Exp. 1 and used in the calculation of body weight (BW) gain to NE intake ratio (G:NE). The energy values of experimental diets, average DFI (ADFI), and G:F were calculated on 100% DM and subsequently adjusted to 89% DM content. Dressing percentage was calculated as the ratio between HCW and final BW, measured 24 h before slaughter without prior fasting. Gonadosomatic index (%) was calculated as testicular weight (weight of right and left testes including epididymis) divided by final BW.\n\n    ANOVA was performed using the mixed model procedure of SAS (PROC MIXED, SAS Inst., Cary NC, USA). Repeated measurements of digestibility and nitrogen balance data (n = 8) in Exp. 1 were evaluated by including the fixed effects of diet group and stage and their interaction and the random effect of pig (included in the repeated statement). In Exp. 2, the effect of the diet (NE concentration) on growth performance was evaluated considering the fixed effects of dietary treatment and litter for the phases before (day 84 to 114) and after immunization (day 115 to 170). For the phase after the effective immunization, two 4-week periods were looked at separately, and the model included dietary group, period, their interaction, and litter, with a pig as a repeated variable. Because the effect of immunocastration on growth performance is now well established and was not the focus of the present study, comparisons of phases before and after immunization periods are not presented.\n\n    To predict the voluntary energy intake, data from the DM feed intake measurements per week, energy (ME and NE) content of the diets, and BW from the age of 84 days onwards were used to calculate relationships between cumulative energy intakes (y; ME or NE) and BW according to the following model:\n\n    If age < 112 days:\n\n    If age >= 112 days:\n\n    adiet beforeV2 and adietafterV2 are the slopes of the relationship for each diet, before and after immunization (V2), respectively; cdiet is the exponent applied to BW for each diet; BWage = 112 is the BW at 112 days of age; and bpig is the intercept of the relationship for each pig (so that cumulative intake of experimental diets equals zero at the start of the experiment, i.e., at 84 days of age). The parameters of the model were evaluated on the cumulative intakes using the NLIN procedure of SAS (PROC NLIN, SAS Inst., Cary NC, USA) to avoid threshold effects caused by the way feed intake was measured (continuous access to the feeder without restriction during the few hours preceding measurement). The hypothesis for a single cdiet exponent applied to BW for all diets was tested for ME and NE intake using the extra sum of squares reduction test. As this test was never significant (p > 0.10), a single exponent (1.43) was considered for further statistical analyses to test the effect of diet and period (P1 = before and P2 = after V2) on the regression coefficients (slopes) of the relationship.\n\n    Carcass trait, boar taint compounds, and testicular weight in Exp. 2 were analyzed using a fixed-effects model of diet, treatment group, litter within slaughter batch, and slaughter batch.\n\n    Measurements of morphology and mitosis cell count of small and large intestinal segments in Exp. 2 were evaluated by including the fixed effects of a dietary group within the intestinal part and the random effect of the pig.\n\n    The individual pig was considered as the experimental unit for all data analyses. The least-squares means were compared using Tukey's test with statistical significance based on p < 0.05.",
        "Results": "    The chemically determined values for the dietary CP, crude fiber, ether extract, and starch concentrations in the representative samples of the LNE, MNE, and HNE diets (Table 1) were as expected. No particular problems occurred in Exp. 1. In Exp. 2, one pig died during the experiment (the HNE group), two were excluded due to umbilical hernia (1 in the LNE group and 1 in the MNE group), and one was excluded due to broken forelimb (the MNE group), providing 41 pigs weighing on average 122.5 kg at the end of Exp. 2 (Table 2).\n\n    The effectiveness of immunocastration in the growth trial (Exp. 2) was assessed considering backfat concentrations of androstenone and skatole and testicular weight at slaughter. With the use of these parameters, no non-responders to immunocastration were identified. Androstenone and skatole concentrations averaged 0.27 +- 0.08 and 0.05 +- 0.03 mug/g of liquid fat, which is just above the detection limit of the determination method. Weight of testes with epididymis averaged 247 +- 147 g (p = 0.78; results not shown), and the gonadosomatic index averaged 0.204 +- 0.132 (p = 0.78; results not shown).\n\n    The results of the digestibility trial (Exp. 1) presented in Table 3 reveal a lower (p < 0.05) digestibility of OM, CP, ether extract, and energy in the LNE diet, in accordance with its greater fiber content. On the other hand, greater crude fiber digestibility was noted for the LNE diet (p < 0.01), whereas NDF and ADF digestibility were not affected (p = 0.83 and 0.12) by diet composition. Similarly, nitrogen intake and retention were similar for the LNE and HNE dietary treatments (p = 0.18 and 0.34), whereas greater nitrogen fecal losses (p < 0.01) and lower nitrogen urinary losses (p = 0.04) were observed for the LNE treatment group. Consistent with the objective of the study, the experimental diets differed in their energy contents; DE (p = 0.01), ME (without the contribution of CH4; p = 0.02), and calculated NE (p < 0.01) contents of HNE and LNE diets were 13.9 vs. 12.7, 13.4 vs. 12.3, and 10.4 vs. 9.3 MJ/kg, respectively (Table 3).\n\n    No effect of the diet (Table 2) on BW at any stage of the experiment was detected. The period after effective immunization significantly affected NE feed intake and growth performance (p < 0.01; Table 2), whereas the phase and dietary treatment interaction after immunization was significant only for backfat gain (p < 0.01; Table 2). Diet composition did not affect the ADFI in any period of the experiment (p > 0.05; data not shown), and NE intake was affected by the changes in diet NE concentration, but this effect was significant only in P2. To be more precise, greater daily NE intake expressed as megajoules per kilogram of BW0.60 was noted between the HNE dietary group compared with the MNE dietary group in P2 (p = 0.03; Table 2). There was no effect (Table 2) of dietary NE concentration on ADG and G:NE in any period of the experiment. A difference in backfat gain was observed in the second phase after immunization (day 143 to 170), where greater (p < 0.01; Table 2) backfat gain was noted for the HNE group compared with the MNE and LNE groups, which was also reflected as a tendency (p = 0.13; Table 2) toward greater backfat gain in P2 (day 115 to 170) in the HNE group.\n\n    To further elucidate the effect of energy intake and period after V2, a detailed analysis of the energy intake data was performed, based on the cumulative consumption of the experimental diets shown in Figure 2. The slopes of the relationships between cumulative energy intake and BW were tested for the effects of phase (prior = P1 or after immunization = P2) and diet using the 1.43 exponent applied to BW. Regardless of diet, the change in cumulative energy intake per kg BW gain never differed between periods for cumulative ME and NE intake (Table 4). In each period (before and after V2), the change in cumulative ME intake per kg BW gain tended to differ (p = 0.05 and 0.06) between the two extreme diets, i.e., LNE and HNE, whereas the change in cumulative NE intake per kg BW increase did not differ between periods and diets and averaged 2.86 MJ/kg BW1.43-463 MJ (Table 4). From the intercept and the slope of the relationship calculated for the first period, it can be estimated that BW at zero cumulative consumption (i.e., at the beginning of the experiment) averaged 34.9 kg (SD = 1.2 kg); the latter is close to the values reported in Table 2 at 84 days of age.\n\n    The effect of a reduction in NE concentration of the diet on the intestinal histo-morphological features (p < 0.01; Table 5) was evident in the jejunum, ileum, ascending, and descending colon, whereas the mucosa of the duodenum and cecum was not affected (Table 5). To be more specific, greater villus surface area, villus width, villus height, villus perimeter, crypt depth, and thickness of the intestinal mucosa were noted for pigs fed LNE diet (p < 0.01; Table 5) than those fed HNE diet, with those fed MNE diet being intermediate. In the ileum, crypt depth increased with dietary NE content reduction (p < 0.01; Table 5), whereas the thickness of the intestinal mucosa was increased in the LNE and MNE dietary groups compared with the HNE group (p < 0.01; Table 5). Despite the change in histo-morphological characteristics of the intestinal mucosa, dietary treatment did not appear to be associated with the enterocyte proliferation (i.e., PCNA-positive cell number) in any of the intestinal sections studied (p > 0.05; Table 5).\n\n    Indole concentration in the ascending colon was decreased (p < 0.01; Table 6) by decreasing dietary NE concentration, while skatole concentration in the cecum was increased with NE reduction (p < 0.01; Table 6) and tended to decrease with NE reduction in the descending colon (p = 0.07; Table 6).\n\n    In agreement with the lack of effect of diet on BW, no effect (p = 0.20) was observed on HCW or weight of major carcass parts (data not shown). However, it should be noted that the numerical variation in dressing percentage between dietary treatment groups, although not significant (p = 0.11), was quite high (1.5% and 0.9% points lower for the LNE and MNE groups, respectively, compared with the HNE group; Table 7), consistent with the effect of dietary treatment on backfat gain measured in vivo by ultrasound (p = 0.02; Table 7) and as the area of fat covering the longissimus muscle (p = 0.05; Table 7) was lower in LNE and MNE pigs than in pigs fed HNE diet. Decreased subcutaneous fatness was reflected in greater lean meat content (p = 0.04; Table 7) of LNE compared with HNE pigs.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In IM pigs, rapid changes in hormonal status 10 to 15 days after immunization result in increased voluntary feed intake, greater ADG, and altered energy metabolism associated with increased lipid deposition. Consequently, this leads to greater BFT and lower lean carcass content [as determined by the meta-analytical studies ], in parallel with the effective elimination of boar taint compounds in adipose tissue. However, most of the studies conducted to date dealt with pigs slaughtered 4 to 6 weeks after immunization, whereas little is known about what happens when the delay between immunization and slaughter is further extended. In the present study, this delay was increased up to 8 weeks without any adverse effects on meat boar taint: taking into account androstenone and skatole levels in the backfat together with the testicular weight, all pigs could be considered fully immunized. Similarly, Kubale et al. observed no evidence of functional or morphological recovery of testicular function within 8 weeks after immunization.\n\n    The high energy digestibility observed in Exp. 1 with a low fiber (i.e., high starch) diet is to be expected and agrees with previous studies. It also confirms that fiber-rich feedstuffs can be successfully used as an energy diluting factor in growing-finishing diets because of components with a low digestive utilization. The inclusion of dietary fiber also increases the endogenous losses, resulting in a perceived decrease in the digestion of energy and nutrients in monogastric animals. Indeed, by increasing NDF content (plus 41 and 81 g/kg DM in MNE and LNE diets, respectively), the calculated NE content of the diets in the present study was reduced by approximately 5 and 10% in MNE and LNE diets. On the other hand, in Exp. 1, dietary fiber intake resulted in increased digestibility of fiber components. This may be explained by the ability of the intestinal mucosa to adjust to a high-fiber diet with a gradual change in microbial fermentation as also confirmed in Exp. 2 by the results of skatole and indole production Additionally, dietary fiber fermentation by the intestinal microbiota results in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, which can directly contribute to the nutritional value of meal as an energy source, but with a lower energetic efficiency than starch and lipid. As indicated by Jin et al., the inclusion of 10% high-fiber source in diets of growing pigs for 14 days caused an increased width of villi and depth of the crypts in the jejunum and ileum. The same study also showed that high dietary fiber intake increased the rate of cell proliferation and crypt depth in the colon. However, this was not evident in the present study at the level of the small intestine, despite the changes in histo-morphological features, which may be since intense changes in intestinal morphology may have occurred earlier (immediately after the change in diet, e.g., at the age of 84 days).\n\n    In the present study, skatole level increased with the NE reduction in the cecum but tended to decrease with NE reduction in the descending colon. The reason for the differential response in different intestine segments may be related to the progressive decrease in the flow of digesta toward the distal colon that changes the fermentation metabolite and bacterial profile. Nevertheless, an overall reduction of skatole with decreased NE and increased amount of dietary fiber can be observed. Similarly, Li et al. demonstrated that the addition of sugar beet pulp, one of the ingredients used in the present study to reduce the energy level of the experimental diet, had a significant inhibitory effect on skatole formation in the intestine. The reasons may be several, from increased intestinal passage rate and increased fecal water content diluting and lowering skatole accumulation rate to serving as a fermentable energy source, preventing amino acid (i.e., tryptophan) fermentation and skatole production. In the absence of fermentable carbohydrates as an energy source, microbial fermentation shifts to amino acids and uses the carbon skeleton of amino acids as an energy source, which also leads to increased production of intestinal skatole as an amino acid (tryptophan) metabolite. On the other hand, in the presence of energy from fermentable carbohydrates, the resident microbes in the colon retain more amino acids for their growth. Along with decreasing skatole, indole production behaved oppositely (decreased with NE reduction in the ascending colon). Although skatole and indole production could be positively correlated due to their common precursor, the synthesis of both compounds is pH-dependent [indole-forming bacteria favor basic and skatole-producing bacteria acidic conditions ] and can be influenced in different ways by dietary components.\n\n    Pigs are generally able to adapt voluntary feed intake to dietary characteristics, and energy density is usually the first determinant of ADFI as long as the maximum capacity of the digestive tract is not reached. However, the results of the present study are evidence of more complex interactions due to the inclusion of dietary fiber in the diet, which can be continually fermented by intestinal microbiota, providing a stable energy source and thus prolonged satiety, and changes in lipid metabolism (enhanced lipid deposition and lipogenic activity) after immunocastration. In agreement with the results of Zeng et al., reduction of diet NE concentration did not significantly affect the ADFI of IM pigs after immunization, which might indicate that the pigs have already reached their maximal feed intake capacity or that the dietary source used in the lowest NE diets had a marked effect on pig satiety. The latter might be due to increased intestinal volume as a consequence of greater bulk density and water-holding capacity of a high-fiber diet and, additionally, due to the effect of SCFA on appetite regulation and long-term satiety. Since the ADFI of IM pigs in the first weeks after immunization is greater than in their surgically castrated counterparts [by ~100 g/day; ], the physical limits for ADFI may be reached independently of the diet energy content. In the present study, a tendency toward lower NE intake was noted for LNE and MNE diet in the second 4-week period after immunization. However, only pigs consuming the MNE diet, expressed on a metabolic BW basis (MJ/kg BW0.60 per day), reached significantly lower NE intake after immunization. This might indicate a nonlinear effect of reducing diet energy density on the regulation of energy intake or that LNE pigs still compensated for the lower NE dietary content with greater ADFI (which was numerically, but not statistically greater), whereas this was not the case for MNE pigs. It was not possible to measure feeding behavior in our trial, but our results on DFI and the influence of dietary fiber on fermentation and satiety suggest that modifications on feeding behavior should be considered to explain the difference between treatments. Additionally, the variability of NE intake (MJ/kg BW0.60 per day) is much smaller, implying that the variability of daily NE intake and ADFI is partly explained by the variability in BW, which was numerically lower for the LNE and MNE groups. However, when cumulative energy intake is considered as a function of BW, small differences in the slopes for cumulative DE and ME intake can be observed (Table 4) whereas no difference was observed in the slope of the relationship between cumulative NE intake and BW between periods and diets. It can thus be considered that maximal daily NE intake (MJ), which does not depend on diet characteristics, was achieved regardless of the dietary energy content and can be described as the first derivative according to BW of the average prediction equation for cumulative NE intake. It corresponds to 4.09 MJ/kg x BW0.43 MJ when BW varied from 40 to 125 kg.\n\n    To eliminate the influence of differential gut content and visceral tissue related to the ADFI differences, the ADG was adjusted for dressing percentage, and it remained unaffected by 5% or 10% reduction of the diet NE concentration in the present study. When even stricter quantitative feed restriction was applied in IM pigs, a decrease in ADG was reported (by 20 and 12% at 78 and 85% of ad libitum feed intake, which corresponds to -6.9 and -4.6 MJ consumed NE per day, respectively), with no improvement in G:F. Due to energy dilution in the present study, growth efficiency was evaluated on NE basis as G:NE, to express energy requirements and dietary energy values on the same scale. In accordance with the results of Quiniou and Noblet in barrows, G:NE was similar in all 3 dietary groups, indicating that changes in diet NE concentration did not influence the growth rate of IM pigs, although the partitioning of energy was different among dietary groups. Namely, in accordance with the objective of the study, changes in diet NE concentration (10% compared with the standard 10.4 MJ NE/kg feed) resulted in a reduced backfat deposition. The difference between the 3 dietary treatments in the rate of backfat gain was significant during the second 4-week period following immunization, resulting in a 28% lower rate of backfat deposition. In general, lipid deposition in pigs increases gradually with BW, but IM pigs are characterized by an intense increase in lipid deposition after immunization and a subsequent increase in the ratio between lipid and protein deposition [LD:PD; ]. It was therefore expected, and demonstrated in the present study, that the difference in backfat gain due to the reduced dietary NE content would become noticeable only after a long period after immunization, providing an additional argument that the pigs were not able to fully adjust their feed intake to achieve a constant energy intake across treatments.\n\n    The results of carcass traits confirm the results observed for performance. In agreement with a similar study in barrows, the carcass weight of IM pigs in the present study was not affected by the reduction in diet NE concentration, whereas lean content was improved. Weights of prime cuts were similar in all 3 dietary treatment groups, whereas the response of fat depots varied. The subcutaneous fat depot was significantly reduced with reduction of the NE content of the feed, whereas smaller (numerical only) reduction was observed for leaf fat and intramuscular fat. Intramuscular fat content was below the level of 2% to 3% required to impact flavor and juiciness to pork meat in all dietary groups, most likely due to the genetic lines used. Additionally, the lack of effect of NE reduction on leaf fat deposition is expected given the relative growth rate of different fat depots, which serve as a source of energy. As demonstrated in barrows, leaf fat, located within the abdominal cavity, exhibits the most rapid response to prolonged dietary stimuli, followed by subcutaneous and intermuscular (and intramuscular) fat deposition. In the present study, pigs were fed on an ad libitum basis, which means that they were not in energy deficiency, because pigs can adapt feed intake to the energy density of the feed. We can then assume that eventual additional energy to the one required for basal metabolic needs consumed by pigs on the LNE diet was firstly deposited to leaf fat and less was available for other tissues. Regarding the effect of quantitative feed restriction in IM pigs, literature reports either no significant effect on carcass leanness and fat deposition or only an effect on leaf fat weight. The lack of effect of restricted feeding on carcass leanness in the abovementioned studies could be associated with a shorter duration of the restriction. As shown in the present study, backfat deposition significantly increases only after a substantial time post-immunization (4 to 8 weeks after V2).\n\n    Taken together, the results of the present experiment confirm that IM pigs are energetically very efficient and suggest that energy dilution in the growing and finishing diet offered ad libitum to IM pigs limits the subcutaneous fat deposition. From a practical perspective, this indicates that in the countries where BFT is a determinant of carcass value (i.e., European Union and the United States), it might be reasonable to use feed restriction (quantitative or qualitative), especially if an extended time between immunization and slaughter is anticipated as well as when pigs are fattened to heavy weights for high-quality dry-cured products, where excessive adiposity must be avoided due to market demand.\n\n    The advantage of immunocastration resides in the long-term boar-like performance of pigs; however, after the immunization, feed intake is considerably increased, which diminishes the advantages in performance. Overall, our results demonstrate that by reducing the NE concentration of the diet by up to 10% with high-fiber content ingredients, similar energy efficiency (gain to NE intake ratio) may be achieved due to effective adaptation to the high-fiber diet, as indicated by histo-morphological characteristics of the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, reducing dietary NE concentration lowers intestinal skatole production. This technique provides an advantage in terms of reduced lipid deposition and improved leanness, without affecting growth rate in IM pigs after immunization, which is particularly important when the BFT is a determinant of carcass value and IM pigs are fattened to higher weights (e.g., in heavy pig production) or when a longer delay between immunization and slaughter is practiced.",

        "Title": "    The epidemiology of adults' eyelid malignancies in Germany between 2009 and 2015; An analysis of 42,710 patients' data",
        "Abstract": "    We report the incidence of malignant tumors of the eyelid in Germany between 2009 and 2015.\n\n    Data pertaining to the period between 2009 and 2015 were extracted from the German Cancer Registry. The International Classification of Diseases for Oncology-3 codes for tumors of the eyelid or canthus were used to identify incidence rates and survival probabilities. Crude and age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were calculated by age, year, and gender and the individual federated states. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meyer and Life tables methods, and COX-Regression was used to calculate hazard ratios for overall and cancer-specific survival.\n\n    This study examined data pertaining to 42,710 patients who had been diagnosed with malignant tumors of the eyelid. Basal cell carcinoma was by far the most common tumor of the eyelid (87.1%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (10.1%) and malignant melanoma (1.1%). ASRs of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma were 65.1, 7.49, and 0.83 per million, respectively. Sebaceous cell carcinoma did not appear to be of high prevalence in Germany. Cancer-specific survival was generally high, exceeding 95%. The overall survival of patients with melanoma was considerably lower than those with other cancers. Both survival rates were inferior to that of basal cell carcinoma (74.9%). Cancer-Specific survival at five years for all groups exceeded 95%.\n\n    The incidence rates of malignant lid tumors match that of the European countries but shows a different pattern than Asian countries.",
        "Introduction": "    No previous studies have investigated the incidence of malignant tumors of eyelid at the national level in Germany.\n\n    In the period between January 2009 and December 2015, 42,710 patients were diagnosed with malignant tumors of the eyelid in Germany.\n\n    Basal cell carcinoma was the most common eyelid cancer (87.1%), with 65.1 per million, followed by squamous cell carcinoma (10.1%) with 7.49 and malignant melanoma (1.1%) with 0.83 per million.\n\n    Sebaceous cell carcinoma was a rare malignancy among eyelid malignancies.\n\n    Cancer-specific survival was generally high, exceeding 95%; cases with melanoma showing the lowest survival rates.\n\n    Overall survival of squamous cell carcinoma reached 58.3% and malignant melanoma 54.8%, both inferior to basal cell carcinoma (74.9%).\n\n    The incidence of skin tumors has been increasing worldwide. Although the eyelids represent less than 1% of the total body surface, periocular malignancies represent 5 to 10% of all tumors affecting the skin, and they impose significant morbidity due to treatment modalities that potentially involve the removal of the affected eyelid.\n\n    Most reports on the incidence of periocular tumors come from single-center registries. These data are not designed to determine the frequency of new diagnoses in a community or the survival at the population level. The effect of different environmental, social, and economic factors can best be ascertained through population-based studies. Furthermore, cancer registries are the basis for studies that aim to delineate the causes of tumors and to evaluate the efficacy of employed preventive and early detection strategies.\n\n    Germany has the largest population in the European Union with 83 million inhabitants as of 2019. To date, no study has addressed the national incidence and survival rates of patients with malignant tumors of the eyelid at the population level in Germany. The 16 German federated states have been obligated to report epidemiologic cancer data by law since 2009. Through a robust process, data are submitted once a year to the Robert Koch Institute, a disease control and prevention institute subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\n    The aim of this report is to delineate the incidence and survival rates of different malignant tumors of the eyelid in Germany and to examine the different factors that influence these rates at the national level.",
        "Methods": "    Cancer is a reportable disease in Germany, and data were provided anonymously to the researchers. Therefore, the study was treated as non-human subject research and was waived from the requirement of signed consent forms. The study adhered to guidelines of good clinical practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and its amendments.\n\n    Data were extracted from the German cancer registry operated by the German Center for Cancer Registry Data at the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin. We included data covering the whole population of Germany pertaining to patients 15 years of age or older. For the purposes of conducting population statistics, patient data from all German states reported between 2009 and 2015 were collected. For survival analysis, we included data of all patients reported by the cancer registries for the same period. Data collection and quality control of the national cancer registry have been described before. Survival time was provided by the Robert Koch Institute as well.\n\n    Patients were selected according to the third edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) topography code C44.1 \"Eyelid including canthus\". Associated histology codes were recorded as follows: 8090-8098 as basal cell carcinoma, 8050-8078 and 8083-8084 as squamous cell carcinoma, 8720-8790 as malignant melanoma, 8079-8082, 8099-8576, 8036-8049, and 8085-8089 as other specified carcinomas, and 8010-8035 as unspecified carcinomas. Specified and unspecified carcinoma were grouped as \"other carcinomas\". Histology codes 8800-8811, 8830, 8840-8921, 8990-8991, 9040-9044, 9120-9133, 9150, and 9540-9581 belonged to leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma and unspecified malignancies, which were grouped as \"other malignancies\". TNM staging, method of confirming the diagnosis, and grading were reported. The International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) was used to define causes of death. Data pertaining to patients whose deaths were reported by death certificate only (N = 85) or by autopsy (N = 0) were excluded.\n\n    Crude (CR) and Age-standardized (ASR) incidence rates were calculated per year. The 2011 Census population estimates, as reported by the German Federal Statistical Office, were used for the purposes of calculating incidence and standardized incidence rates. The incidence rate was calculated per million due to the small incidence of melanomas. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. For survival analysis, we calculated the eyelid cancer-specific survival (ELCSS). Furthermore, we have developed life tables analysis including Wilcoxon (Gehan) Test for group comparisons. The lid-related causes of death were reported as the \"event\" for calculating cancer-specific survival. COX regression analysis was conducted for the purposes of adjusting for age, sex, and morphology and in order to calculate death-related hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence Intervals (95% CI). The Schoenefeld test was used to validate the COX-Model for overall survival. It was not possible to similarly validate cancer-specific survival using the same test.\n\n    The data were organized, cleaned, and the incidence was calculated using Microsoft Excel for Microsoft Office 365. Descriptive data analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS version 27. Incidence Standardization and Confidence Intervals were calculated using PHE Tool. Maps were plotted using Tableau version 2020.01 software on OpenStreetMaps and R Statistical Packages; \"Survival\", \"GGPlot2\" and \"Survminer\".",
        "Results": "    Data pertaining to 42,710 patients who had been diagnosed with eyelid malignancies were analyzed. A majority of these patients (87.1%; n = 37,181) had been diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma (10.1%; n = 4297) and malignant melanoma (1.1%; n = 474). There was a slightly higher overall frequency of malignancies among females (57.4%) as well as higher frequencies of all subtypes except for sarcomas, where male patients made up 75% of the cases (Table 1). Mean age at presentation of all malignancies stood at 69.5 (SD +- 12.76) years of age (Supplementary Table 1). Mean age at diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma stood at 69.38 (SD +- 12.7, 95%CI 69.2-69.5, median 71.58, IQR 17) years of age; whilst that of squamous cell carcinoma stood at 74.6 (SD +- 11.9, 95% CI 74.25-74.97, median 76, IQR 14.58). Mean age at diagnosis of melanoma stood at 72.2 years of age (SD +- 13.4, 95% CI 71.02-73.43, median 75, IQR 14.13). There was a higher frequency of bilateral disease among patients with squamous cell carcinoma (3.8%) compared with other malignancies.\n\n    The nationwide ASR for basal cell carcinoma stood at 65.1 per million. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern had the highest CIR for basal cell carcinoma (106 per million). Schleswig-Holstein had the highest CIR (13.1) for squamous cell carcinoma, while Rheinland-Pfalz had the highest CIR for melanoma (1.2) (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2). The ASR in males stood a lower 55.6 per million compared with the 74.43 in females (rate ratio = 0.7503, p <0.0001). For males, the ASR peaked at 11.5 per million in the 70-74 age group; females in the same age group had an ASR of 13.9 per million (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 3). Whilst the ASR in males had peaked at 70-74 years of age, the ASR in females continued to rise until a peak at over 85 years of age. The ASR of melanoma stood at 0.83 per million, with a rate of 0.74 in males and 0.91 in females (rate ratio 0.81, p-value < 0.0001) and a peak of 0.15 in the 70-74 age group in males and 0.19 in the 75-79 age in females. It is worth mentioning that CIR for females was higher than that of males, whilst the higher ASR in females reflected their nationwide population distribution. Analysis revealed no clearly discernable temporal or geographical trends over the study period (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1). Out of the 42,710 incidences, one patient showed two consequent lid malignancies, 140 patients showed single second lid malignancy. Squamous cell carcinomas following basal cell carcinoma were the most common second malignancy (N = 82).\n\n    Histological confirmation was the most common method of diagnosis (99.3%). Pathological TNM was reported to the registry in 97.5% of the TNM prefix (pTNM). Out of 17,349 patients with reported TNM-T, T1 was the most common stage (N = 12,143, 70.0%), followed by unclear stage Tx (N = 3347, (19.3%) (Table 2). Out of 6458 with a reported grade of differentiation, 63.5% (N = 4102) of patients had presented with well-differentiated (G-1) tumors. Regional and distant metastatic tumors were uncommon (<1%). Surgery, as the sole modality of treatment was conducted in 88% of cases with basal cell carcinoma, 81% of cases with squamous cell carcinomas, and 73% of cases with malignant melanomas (Table 3).\n\n    All patients had ELCSS above 95%. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma had the worst ELCSS (Figure 3). Patients with malignant melanomas had the lowest survival rate (96.4%). Patients with squamous cell carcinoma and patients with basal cell carcinoma showed higher survival of 99.5%, and 99.9%, respectively (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 4).\n\n    Overall survival at five years after a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma stood at comparable rates of 58.3% and 54.8%, respectively. Both rates were considerably lower than the overall survival rate at five years after a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, which stood at 74.9% (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 5). Overall, males had lower overall survival probabilities at five years after their diagnoses compared with females.\n\n    Multivariate analysis revealed that male patients had lower overall survival rates (HR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.62-1.79). Moreover, the older the age at diagnosis, the higher the risk of death (HR = 1.11, 95%CI 1.11- 1.12). Patients diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma had the best overall survival. Evidently, due to their shared confidence intervals, the survival rates of patients with basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas did not significantly differ. The same patterns were noted after a multivariate analysis of cancer-specific survival. Further details are presented in Figure 4, Supplementary Tables 6-7, and Supplementary Figure 2.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The current study is the first to systematically report on the incidence of malignant tumors of the eyelid in Germany. This was possible primarily because all German states have been obligated to report their cancer data to the Robert Koch Institute since 2009. Until now, published data have only been available for \"skin tumors in general\", with non-melanoma ASRs of 184 and 143 per 100.000 for males and females, respectively. As there are geographic factors in the whole of Europe, which are evident within Germany, a separate analysis of epidemiologic data of the individual German states, conducted in a similar manner to the nationwide analysis conducted in this study, should be undertaken.\n\n    An overview of available eyelid tumor population-based studies from other countries is found in Supplementary Table 8. As evident by the overview, a heterogeneous set of conceptions have stood behind the buildup of these studies. The only European study comparable to this work was an Irish study with an observation period between 2005 and 2015. It reported ASRs for patients with basal cell carcinoma of 158.7 and 134.9 per million for males and females, respectively, which were about twice as high as our rates. Compared to the Irish study's reported squamous cell carcinoma ASRs of 21.0 (males) and 13.9 (females), the same ASRs stood at 7.25 (males) and 7.7 (females) in our study. The literature review revealed that basal cell carcinoma was the most common lid malignancy, ranging between 80-95%. It followed the age distribution of skin basal cell carcinomas described before; however, our study showed more precision. Although melanomas represented a considerably small proportion of malignancies reported by this and other comparable studies, it continues to carry a significant burden of clinical morbidity and mortality.\n\n    Interestingly, sebaceous gland carcinoma was reportedly the most frequent eyelid malignancy in India, the second most in South Korea and Singapore, and the third most frequent in Taiwan. In our study, sebaceous gland carcinoma was found to be a rare malignancy (N = 135). This finding is suggestive of strong geographic and, possibly, genetic variations responsible for these differences.\n\n    In males, there was a steady increase in the incidences of the three most common malignancies, which peaked at the 70-75 age group, then a decline afterwards. In females, the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma continued to rise beyond the 70-75 age group. This is possibly attributable to the accumulation of genetic mutations with aging and infections with a higher cumulative exposure to ultraviolet light as well as reduced repair and a higher apoptosis capacity. We postulate that the decline in the overall incidence of malignancies in older age groups may reflect a decreased interest in seeking medical attention in these groups (e.g., due to lack of interest in improving one's body figure). This may in turn explain the lower survival probabilities among the very old, especially among male patients.\n\n    Previous studies have reported an association between higher rates of squamous cell carcinomas and the male gender. These results were comparable to those of our study in males up to the age of 75. Beyond the age of 75, females had the higher ASRs. In the Irish study, higher ASRs of basal cell carcinoma were reported among males. Conversely, ASRs were higher among females in this study.\n\n    Previous studies reported rising incidences of basal cell carcinoma and melanoma of the skin over long periods. As the data collected for the purposes of this study cover only a relatively short period, no conclusions about long term trend could be drawn. Earlier studies of eyelid malignant tumors reported non-significant trend of rising incidences. Further studies with more extended observation periods are needed in order to better understand the significance of this trend.\n\n    Survival rates in malignant tumors of the eyelid have rarely been reported. As with this work, Jung et al. reported a near 100% survival of patients with BCC.20 The cancer-specific survival of skin tumors is high and has been continuously rising over the years. Higher mortality rates have been reported for sebaceous gland carcinoma and melanoma.\n\n    Although a considerable effort was made in data collection, quality control, and analysis, there might be some limitations to our study. The study's retrospective registry-based design renders it prone to the bias of incomplete data. A known similar example is found in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) program, where the data on treatment may not reflect the latest status of patients. However, in SEER, roughly one-third of the US population is included, whereas our study comprises the whole of Germany.\n\n    In this study, differences between the German states and other European countries with regards to the incidences of tumors may be attributable to a set of factors. As solar radiation is essentially equally distributed over northwestern Europe and also within Germany, it seems unlikely to be a factor in these differences. Socioeconomic differences might be playing a role, as it has been shown that the incidence of cancer is unequally distributed across socioeconomic groups in Germany. Differences in skin type and genetic factors have not been assessed. Furthermore, an essential influencing factor may be the reporting system itself, which is theoretically homogonous, but, in practice, heterogeneous. The discrepancy in medical coverage (or its accessibility) and different levels of interest in seeking treatment are possible confounders. This is thus a possible disadvantage of conducting register data-based studies comparted to retrospective case series.\n\n    Care needed to be taken when data of different German states were added together, as the respective registers had varied levels of completeness. States declared explicitly as reference regions by the Robert Koch Institute are Saarland, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Niedersachsen, as well as some regions in Bavaria and Nordrhein-Westfalen, each having been reporting area-wide data for at least ten years. A law obligating federal states to collect clinical cancer data from 2013 is still in the phase of implementation. Thus, robust data concerning therapy and the course of cancer illness are not currently available in the whole of Germany and could therefore not be presented here. Moreover, our study did not examine the competing causes of death which can be an area for future research.\n\n    Actual numbers could be higher than the reported ones here because relapses and multiple tumors were not being recorded by the registries. Apart from that, there might be bias in the data due to the waiving of invasive diagnostic procedures in the very old, resulting in a possible underestimation of incidences in the highest age group. Future numbers might significantly change upwards due to the aging German society or downwards due to the immigration of younger people of non-Caucasian descent who may have lower risks of non-melanocytic skin tumors. Numbers may also rise through the implementation of effective of early detection measures.\n\n    In summary, this is the first study to present data pertaining to the incidences of eyelid malignances in Germany. Our results and findings may provide a basis for the improvement of cancer registration and health education concerning eyelid malignances. Future studies might be able to better identify high-risk groups and recommend the best prevention strategies.",

        "Title": "    The investigation on the hypercoagulability of hepatocellular carcinoma-related cerebral infarction with thromboelastography",
        "Abstract": "    To investigate the hypercoagulability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related cerebral infarction (HCRCI) with thromboelastography (TEG).\n\n    A multicenter prospective study was conducted in HCRCI patients, HCC patients without cerebral infarction, and acute cerebral infarction (ACI) patients without HCC between January 2016 and December 2019. TEG parameters and laboratory and clinical data were collected and compared among the three groups. To confirm the independent risk factors of HCRCI, multivariate analyses were conducted. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to evaluate the area under the curve (AUC) plotted by each independent risk factor.\n\n    There were 38 patients recruited in the HCRCI group, and 152 patients were recruited to the HCC group and the ACI group. The levels of plasma neutrophil count, D-dimer, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen, and maximum amplitude (MA):a parameter of TEG:were significantly higher in the HCRCI group than HCC and ACI groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that increased neutrophile count, D-dimer, AFP, and MA were independently associated with HCRCI. ROC curve analysis showed first that AUC of MA for HCRCI was .875, which was larger than the other risk factors, and second that the optimal cutoff value for MA was 61.35, with a sensitivity of 89.50% and specificity of 66.40%.\n\n    It was suggested that TEG disclosed that the pathogenesis of HCRIC is exactly related to the hypercoagulability. And with a cutoff value of MA equaling to 61.35, TEG facilitates clinicians to identify HCC patients at high risk of HCRIC.\n\n    TEG which can comprehensively and accurately reflect overall blood coagulation status to evaluate coagulation in patients with HCRCI. TEG confirmed that pathology of HCRCI was related to hypercoagulation.",
        "Introduction": "    Cancer-related cerebral infarction (CI) has received increased attention in the past few years. Now, it is believed that cancer-related CI may have its own specific clinical features, and most of its pathogenesis is related to hypercoagulability (Selvik et al.,, Cutting et al.,). Previous studies have found that the mucins secreted by cancer cells into the blood are associated with hypercoagulability in patients with cancer-related CI (Shao et al.,, Jovin et al.,, Amico et al.,).\n\n    Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor all over the world (Cong et al.,), and the incidence is also rising in China (Fang et al.,). It was found that HCC patients were 1.8 times more likely than the general population to have a cerebral infarction within a year after HCC being diagnosed (Zoller et al.,), indicating that some patients have HCC-related cerebral infarction (HCRCI). However, there have been few reports on HCRCI. Does HCRCI also have specific clinical characteristic? Is HCRCI also related to hypercoagulability? This hypercoagulable state is related to elevated serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is thought to be one type of mucin secreted by HCC. All of the questions mentioned above are interesting and worth exploring.\n\n    Patients with cancer-related CI are considered to have hypercoagulability because of higher plasma D-dimer levels (Selvik et al.,, Cutting et al.,). However, previous studies have shown that routine coagulation tests are insufficient to accurately measure coagulation status in patients with cancer-related CI (Cheng et al.,, Quan et al.,, Qin et al.,). In order to accurately measure coagulation status in patients with cancer-related CI, a new and more sensitive method is needed. Thromboelastography (TEG) can be used to measure whole blood coagulation, reflecting comprehensively and accurately overall blood coagulation status (Bowry et al.,). TEG has been used successfully to identify hypercoagulable state in patients with prostate cancer (Toukh et al.,) and lung-cancer-related CI (Quan et al.,).\n\n    In the present study, we prospectively collected patients with active HCC and with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) without conventional vascular risks as HCRCI group patients to investigate the coagulation status in patients with HCRCI and the underlying pathogenesis of HCRCI with TEG. We hypothesized that the development of HCRCI is related to hypercoagulability caused by elevated plasma AFP, and TEG could more accurately describe the coagulation status of patients with HCRCI compared with routine blood coagulation function tests. This study may contribute to disclosing the pathogenesis of HCRIC exactly relating to hypercoagulability, identifying HCC patients at high risk of HCRIC. And may further contribute to clinicians taking more targeted anticoagulant prophylaxis to prevent the development of HCRCI.",
        "Methods": "    This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. Approval Number: 2021(KY-E-177). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or caregivers.\n\n    We recruited patients with HCRCI who were hospitalized between January 2016 and December 2019 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Wuzhou Red Cross Hospital, Wuzhou Workers' Hospital, Fusui County People's Hospital, and Cenxi People's Hospital.\n\n    The HCRCI group comprised patients (age: >=18 years) with active HCC complicated with ACI without conventional vascular risk factors (Guo et al.,, Kim et al.,, Schwarzbach et al.,). The cancer diagnosis of patients always preceded stroke onset. Active HCC was defined as a diagnosis or treatment of HCC during the last 6 months, or known metastatic/recurrent HCC (Guo et al.,, Schwarzbach et al.,, Lee et al.,). Histological testing was selected as the gold standard for HCC diagnosis. The criteria used for the diagnosis of ACI were determined according to the American Heart Association stroke diagnostic criteria (Powers et al.,). The etiological classification of CI was ascertained by reference to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria (Adams et al.,). The exclusion criteria for the HCRCI group included patients with HCC complicated with CI with conventional vascular risk factors; patients with primary or secondary intracranial tumors; patients with other systemic malignancies; patients with HCC complicated with cerebral hemorrhage and other nervous system diseases; patients with heart, lung, kidney, and other important organ dysfunction; patients were treated with intraarterial/intravenous thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, hemodialysis, infection <14 days, platelet count <50,000/mm3, and pregnancy; and patients who refused to be recruited. Patients enrolled in the study strictly followed the double-blind principle, and were reviewed and confirmed by one neurologist, one oncologist, and one radiologist.\n\n    We collected HCRCI group and control group according to 1:4. Participants in the ACI group were individually matched to participants in the HCRCI group based on age stratum (>=65 vs. <65 years) and sex, while participants in the HCC group were individually matched to patients in the HCRCI group based on age stratum (>=65 vs. <65 years), sex, and cancer types (Figure 1).\n\n    In the HCRCI group and stroke-only group, blood was collected 72-120 h after the onset of cerebral infarction. In the HCC-only group, blood was collected immediately after enrollment. Blood samples were immediately tested in laboratory, including routine blood examination (including white blood cell, platelet, and neutrophil counts), blood coagulation examination (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], fibrinogen, international standardized ratio [INR], D-dimer, and TEG), and concentration of tumor markers (AFP, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], cancer antigen 125 [CA125], cancer antigen 153, and cancer antigen 199).\n\n    The TEG 5000 analyzer (Haemoscope Corporation, Skokie, IL, USA) and accompanying reagents were used in the present study. Briefly, 1000 muL of whole blood sample of citrate was injected into a kaolin reagent bottle, mixed, and allowed to stand for activation. Then, 340 muL of this solution was injected into the standard specimen cup, and 20 muL of 0.2 mol/L calcium solution was added into the standard specimen cup for immediate detection. After being processed by computer collection and analysis software, TEG parameters were recorded, including coagulation reaction time (R-time), alpha-angle, time of clot formation (K-time), coagulation index (CI), clot lysis at 30 min (LY30), and maximum amplitude (MA). TEG was performed by the same trained operator. Quality control checks were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n    We collected participants' baseline data, including general data (age, sex, etc.), HCC data (pathological types, whether there were metastasis and treatment), CI data (stroke etiology, infarct patterns, and clinical features), and cranial computed tomography/diffusion-weighted imaging/magnetic resonance imaging. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was utilized to evaluate the severity of focal neurological dysfunction and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was utilized to assess the outcome.\n\n    Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were represented by n (%); continuous variables were represented by mean +- SD. In the case of continuous data, the significance of differences between groups were evaluated using the independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test, or chi 2 and Fisher's exact tests (two-tailed) in the case of categorical data. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify independent risk factors for HCRCI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to assess the area under the curve (AUC) plotted for each independent risk factor. The AUC of each independent risk factor was compared using Medcalc version 10.4.8 (Frank Schoonjans). The variable with the largest AUC should be considered to have the best predictive power for HCRCI, and the cutoff value of this variable should be used as a predictor of HCRCI occurrence. All tests were two-sided. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Due to the characteristics of cancer-related ischemic stroke, no formal sample size calculations were performed.",
        "Results": "    We recruited 38 patients with HCRCI (32 males and six females; mean age: 63.05 +- 10.63 years), along with 152 patients with HCC and 152 patients with ACI. There were no statistical differences in age and sex among the three groups (p > 0.05).\n\n    The etiology of CI in the HCRCI group was cryptogenic CI according to TOAST classification. Comparison of clinical data between the ACI and HCRCI groups showed no significant differences in neurological dysfunction symptoms (dyskinesia, dysarthria, disturbance of sensation and consciousness, and ataxia) and neurological dysfunction degree (NIHSS score on admission) (p > 0.05). According to the mRS score, the rate of good prognosis was lower in the HCRCI group than in the ACI group (9/38 [23.68%] vs. 108/152 [71.05%]; p < .05), while the rates of poor prognosis and mortality were higher in the HCRCI group (18/38 [47.37%] vs. 36/152 [23.68%] and 11/38 [28.95%] vs. 8/152 [5.26%]; p < .05). D-dimer level was elevated in the HCRCI group (p < .05). For the other laboratory examinations, the differences between the two groups were not significant (p > .05) (Table 1).\n\n    Compared with the ACI group, patients in the HCRCI group had a lower rate of single CI in a single arterial area and a higher rate of multiple CIs in multi-arterial regions. Sometimes the lesions were distributed to the bilateral anterior circulation and posterior circulation (p < .05). Small lesions were more common in the HCRCI group (p < .05), and the difference was not significant in the size of medium and large lesions and the location of lesions between the two groups (p > .05) (Table 2; Figure 2).\n\n    The rate of distant metastasis in the HCRCI group was higher than that in the HCC group (p < .05). There were no differences between the two groups in the pathological types of HCC and HCC treatment (p > .05). Compared with the HCC group, neutrophil count, D-dimer, AFP, CEA, and MA value of TEG in the HCRCI group were significantly elevated (p < .05), while there were no significant differences in other examinations (p > .05) (Table 3).\n\n    Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that elevated neutrophils (odds ratio [OR] = 1.502, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.003-2.250, p = .048), D-dimer (OR = 1.0005, 95% CI: 1.000-1.001, p = .046), AFP (OR = 1.002, 95% CI: 1.001-1.003, p = .002), and MA (OR = 1.709, 95% CI: 1.298-2.249, p < .001) were independent risks of HCC patients to develop HCRCI (Table 4).\n\n    Compared to the AUC of neutrophils (.762, 95% CI: .665-.859), D-dimer (.740, 95% CI: .656-.825), and AFP (.770, 95% CI: .677-.862), the AUC of MA (.875, 95% CI: .819-.932) was the largest, and the optimal cutoff value of MA was 61.35; the sensitivity and specificity of identifying and predicting HCRCI were 89.50% and 66.40%, respectively (Table 5; Figure 3).",
        "Conclusion": "    It was suggested that TEG, on the one hand, disclosed that the pathogenesis of HCRIC is exactly related to the hypercoagulability. And on the other hand, with a cutoff value of MA equaling to 61.35, TEG facilitates clinicians to identify HCC patients at high risk of HCRIC.",
        "Discussion": "    Stroke and cancer are the two common leading causes of death or disability around the world. Cancer and CI sometimes share the same risk factors, such as smoking, so sometimes the same patient can suffer from these two diseases at the same time, with cancer complicated by CI (Siriratnam et al.,). Moreover, previous studies have shown that cancer can directly or indirectly cause the occurrence of CI (Guo et al.,, Kim et al.,, Schwarzbach et al.,). Furthermore, there will be an increasing number of patients with cancer-related CI as the treatment of tumors continues to improve. Cancer patients who suffer another ACI will not only suffer additional pain, but also have serious adverse consequences (Kim et al.,, Kneihsl et al.,). Therefore, cancer-related CI is receiving increased attention. Previous researches have shown that cancer-related CI often has clinical features such as increased plasma D-dimer level and multiple ischemic lesions in multi-arterial areas, and different cancer cells may have elevation of different tumor markers in serum (Selvik et al.,, Schwarzbach et al.,, Cocho et al.,). In the present study, we found that HCRCI patients had similar characteristics to those with general cancer-related CI, including increased levels of plasma D-dimer and multiple lesions in cerebral multi-arterial regions. Moreover, HCRIC was found to have its unique feature of elevated serum AFP level, which is helpful for clinicians to identify HCRIC from other subtypes of CI.\n\n    Besides having specific clinical features, cancer-related CI also has specific pathogenesis that is worth exploring. Previous studies have found that in addition to the fact that some cancers can directly lead to CI (Budincevic et al.,, Zheng et al.,), most cancer-related CI is associated with hypercoagulability based on elevated serum D-dimer level (Shen et al.,, Rosenberg et al.,, Gon et al.,). However, as has been found in other studies on the pathogenesis of cancer-related CI, although patients are considered to be hypercoagulable, routine coagulation tests, such as thrombin time, PT, APTT, and INR, are normal in most patients with cancer-related CI, suggesting that the tests are inadequate to assess blood clotting (Cheng et al.,, Quan et al.,, Qin et al.,). In the current study, increased serum D-dimer levels suggested that the pathogenesis of HCRCI is related to hypercoagulability. TEG has been shown to have advantages in measuring blood clotting ability by assaying the viscoelastic characteristics of blood clots, providing information on the cumulative impacts of various parameters, including plasma factors and cytokines, at all stages of coagulation and fibrinolysis (Akay et al.,).\n\n    The MA, one parameter of TEG, is the maximum amplitude of binding of fibrin and platelets to platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, indicating the maximum strength of fibrin/platelet clots. When the MA value increases, it indicates arteriovenous thrombosis and blood hypercoagulability (Zohav et al.,). In the present study, TEG was used to detect coagulation in patients with HCRCI, and showed that MA in the HCRCI group was significantly increased, suggesting that patients with HCRCI are in a hypercoagulable state.\n\n    However, how hypercoagulability occurs in patients with HCC is uncertain. Studies have found that mucins produced by cancer cells are related to hypercoagulability and raise the risk of CI (Shao et al.,, Jovin et al.,, Amico et al.,). (Jovin et al.,) found that the increase of some tumor markers such as CA125 with mucin characteristics was associated with cancer-related hypercoagulability and contributed to cancer-related ischemic stroke. (Shao et al.,) confirmed through animal studies that mucins secreted by cancer cells can activate neutrophils and platelets and trigger microthrombosis. These studies suggest that mucin-related hypercoagulability plays a key role in cancer-associated ischemic stroke. In the current study, we found that AFP was an independent risk factor of HCRCI. AFP is also a similar mucin marker as CA125. Therefore, we speculated that AFP secreted by HCC may contribute to the occurrence of HCRCI by inducing platelets and neutrophils mutual activation.\n\n    In addition, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) produced by neutrophils are also related to hypercoagulable state and thrombotic diseases, including ischemic stroke (Thalin et al.,, Demers & Wagner,). Cancer cells induce formation of NETs, which bind to platelets, activate the coagulation system, and inhibit activation of the anticoagulation system and fibrinolysis, increasing hypercoagulability in patients and leading to thrombosis (Jung et al.,). In the present study, neutrophils in HCRCI patients increased, and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high neutrophil count can independently increase the risk of HCRCI. This suggests that HCC also induces an increase in neutrophils and the release of NETs and stimulates platelet activation to promote hypercoagulability, and eventually leads to HCRCI.\n\n    In the current study, elevated D-dimer, AFP, neutrophils, and MA value were independently associated with HCRCI, suggesting that these parameters might be utilized as possible biomarkers for HCRCI. To identify high-risk HCC patients with HCRCI, ROC curve was used to evaluate AUC plotted for each independent correlation factor. The MA value had the largest AUC, with the highest sensitivity and specificity, which proves that MA value can identify patients at high risk of developing HCRCI.\n\n    There were some limitations to this study. First, the small patient population limits our ability to generalize the results. Second, MA (determined by TEG) were not different between ACI and HCRCI groups; however, they were different between HCC and HCRCI. The difference in MA(determined by TEG) in HCC and HCRCI remained not excluded be the result thatthe acute stress response to stroke. A larger, prospective, multicenter study will better elucidate the ability of TEG to distinguish HCRCI from other types of CI in terms of etiology and may facilitate prediction of the occurrence of HCRCI.",

        "Title": "    Interactive Effects of Copper Sources and a High Level of Phytase in Phosphorus-Deficient Diets on Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility, Tissue Mineral Concentrations, and Plasma Parameters in Nursery Pigs",
        "Abstract": "    The present study investigated the interactive effects of copper sources and a high level of phytase on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, tissue mineral concentrations, and plasma parameters in nursery pigs. Weaning piglets (N = 192; 6.06 +- 0.99 kg), blocked by body weight, were randomly allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments, with 12 pens per treatment and 4 pigs per pen. A basal diet for each phase was formulated to meet nutrient requirements for nursery pigs with the exception that standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) P was reduced by 0.12% and Ca was adjusted to achieve Ca/STTD P = 2.15. The 4 dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design, with 2 Cu sources (125 mg/kg Cu from copper methionine hydroxy analogue chelate (Cu-MHAC) or copper sulfate (CuSO4)) and 2 phytase levels (0 or 1500 phytase units (FTU)/kg). Results showed that there was an interaction (P < 0.05) between Cu sources and phytase on ADG during days 0-41. When phytase was not present in the diets (P deficient), there was no difference between the two Cu sources in terms of ADG during days 0-41, whereas with phytase in the diets, Cu-MHAC tended to improve (P < 0.10) ADG during days 0-41 compared with CuSO4. Pigs fed Cu-MHAC had greater apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of neutral and acid detergent fiber and STTD of P than those fed CuSO4. Phytase increased (P < 0.05) growth performance, ATTD of Ca and P, and plasma inositol and growth hormone concentrations. In conclusion, Cu-MHAC may be more effective in improving growth rate than CuSO4 when phytase was supplemented at 1500 FTU/kg. Cu-MHAC enhanced fiber and P digestibility regardless of phytase, compared with CuSO4. Phytase addition in P-deficient diets was effective in improving growth performance, Ca and P digestibility, and plasma inositol and growth hormone concentrations.",
        "Introduction": "    High levels of copper sulfate (CuSO4, 150 to 250 mg/kg Cu) are widely used in nursery pigs to promote growth and improve feed efficiency. It has been demonstrated that chelated Cu is more bioavailable in both chickens and pigs than CuSO4. Supplementation of Cu as Cu-citrate (125 mg/kg Cu) or Cu-proteinate (100 mg/kg Cu) has been shown to achieve similar growth performance in nursery pigs as CuSO4 supplementation at 250 mg/kg Cu. Similarly, supplementation of copper methionine hydroxy analogue chelate achieved greater average daily gain and feed efficiency in nursery or grow-finish pigs compared with pigs fed CuSO4 or tribasic copper chloride at equivalent Cu levels.\n\n    Copper sulfate is easily dissociated in the acidic pH in the stomach, allowing Cu to interact with phytate and resulting in the formation of Cu-phytate complexes. These complexes could impair phytase efficacy, resulting in lower P release from the phytate molecule. An in vitro model has demonstrated that Cu lysine is less inhibitive to phytase compared with CuSO4. Our recent data also suggests that Cu-MHAC may enhance phytase efficacy on bone mineralization in nursery pigs when 500 FTU/kg phytase is used, compared with CuSO4. However, there is no data on the interaction of copper source and phytase supplementation at high levels on growth performance and mineral digestibility in pigs. It is hypothesized that Cu-MHAC could enhance the efficacy of phytase at 1500 FTU/kg on growth performance and mineral digestibility in nursery pigs, compared with CuSO4. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the interactive effects of copper sources and phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, tissue mineral concentrations, and plasma parameters.",
        "Methods": "    The present experiment was conducted at Green Acres Animal Research and Testing Facility (Novus International, Inc., Montgomery City, MO). A total of 192 TR4 x C22 weaning barrows (BW 6.06 +- 0.99 kg; PIC, Hendersonville, TN, USA) were used in this study. Pigs were housed in plastic-coated floor pens. Each piglet was tagged for individual identification. Pigs had free access to the feed and water during the entire nursery period. A three-phase feeding program (days 0-14, 15-28, 29-42) was used in the present study.\n\n    At weaning (day 0), piglets were weighed individually and allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments according to a randomized complete block design, which was blocked by initial BW. There were 12 pens per treatment and 4 pigs per pen. A basal diet for each phase was formulated to meet the energy and nutrient requirements for different stages of pigs according to the recommendation by NRC, with the exception that standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) P was reduced by 0.12% and Ca level was adjusted to meet the fixed ratio of Ca to STTD P of 2.15. The 4 dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design (Table 1), with 2 Cu sources (125 ppm Cu from copper methionine hydroxy analogue chelate (Cu-MHAC, MINTREX  Cu, Novus International, Inc., St. Charles, MO, USA) or CuSO4 (Old Bridge Chemicals, Inc., Old Bridge, NJ, USA), respectively) and 2 phytase levels (0 or 1500 FTU/kg phytase (PHYTAVERSE , Novus International, Inc., St. Charles, MO, USA)). The basal diet composition for the 3 phases is presented in Table 2.\n\n    Piglet body weights (BW) were measured at the initiation of the study (day 0) and at the end of each phase (days 14, 28, and 41). Feed addition to each feeder was recorded each time when the feed was added to the feeder. At the end of each phase, the remaining feed in the feeder was weighed. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) were calculated for each phase and the entire nursery period.\n\n    Fresh fecal samples were collected via grab sampling from each pig in each pen twice a day from days 36 to 41. The fecal samples were stored at - 20  C immediately after collection. At the end of sample collection, fecal samples within each pen were thawed, homogenized, and immediately placed in a heated oven (NHP-PD-ECO, Win-Holt, Woodbury, NY, USA) at 65  C for 48 h. All dried fecal samples were ground using a rotor mill (PULVERISETTE 14, Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) fitted with a 1-mm screen. Ground feces were thoroughly homogenized, and a subsample was collected for chemical analysis.\n\n    At the end of the study (day 42), one pig from each pen with the BW closest to the average BW of the pen was selected and approximately 7 ml of blood samples was collected via jugular puncture, followed by euthanasia using captive bolt. The blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 x g at 4  C for 15 min to obtain plasma samples. The third metacarpal samples were collected from selected pigs. Liver (approximately 50 g of the right lobe) and kidney (approximately 50 g of the right kidney) samples were collected in the selected pigs. The metacarpal, liver, and kidney samples were stored at - 20  C until chemical analysis.\n\n    Diets and feces samples were analyzed for dry matter (DM, method 934.01), Ca (method 985.01), P (method 985.01), Zn (method 985.01), and Cu (method 985.01) according to AOAC. Phytase activity in the diets was analyzed according to ISO. Gross energy was analyzed in diets and feces using an isoperibol bomb calorimeter (Model 6300, Parr Instruments, Moline, IL). Acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) in diets and feces were analyzed using ANKOM Technology method 12 and 13, respectively (ANKOM 2000 Fiber Analyzer, ANKOM Technology, Macedon, NY). Titanium concentration in phase 3 diets and fecal samples was analyzed according to the procedures described by Myers et al..\n\n    Plasma samples were used for malondialdehyde (MDA) analysis, which was quantified using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay kit 10009055 (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). Plasma inositol was measured using myo-inositol assay kit from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations were measured using porcine growth hormone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit from MyBioSource (San Diego, CA) and porcine IGF-1 ELISA kit, respectively.\n\n    Metacarpal, liver, and kidney samples were ashed in a muffle furnace at 600  C overnight in porcelain crucibles. The concentrations of ash, Ca, P, Zn, and Cu in metacarpal, liver, and kidney samples were determined using the procedure described by method 985.01 of AOAC. Ash, Ca, and P percentages in metacarpal samples were expressed as grams of ash, Ca, and P per 100 g of dry, fat-free metacarpal weight, respectively.\n\n    The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) coefficient for Ca and P in each treatment was calculated according to equations proposed by NRC. Standardized total tract digestibility of Ca and P were calculated by accounting for endogenous losses of Ca (330 mg/kg dry matter intake) and P (190 mg/kg dry matter intake), respectively.\n\n    SAS  9.4 (SAS Inst. Inc., Gary, NC) was used for all data analysis. Pen served as the experimental unit. The LSMEANS statement was used to calculate the least square means. The Tukey-Kramer adjustment was used for multiple comparisons of the least square means. Pooled SEM was calculated for each measurement. A probability of P <= 0.05 was considered as significant and 0.05 < P <= 0.10 was declared as a trend.\n\n    The GLIMMIX procedure was used to analyze all the data. Copper source, phytase level, and their interaction were considered as the fixed effects, whereas block was considered as the random effect. All the data were analyzed using default normal regression model.",
        "Results": "    Pigs fed diets containing Cu-MHAC tended (P < 0.10) to have greater G:F during days 0-14, compared with those fed diets containing CuSO4 (Table 3). Pigs fed diets containing 1500 FTU/kg phytase had greater (P < 0.05) ADG, ADFI, and G:F during all phases, except for G:F during days 28-41, compared with those fed diets without phytase.\n\n    There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between Cu sources and phytase in terms of BW on day 41. When phytase was not present in the diets (P deficient), there was no difference between the two Cu sources in terms of BW on day 41. In contrast, when phytase was included in the diets, Cu-MHAC tended to have greater (P < 0.10) BW on day 41 than CuSO4. Similarly, there was an interaction (P < 0.05) between Cu sources and phytase on ADG during days 0-41. When phytase was not present in the diets (P deficient), there was no difference between the two Cu sources in terms of ADG during days 0-41. In contrast, when phytase was included in the diets, Cu-MHAC tended to increase (P < 0.10) ADG during days 0-41 compared with CuSO4.\n\n    The ATTD of NDF and ADF was greater (P < 0.05) in pigs fed diets containing Cu-MHAC compared with pigs fed diets containing CuSO4 (Table 4). Pigs fed diets containing Cu-MHAC had greater (P < 0.05) ATTD and STTD of P than those fed diets containing CuSO4. Phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg increased (P < 0.01) ATTD of ash, Ca, and P, and STTD of Ca and P, compared with no phytase supplementation. However, phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg resulted in lower (P < 0.05) ATTD of NDF, ADF, and gross energy, compared with no phytase supplementation.\n\n    Cu sources did not affect fat-free bone weight, bone ash, Ca, P, Zn, and Cu concentrations from pigs on day 42 (Table 5). Phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg increased (P < 0.05) fat-free bone weight and bone P concentrations compared with no phytase supplementation. Similarly, phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg tended to increase (P < 0.10) bone ash and Ca concentrations compared with no phytase supplementation. However, phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg reduced (P < 0.01) bone Cu concentration compared with no phytase supplementation.\n\n    There were no differences (P > 0.10) among the two Cu sources in terms of liver and kidney Cu and Zn concentrations (Table 6). Phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg reduced (P < 0.01) liver Cu concentration compared with no phytase supplementation. In contrast, phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg resulted in greater (P < 0.05) kidney Cu and Zn concentration compared with no phytase supplementation.\n\n    There were no differences (P > 0.10) between the two Cu sources in terms of plasma inositol, TBARS, growth hormone, and IGF-1 concentrations (Table 7). Phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg increased (P < 0.05) plasma inositol and growth hormone concentrations compared with no phytase supplementation.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    High levels of CuSO4 (150 to 250 mg/kg Cu) are traditionally used in weaning pig diets to promote growth and improve feed efficiency. Technology advancement has led to the development of numerous forms of organic Cu, which have been shown to be more bioavailable than CuSO4. Studies have demonstrated that Cu-proteinate and Cu-MHAC achieved greater growth performance in nursery pigs than CuSO4 at the same Cu inclusion levels, which was further supported by the current study that Cu-MHAC achieved greater average daily gain than CuSO4 in the presence of phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg. The fact that average daily gain in nursery pigs was not different between Cu-MHAC and CuSO4 without phytase in the present study indicated that the impact of P deficiency might overshadow the beneficial effect of Cu-MHAC or P deficiency may impair the function and utilization of Cu in the body. Additionally, Cu-citrate yielded similar growth performance as CuSO4 in nursery pigs at the same inclusion level of Cu. It was also shown that Cu-MHAC led to greater growth performance in nursery pigs than tribasic copper chloride at the same Cu inclusion levels. These studies suggest that Cu sources play a critical role in its function and utilization in the body, thereby affecting growth performance of pigs.\n\n    Several modes of action could be responsible for the growth performance benefits by Cu-MHAC supplementation. Firstly, Cu could exert antibacterial effect directly or indirectly via bile salts and therefore modulate gut microbiota. It was reported that supplementation at 100 mg/kg Cu as Cu-methionine or Cu-proteinate increased the proportion of Lactobacillus while they reduced the proportion of Escherichia coli in the ileal digesta of broilers. Supplementation of 30 mg/kg Cu from Cu-MHAC in broilers decreased the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae and Firmicutes in the cecum digesta compared with supplementation of 125 mg/kg Cu from CuSO4, which indicated that Cu-MHAC could modulate gut microbiota by shifting cecal microbiota to more beneficial microflora. The improved growth rate by Cu-MHAC in the diets containing 1500 FTU/kg phytase in the current study may be derived from the balanced gut microbiota compared with CuSO4.\n\n    Secondly, Cu supplementation could exert its function via systemic routes. It has been demonstrated that increasing Cu supplementation in weaning pigs could increase serum mitogenic activity, liver superoxide dismutase activity, and pituitary growth hormone mRNA concentrations. It can also elevate serum growth hormone and IGF-1, enhance both ghrelin mRNA expression in the fundic region of the stomach and growth hormone-releasing hormone, and suppress somatostatin mRNA expression levels in the hypothalamus. A recent study conducted by Gonzalez-Esquerra et al. demonstrated that nursery pigs fed Cu-MHAC at 50 mg/kg Cu had increased serum growth hormone concentration than those fed CuSO4 at 160 mg/kg Cu. However, plasma growth hormone and IGF-1 were not affected by the two Cu sources in the current study. The discrepancy among studies may be attributed to animal source and variation, sampling time, diurnal change of these hormones, and the analysis accuracy of these hormones.\n\n    Thirdly, Cu-MHAC, which is composed of one mole of Cu chelated with two moles of DL-2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid in coordinate covalent bonds, is stable in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which may minimize the formation of Cu-phytate complex and allow more Cu to be absorbed by the epithelial cells in the jejunum and ileum. The reduction of Cu-phytate complexes by Cu-MHAC could also improve P digestibility without phytase supplementation compared with CuSO4. In contrast, approximately 40 to 50% of Cu in CuSO4 was formed as insoluble Cu-phytate in the pH range 5.5 to 6.5, which resulted in reduced phytase efficacy to break down the phytate molecule to release P. Indeed, increasing Cu levels as CuSO4 in the diets containing 600 FTU/kg resulted in a linear reduction of average daily gain, feed efficiency, and apparent P retention rate in broilers, which reinforced that CuSO4 at high inclusion levels could impair phytase efficacy. However, the in vitro model demonstrated that the magnitude of inhibition on phytate hydrolysis by phytase was much less when Cu-lysine was used as Cu source compared with CuSO4, most likely indicating that a lower level of Cu-phytate complex was formed when using chelated Cu source. To the best of our knowledge, the current study was the first study to report increased P digestibility by chelated Cu compared with CuSO4 in pigs in the presence of phytase. It was not known why the improved P digestibility by Cu-MHAC did not lead to increased bone P compared with CuSO4, which warrants further investigation. The improved ADF and NDF digestibility by Cu-MHAC supplementation compared with CuSO4 could also partially explain the improved growth rate in nursery pigs in this study. It has been reported that Cu supplementation at 10-20 mg/kg could increase NDF digestibility in cashmere goats probably due to enhanced rumen fermentation. It was probable that Cu-MHAC supplementation could increase the number of fiber-degrading gut microbes in pigs, thereby improving fiber digestibility, compared with CuSO4.\n\n    The observation that phytase increased growth performance and bone mineralization in pigs was also observed in previous experiments. The improved growth performance and bone mineralization by phytase supplementation were mainly a result of increased P digestibility, which was consistent with the findings of the current study.\n\n    Phytate is negatively charged in aqueous solutions, especially under acidic conditions, which makes the phytate molecule bind other nutrients, including starch, protein, and minerals. Additionally, phytate may bind to endogenous digestive enzymes and thereby reduce their capacity to digest nutrients. As a result, increasing phytate levels in the diets may reduce pepsin activity in weanling pigs and intestinal alpha-amylase, sucrase, and maltase activities in chickens. Phytase supplementation may result in a step-wise hydrolysis of the phytate molecule, thereby releasing phytate bound P and other nutrients, which may improve the digestibility of these nutrients.\n\n    Results of experiments to study phytase supplementation on the ATTD of nutrients and energy have been inconsistent. Increasing the dosage of phytase from 0 to 4000 FTU/kg did not affect the ATTD of dry matter and gross energy in growing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based diets, but a linear increase in the ATTD of dry matter and gross energy was observed if the dosage of phytase was increased in corn-soybean meal diets fed to nursery pigs. Increasing levels of phytase from 0 to 4000 FTU/kg did not affect the ATTD of NDF, but linearly increased the ATTD of ADF by nursery pigs fed corn-soybean meal diets. However, a linear reduction in the ATTD of NDF was observed when phytase supplementation was increased from 0 to 20,000 FTU/kg in nursery pigs fed a corn-soybean meal diet, which was consistent with the findings of the current study. Phytase in the current study could reduce Ca and P flow to the hindgut, thereby impairing the microbial fermentation and reducing fiber digestibility. The reduced fiber digestibility may partially explain the reduced energy digestibility by phytase in the present study.\n\n    It is well documented that phytase supplementation could increase Zn digestibility and bioavailability in pigs. However, phytase effect on Cu bioavailability in pigs was inconsistent. Some studies reported phytase supplementation improved Cu digestibility and bioavailability, whereas other studies showed no response or even negative effect on Cu digestibility and bioavailability in pigs. The amount of Zn release from the phytate complex by phytase supplementation and relative Zn and Cu concentrations in the diets might explain the various responses from different studies. Hill et al. reported the antagonistic effect of excess dietary Zn on Cu availability in pigs. The antagonism between Zn and Cu is primarily mediated through the absorption process, where Zn induces high concentrations of metallothionein in the intestinal mucosa and the binding affinity of metallothionein for Cu is greater than Zn. The Cu bound to metallothionein is not absorbed and sloughed with mucosal cells, therefore reducing Cu bioavailability. To our best knowledge, it is the first study to report the increased kidney Cu concentrations caused by phytase supplementation, along with the reduced bone and liver Cu concentrations. It seems that the improved Zn bioavailability caused by phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg not only impacts Cu absorption in the intestinal level but also shifts Cu metabolism and distribution among various tissues, including bone, liver, and kidney. Further studies are warranted to explore this intriguing question.\n\n    Numerous studies have reported that phytase supplementation above 1000 FTU/kg could lead to increased plasma inositol concentration in pigs and broilers. It has been suggested that inositol could stimulate insulin signaling pathway and protein synthesis, which may explain the improved growth performance of phytase supplementation above 1000 FTU/kg in pigs and broilers. Plasma growth hormone concentration was reduced under phosphorus deficiency in broilers. It could be speculated that increased P bioavailability by phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg in the current study may contribute to enhanced pituitary activity and thereby higher growth hormone secretion. The increased plasma inositol and growth hormone may partially explain the improved growth performance by phytase in the present study.\n\n    In conclusion, Cu-MHAC led to greater growth rate in nursery pigs than CuSO4 in the presence of phytase supplementation at 1500 FTU/kg. Cu-MHAC enhanced fiber and P digestibility regardless of phytase in comparison with CuSO4. Phytase addition to P-deficient diets was effective in improving growth performance, Ca and P digestibility, and plasma inositol and growth hormone concentrations.\n\n    Publisher's Note\n\n    Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

        "Title": "    Effects of pen enrichment on leg health of fast and slower-growing broiler chickens",
        "Abstract": "    Pen enrichment for broiler chickens is one of the potential strategies to stimulate locomotion and consequently contribute to better leg health and welfare. This study was designed to evaluate effects of using a plethora of pen enrichments (barrier perches, angular ramps, horizontal platforms, large distance between feed and water and providing live Black Soldier fly larvae in a dustbathing area) on tibia characteristics, locomotion, leg health and home pen behaviour of fast and slower-growing broiler chickens. The experiment was set up as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with a total of 840 male broiler chickens in a complete randomized design (7 pens per treatment and 30 chickens per pen) with the following treatments: 1) pen enrichment (enriched pen or non-enriched pen); 2) broiler strain (fast-growing Ross 308 or slower-growing Hubbard JA 757). Home pen behaviour and use of enrichment were observed. At approximately 1400 and 2200 g body weight, two chickens per pen were randomly selected and slaughtered, to investigate tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical characteristics and leg health. Pen enrichment positively affected tibia biophysical characteristics, e.g., osseous volume (Delta = 1.8 cm3, P = 0.003), total volume (Delta = 1.4 cm3, P = 0.03) and volume fraction (Delta = 0.02%, P = 0.002), in both fast and slower-growing chickens, suggesting that pen enrichment particularly affects ossification and mineralization mechanisms. Accordingly, locomotion and active behaviours were positively influenced by pen enrichment. However, pen enrichment resulted in lower body weight gain in both strains, which might be due to higher activity or lower feed intake as a result of difficulties of crossing the barrier perches. Regarding the strain, slower-growing chickens showed consistently more advanced tibia characteristics and more active behaviour than fast-growing chickens. It can be concluded that pen enrichment may lead to more activity and better bone development in both fast and slower-growing chickens.",
        "Introduction": "    In the last decades, genetic selection for growth rate and feed efficiency in broiler chickens resulted in significant phenotypic and genotypic changes. Despite the fact that this selection has provided numerous advantages e.g., high amount of meat production in a short rearing duration, less environmental pollution and considerable financial benefits for producers, it has also caused some downsides e.g., suboptimal leg health. Suboptimal leg health appears to be related to an imbalance between high growth rate and immature bones and joints, which can lead to impaired locomotion, pain, poor welfare, higher mortality, lower slaughter revenues and significant financial losses.\n\n    A potential strategy to promote leg health and welfare of modern broiler chickens might be to stimulate activity and locomotion, e.g., by pen enrichment. Chickens have been using natural perches, platforms, ramps and elevated resting areas as their natural behaviour throughout their history, from wild ancestors to their modern generations. This suggests that these types of enrichments are important to fulfil natural behaviors, but current broiler houses mostly lack any form of enrichment. Several studies assessing behaviour showed that fast-growing broiler chickens spend approximately 80% of their lifespan with passive behaviours (e.g., lying, sitting and resting). The lack of activity, together with a fast growth rate, may impair bone development, which is one of the reasons for suboptimal leg health and lameness. It has been shown that activity can be stimulated through an enriched environment, by i.e., a lower stocking density, placing platforms and/or ramps, barrier perches in between feed and water resources, large distance between feed and water, different dustbathing materials, such as moss-peat, and worms or insects in a dustbathing area resulted in lower prevalence of leg disorders, lower mortality rate and better locomotion, although we did not find this in an earlier comparable study. Increasing physical activity and locomotion may thus result in lower incidence of leg problems by stimulating tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical properties.\n\n    Another potential strategy to promote leg health and welfare is to reduce growth rate of broiler chickens. Fast growth rate and body weight gain in fast-growing broiler chickens are known to be directly associated with several health and welfare issues. For instance, fast-growing broiler chickens demonstrate more leg and locomotion problems than slower-growing broiler chickens. One of the reasons is that the speed of bone development is unable to keep up with this rapidly increased body weight in fast-growing broiler chickens and they have more porous and less mineralised bones than slower-growing broiler chickens. It has been found that slower-growing broiler chickens spent more time on perches and platforms, demonstrated better locomotion, had less hock and leg problems and lower mortality than fast-growing broiler chickens.\n\n    It can be hypothesized that pen enrichment positively affects bone development and locomotion in both fast and slower-growing broiler chickens, but that effects might be larger in the fast-growing broiler chickens, because they generally show worse gait, resulting in less locomotion. However, effects of pen enrichment on locomotion and leg problems in slower-growing broiler chickens are hardly investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate effects of a combination of different forms of pen enrichment on tibia characteristics, locomotion, leg health and home pen behaviour of both fast and slower-growing broiler chickens.",
        "Methods": "    The experiment was setup as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two strains of broiler chickens (fast-growing and slower-growing) and two different levels of pen enrichment (enriched and non-enriched). A total of 28 pens (7 pens per treatment, each containing 30 male broiler chickens) within a complete randomized design was used. Male chickens were used, because they show in general more leg health problems than female chickens, due to their higher body weight. Fast-growing broiler chickens were reared till day 38 of age, whereas slower-growing broiler chickens were reared till day 49 of age. The experiment was conducted at the research accommodation of Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (Lelystad, The Netherlands). All procedures in this study were approved by the Central Commission on Animal Experiments (The Hague, The Netherlands; approval number: 2016.D-0138.006).\n\n    A total of 420 fast-growing (Ross 308, breeder age of 30 weeks) and 420 slower-growing (Hubbard JA 757; breeder age of 28 weeks) day-old male broiler chickens were obtained from a commercial hatchery (Probroed, Groenlo, The Netherlands) on the same day and randomly allocated to 28 pens in one broiler house. Half of the chickens per broiler strain were placed in enriched pens, while the other half was placed in non-enriched pens, resulting in the following treatments: enriched fast (EF), non-enriched fast (NF), enriched slower (ES) and non-enriched slower (NS). Pen size of both enriched and non-enriched pens was 3 x 1 m and floors in all pens were covered with 4 to 6 cm wood shavings as bedding material. Enriched pens contained two wooden platforms (100 x 20 x 40 cm, one at each long side of the pen), two wooden ramps (200 x 20 cm, angle of 11.5 ), a dust bathing area in the centre of the pen (100 x 100 cm) with peat moss (with a thickness of 2 cm in week 1, 4 cm in week 2, and 7.5 cm from week 3 onwards), two vertical wooden barrier perches (100 x 4 cm, adjustable in height from 4 to 16 cm with steps of 4 cm at days 7, 14 and 21), a maximum distance (3 m) between the feeding trough (1 m in length) and 3 nipple drinkers per pen and provision of live Black Soldier fly larvae (BSFL) in the substrate of the dust bathing area (once daily between 11:00 and 11:15 h). Because their attractiveness and flavour, all larvae were consumed by chickens in a very short time span (<10 min). The amount of BSFL was determined daily, based on 5% of the expected feed intake, except during the first 7 days, where chickens received a higher level of BSFL (10% on days 0-1, 15% on days 2-4 and 10% on days 5-7). The reason for using higher percentages in these 7 days is related to the number of larvae available for each chicken. With the low feed intake in this phase, only one or two larvae would have been available per chicken in case only 5% BSFL was provided. Non-enriched pens included feed and water (at 1 m distance) and one single long perch (300 x 4 cm, not adjustable in height). The provision of one single perch was done to fulfil the minimal requirements for housing as indicated by the EU directives 2010/63/EU and 2007/526/EC. Illustrations of the enriched and non-enriched pens are provided in Fig 1.\n\n    At day 0 (placement), all broilers were provided with a neck tag for individual identification. House temperature was maintained at 34 C at day 0 and gradually decreased to a constant temperature of 18 C at 40 days of age. Relative humidity was kept between 60% and 80% from 1-7 days of age and between 40% and 60% thereafter. The lighting program used was 24L:0D (day 0), 20L:4D (day 1 to 6) and 18L:6D (from day 7 onward, with a continuous dark period during night). At day 0, chickens were vaccinated against infectious bronchitis (eye drop; MSD Animal Health, Boxmeer, The Netherlands) and at day 11, against Newcastle disease (Clone 30; eye drop, MSD Animal Health, Boxmeer, The Netherlands).\n\n    Feed and water were provided ad libitum for all treatments throughout the whole experiment. Both strains received the same diets with digestible amino acid levels suitable for both strains, based on commercially available diets. A 3-phase feeding program was applied; starter diets were provided from day 0 to 14 (MEbroiler = 2925 kcal/kg, CP = 203 g/kg, dLys = 11.1 g/kg), grower diets from day 14 to 35 (MEbroiler = 2975 kcal/kg, CP = 171 g/kg, dLys = 9.1 g/kg) and finisher diets from day 35 to 38 (for fast-growing chickens) or 35 to 49 (for slower-growing chickens) (MEbroiler = 3025 kcal/kg, CP = 165 g/kg, dLys = 8.6 g/kg). Plant protein based diets were formulated according the energy level and amino acid profile of CVB. Coccidiostats (70 g/kg salinomycin) were added to the grower diet. A protein-fat mixture (consisting of fishmeal and potato protein) (DM = 900 g/kg, ME = 4658 kcal/kg of DM, CP = 419 g/kg of DM, CF = 371 g/kg of DM), with a comparable composition as the BSFL (DM = 350.7 g/kg, ME = 4658 kcal/kg of DM, CP = 419 g/kg of DM, CF = 371 g/kg of DM), was added (mixed with daily feed) to the diet of the non-enriched pens once daily to achieve similar energy and nutrient intake as the broilers in the enriched pens (which received BSFL).\n\n    All chickens were individually weighed on day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 of age. Feed intake (FI) was determined per pen at the same days by subtracting the left-overs in the feeder from the amount of feed provided. Body weight (BW), FI and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated for the three phases and over the whole growing period, taking mortality into account. FI was calculated without BSFL intake of chickens in enriched pens and by excluding the intake of the protein-fat mixture of chickens in non-enriched pens. Mortality was recorded per pen per day. At day 29 and 38, two fast-growing chickens per pen were selected for slaughtering with an average body weight of 1400 and 2200 g, respectively, whereas at day 38 and 49, two slower-growing chickens per pen were selected for slaughtering with the same body weights. Chickens were subjected to electrical stunning without any neck dislocation and decapitation. It was done by a specially designed electrocution device (H2H Euthanizer, Top Equipment B.V., Tiel, The Netherlands). The working principle of the device is passing through the sudden electricity (230 V) into chicken's body for euthanizing. Then, Varus-Valgus (VV) was scored, after fixating the legs at the hip joint to stretch the leg, by determining the angle between the tibia and the metatarsus for both the left (VVL) and right leg (VVR), using a goniometer. Thereafter, the left leg of each chicken was dissected and assessed by a trained poultry veterinarian in post-mortem evaluation on tibia dyschondroplasia (TD), bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO), epiphyseal plate abnormalities (EPA), and epiphysiolysis (EPI). All these leg disorders were scored in the range of 0 (no abnormalities), 1 (minor abnormality) or 2 (severe abnormality).\n\n    Right legs were deboned and tibias were packed and frozen at -20 C. After thawing, tibia weight was determined. Tibia proximal length, lateral cortex thickness, femoral and metatarsal side proximal head thickness, osseous volume, pore volume, total volume (osseous volume + pore volume), volume fraction (osseous volume / total volume), mineral content and mineral density were analysed on individual tibia, using a GE Phoenix 3D X-ray microfocus CT scanner (General Electric Company , Boston, Massachusetts, US); for details see. Illustrations of scanned bones are provided in Fig 2. Robusticity index was calculated using the following formula:\n\n    The same tibia bones used for 3D X-ray scanning were subjected to a three-point bending test, of which the method is described by, using an Instron  electromechanical universal testing machine (Instron , Norwood, Massachusetts, United States). Maximal load of breaking point was used as the tibia ultimate strength; reached yield load just before the angle has changed on slope data was used as the tibia yield strength; the slope of the selected linear part of the curve data was used as the tibia stiffness; the area under the curve of selected region data was used as the tibia energy to fracture. Elastic modulus (GPa), which is the amount of strain as a result of a particular amount of stress, was calculated using the following formula:  where E is the elastic modulus (GPa), N is the maximal load (N), S is the span between bending fixtures (mm), T is the tibia thickness (mm), L is the tibia length (mm), and delta is the maximum deflection (mm) at the midpoint of the bone.\n\n    Gait score of 4 randomly selected chickens per pen was evaluated by an experienced evaluator (blinded to the treatments by carrying the chickens to the observation place and preventing the observer to see the enriched and non-enriched pens) on day 27 (fast-growing chickens) and day 35 (slower-growing chickens), to eliminate BW difference. Gait was scored within a range of 0 (normal locomotion) to 5 (unable to walk). One more observation day for slower-growing chickens was originally planned on day 48 to make the comparison with the fast-growing chickens. However, due to solid Covid-19 rules at the last week of the experiment, this activity was skipped.\n\n    Home pen behaviour (all chickens per pen) and use of enrichment (all chickens per pen in enriched pens) were scored by direct observation of one experienced observer, using instantaneous scan sampling at day 8, 22, 29 and 43. At these days, broilers were observed in their home pen at four moments (8:30, 10:30, 13:00 and 15:00 h). These four scans were considered representative for their behaviour during the day. In enriched pens, half an hour while BSFL feeding was excluded from the observations. To avoid systematic error due to time effect, observation of each round was started from a different pen. On day 43, only slower-growing chickens were present. Per scan per day per pen, behaviour of all chickens was scored during 3 to 4 min. The number of chickens performing the following behaviours was scored: eating, drinking, walking, standing, sitting, comfort behaviour, foraging, dustbathing, ground pecking, aggression and others. Others was defined as chickens demonstrating a behaviour other than all other behaviours described above. After observing the behaviour in a pen, the number of chickens performing the following activities was scored for use of enrichment: chickens on platforms and ramps, chickens under platforms and ramps, dustbathing chickens and chickens perching on barrier.\n\n    All statistical analyses were performed in SAS (Version 9.4, 2013, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, US). Model assumptions were approved at both means and residuals for continuous data. Non-normal distributed data were log-transformed before analyses. Pen was used as the experimental unit for all analyses.\n\n    All growth performance data from day 0 to 35 (BW, FI, FCR, mortality) were subjected to general mixed model analysis, using the MIXED procedure with model 1.  where Y = the dependent variable, mu = the overall mean, enrichment = whether or not pen enrichment was applied (enriched or non-enriched), strain = broiler strain (fast-growing Ross 308 or slower-growing Hubbard JA757), interaction = 2-way interaction between enrichment and strain, E = residual error.\n\n    From day 35 onwards, only chickens from the slower-growing strain were present and growth performance data (BW, FI, FCR, mortality) was subjected to general linear mixed model analysis, using the MIXED procedure with model 2.  where Y = the dependent variable, mu is the overall mean, enrichment = whether or not pen enrichment was applied (enriched or non-enriched), E = residual error.\n\n    Tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical characteristics, at two body weight classes (1400 and 2200 g), were subjected to general linear mixed model analysis, using the MIXED procedure with model 1.\n\n    Home pen behaviour (eating, drinking, walking, standing, sitting, comfort behaviour, foraging, dustbathing, ground pecking, aggression and others) was subjected to general linear mixed model analysis, using the MIXED procedure with model 1 (home pen behaviour at day 8, 22 and 29) and model 2 (home pen behaviour at day 43). Preliminary analyses demonstrated a lack of interaction between strain and enrichment for home pen behaviour and consequently data is presented for only main effects.\n\n    Gait score was assessed, using the GLIMMIX procedure with model 1. Gait score at day 27 (fast-growing chickens) and day 35 (slower-growing chickens), when they had similar body weights, were compared.\n\n    Use of enrichment (chickens on platforms and ramps, chickens under platforms and ramps, dustbathing chickens and chickens perching on barriers) was subjected to general linear mixed model analysis, using the MIXED procedure with model 3.  where Y = the dependent variable, mu is the overall mean, strain = broiler breeder strain (fast-growing Ross 308 or slower-growing Hubbard JA757), E = residual error.\n\n    To eliminate BW effect between the fast and slower-growing strain, home pen behaviour and enrichment use at day 22 for fast-growing chickens and day 29 for slower-growing chickens, when they had similar body weights, were compared, using model 1 (home pen behaviour) or model 3 (enrichment).\n\n    VVR and VVL were subjected to general linear mixed model analysis, at two body weight classes (1400 and 2200 g), using the MIXED procedure with model 1. Leg disorders (TD, EPA, BCO and EPI) were subjected to generalized linear mixed model analysis, at two body weight classes (1400 and 2200 g), using the GLIMMIX procedure with model 1. Leg disorders were scored as 0 (no abnormalities), 1 (minor abnormality), or 2 (severe abnormality), but analyzed as 0 (no abnormalities) or 1 (abnormalities present). EPA, BCO and EPI were not statistically analysed, because there were only three chickens scored with BCO and no observations at all were recorded for EPA and EPI.\n\n    Results are provided as LSmeans +- SEM, unless indicated otherwise. When multiple comparisons were performed, the level of significance was corrected, using Bonferroni. Effects were considered to be significant at P<=0.05.",
        "Results": "    No interaction effects between enrichment and strain were found on BW (Table 1). Chickens in non-enriched pens had a higher BW than chickens in enriched pens at day 21 (Delta = 35 g, P = 0.02), 28 (Delta = 62 g, P = 0.007), 35 (Delta = 99 g, P = 0.003), 42 (slower-growing chickens only; Delta = 84 g, P = 0.003) and 49 (slower-growing chickens only; Delta = 93 g, P = 0.005).

No interaction effects between enrichment and strain or main effects were found on mortality. No chickens were culled.\n\n    At the 1400 g BW class, no interaction effects between pen enrichment and strain were found on tibia morphological characteristics (Table 3) and neither pen enrichment effects were found. Slower-growing chickens had a higher femoral (Delta = 0.17 cm, P = 0.02) and metatarsal side proximal tibia head thicknesses (Delta = 0.12 cm, P = 0.04) than fast-growing chickens. At the 2200 gBW class, no interaction effects between enrichment and strain were found on tibia morphological characteristics (Table 3) and neither pen enrichment effects were found. Slower-growing broilers had a higher tibia weight (Delta = 0.81 g, P = 0.02), proximal tibia length (Delta = 0.63 cm, P = 0.008) and metatarsal side proximal tibia head thicknesses (Delta = 0.17 cm, P = 0.002) than fast-growing broilers.\n\n    At the 1400 g BW class, no interaction effects between pen enrichment and strain were found on tibia biophysical characteristics (Table 4) and neither pen enrichment effects were found. Slower-growing broilers had a higher tibia osseous volume (Delta = 6.4 cm3, P<0.001), tibia total volume (Delta = 6.6 cm3, P<0.001), tibia volume fraction (Delta = 0.04%, P<0.001) and tibia mineral content (Delta = 1.1 g, P<0.001) than fast-growing broilers. At the 2200 g BW class, an interaction between pen enrichment and strain was found on tibia pore volume (Table 4). Enriched slower-growing group resulted in a lower tibia pore volume compared to other three groups (Delta = 1.0 cm3 on average; P = 0.02). Chickens in non-enriched pens had a lower tibia osseous volume (Delta = 1.8 cm3, P = 0.003), tibia total volume (Delta = 1.4 cm3, P = 0.03) and tibia volume fraction (Delta = 0.02%, P = 0.002) than chickens in enriched pens. Slower-growing broilers had a higher tibia osseous volume (Delta = 5.9 cm3, P<0.001), tibia total volume (Delta = 5.4 cm3, P<0.001), tibia volume fraction (Delta = 0.05%, P<0.001), tibia mineral content (Delta = 0.7 g, P = 0.02) and tibia mineral density (Delta = 0.05 g/cm3, P<0.001) than fast-growing broilers.\n\n    At the 1400 g BW class, no interaction effects between pen enrichment and strain were found on tibia mechanical characteristics and neither pen enrichment effects were found (Table 5). Slower-growing broilers had a higher tibia ultimate strength (Delta = 21.7 N, P<0.001), tibia yield strength (Delta = 21.0 N, P<0.001), tibia stiffness (Delta = 20.6 N/mm, P<0.001) and tibia energy to fracture (Delta = 21.9 N-mm, P<0.001) than fast-growing broilers. At the 2200 g BW class, no interaction effects between pen enrichment and strain were found on tibia mechanical characteristics (Table 5) and neither pen enrichment effects were found. Slower-growing chickens had a higher tibia ultimate strength (Delta = 19.4 N, P<0.001), tibia yield strength (Delta = 17.8 N, P<0.001), tibia stiffness (Delta = 21.7 N/mm, P<0.001) and tibia energy to fracture (Delta = 20.9 N-mm, P<0.001) than fast-growing broilers.\n\n    No interaction effects between pen enrichment and broiler breeder strain were found on VVR, VVL and TD at both 1400 and 2200 g BW classes and no main effects of pen enrichment or strain were found on TD. At the 1400 g BW class, VV angulation was not affected by enrichment or strain (on average 4.90o). At the 2200 g BW class, slower-growing chickens had a lower VVR than fast-growing chickens (3.80  vs 6.04 , respectively, P = 0.003). VVL angulation was not affected by enrichment or strain at this BW class (on average 5.88o). No interaction and main effects were found on TD, which was observed in 11 chickens (9.82%) at 1400 g BW class and 10 chickens (8.92%) at 2200 BW class.\n\n    At similar BW class (day 27 for fast-growing chickens and day 35 for slower-growing chickens), no interaction between pen enrichment and strain (P = 0.97) and neither main effects of pen enrichment (P = 0.97) or strain (P = 1.00) were found on gait score.\n\n    Chickens in non-enriched pens showed less foraging behaviour at day 8 (Delta = 8.47%, P<0.001), day 22 (Delta = 9.19%, P<0.001), day 29 (Delta = 5.6%, P<0.001) and day 43 (slower-growing chickens only, Delta = 8.86%, P<0.001), less dust bathing behaviour at day 8 (Delta = 0.97%, P = 0.006) and less ground pecking behaviour at day 43 (slower-growing chickens only, Delta = 3.98%, P = 0.02) than chickens in enriched pens (Table 6). The opposite was found for standing behaviour at day 29 (Delta = 4.15%, P = 0.007), sitting behaviour at day 22 (Delta = 8.97%, P = 0.03), ground pecking behaviour at day 8 (Delta = 3.71%, P = 0.002) and aggression behaviour at day 29 (Delta = 1.05%, P = 0.02), which behaviours were all higher in non-enriched pens than in enriched pens. Slower-growing chickens showed more walking behaviour at day 8 (Delta = 6.99%, P = 0.001), day 22 (Delta = 7.6%, P<0.001) and day 29 (Delta = 5.32%, P<0.001), more standing behaviour at day 8 (Delta = 2.34%, P = 0.03), day 22 (Delta = 3.12%, P = 0.02) and day 29 (Delta = 8.91%, P<0.001), more foraging behaviour at day 22 (Delta = 6.61%, P = 0.009) and day 29 (Delta = 3.9%, P = 0.002) and more aggression behaviour at day 22 (Delta = 0.94%, P = 0.03) and day 29 (Delta = 1.02%, P = 0.03) than fast-growing chickens. The opposite was found for eating behaviour at day 8 (Delta = 3.04%, P = 0.04) and day 22 (Delta = 1.16%, P = 0.03) and sitting behaviour at day 22 (Delta = 19.28%, P<0.001) and day 29 (Delta = 8.91%, P<0.001).\n\n    In enriched pens, a clear strain effect was found on use of different enrichment objects (Table 7). The percentage of chickens on platforms and ramps at day 29 (Delta = 14.6%, P<0.001) and perching on barriers at day 8 (Delta = 4.9%, P<0.001), day 22 (Delta = 14.05%, P<0.001) and day 29 (Delta = 16.05%, P<0.001) was higher in slower-growing chickens than in fast-growing chickens. The opposite was found for the percentage chickens under platforms and ramps at day 29 (Delta = 13.72%, P = 0.003) and dustbathing chickens at day 8 (Delta = 1.19%, P = 0.05).\n\n    At similar BW, slower-growing chickens showed more walking (Delta = 5.24%), standing (Delta = 8.6%), foraging (Delta = 2.67%), dust bathing (Delta = 0.12%) and aggression (Delta = 1.02%) behaviour than fast-growing chickens, while the opposite was found for eating (Delta = 0.62%), drinking (Delta = 1.54%), sitting (Delta = 11.93%) and comfort (Delta = 2.32%) behaviour. At similar BW, more slower-growing chickens were on platforms and ramps (Delta = 11.27%) and perching on barriers (Delta = 16.1%) than fast-growing chickens, whereas the opposite was found for percentage of chickens under platforms and ramps (Delta = 4.98%) and dustbathing chickens (Delta = 0.03%).",
        "Conclusion": "    In both slower and fast-growing chickens, tibia biophysical characteristics were positively influenced by comprehensive pen enrichment, while tibia morphological and mechanical characteristics were not affected, suggesting that pen enrichment particularly affects physiological mechanisms related to ossification and mineralization. Slower-growing chickens showed better tibia characteristics, active behaviours and higher tendencies to use enrichment objects than fast-growing chickens. Pen enrichment resulted in lower body weight gain in both fast and slower-growing chickens. The relationship between tibia development and leg health remains unclear, because of the very low incidence of leg disorders in the current study.",
        "Discussion": "    The aim of this study was to investigate effects of a combination of different forms of pen enrichment on tibia characteristics, locomotion, leg health and home pen behaviour of both fast and slower-growing broiler chickens. Hardly any interactions were found between strain and enrichment, indicating that both fast and slower-growing chickens are both able to use several forms of enrichment in a comparable way.\n\n    Results of the current study showed that pen enrichment resulted in lower body weight and higher FCR in both fast and slower-growing chickens. These findings are supported by recent studies, who observed a negative effect of pen enrichment on growth performance. In an earlier comparable study, pen enrichment resulted in lower body weight, but also in a higher FI and a lack of effect on FCR. In the latter study, the FI of the non-enriched pens included the protein-fat mixture, where this was excluded in the current study. Results of current study are not in accordance with other studies, who found no significant effects of pen enrichment on any growth performance parameters. This discrepancy among studies might be related to the fact that less complex pen enrichment forms were used in these studies compared to the current study. For example, only barrier perches and mirror, ball, perch and dust (each material in another pen) were used in these studies. The lower body weight gain of enriched-housed broilers in the current experiment might be related to 1) the comprehensive enrichment design of the current study, which contains a combination of platforms, angular ramps, barrier perches, large distance between feed and water and live Black Soldier fly larvae in the moss-peat dust bathing area. A plethora of different enrichments might exponentially stimulate physical activity and consequently a higher metabolic energy use, which will result in a lower body weight gain. This higher activity in enriched pens is supported by the higher percentage of chickens showing active behaviours and use of enrichment in both fast and slower-growing chickens. 2) Chickens might have had difficulties to cross the barrier perches to access the feed on one side and water on the other side. This might be due to other chickens perching and consequently blocking the way from one side of the pen to the other side. It might also be related to their heavy body weight, particularly in the last week of the rearing period. Whether or not a more balanced pen enrichment might have comparable stimulatory effects on activity, while maintaining performance, needs to be investigated.\n\n    Regarding the strain, in the current study, body weight and feed intake of fast-growing chickens were higher than slower-growing broiler chickens on same ages, which is in accordance with previous studies. Due to a use of very young broiler breeders, body weight gain and BW at slaughter was relatively low, which might have resulted in a low prevalence of leg disorders as well (see below).\n\n    One of the most important underlying reasons for suboptimal bone development in broiler chickens is high growth rate, while low activity levels is the other one. The hypothesis of this study was that leg health and bone characteristics in broiler chickens can be improved through pen enrichment, which has previously been confirmed by several studies. Focusing on bone properties, a higher activity has been found to positively affect tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical characteristics of chickens. A large distance between feed and water resulted in increased walking activity and better tibia development in broiler chickens. Barrier perches resulted in improved tibia characteristics of laying hens. Using sand as a dustbathing material and addition of strings for activity stimulation resulted in better bone development in fast-growing broiler chickens.\n\n    The results of the current study showed that tibia osseous volume, total volume and volume fraction of both fast and slower-growing broiler chickens and tibia pore volume of slower-growing chickens only were positively affected by pen enrichment, while the other tibia characteristics did not differ between enrichment treatments. These findings are in agreement with previous studies, indicating the stimulating effects of pen enrichment on bone characteristics. Tibia characteristics were found correlated with leg disorders and locomotion. Chickens with advanced tibia characteristics showed better locomotion and less leg disorders. In the current study, it can be suggested that bone mineral deposition is the most stimulated physiological mechanism by pen enrichment, whereas tibia morphological and mechanical characteristics, such as tibia weight, length, strength and stiffness, were not affected. It can be hypothesized that stimulated activity due to pen enrichment particularly affects physiological pathways involved in ossification and mineralization, rather than affecting anatomical and physical tibia characteristics.\n\n    Regarding the strain, almost all tibia morphological, biophysical and mechanical characteristics in both body weight classes were higher in slower-growing chickens than in fast-growing chickens. These findings are in line with previous studies, indicating that slower-growing chickens demonstrate better bone characteristics in all ages compared to fast-growing chickens. Fast-growing chickens have more porous and less mineralized leg bones than slower-growing broiler chickens, which together with a higher body weight results in a higher risk of lameness, impaired activity and locomotion and more leg problems.\n\n    In the current study, the incidence of TD did not differ between pen enrichment, nor between strains, while other leg disorders (BCO, EPA and EPI) were hardly or not observed. These results might be explained by a relatively low stocking density (10 chickens/m2), which is related to a low prevalence of leg disorders. The low stocking density was used according to the EU legislation 2010/63/EU. Additionally, BW of the chickens was relatively low, probably related to the use of offspring from young broiler breeders. VV angulation in right legs was found to be higher in fast-growing chickens than in slower-growing chickens. These results are in line with previous studies, indicating that growth rate plays an important role on the prevalence of VV. This might be explained by irregular and poor vascular morphology of the epiphyseal growth plate and insufficiently mineralized bones in fast-growing broiler chickens. Slower-growing chickens, on the contrary, have more time for bone mineralization, which compensates the lack of mineralization in the early growth phase, that loads less stress on the skeleton, and eventually result in a low incidence of VV. Despite the fact that VV angulation in right legs differed between strains in the current study, the maximal average angulation was 6.04o and it can be disputed whether or not this degree of angulation can be considered as VV or as a leg disorder. Stimulating locomotion by pen enrichment might be more beneficial for fast-growing chickens, since they have less advanced bone development and poorer leg health than slower-growing chickens. However, in the current study no differences between treatments were found on gait score.\n\n    Results of home pen behaviour showed that broiler chickens in enriched pens demonstrated higher or a tendency to higher percentages of active behaviours (e.g., standing, walking, foraging) and lower percentages of passive behaviours (e.g., comfort behaviour, sitting) than chickens in non-enriched pens. This is in accordance with previous studies, indicating that pen enrichment may stimulate physical activity. Placing horizontal platforms, angular ramps and barrier perches resulted in stimulated activity in broiler chickens. Using wooden boxes with peat for dust bathing, two platforms with ramps and two bales of peat as a pen enrichment resulted in more wing flapping, wing stretching, body shaking, ground scratching, ground pecking and foraging behaviours in fast-growing broiler chickens compared to non-enriched pens. Scattering mealworms and Black Soldier fly larvae on the litter in fast-growing broiler chickens resulted in increased physical activity and locomotion. A large distance between feeder and drinker as a pen enrichment also resulted in a high percentage of active behaviours. Different dustbathing materials, such as moss-peat have also been found to contribute to activity of broiler chickens.\n\n    In the current study, slower-growing broiler chickens demonstrated higher or tendency to higher percentages of active behaviours (e.g., standing, walking, foraging) and lower percentages of passive behaviours (e.g., comfort behaviour, sitting) at all observation days and also on similar body weights (day 22 for fast-growing chickens and day 29 for slower-growing chickens) than fast-growing chickens. In addition, use of enrichment objects differed between fast and slower-growing broiler chickens. The most attention-grabbing difference was observed in chickens perching on barriers. A considerably higher percentage of slower-growing chickens were found perching on barriers compared to fast-growing chickens at all ages and also at the same body weight. Slower-growing chickens also showed a higher or a tendency to higher preference to go on ramps and platforms, while fast-growing chickens preferred to stay under the platforms and ramps. These findings are in in line with previous studies showing slower-growing chickens demonstrated more active behaviours than fast-growing chickens. Fast-growing broiler chickens showed higher percentages of time sitting idle and lower percentages of time standing and walking than slower-growing chickens. Slower-growing chickens have been found to use perches more than fast-growing chickens. It has been shown that fast-growing broiler chickens showed a preference for lying and sitting on the litter instead of using raised platforms and perches. All these findings might be due to the imbalance between high growth rate and immature bones of fast-growing chickens than slower-growing chickens, which negatively affects standing, particularly at higher body weights, walking and foraging behaviours. This makes fast-growing chickens have more difficulties with barrier perches to access feed and water, to climb and go down on angular ramps than the slower-growing chickens. Another potential reason for these differences between strains might be related to body weight and heavy breast muscles. However, the current study clearly demonstrates that at the same BW class, still differences in activity related behaviours were present between the fast and slower-growing chickens, which suggests that other aspects than BW appears to play a role as well.",

        "Title": "    Co-administration of alcohol and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in male Sprague Dawley rats: a study on testicular morphology, oxidative and cytokines perturbations",
        "Abstract": "    Alcohol consumption alongside combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has attracted research interest, especially because of increasing male infertility. This study investigated the combined effects of alcohol and cART on testicular morphology, biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Rats, weighing 330-370 g, were divided into four groups of six animals each; control, alcohol treated (A), cART, and alcohol plus cART treated (A+cART). Following 90 days treatment period, animals were euthanized, testis extracted, and routinely processed for histology and immunohistochemical analysis. Significantly decreased epithelial area fraction, increased luminal and connective tissue area fractions, and reduction of epithelial height and spermatocyte number, were recorded in the treated groups compared to control. Extensive seminiferous epithelial lesions including widened intercellular space, karyolysis, and sloughing of germinal epithelium were recorded in all the treated groups. Furthermore, upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, interleukin-6, and caspase 3 recorded in treated animals, was more significant in A+cART group. Also, the levels of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were more elevated in A and cART treated groups than in A+cART, while MDA was significantly elevated in cART and A+cART treated groups compared to control group. Altogether, the results indicate testicular toxicity of the treatments. It is concluded that consuming alcohol or cART induces oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in testis of rats, which lead to testicular structural and functional derangements, which are exacerbated when alcohol and cART are consumed concurrently. The result will invaluably assist clinicians in management of reproductive dysfunctions in male HIV/AIDS-alcoholic patients on cART.",
        "Introduction": "    Male infertility incidence is rising steadily worldwide and accounts for more than 50% of infertility cases. Equally, there is a worldwide increase in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and alcohol abuse. For instance, about 33% of South African (SA) population consumes alcohol regularly and the SA's average consumed alcohol per capita (APC) almost doubles the global average APC. Equally, the country is burdened with high HIV prevalence and has the biggest combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) program globally. Currently, cART prophylaxis is encouraged among healthcare workers following accidental needle prick, and amongst prostitutes and individuals after unsafe and casual sex with unknown persons or HIV infected individuals. While the influence of alcohol on risky sexual activity is associated with an increase in the spread of HIV infection and the consequent use of cART, many HIV patients on cART therapy continue to consume alcohol regularly for euphoric purposes. Furthermore, alcohol has been associated with reduced viral suppression dose-dependently; aggravated HIV progression, and reduced cART efficacy.\n\n    Alcohol and cART have each been shown to have negative long-term consequences on both male and female reproductive organs and other body systems. Excessive alcohol consumption is reckoned as a leading cause of male impotence and infertility. Several testicular and sexual dysfunctions have been reported in habitual/chronic alcohol consumers. Also, cART has been shown to alter reproductive hormones and sperm parameters. A reduction in testosterone levels, sperm concentration, and DNA integrity have been implicated in long-term use of cART. Only two reports in literature have shown adverse effects of alcohol and cART interaction on testicular histology. The present study evaluated specifically the impact of this interaction on Sertoli and Leydig cells and immunohistochemical localization of the oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers to further delineate possible physio-biochemical impact of alcohol plus cART treatment on the testis. Currently, increasing HIV infection and male infertility are reported among reproductive age individuals, with high desire for procreation, and might also be regular alcohol consumers. This implies increased alcohol and cART interaction amongst the age group, making their reproductive health a huge health concern. Against this backdrop, this study evaluated testicular toxicity associated with concurrence of alcohol and cART in the body using HIV-naive male rat model to mimic conditions of cART regimen.",
        "Methods": "    These were procured from different reliable sources. A combination antiretroviral drug (Atripla) consisting of 600 mg of Efavirenz, 300 mg Tenofovir disproxil Fumurate, and 245 mg Emtricitabine was procured from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences. Rabbit polyclonal for primary antibodies interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) (ab2105), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (ab6671), and caspase 3 (ab4051), rabbit monoclonal for primary antibody inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (ab115819), and mouse monoclonal for primary antibodies interleukin-6 (IL-6) (ab9324), malondialdehyde (MDA) (ab243066), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) (ab62623) were procured from Abcam . Whilst biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (BA-1000) and goat anti-mouse (BA-9200) secondary antibodies, and Avidin-Biotin Complex kit (ABC) (PK-6100) were procured from Vector Laboratories.\n\n    This study was approved by the Animal Research Ethics committee (AREC) (approval number: 2018/011/58/C) of University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) and all experiments were conducted at the Wits Research Animal Facility in compliance with the guidelines set forth by AREC.\n\n    Twenty-four adult male Sprague Dawley rats (10 weeks old), weighing between 330-370 g were used in the study. Each rat was separately housed under sterile conditions in a plastic cage. Animals were fed on normal rat chow and water ad libitum and were maintained at 21 C-23 C room temperature, with lighting conditions of 12/12-hour light/dark cycle.\n\n    Animals were divided into four groups of six rats each as follows; control group, received no treatment; alcohol group (A), which received 10% v/v alcohol in drinking water daily; the cART group, received extrapolated human equivalent dose of 23 mg/kg of cART (consisting of efavirenz 600 mg+emtricitabine 200 mg+tenofovir 245 mg) in gelatine cubes daily; and alcohol plus cART group (A+cART), received both alcohol and cART daily at same doses indicated above. After 90 days of treatment, the animals were weighed, anesthetized with 240 mg/ml pentobarbitone dose, and sacrificed. The animals were perfused with 2 ml/min of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) in 0.9% saline and the testes were harvested, weighed, and the wet weight recorded and thereafter fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histology and further analysis.\n\n    The weight of the testes was recorded immediately after their extraction using an electronic scale (Kern PCB 200-2 weighing scale). Testis volume was determined using the Archimedes principle of water displacement in a measuring cylinder. The initial volume (Vi) of distilled water in a graduated cylinder was recorded, and then the final volume (Vf) was determined after adding the testis to the graduated cylinder containing the known amount of distilled water. The volume of the testis (Vt) was calculated by subtracting the initial volume from the final volume as shown below.\n\n    A sliding digital Vernier caliper was used to measure the width and length of the testes, as described by Parhizkar et al.. Testis size was then calculated using the formula below.\n\n    The fixed testes were dehydrated sequentially in 70%-100% alcohol grades and embedded in molten paraffin wax and serially sectioned at 5 mum thickness. The sections were stained with H&E and examined using the Axioskop 2 plus light microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ci, 104C type). Photomicrographs of testicular tissue sections were obtained using a linked computerized Zeiss digital image system, the AxioCam 208 color (Zeiss group) for morphometric assessment. Six camera fields from 4 sections per animal, from six animals per group (i.e., 144 images per group) were captured and used for morphometry and analysis.\n\n    Testicular component (epithelial, luminal, connective tissue, and interstitial space) area fractions were determined using Fiji 84-intersection grid. The grid was superimposed on H&E-stained images captured at x100 and the intersecting points for each component were counted. The average intersecting points for each testicular component were calculated in 144 microscopic field images per group and each testicular component area fraction was determined using the formula below.\n\n    Seminiferous tubule area (TA), tubule diameter (TD), epithelium height (EH), and luminal diameter (LD) were measured in 50 round or nearly round seminiferous tubules for each animal (i.e., 300 tubules per group) using Fiji software. The seminiferous TA was determined by tracing around the seminiferous tubule using the Fiji freehand selection tool. The average TD and epithelial height were calculated using the minor and major axes measurements. To exclude longitudinal tubules, an average TD was considered only if D1/D2 >=0.85, a value of D1/D2=1.0 representing a perfectly rounded circle.\n\n    The number of the different germinal epithelium cells (Sertoli, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, round, and elongated spermatids) were counted in H&E-stained sections at x400. Ten rounded seminiferous tubules (stage VII) for each animal were considered (i.e., 60 tubules per group).\n\n    Using Fiji software, diameters (D) of fifty Leydig nuclei with distinct nucleoli were measured for each animal on H&E-stained images captured at x400. The nuclear volume (an important parameter in a variety of cell functions) was determined in accordance with previously reported methods, with the formula below.\n\n    Spermatogenesis was classified in 50 stage II-VII seminiferous tubules per animal (i.e., 300 tubules per group) using Johnsen's testicular score. Each tubule was assigned a score from 10 to 1, accordingly, thereafter the number of tubules for an individual score was multiplied by the score, and then the total for all the scores was divided by 50 (the total number of tubules scored) to obtain the mean Johnsen's score per group for further analysis.\n\n    The modified Johnsen scoring criteria used is shown in Table 1.\n\n    Testicular H&E-stained sections were examined for the presence of histological changes. Observed changes were graded in 24 microscopic fields (six fields from each of the four sections) for each animal (i.e., 144 fields per group). The changes in each field were semi-quantitatively categorized into five grades as follows; grade 4=very severe (change seen in >75% of the field), grade 3=severe (change seen in >50% <75% of the field), grade 2=moderate (change seen in >25% <50% of the field), grade 1=mild (change seen in <25% of the field), and grade 0=none (no change in the field) as previously reported by Erpek et al..\n\n    Testicular tissue sections were mounted on silane-coated slides for antibody immunolabeling. Assessment of oxidative stress using iNOS, MDA, and 8-OHDG, inflammation (IL-1beta), TNF-alpha, and IL-6, and caspase 3 for apoptosis were carried out. The sections were incubated in citrate buffer overnight in a water bath at 60 C for antigen retrieval. Then, the endogenous peroxidase was inhibited using 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 minutes. After rinsing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for three changes of five minutes each, 5% normal goat serum was added to the sections to block nonspecific antibody binding. This was tapped off after 30 minutes, and the primary antibody was added subsequently (1:100 for anti-TNF-alpha and anti-iNOS, 1:200 for anti-IL-1beta, anti-IL-6, anti-MDA, and anti-caspase 3, and 1:1,000 for anti-8-OHDG) and left overnight (approximately 16 hours) at 4 C. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (1:1,000 biotinylated goat anti-rabbit for the IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and caspase 3 antibodies and 1:1,000 biotinylated goat anti-mouse for IL-6, MDA, and 8-OHDG antibodies) for 30 minutes. Then, after rinsing in PBS, ABC reagent was added for 30 minutes. Afterward, the sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB) for five minutes. DAB was then washed off under running tap water for five minutes and the slides were dipped in hematoxylin for one minute to counter stain. Followed by rinsing in running tap water to remove excess stain, dehydration of slides in alcohol series, and coverslipped with Dibutylphthalate Polystyrene Xylene. The images of antibodies with immunoreactivity localized to both cell nucleus and cytoplasm (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and MDA) were captured in 24 microscopic fields at x100 for each animal (i.e., 144 sections per group) and were segmented using the ilastik pixel classification workflow. Fiji was used for quantification of the ilastik exported image segments to extract numerical data for statistical analysis. Details of image segmentation and quantification are shown in Appendix 1-2. The percentage area of expression for antibodies was calculated using the formula below.\n\n    For the antibodies with immunoreactivity localized to cell nuclei (IL-6, 8-OHDG, and caspase 3), the total number of cell nuclei expressing immunoreactivity were counted in 20 rounded stage VII seminiferous tubules for each animal (i.e., 120 tubules for each group).\n\n    GraphPad Prism 6 windows software was used for data analysis. Data were expressed as Mean+-SEM. Group means of parametric data were compared using a one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. Non-parametric data (Johnsen's and histological change scores) were compared using Kruskall Wallis, followed by Dunn's post hoc test. Deeming a P-value of <0.05 statistically significant.",
        "Results": "    All treated groups (A, cART, and A+cART) showed a non-significant decrease in testis weights, testis volume, and testis size in comparison with the control (Table 2).\n\n    The epithelial area fraction (EAF) of treated groups significantly reduced compared to the control, (A, P=0.0012; cART, P=0.0078; and A+cART, P<0.0001) (Table 2). The luminal area fraction (LAF) of cART group decreased significantly compared to control (P=0.0123), A (P=0.0059) and A+cART (P<0.0001), but was significantly increased in A+cART compared to control (P=0.0141). The connective tissue and interstitial space area fractions (CTAF and ISAF respectively) of all the treated groups (A, cART, and A+cART) were increased compared to the control. The increase was significant in CTAF of all treated groups (A: P=0.0017, cART: P<0.0001, and A+cART: P<0.0001) and in ISAF of A (P=0.0008) and cART (P=0.0003) groups. Furthermore, CTAF of cART and A+cART treated groups was significantly higher when compared with group A (P=0.0110 and P=0.0038 respectively), while ISAF of A+cART group was significantly reduced compared to A (P=0.0025) and cART (P=0.0010) groups (Table 2).\n\n    All seminiferous tubule measured parameters (area, diameter, epithelium, and lumen) were decreased in all treated groups compared to control, except for lumen of A+cART treated that increased non-significantly (P>0.05) (Table 3). TA and diameter significantly decreased (P<0.0001) in A, cART, and A+cART treated groups relative to control. The TA of cART treated group significantly decreased compared to A treated group (P=0.0413). In addition, TA and diameter were significantly higher in A+cART than in A (P=0.0155 and 0.0089 respectively) and cART (P<0.0001) groups. In comparison with the control group, the epithelial height of groups A, cART, and A+cART decreased significantly (P=0.0002, 0.0001, and 0.0001 respectively) while the LD of A+cART group increased significantly (P=0.0013). However, the LD of cART group was significantly decreased compared to control (P=0.0340), A (P=0.0004), and A+cART (P<0.0001) treated groups.\n\n    The results are as shown in Table 3. The mean number of spermatogonia increased significantly in A and cART-treated groups (P<0.0001and P<0.0002 respectively) relative to control but was significantly decreased in A+cART (P=0.0032) relative to A group. However, spermatocytes were significantly reduced in cART and A+cART groups compared to control, (P=0.0043 and P=0.0007 respectively). Both round and elongated spermatids decreased significantly (P<0.0001) in all treated groups compared to the control. Furthermore, a non-significant decrease (P>0.05) in the number of Sertoli cells was found in all the treated groups (A, cART, and A+cART) compared to control.\n\n    Leydig cell nuclear diameter and volume decreased significantly (P<0.0001) in all the treated groups (A, cART, and A+cART) compared to control (Table 3).\n\n    Johnsen's score was used to profile the progress/status of spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules. Compared to the control, a significant reduction in Johnsen's score was recorded in A (P=0.0115) and A+cART groups (P=0.0256) (Table 4).\n\n    The most common histological changes observed were lifting of germinal epithelium, widened intercellular space, and karyolysis (Fig. 1) and were different across the groups (Table 4). However, the difference in epithelial lifting was not significant across the groups but widened intercellular space was significantly higher in A+cART (P=0.0029) compared to control group. Additionally, karyolysis in cART and A+cART groups was significantly high when compared to the control group (P=0.0081 and 0.0346 respectively). Furthermore, seminiferous tubule shrinkage was observed in all treated groups, with sloughing of germinal epithelium into the lumen recorded in A+cART treated animals.\n\n    Oxidative stress markers immunoreactivity (Fig. 2) was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of macrophages and Leydig cells for both iNOS and MDA. While 8-OHDG immunoreactivity was localized in the spermatogenic cell nuclei and residual bodies. All treated groups (A, cART, and A+cART) demonstrated a significant increase (P<0.0001) in expression of iNOS and 8-OHDG relative to the control group (Fig. 2). A significant increase of MDA expression was detected in cART and A+cART groups relative to the control group (P<0.0001) and in cART and A+cART groups relative to group A (P<0.0001 and P=0.0302 respectively) (Fig. 2).\n\n    Expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and caspase 3 were as presented in Fig. 3. IL-1beta expression was significantly elevated (P<0.0001) in A and cART treated groups compared to the control. But the expression of IL-1beta in cART and A+cART treated groups was significantly decreased relative to A treated group (P=0.0006 and P<0.0001 respectively) and significantly decreased (P<0.0001) in A+cART compared to cART. Although, the expression of TNF-alpha was increased in all the treated groups against the control, the increase was only significant in A treated animals (P=0.0001). Further, the expression TNF-alpha in A group increased significantly (P=0.0011) compared to A+cART treated group. IL-6 was significantly upregulated (P<0.0001) in all treated groups (A, cART, and A+cART) compared to the control. Whilst caspase 3 expression significantly increased in A (P=0.0023), cART (P<0.0001), and A+cART (P<0.0001) groups relative to control. Further, caspase 3 expression in A+cART group was significantly higher in comparison to A (P<0.0001) and cART (P=0.0013) treated groups (Fig. 3).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Infertility is a worrisome reproductive health problem in families globally with a soaring prevalence of male infertility. The chronic use of combined antiretroviral (cART) blended with alcohol abuse has introduced new variables in male reproductive dysfunctions. Moreover, a high incidence of alcohol use among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and on cART has also been reported. Markedly, cART and alcohol have individually been reported to negatively impact the male reproductive system and thus their concomitant use may pose major reproductive dysfunctional challenges, particularly amongst PLWHA that desire to have biological children, which is a critical societal necessity.\n\n    The result from this study showed non-significant decrease in testicular weight, volume, and size across the treatment groups compared to the control group which is consistent with previous reports and may suggest minimal perturbations of testicular architecture. However, the significantly decreased EAF, and the significantly increased LAF in A+cART treated group point to perturbations of testicular structure and cellular coherency. Furthermore, the significant increases in ISAF in A and cART treated groups and non-significant in the A+cART treated group may suggest specific treatment effects and the impact of the A+cART interaction on this parameter. Overall, these changes in the histological component of the testis reflect an alteration of the integrity of testicular morphology, pointing to disruption of the normal testicular paracrine/autocrine factors (such as cytokines) involved in regulation of spermatogenesis and consequently will lead to a decline in spermatogenesis.\n\n    Furthermore, the increased number of spermatogonia (proliferation of spermatogenesis) observed in testis of the alcohol and cART treated groups, could be an attempt to increase the germ cell pool so as to counteract the diminishing spermatogenesis processes which is in line with a previous clinical study that reported a massive increase in the number of normally differentiated spermatogonia and elevated spermatogonia proliferative activity in a biopsy of patient with non-obstructive azoospermia. Additionally, the (LAF and diameter (LD) were both slightly increased in the A group but significantly increased in the A+cART group, suggesting varying degrees of germ cell layer reduction due to different treatments as well as seminiferous tubule shrinkage.\n\n    Notably, tubular shrinkage was depicted by the significant reduction in TA and TD in testis of treated groups (A, cART, and A+cART), and was consistent with previous findings. However, LAF and LD were also significantly decreased in the treated groups except in cART group regardless of the diminished EAF, EH, and germinal epithelium cell layers. This could have been due to the prominent seminiferous tubule shrinkage observed in cART treated group which also recorded the greatest reductions in TA and TD. Further, shrunken seminiferous tubules are suggestive of tubule degenerative changes induced by the treatments and subsequently result in germ cell death. Accordingly, shrinkage of the seminiferous tubules resulted in an increase in ISAF in the treated groups compared to the control animals.\n\n    Equally, a significant increment in CTAF was recorded in the testis of treated animals, suggesting formation of fibrosis in the testis interstitium. Our findings go in line with that of a previous study that reported fibrosis led to increase in thickness of the testicular interstitium in the infertile males. Testicular fibrosis usually occurs following testis trauma and inflammation amongst others. Fibrosis impairs the integrity of the testicular interstitium and alters the structure and function of the interstitial cells (Leydig, macrophages, and myoid cells), and consequently adversely affects testicular structure and function.\n\n    Furthermore, the number of Sertoli cells was not significantly reduced in the treated animals compared to control animals, suggesting that Sertoli cells were less adversely affected. Previous report indicated that Sertoli cells are resistant to apoptosis compared to germ cells, because they contain high levels of anti-apoptotic markers, Bcl-w and Bcl-xL. It has been reported that while the number of Sertoli cells is not usually affected, disruptions in its structure are relatively common and can alter the cell's functions, the integrity of the blood-testis barrier and consequently lead to dysregulation of spermatogenesis. Though, the present study did not include effects on the Sertoli cell cytoskeleton, previous studies show that its alteration and/or damage leads to sloughing of germ cells into the lumen and separation of germinal epithelium from the basement membrane, which were both observed in treated animals in the current study.\n\n    However, Leydig cell nuclear diameter and volume in testis of treated animals were significantly reduced relative to the control animals and may imply disturbances of Leydig cell function. The nucleus is the lifeline of the cell, and a previous study showed that quantitative measurements of the nucleus is important in understanding the cell's response to injury and further reported that nuclear volume correlates strongly with cell volume and function. Leydig cells are present in the testis interstitium, and synthesize androgens via steroidogenesis. Therefore, shrinkage of the nucleus will ultimately affect the Leydig cell's steroidogenic capacity and subsequently lead to disruption of spermatogenesis.\n\n    Additionally, in parallel with previous findings, Johnsen's score of the treated groups was reduced compared with the control animal group. Reduction in Johnsen's score is linked to interruption of normal germ cell maturation, germ cell layer loss, and tubule lesions. Also, seminiferous tubule germinal epithelium lesions such as lifting of epithelium, widened interstitial space, karyolysis, and sloughed germ cells were more evident in the treated groups compared to control animal group, which supports the reduction in Johnson's score recorded in treated groups. This result confirm testicular toxicity of the treatments (alcohol or/and cART).\n\n    Oxidative stress is a common feature in most male reproductive system dysfunctions, occurring as a result of an imbalance between rate of production and clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). High ROS levels have been reported in 30%-80% of infertile males. Our findings showed upregulation of oxidative stress markers i.e., iNOS, MDA, and 8-OHDG in the testis of treated animals. This indicates that alcohol, cART, and their combination induced oxidative stress in the testis. Reports show that iNOS upregulation leads to increased ROS formation, ROS have been shown to induce lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation in the testis. These are the most common consequences of testicular oxidative stress resulting into increased MDA and 8-OHDG formation respectively. Previous studies have reported that ROS-induced lipid peroxidation is implicated in male reproductive dysfunction, due to substantial amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in the testis tissue.\n\n    Reportedly, elevation of ROS stimulates release of several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 mostly via the nuclear factor-kappa beta pathway. In the testis, cytokines are majorly derived from interstitial macrophages, but Leydig and Sertoli cells also secrete cytokines. Studies show that during testicular injury, activated macrophages, Leydig, and Sertoli cells produce a high concentration of cytokines and iNOS. In consonance with the above, the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in the present study may adversely affect the process of spermatogenesis, as reported by previous studies. Somade et al. found that elevated cytokine levels in testis and kidney of Wistar albino rats, was associated with testiculo-renal toxicosis following acute administration of edible camphor. Additionally, testicular cytokines have been shown to affect germ cell proliferation, as well as Leydig and Sertoli cells functions and secretions. This study findings show that oxidative stress and inflammation are interlinked mechanisms associated with germ cell apoptosis, which might underlie the multidimensional changes observed in testis of animals treated with alcohol or/and cART.\n\n    Overall, the study has revealed some important findings in testicular toxicity of the treatments relative to the parameters studied. Interestingly, though the levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and MDA were elevated in A+cART treated group compared to control animals but comparatively were not as elevated as that of IL-6, iNOS, 8-OHDG, and caspase 3 expression in A+cART treated group. These results suggest possible effect of cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway involved in the metabolism of alcohol and cART, resulting in reduction of the level of these parameters (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and MDA) in A+cART treated group. Additionally, it may suggest a variation in the effects of different treatment on the studied parameters.\n\n    In conclusion, our results show that consumption of alcohol or cART can cause perturbations in the testis morphometric parameters and seminiferous tubule lesions via upregulation of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, consumption of alcohol and cART concurrently can exacerbate testicular damage. The findings from this study are invaluable for the clinical management of male fertility challenges that could emerge in PLWHA on cART therapy who consume alcohol regularly.\n\n    Author Contributions\n\n    Conceptualization: EO, EFM.

        "Abstract": "    The G protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (Smo) is a central signal transducer of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway which has been linked to diverse forms of tumours. Stimulated by advancements in structural and functional characterisation, the Smo receptor has been recognised as an important therapeutic target in Hh-driven cancers, and several Smo inhibitors have now been approved for cancer therapy. This receptor is also known to be an oncoprotein itself and its gain-of-function variants have been associated with skin, brain, and liver cancers. According to the COSMIC database, oncogenic mutations of Smo have been identified in various other tumours, although their oncogenic effect remains unknown in these tissues. Drug resistance is a common challenge in cancer therapies targeting Smo, and data analysis shows that healthy individuals also harbour resistance mutations. Based on the importance of Smo in cancer progression and the high incidence of resistance towards Smo inhibitors, this review suggests that detection of Smo variants through tumour profiling could lead to increased precision and improved outcomes of anti-cancer treatments.",
        "Introduction": "    The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of transmembrane proteins encoded by 826 genes in the human genome. These receptors play important roles in mediating a plethora of physiological responses. Structurally, all GPCRs are characterised by seven transmembrane alpha-helical regions separated by intra- and extracellular loops. Human GPCRs are split into four classes based on structure and sequence similarity: A (rhodopsin), B (secretin), C (glutamate), and F (Frizzled). Class F consists of Smoothened (Smo) and 10 paralogues of Frizzled, which regulate the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signalling pathways, respectively. Whilst class F remains one of the least structurally characterised subfamilies of GPCR receptors, recent structural insights into Smo have enabled scientists to elucidate certain aspects of its activation and regulation. These findings make Smo the only receptor of its class that has been established as a therapeutic target to date.\n\n    Deregulation of the Hh pathway has been implicated in a broad spectrum of tumours including cancers that form in the liver, breast, pancreas, and skin. In many of these, Smo was recognised as a promising drug target. In some types of cancer, in fact, Smo drives tumour progression. For this reason, Hh-focused drug discovery efforts have predominantly been dedicated to targeting this receptor. Indeed, three small-molecule antagonists of Smo have now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, Smo is the second most variable member of class F GPCRs, with over 200 variants identified in the healthy population. Some of the mutations render Smo resistant to inhibition by therapeutic antagonists thus impairing quality of life through undesirable side effects and making cancer therapy ineffective. Although it has been recognised that polymorphisms of Class A GPCRs may have profound implications for precision medicine, researchers are only beginning to evaluate the role of class F receptors in patient-specific treatment approaches. This review attempts to show that, considering the mutational landscape of Smo and its role in cancer, identification of Smo mutations through tumour genetic screening can enhance diagnosis and guide the choice of medication to ensure the best therapeutic outcomes for cancer patients.\n\n    Human Smo is a 787-residue transmembrane protein encoded by the SMO gene with a structure characteristic of class F GPCRs. It has an extracellular N-terminus segment which contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), followed by the linker (LD) and hinge (HD) domains. The heptahelical transmembrane domain (7TM) consists of 7 transmembrane helices (TM1-7) that are separated by alternating extracellular and intracellular loops (ECLs and ICLs). The flexible C-terminal domain is found on the intracellular side of the membrane (Figure 1a,b).\n\n    Structural studies of Smo have provided clues to the mechanisms underlying Smo regulation. Smo activation is negatively regulated by a 12-pass transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptc). It was originally suggested that the inhibitory effect of Ptc was mediated by direct binding to Smo, although a significant amount of contradicting evidence invalidated this view. It is now established that Ptc exerts its inhibitory effect by limiting the accessibility of lipid-based agonists such as cholesterol and oxysterol in the local membrane environment of Smo. Structural studies have provided empirical evidence for this mode of regulation. For example, a recent crystal structure of Smo clearly shows three ligand-binding pockets of the receptor, two of which are occupied by cholesterol (Figure 1c). The latest cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of lipid-bound Smo also confirms that lipid binding is a major regulator of the receptor's activity. Although lipid binding alone is enough for Smo to acquire its active conformation, another cryo-EM structure has shown that ligand binding can also induce receptor coupling to a heterotrimeric G-protein, Gi. This suggests that Smo can mediate downstream signal transduction through Gi-dependent and Gi-independent mechanisms. Other crystal structures present a variety of binding states of Smo, including conformations where a ligand is only bound to the CRD, both CRD and upper 7TM binding sites, or the upper 7TM only. Thus, the emerging structural evidence highlights the complexity of Smo activation, and the presence of multiple ligand-binding pockets highlights this receptor's inherent druggability.\n\n    Strict regulation of Smo activity is essential to avoid aberrant signalling through the Hh pathway. Although members of Class A GPCRs have well-characterised motifs that play a key role in regulation of receptor activity, the lack of these segments in Smo has delayed elucidation of its molecular switch mechanism until recently.\n\n    A large-scale sequence alignment of mammalian and non-mammalian class F receptors has identified a conserved basic residue R451 in the TM6 of Smo. Analyses of available structures combined with computational modelling have shown that this residue acts as a molecular switch through interactions with the TM7. In its inactive state, R451 forms a network of interactions with residues T534, W535, and W537 found in the lower part of the TM7. In the lipid-bound active conformation, however, these interactions are weakened due to the substantial rearrangement of cytoplasmic regions of the transmembrane helices, particularly in TM5 and TM6 (Figure 2a). Indeed, the previously mentioned cryo-EM structure of G protein-bound Smo shows that the switch from the inactive to active states is accompanied by an increase in the distance between R451 and W535 by 0.5 A. This movement is required to accommodate the alpha5 helix of the Gialpha subunit in order to allow the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of the receptor (Figure 2b).\n\n    Examination of structural rearrangements reveals that the Smo receptor exists in distinct active and inactive conformational states. Interestingly, certain oncogenic mutants such as Smo-W535L mimic the active state to trigger ectopic Hh signalling. The wide variety of structures adopted by Smo could thus facilitate discovery of biased drugs that would target this receptor in a conformation-selective manner.\n\n    Smo is a key player of the Hh pathway which is essential in many physiological processes including tissue patterning, regeneration, and homeostasis. In mammals, Hh signalling is activated by small Hh proteins Sonic, Desert, and Indian. Binding of these ligands to Ptc can induce target gene expression, which is mediated by members of the glioma-associated oncogene (Gli) transcription factor family, via the canonical pathway. Alternatively, Hh ligands can generate a response in a Gli-independent fashion through the non-canonical pathway. Non-canonical signalling can be split into two signalling modes: Smo-independent (type I) and that downstream of Smo (type II). Since the focus of this review is the Smo receptor, only the canonical and Smo-dependent non-canonical pathways will be considered further.\n\n    In the absence of Hh ligands, the levels of Smo in the plasma membrane are low and Ptc indirectly inhibits Smo activity by altering the lipid composition of the cell membrane. Binding of a Hh ligand to Ptc leads to the release of this inhibition. Further activation of the pathway requires translocation of Smo receptors sequestered in the intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane. Thus, prior to the start of Hh signal transduction, inhibition of Smo by Ptc is abolished and the GPCR is enriched in the cell surface membrane.\n\n    In the canonical pathway (Figure 3a), Smo indirectly mediates transcription of Hh target genes through the Gli family of transcription factors. Firstly, increased membrane localisation of Smo receptors is followed by phosphorylation of their C-terminal tails by casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). This causes conformational rearrangements within the receptor which enable it to laterally move to the membrane of primary cilia (PC), long microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the cell. This translocation event is essential for canonical Hh signalling in vertebrates. In the PC, Smo interacts with the Ellis-van Creveld syndrome protein complex (Evc/Evc2) via its phosphorylated C-tail. This triggers the dissociation of the inhibitory suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU) from Gli, resulting in the release of the transcription factor. Gli then enters the nucleus, where it gets converted into its transcriptional activator form GliA which induces transcription of the Hh target genes. In addition to beneficial roles such as adult organ homeostasis and repair, these genes play a role in angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance, as discussed in the following chapter of this review.\n\n    In contrast to the canonical pathway, type II non-canonical Hh signalling (Figure 3b) elicits a more rapid cellular response without any detectable Gli activity. In this pathway, Smo acts as a GPCR, i.e., it mediates the effects of Hh ligands through interactions with the heterotrimeric G protein Gi. When Ptc is bound by a Hh ligand, activated Smo exchanges GDP for GTP in Gi, resulting in the release of the Gbetagamma subunit. The dissociated Gbetagamma subunit induces phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma)-catalysed synthesis of inositol triphosphate (IP3), which triggers Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resulting in calcium spikes. Interestingly, this signalling cascade is the only axis of the non-canonical pathway that requires accumulation of Smo in PC. Additionally, Gbetagamma activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which in turn activates the Rho family small GTPases RhoA and Rac1 that modulate the actin cytoskeleton, thereby promoting migration and fibre formation. Considering the fundamental kinases that are involved in this transduction network, it is not surprising that G protein-mediated signalling through Smo tightly interlinks with other pathways. These include Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR, increased activity of which has been associated with the development of Smo inhibitor resistance and tumour evolution.\n\n    A recently identified Gli-independent signalling cascade presents another piece of evidence that highlights the importance of non-canonical signalling in cancer. It has been shown that Smo-mediated dissociation of Gi contributes to activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells. This is achieved through the recruitment of CARD recruited membrane-associated (CARMA), B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 10 (BCL-10), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) proteins, which triggers a release of NF-kappaB inhibition. This is followed by the translocation of cytosolic NF-kappaB into the nucleus, where it drives the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative target genes that can enhance cancer cell survival. Thus, crosstalk between the Hh and other signalling pathways can amplify the effect of dysregulated Smo-dependent signalling, thereby driving cancer development and progression.\n\n    The observation that Smo has important functions outside of its GPCR-like interactions with Gi has encouraged thorough research into the mechanisms underlying regulation of this receptor. Post-translational modifications are now known to regulate Smo activity, with phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, ubiquitination, and recently discovered cholesterylation having particular regulatory importance, although sumoylation has also been described. Moreover, the binding of small lipid-based molecules has an important regulatory effect on Smo. Alongside protein-protein interactions with Gi, Smo has been found to oligomerise, interact with beta-arrestin and recently with G12, but these aspects of Smo regulation are outside the scope of this review.\n\n    Phosphorylation of the C-tail of Smo by CK1alpha and GRK2 is an essential activation step that induces a conformational change of the receptor and its subsequent enrichment in the PC membrane. In vitro kinase assays with murine Smo led to the identification of specific serine/threonine motifs where phosphorylation takes place, and sequence alignment has shown that these residues are conserved in the human counterpart (Figure 4). Additionally, the same study suggests that an oncogenic form of Smo (R562Q) exhibits increased phosphorylation and basal activity by making the C-terminal tail more accessible to phosphorylation by kinases.\n\n    Another post-translational modification that occurs in Smo is N-glycosylation. Both the N-terminal segment and the extracellular loops harbour N-glycosylation sites (Figure 4). Experiments involving murine Smo have shown that although mutations in these sites have no effect on PC trafficking and canonical signalling, they lead to a diminished ability of Smo to induce non-canonical signalling via Gi. Based on these results, it was suggested that the removal of N-linked glycosylation may lead to certain perturbations in the structure that make the receptor adopt a conformation biased towards canonical signalling. Indeed, there is an increasing amount of evidence indicating that N-glycosylation affects ligand binding in several other members of the GPCR superfamily. Given that some of the glycan acceptor sites are proximal to the CRD and upper 7TM pockets of Smo, it is likely to also be true for this class F receptor. Further elucidation of the role of this modification in Smo regulation will aid the development of biased therapeutic ligands.\n\n    Latest research provides significant evidence for the role of the ubiquitination state of Smo in signalling. Ubiquitination of lysine residues on the cytoplasmic surface of Smo has been implicated in the removal of inactive Smo from PC when Hh signalling is suppressed. In fact, a mouse mutant Smo lacking all lysine residues on its intracellular surface was associated with increased accumulation in cilia and amplified levels of Hh target gene expression. More specifically, conserved lysine residues in the IL3 (corresponding to K430, K440, and K444 in human) were found to be critical for this Hh-independent ciliary accumulation (Figure 4). Therefore, a mutation in one of these residues or nearby regions could dampen ubiquitination and thus removal of Smo from PC, thereby causing pathway activation. Interestingly, one of the previously mentioned oncogenic forms of Smo (W535L) has a mutation near the cytoplasmic surface. This mutant leads to increased receptor accumulation in PC and constitutive activation of the Hh pathway. It appears this mutant mimics the active conformation of the receptor and is therefore not a suitable substrate for ubiquitination by a ubiquitin ligase.\n\n    Although it is well established that Smo is positively regulated by transient interactions with lipid-based agonists in its binding pockets, a recent study revealed an unexpected covalent attachment of a cholesterol molecule in the CRD of Smo in the presence of Hh ligands. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that cholesterylation occurs on D95 (Figure 4). The authors have also demonstrated that loss of this modification failed to activate downstream signalling and reduced ciliary localisation. In a more recent study, the same group confirmed the importance of this modification by observing that mice lacking the cholesterylation site were not able to survive past the embryonic stage. Given the role of this modification in Smo regulation, interfering with cholesterylation of Smo may provide a novel therapeutic avenue to treat Hh-driven cancers.\n\n    Since it was discovered that Ptc inhibits Smo in a catalytic manner rather than by direct protein-protein interaction, multiple lines of evidence suggested that lipid-based small molecules are in fact endogenous ligands of Smo. These activating small molecules include cholesterol and oxysterol, and both have been shown to be efficient for cellular activation of Smo in the absence of Hh ligands. At first, crystal structures showed that cholesterol and oxysterol individually bind the ligand-binding pocket in CRD. More recent structures revealed that these lipid modulators can also bind the 7TM core of Smo, which explains why CRD-devoid Smo still gets activated in response to Hh. Elucidation of the structural basis of Smo modulation by small molecules has enabled the identification of druggable pockets and key residues, which, if mutated, can alter the ligand binding affinity of the receptor.\n\n    In addition to positive regulation by lipid-based ligands, Smo activity was found to be negatively modulated by binding of the natural sterol alkaloid cyclopamine. Like oxysterol and cholesterol, this molecule can bind both the CRD and the TM7 core. Originally, this molecule was considered to have exclusively inhibitory effects on Smo, which was supported by decreased Hh gene expression in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in response to cyclopamine. However, it was also observed that cyclopamine can induce Smo accumulation in PC, indicating agonist-like properties of this compound. Nevertheless, the characterisation of Smo inhibition by cyclopamine led to the development of antagonistic cyclopamine derivatives with increased specificity and pharmacological potency. These include the FDA-approved Smo inhibitors used to treat Hh-driven cancers as well as other synthetic agonists that are currently undergoing clinical trials. These will be considered in the following chapter of this review.\n\n    Although Hh signalling is active predominantly during development, this pathway plays a crucial role in adult tissue maintenance and repair. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that aberrant activation of Smo-mediated signalling can disrupt these processes and trigger tumorigenesis. This is unsurprising since Gli upregulates expression of genes encoding proteins important in cell proliferation (cyclin D, cyclin E), cell survival (Bcl-2), angiogenesis (VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2), metastasis (MMP2, Snail), and regulation of the replicative potential of the cell (TERT). Moreover, Smo-dependent non-canonical signalling can rewire cellular metabolism by increasing cellular Ca2+ levels, which in turn activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key sensor of cellular energetics. This leads to a rapid shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, a well-established feature of cancer.\n\n    Besides the elevated expression of Gli targets and Ca2+ oscillations, signalling downstream of Smo can manifest cancer characteristics in an indirect manner. For example, in vivo experiments have demonstrated that Hh-driven basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cells have decreased accumulation of p53, a key growth suppressor that triggers cell cycle arrest. Aberrant Hh activity has also been suggested to elevate DNA damage responses via crosstalk with the ATR/Chk1 pathway. This was confirmed by the observation that a Smo inhibitor re-sensitises hematopoietic cells to UV-induced bulky DNA lesions. Notably, this study highlights the direct involvement of Smo in DNA damage resistance, one of the main mechanisms underlying genome instability in cancer. Moreover, inhibition of Smo in BCC cells has been linked to increased levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I molecules, surface recognition elements that attract cytotoxic T-cells to tumours. This indicates that constitutive Hh signalling can enable cancers to evade the immune system by dampening cell surface presentation of these important proteins. Finally, although the role of Hh in inflammation is unclear, recent evidence suggests that this pathway plays a role in the initiation of gastric inflammation through elevated SLFN5 expression, which can eventually lead to tumorigenesis in the foregut. Smo can also indirectly stimulate tumour-promoting inflammation by activating NF-kappaB through the previously described non-canonical signalling axis. Thus, multiple lines of experimental evidence indicate that dysregulated signalling through Smo can lead to major cellular alterations underlying the hallmarks of cancer (Figure 5).\n\n    It is thus becoming increasingly clear that Hh signalling has a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Recognition that aberrant Hh signalling can be induced in several ways has led to classification of tumours based on the mechanism of Hh pathway activation. Type I cancers arise independently of the ligand due to activating mutations in SMO or inactivating mutations in PTC or SUFU. Type I tumours harbouring Smo mutants include BCC, basal cell nevus syndrome (BCN), medulloblastoma, meningioma, and HCC, and these will be described in more detail in the next chapter. Type II mode of activation is ligand-dependent and autocrine, meaning that the tumour cell releases Hh ligands which act upon itself. Type III tumour development is also ligand-dependent but paracrine, i.e., Hh ligands are released by stromal cells surrounding the malignancy. Thus, inhibition of the Hh pathway is a very attractive therapeutic approach for tumours that fall under this classification system.\n\n    As Type I cancers arise independently of the ligand, inhibition of ligand binding to Ptc will have no effect on this type of tumours. Therefore, inhibition must take place at the level of Smo or downstream of the receptor to have therapeutic value. Despite the currently active research into Gli inhibitors, the intracellular location of these transcription factors makes the drug discovery efforts more challenging. In contrast, Smo is found on the cell surface membrane, which facilitates interactions with drug molecules found in the extracellular milieu. Furthermore, Smo has several druggable pockets, as described in Section 2.1, which can facilitate the design of a diverse range of synthetic antagonists. Finally, Smo is an actively studied GPCR and complete elucidation of its activation mechanisms will eventually enable the discovery of highly specific and efficient therapeutics. Thus, Smo presents an important class of Hh inhibitors. Importantly, since Smo inhibition would hinder downstream activation of Gli and thus block expression of tumour-associated target genes, Smo antagonists can benefit patients with all three types (I, II, and III) of Hh-driven cancers.\n\n    As of February 2022, three Smo antagonists have been approved by the FDA: GDC-0449 (vismodegib) and LDE-225 (sonidegib) for the treatment of BCC, and PF-04449913 (glasdegib) for acute myeloid leukaemia. Vismodegib, sonidegib, and glasdegib prevent Smo activation by blocking the binding sites of lipid-based agonists, which are found at increased levels in the plasma membrane in the presence of Hh. These small molecule inhibitors are also being investigated for the treatment of other cancers. For example, vismodegib has shown promising results in patients with BCN and medulloblastoma, and is currently undergoing trials for the treatment of pancreatic, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers. Sonidegib trials have also shown encouraging results in individuals with breast cancer, and patients are currently being recruited to investigate the effect of this drug on various types of advanced solid tumours. Moreover, there is active recruitment of patients for clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of glasdegib against advanced soft-tissue sarcomas. Other therapeutic Smo antagonists have not yet been approved and are currently going through clinical trials, with over half of them undergoing Phase II trials (Table 1).\n\n    Rapid advancements in genomics over the last decade have enabled scientists to identify mutations in drug targets and examine effects of these genetic changes on therapeutic outcome. The recognition of the GPCR superfamily as a group of highly variable receptors was brought by a recent analysis of genetic data from over 60,000 unrelated healthy individuals deposited in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), results of which are available on the GPCR database (GPCRdb) website. Given that members of this receptor family are targeted by over 30% of the FDA-approved therapeutics, this finding is likely to facilitate a more personalised, genetics-guided approach to pharmacological inhibition of GPCRs.\n\n    As for Smo, research concerning the effects of its mutations in cancer therapies is in its preliminary stages. Smo mutations can be divided in the following groups: (1) passenger mutations that do not contribute to cancer progression; (2) oncogenic mutations that stabilise the active form of Smo and release it from the inactive state conformational constraints; (3) resistance mutations that prevent effective drug binding. According to the GPCRdb, mutations in the SMO gene are rare across the healthy population, i.e., there is no mutant allele with a frequency of >=0.01. Nevertheless, Smo, which is the only class F GPCR recognised as a drug target, is the second most variable member of its class, with records of 220 variants present in the GPCRdb. Five of these variants are loss-of-function, and 104 were predicted to have a deleterious effect based on their SIFT and PolyPhen scores. Examination of the mutational landscape of SMO shows that regions flanking the 7TM domain are the most mutated, with 8 out of 9 the most frequently occurring mutations located in these segments (Figure 6a, top).\n\n    To compare the mutational landscape of SMO in healthy individuals and cancer patients, relative frequencies of mutations in this gene were calculated using data from the COSMIC database, which stores information on somatically acquired mutations found in human cancer. The histogram (Figure 6a, bottom) indicates that the 7TM domain is more frequently mutated across cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. To account for the bias associated with domain lengths, the average number of mutations per residue in each of the individual transmembrane regions and the flanking segments was calculated for both datasets. Figure 6b confirms that the 7TM domain experiences a higher mutational pressure in the context of cancer, with the exception of TM2. Since this transmembrane region harbours ligand-binding pockets and plays a central role in the conformational rearrangements underpinning receptor activation, increased mutational frequency in 7TM raises the probability of altered receptor function that would favour oncogenesis. On the other hand, a vast majority of the non-silent SMO mutations are missense in nature in both datasets, although nonsense mutations appear to be more prevalent in cancer (Figure 6c).\n\n    In addition to the general statistics, the COSMIC database provides important information on the distribution of somatic mutations in SMO across different tissues. According to the literature, a significant proportion (10%) of BCC tumours occur due to gain-of-function mutations in SMO, causing uncontrolled proliferation of skin cells. On the other hand, alterations in the SMO gene have been described to be rare in chondrosarcoma and gastric tumours. Yet, according to the COSMIC database, mutations in the SMO gene have been identified in 35 out of 45 (78%) primary cancer tissue types, which highlights the importance of further investigation into the functional role of Smo mutants in various tumours. These genetic alterations are the most prevalent in meninges (12.8%), skin (7.91%) and uterine adnexa (7.69%). It is important to note, however, that most of these genetic alterations are passenger mutations, and the relatively high mutational frequency may be due to high genomic instability and proliferative potential of these tumour cells.\n\n    The role of Smo mutants in oncogenesis was first described in BCC, the commonest form of human cancer. Direct sequencing of the SMO gene in BCC patients identified two oncogenic mutations. One of these, R562Q, is found in close proximity to the C-terminal Ser/Thr motif (S588, S590, T593, S595) that gets phosphorylated by CK1alpha. This genetic alteration causes conformational changes that make the C-tail more accessible for phosphorylation by the kinase, hence leading to increased activity of the receptor. The other sporadic mutation changes codon 535 from tryptophan to leucine (W535L). As mentioned previously, this residue is a key player in the molecular switch mechanism of Smo activation. The W535L mutant localises to PC in the absence of Hh ligand and has constitutive activity, as shown by increased mRNA levels of a Gli target transcript. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations have shown that this mutation weakens the interactions between the cytoplasmic ends of TM6 and TM7, making these helices tilt outwards to allow coupling with Gialpha. These lines of evidence suggest that W535L conveys the ability to drive tumour progression through both canonical and non-canonical Hh signalling.\n\n    While mutations in SMO have a well-established association with sporadic BCC, two more recent case reports identified another oncogenic Smo mutation in an inherited form of skin cancer, BCN. This somatic mutation is caused by a substitution of leucine to bulkier phenylalanine at the codon position 412 (L412F). This mutation is located in the TM5 and the substitution for a bulkier amino acid enables the conformational change between TM5 and TM6 that confers the active state (Figure 2). Indeed, this mutant yields a much higher Gli promoter activity compared to the wild type, which indicates that this mutation leads to increased signalling through the canonical pathway. Although vismodegib treatment was successful in the first reported case of Smo-driven BCN, in the second case clinicians decided against this treatment because this mutation had been linked to vismodegib resistance in BCC.\n\n    Another form of epithelial tumour, HCC, was also linked to a mutation in Smo. The K575M substitution located in the C-terminus of the receptor was initially thought to interfere with the physical interaction between Smo and Ptc, thereby making Smo constitutively active. However, now that it has been established that Ptc controls Smo activity in an indirect manner, the mechanism of activation of this Smo mutant needs to be explored further. Perhaps it has a similar mechanism of activation to R562Q since it resides proximately to the CK1alpha phosphorylation site.\n\n    In addition to cancers of epithelial origin, Smo mutants have been associated with brain tumours. In addition to W535L, the S533N mutation, also located in the TM7, was first identified in human cancer patients with medulloblastoma and was confirmed to drive the formation of brain tumours in mice models. Like other oncogenic mutations, S533N is believed to destabilise the architecture of the transmembrane receptor to promote the transition to the active state. Substitution of a small, uncharged serine for a positively charged arginine with a bulkier side chain probably disturbs the interactions between TM6 and TM7. In addition, whole-genome analysis of medulloblastoma tumours has identified another novel oncogenic mutation, S278I, located in the TM2. Furthermore, meningioma, the most common type of primary brain tumour, is in some cases driven by the previously mentioned L412F and W535L mutations. Interestingly, these mutations were found to be more abundant in a particular type of this tumour, olfactory groove meningiomas, compared to other types. Additionally, it has been reported that patients with grade I tumours driven by mutated Smo had a significantly poorer prognosis compared to tumours with the wildtype receptor. Thus, the mutational status of Smo can be used to determine which patients can benefit from pharmacological inhibition of this receptor. The Type I tumours that are driven by activating mutations of Smo are summarised in Table 2.\n\n    It is notable that oncogenic mutations of Smo identified to date are found in different structural regions: TM2 (S278I), TM5 (L412F), TM7(S533N and W535L), and the C-tail (R562Q and K575M). This indicates that the conformational state of Smo is stabilised by interactions spanning multiple domains. By disrupting the structural integrity of the inactive form of Smo, these mutations activate the Hh signaling and trigger tumorigenesis. For this reason, it would be expected that these mutations would primarily be found in cancer patients. Strikingly, according to the GPCRdb records, the R562Q mutation was present in 3 healthy individuals. This could be explained by lower genetic penetrance of this mutation. Alternatively, it is possible that cancer had not developed or was not identified in these individuals at the time of genetic data analysis. The absence of other oncogenic mutations in the healthy population, however, confirms the role of these mutations in carcinogenesis.\n\n    Despite Smo being a promising therapeutic target for Hh-driven cancers, drug resistance is a common challenge. Tumour relapse has been reported in patients treated with vismodegib and sonidegib due to acquired resistance, however no resistance has been reported towards glasdegib, which has a different binding site to the vismodegib and sonidegib. One of the major mechanisms of resistance to Smo inhibitors is disruption of drug-receptor interactions because of mutations in the 7TM domain.\n\n    Although the Smo inhibitor vismodegib is successful in treating BCN, only 48% of patients with advanced BCC respond to the drug, and further 20% of the BCC patients develop resistance within the first year of treatment. Additionally, vismodegib treatment has shown considerable tumour shrinkage in a patient with medulloblastoma but was followed by relapse within several months because of acquired resistance. According to the COSMIC database, mutations in 12 residues have been attributed to vismodegib resistance (Figure 7a), and over a quarter of cancers acquired resistance through a missense substitution of D473. The recently reported structure of vismodegib-bound Smo reveals that this mutation disrupts a network of hydrogen bonds that coordinates the drug in the binding pocket. Other mutations that directly impair drug binding include H231R, W281C, V321M, I408V, C469Y, Q477E, and E518K. T241M, A459V, F460L and G497W resistance mutations are distal to the binding site and exert negative effects on drug binding in an allosteric manner. For example, molecular dynamics simulations have shown that the region surrounding the mutated residue in Smo-G497W undergoes a conformational change that narrows the drug-binding cavity of the receptor, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect of vismodegib. Activating mutations L412F, W535L, and S533N confer vismodegib resistance by constitutively activating the receptor and hence desensitising it to the drug (Figure 7b).\n\n    Although the structure of sonidegib-bound Smo is yet to be determined, the binding sites of sonidegib and vismodegib are likely to be overlapping since they were derived from the same natural Smo inhibitor cyclopamine. It is thus not surprising that mutations that confer resistance to vismodegib also affect responsiveness to sonidegib. For example, a small-cohort study has shown that BCC patients that acquired resistance to vismodegib through the D473H/G and Q477E mutations have a poor response to sonidegib. In the same study, W535L and S533N oncogenic mutations also impaired sonidgeib efficacy. Yet, certain mutations have been identified in mice models that are unique to sonidegib resistance. These residues are conserved in humans and correspond to N219D, L221R, D384N, S387N, and G453S (Figure 8). Interestingly, there is a record of the G453S mutation in SMO in the COSMIC database, suggesting that human tumours can also acquire resistance specifically to this drug.\n\n    To investigate whether natural genetic variation can cause unresponsiveness to vismodegib and sonidegib, Smo mutations conferring resistance to these drugs were searched in the GPCRdb. It appears that three vismodegib resistance mutations (D473N, W281C, and I408V) and one of the sonidegib-specific mutations (S387N) are indeed present in the healthy population. This observation highlights the need for genetic profiling of tumours before a Smo antagonist is prescribed. This is because early detection of these pre-existing resistance mutations will likely facilitate better treatment choice and, as a result, improved therapy outcome.",

        "Discussion": "    The functional and structural characterisation of Smo has been advancing at a remarkable rate since it was first established to be an oncoprotein in BCC. The mechanisms of Smo activation remained a mystery until the high-resolution X-ray and cryo-EM structures revealed the receptor's capability to become active upon binding of lipid-based agonists. Alongside these findings, it was recognised that Smo is a highly druggable protein with multiple binding pockets and a range of conformational states, which can aid the discovery of novel synthetic inhibitors. Moreover, Smo-mediated Hh signal transduction can modulate cancer hallmarks through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways as well as crosstalk with other signalling networks.\n\n    As the clinical practice is moving away from the one-fits-all approach, cancer treatments tailored towards the genetic characteristics of a patient's tumour will have a particularly major impact in the future. Although the importance of polymorphisms of other GPCRs in precision medicine has been examined, this review argues that Smo variants should be considered in individualised oncology approaches. For patients whose tumours harbour oncogenic mutations in SMO, early detection of these genetic alterations can match these individuals with a suitable Smo inhibitor. This would particularly benefit patients with BCC, BCN, medulloblastoma, meningioma, and HCC since these tumours are Smo-dependent. Indeed, genomic analyses have already been successful in identifying patients with Hh-driven medulloblastoma who would benefit from therapy involving Smo antagonists. Additionally, according to the COSMIC database, oncogenic Smo mutations may also be present in tumours that develop in the large intestine, cervix, oesophagus, upper aerodigestive tract, and bones (Figure 9). To determine whether Smo mutants drive cancer in these tissues, these tumours should be subjected to genomic testing and extensive molecular analysis. Such gaps in knowledge could soon be addressed, as current genotype-directed clinical trials taking place in Denmark and Finland are investigating the use of vismodegib in treating various types of advanced solid tumours.\n\n    The analysis of data from the GPCRdb has demonstrated that Smo mutations that confer resistance to vismodegib and sonidegib are present in the healthy population. This finding highlights the importance of genomic tumour profiling at the earliest stages of cancer to allow the elimination of ineffective treatment with these drugs. The high incidence of acquired resistance emphasises the significance of regular tumour genetic testing throughout the course of treatment. Implementation of this practice would allow effective salvage therapies to be offered in a timely manner. For example, itraconazole is believed to be a good candidate for second generation therapy against Hh-driven cancers. Additionally, combinatorial approaches targeting both Smo and downstream signalling molecules have been recognised as promising in cancer treatment. Targeting regulatory mechanisms of Smo presents another therapeutic approach for acquired resistance. Blocking GRK2 could prevent the essential phosphorylation of the Smo C-tail and dampen the receptor's activity as shown to be the case in mammalian cells in vitro. Inhibition of cholesterylation is also an interesting direction for drug development since this type of modification is uncommon.\n\n    While this review gives an outline of the important oncogenic and resistance mutations, many other mutations have an unknown effect on Smo activity. For example, V270I occurs relatively frequently in both healthy individuals and cancer patients (Figure 6a). Given that this residue is in the important 7TM domain, it is a question of future research to investigate the effect of this mutation on the Smo receptor. In addition to the classical biochemical experiments, the impact of mutations on Smo function should be examined using recently developed structural bioinformatics methods. Furthermore, an understanding of how Smo variants impact drug dosage requirements will be an exciting area of future study as it will spare patients from exposure to ineffective amounts of medication.\n\n    As genomic profiling of tumours is becoming part of routine care, oncogenic mutants of Smo must be added to the cancer biomarker toolkit. Further characterisation of Smo variants and their role in various types of tumours will help develop novel therapies with antiresistance profiles and personalised approaches. This will be essential in ensuring improved long-term prognosis for cancer patients.\n\n    Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

        "Title": "    Interpreting regulatory mechanisms of Hippo signaling through a deep learning sequence model",
        "Abstract": "    Signaling pathway components are well studied, but how they mediate cell-type-specific transcription responses is an unresolved problem. Using the Hippo pathway in mouse trophoblast stem cells as a model, we show that the DNA binding of signaling effectors is driven by cell-type-specific sequence rules that can be learned genome wide by deep learning models. Through model interpretation and experimental validation, we show that motifs for the cell-type-specific transcription factor TFAP2C enhance TEAD4/YAP1 binding in a nucleosome-range and distance-dependent manner, driving synergistic enhancer activation. We also discovered that Tead double motifs are widespread, highly active canonical response elements. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that TEAD4 binds them cooperatively through surprisingly labile protein-protein interactions that depend on the DNA template. These results show that the response to signaling pathways is encoded in the cis-regulatory sequences and that interpreting the rules reveals insights into the mechanisms by which signaling effectors influence cell-type-specific enhancer activity.\n\n    Interpretable deep learning uncovers cis-regulatory rules downstream of Hippo signaling\n\n    YAP1 binding serves as a proxy for predicting cell-type-specific enhancer activity\n\n    TFAP2C enhances TEAD4/YAP1 binding within nucleosome range, dependent on distance\n\n    Two TEAD4s cooperate on the Tead double motif through transient, labile interactions\n\n    Dalal et al. show how AI can be used to systematically uncover the sequence rules that guide how signaling pathways interact with DNA inside cells. This work provides a new lens for discovering the cooperative mechanisms that shape cell-type-specific gene expression in response to cellular signaling.",
        "Introduction": "    Signaling pathways are critical for cell fate decisions during development, the generation of cell types in vitro, and therapeutic interventions, which often target-specific signaling pathways. The signaling components and transcription factors (TFs) that function as canonical effectors of a pathway are typically well studied. Such signaling effectors recognize specific DNA sequence motifs either directly or find obligate partner TFs with DNA binding specificity. However, signaling pathways are reiteratively used during development, and which cis-regulatory sequences are bound by these TFs and become active enhancers that regulate target genes is highly complex and poorly understood. Thus, signaling pathways are critical for gene regulation, but their target specificity is one of the least understood areas of enhancer biology, making it difficult to predict the activity of enhancers or modify their function during development through targeted mutations.\n\n    Here, we hypothesized that the binding of signaling effectors is encoded in the cis-regulatory sequences. This hypothesis is supported by studies on individual enhancers showing that the target gene specificity of a signaling pathway depends on cell-type-specific TFs. Furthermore, genetic experiments showed that cell-type-specific TFs help determine where signaling effectors bind. However, there is no systematic approach to capture the genome-wide cis-regulatory sequence rules, identify relevant cell-type-specific TFs, and characterize the molecular mechanisms by which they influence enhancer activation.\n\n    Capturing genome-wide cis-regulatory sequence rules in a cell-type-specific manner is an ideal task for a deep learning model. By learning to predict TF binding data from DNA sequence, convolutional neural networks learn complex sequence rules in an unbiased way, and the rules can be extracted from the trained models using interpretation tools. A key advantage is the inherent predictive accuracy and the genome-wide applicability of the learned sequence rules, something that cannot be achieved by studying motifs on individual enhancers experimentally or by analyzing motif compositions using traditional methods.\n\n    Predictive accuracy is the first step during training, where the model learns to predict TF binding profiles from sequence. The genome-wide applicability is ensured by testing the performance on withheld data that the model has not seen during training. Another advantage is that the sequence rules are learned de novo in an inherently combinatorial way on large amounts of data. Only upon achieving accurate predictions can the model be interpreted to extract the learned rules. Such models not only learn TF motifs, but also measurements of their relative affinities and the syntax rules, and thus the distance relationships by which motifs cooperate with each other.\n\n    We reasoned that interpretable deep learning might identify which cell-type-specific TF motifs contribute to the response to signaling, and that the motif syntax rules could pinpoint to potential molecular mechanisms. TF cooperativity is often studied with the assumption that TFs interact with each other through protein-protein interactions, exemplified by the pioneering work of the interferon-beta enhanceosome. For such protein-protein interactions to occur, two motifs have to be well positioned at close distances, which should be reflected in the syntax rules. On the other hand, such strictly spaced motifs are not frequently observed in the genome, raising the question of whether TF binding cooperativity often occurs through more flexible motif syntax. Indeed, deep learning models suggest the existence of a soft motif syntax, which occurs at variable motif distances within ~150 bp, with stronger TF cooperativity predicted at closer distances.\n\n    Whether such syntax rules exist for signaling effectors has previously been difficult to decipher. ChIP-seq binding data tend to be of low resolution and display low levels of signal when the TF binds indirectly through a partner TF. Likewise, individually manipulating enhancer sequences in vivo limits throughput, and the effects can be difficult to interpret since they may be enhancer-specific or caused by the inadvertent disruption of other important sequences. Large-scale reporter assays, on the other hand, have produced conflicting results on whether motif syntax is important and, if so, their effects have only been measured for short motif distances and not been mechanistically analyzed. For these reasons, TF binding cooperativity downstream of signaling pathways has not been systematically studied from a sequence perspective.\n\n    To test whether the binding of signaling effectors is sequence encoded and follows syntax rules, we performed TF binding experiments at the highest resolution and leveraged our previously developed deep learning model BPNet to predict the data at base resolution from genomic sequences of 1 kb. This approach has high predictive accuracy and optimally resolves sequence rules between closely spaced motifs within enhancers. Since the model does not predict enhancer activity or target genes, we evaluated and validated these downstream aspects using traditional methods.\n\n    As a model system for our approach, we studied the Hippo signaling pathway in mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Hippo signaling is critical for specifying trophoblast versus inner cell mass cell fate in the early mouse embryo. When cells of the embryo sense that they are facing the outside, i.e., less cell density, they polarize and inactivate the Hippo pathway. This causes YAP1/TAZ to translocate to the nucleus and bind to TEAD4, which, like all TEAD family members, binds to a consensus Tead motif. Other TFs known to be important for TSC identity include CDX2, TFAP2C, and GATA3. TSCs are therefore an ideal system to dissect the interactions between Hippo signaling effectors and cell-type-specific TFs in enhancer activation.\n\n    Here, we show that the binding of the signaling effectors YAP1/TEAD4 is specified by cis-regulatory sequence rules that apply genome-wide. We identified thousands of novel active enhancers in TSCs and show that their activity is driven by YAP1, which binds DNA with the help of cell-type-specific TFs such as TFAP2C. While the Tfap2c-Tead motif synergy follows a soft motif syntax, we also identified the Tead double motif as mediating strong cooperativity through strict syntax. Based on our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the strict distance between the two Tead motifs is required for two TEAD4 to engage in labile protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the TEAD4 effector complex is assembled on DNA with the help of Hippo signaling. This demonstrates how deep learning models can uncover precise sequence rules and potential mechanisms by which signaling effectors bind in the genome to produce cell-type-specific effects.",
        "Methods": "    Mouse trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) were a gift from Vijay Pratap Singh and were maintained in a feeder-free culture as described. Briefly, feeder conditioned medium (Feeder-CM) was prepared by culturing gamma-irradiated MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) in TS medium (RPMI 1640 medium, FBS 20%, 50 mug/mL of Penicillin and streptomycin (100x), 1 mM of Sodium pyruvate (100 mM), 0.1 mM of beta-Mercaptoethanol (20 mM), 2 mM GlutaMAX (200 mM) for 72 h and then filtered with a 0.45 mum filter. 70% Feeder-CM plus 30% TS medium (70cond) supplemented with growth factor FGF4 (R&D System) and heparin (Sigma) (70cond +1.5x F4H Medium) was used to maintain TSCs in feeder-free conditions. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were cultured and maintained as previously described.\n\n    For each ChIP-nexus experiment, 106 TSCs were used. Cells were washed with PBS and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 10 min at RT. The reaction was quenched with 125 mM glycine. Fixed cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS), incubated for 10 min on ice and sonicated with a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode) for five cycles of 30 s on and 30 s off. The ChIP-nexus procedure and data processing were performed as previously described, except that the ChIP-nexus adapter mix contained four fixed barcodes (ACTG, CTGA, GACT, and TGAC), and PCR library amplification was performed directly after circularization of the purified DNA fragments (without the addition of the oligo and BamHI digestion). PAtCh-Cap was performed as previously described with 10% of sheared chromatin from 10-6 TSCs. ChIP-seq experiments, including a whole cell extract (WCE) control, were performed as described with 10e6 TSCs per ChIP. For each ChIP, 5-10 mug of antibody was coupled to 50-100 muL of Protein A or Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used: anti-TFAP2C (R & D systems, no. AF5059), anti-TEAD4 (Abcam, no. ab58310), anti-CDX2 (Bethyl Laboratories, no. A300-692A), anti-GATA3 (Cell Signaling, no. 5852T), anti-YAP1 (Cell Signaling, no. 14074S), anti-Pol II (Cell Signaling, no. D8L4Y), anti-H3K27ac (ChIP-seq) (Active motif, no. 39135). For all experiments, at least two biological replicates were prepared-that is, the experiments were performed on different days, starting with cells from a different passage number. Single-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (75 cycles). The full ChIP-nexus protocol can be found on the Zeitlinger lab website at https://research.stowers.org/zeitlingerlab/protocols.html.\n\n    Selected genomic regions of range 175-200 bp were synthesized using GeneArt Strings DNA fragments along with restriction enzyme sites for with Kpn1 (NEB, R0142) and XhoI (NEB, R0146) to clone in pNL3.2 vector. pNL3.2 vectors (Promega) were digested and cloned using an Infusion master mix (Takara) upstream of the luciferase gene. Stellar competent cells (Takara) were used for transformation and downstream miniprep (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. The cloned sequences were confirmed using the Sanger sequencing method. 2.5-5 TSCs were used to transfect a total of 500 ng DNA with lipofectamine2000 in a ratio of 1:2 (DNA to lipofectamine2000), following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were co-transfected with 1:100 ratio of control (pGL4.54[luc2/TK]) and reporter construct (pNL3.2[NlucP/minP]). Cells were transfected in suspension for 15-20 min and resuspended with media to grow in each well of the 24-well plate.\n\n    Luciferase assays were performed using a Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). After 24 h, cells were harvested, and the NanoDLR assay protocol was followed per the manufacturer's instructions to take luminescence measurements with SpectraMax iD3 Plate Reader. Reporter luminescence signals were normalized according to their corresponding control luminescence signals, resulting in relative luciferase activity. Replicate luciferase assay experiments were performed independently three times (Table S3).\n\n    TT-seq experiments were performed in three biological replicates on TSCs across three biological replicates, as described in https://www.protocols.io/view/transient-transcriptome-sequencing-experimental-pr-3byl42y22vo5/v1. Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold Set to degrade rRNA. Approximately 106 cells were seeded in a 100 cm dish (~80% confluency) and incubated with 500 muM of 4sU (Sigma) at 37 C, 5% CO2 for 15 min. The cells were then collected by adding 4.5 mL of TRIzol lysis reagent (Life Technologies Corp), incubated for 5 min on ice, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 C. In the biotinylation of the 4sU labeled RNA step, acid-phenol-chloroform (ThermoFisher) was used instead of chloroform.\n\n    For each ATAC-seq experiment, 1-5 or 25 TSCs were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in ATAC Resuspension Buffer (RSB, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2) with 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630. Tn5 transposition was performed as previously described. Briefly, the cells were incubated for 3 min on ice in ATAC RSB supplemented with 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.01% Digitonin (Promega, G9441). The reaction was quenched with ATAC RSB with 0.1% Tween 20 and centrifugation. Tagmentation took place at 37 C and 1000 rpm for 30 min in a 50 muL reaction volume containing 10 muL of 5x Tagmentation Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM MgCl2, 50% DMF), 0.5 muL 10% Tween 20, 0.5 muL 1% Digitonin, 1-2 muM assembled transposome and water. Tn5 transposase was purified in-house as previously described. Tn5 was loaded with previously reported oligonucleotides Tn5ME-A/Tn5mC1.1-A1block and Tn5ME-B/Tn5mC1.1-A1block by mixing equal amounts of purified Tn5 protein and annealed oligonucleotides for 30 min at RT. After tagmentation, the DNA fragments were purified using the Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (NEB). Libraries were constructed using Illumina Nextera Dual Indexing, and qPCR was used to prevent over-amplification as described. At least three biological replicates were generated, and paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (2 x 75 bp).\n\n    TSCs wild-type and CRISPR-Cas9 edited cells were grown separately in wells of a 6-well plate and harvested at 80% confluency (~26 cells) using 500 muL of TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Corp). The lysate was incubated for 5 min on ice, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 C. For RNA extraction, the lysate was quickly thawed at 65 C, cooled on ice for 5 min, and vortexed. Then, 100 muL of chloroform was added per 0.5 mL of TRIzol lysis reagent, shaken vigorously for 15 s, and incubated for 3 min. The sample was centrifuged at 4 C and 7000 x g for 25 min, and the upper colorless aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube. 250 muL of isopropanol was then added, incubated for 10 min at 4 C, and centrifuged at 4 C and 12,000 x g for 10 min. The total RNA precipitate formed a white gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube, which was washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried for 5-10 min, and resuspended in 20 muL of RNase-free water. DNase treatment was performed using the TURBO DNase kit per the manufacturer's instructions: adding 1 muL of TURBO DNase and 2 muL of DNase buffer to the dissolved RNA and incubating at 37 C for 30 min. To inactivate TURBO DNase, the RNA samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform (Sigma). The sample was centrifuged at 4 C and 7000 x g for 25 min, and the upper colorless aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube. 250 muL of isopropanol was added, incubated for 10 min at 4 C, and centrifuged at 4 C and 12,000 x g for 10 min. The total RNA precipitate formed a white gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube, which was washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried for 5-10 min, and resuspended in 20 muL of RNase-free water. The samples were incubated in a water bath or heat block set at 55 C-60 C for 10-15 min. The RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and the RNA integrity was checked on a 2100 Bioanalyzer using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. mRNA-stranded libraries were prepared using a TruSeq poly-A Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 P2 platform with 2 x 100 bp single-end reads. Three biological replicates were performed for wild-type and CRISPR-Cas9 edited cells.\n\n    In the first CRISPR TSC line, the Tead double motif on chr17:6,827,802-6,827,811 (mm10) was mutated from ACATTCCAGA (wild-type) to GCATTCCAGGAATTCCA (mutant). In a second CRISPR TSC line, the Tead single motif (CACATTCCTA) on chr12:102,262,024-102,262,033 (mm10) was first inserted at 60 bp downstream of the TFAP2C motif (GGGCCCCAGGGCC) and then in a second round of CRISPR-Cas9 editing Tead single motif was mutated from CACATTCCTA (wild-type) to CACCGTCCTA (mutant) at its original position. crRNA target sites were designed using the IDT target predictor tool by evaluating the predicted on-target efficiency score and off-target potential. Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA was designed to contain ~40 bases of homology from the targeted cut site (gRNA and ssODN sequences are shown in Table S2. Equimolar amounts (stock of 100 mum) of Alt-R crRNA and tracrRNA-ATTO550 were mixed to form gRNA at a final concentration of 50 muM. The mixture was heated at 95 C for 5 min and cooled at RT. The single-stranded donor oligonucleotides (ssODN) were designed to contain ~40 bases of homology from the targeted cut site (crRNA and ssODN sequences were designed using the IDT software tool). A ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex was formed by combining 150 pmol of gRNA (crRNA+tracrRNA) and 125 pmol of Cas9 HiFi v3 protein (IDT) with hybridization for 20 min at RT. The RNP was combined with 100 pmol of ssODN donor and 100 pmol of electroporation enhancer v2 and delivered to 1.5e5 cells by Neon electroporation (1,400 V, 10 m, 3 pulses; Neon Transfection System, MPK5000, Life Technologies). Immediately after electroporation, cells were cultured in 0.5 muM Alt-R HDR enhancer V2 of 0.69 mM. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS before FACS sorting on S6 FACSymphony. Single cells were directly sorted into 96-well plates. Cells were screened for the expected mutations through paired-end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (250 cycles). On-target indel frequency and expected mutations were analyzed using CRIS.py. Clones with the intended homozygous mutation and sequence alignments >90% were chosen for further experiments, except for the 2nd CRISPR line, where we found one Indel and SNP within 500 bp of the original Tead single motif position, but these changes were predicted to be neutral by BPNet.\n\n    C57BL/6J (B6) strain of mice were used from the Stowers Institute for Medical Research (SIMR) core production colony. Three to four-week-old females were superovulated using 5IU of PMSG (Genway Biotech), followed by 5IU HCG (Sigma Aldrich) 46-48 h later. Following HCG, females were paired with B6 males and checked for a copulatory plug the next morning, indicating successful mating. Fertilized embryos were collected from the plugged females at 1.5 dpc (2-cell stage) by flushing M2 (Millipore) through the infundibulum and out the uterine horn using a blunt needle. Embryos were then incubated overnight at 37 C under 5% CO2 in humidified air in 4-well culture dishes containing KSOM media (Millipore). Experiments were approved by the SIMR IACUC and were performed following the committees' guiding principles.\n\n    Two days (48 h) before the transduction of wild-type or CRISPR-Cas9 edited (putative Ezr region edits) TSCs, cells were seeded at 1 X 105 cells per well in triplicate with 3 mL of media per well of 6-well plate. On the day of transduction, cells were small-sized colonies of about 30-40% confluence; the old media were removed and washed once with PBS and replaced with 2 mL of media. The cells were infected with prepackaged lentiviral particles (constitutive reporter vector expressing tdTomato fluorescent protein gene driven by EF1a promoter (Takara) at MOI of 20 (Stock: 3.5-10 TU/ml) along with polybrene (4ug/ml) (Sigma) for 24 h before being replaced with a fresh medium. Four days after transduction, the td-Tomato-positive cells were selected using puromycin antibiotic selection (1 mug/ml) (InvivoGen) and were kept under selection until the positive colonies reached 60-80% confluence. Once cells reached 80% confluence, the positive cells were FACS sorted on S6 FACSymphony, expanded, and used for embryo aggregation experiments.\n\n    To prepare the aggregation plates, six indentations on the bottom of the 35 x 10 mm plates were made using an aggregation needle (BLS) sterilized with 70% alcohol and added a drop of KSOM. All drops of KSOM were covered with mineral oil (Sigma). On the morning of the aggregation, the embryos (8-16 cell stage) were washed through M2 and then placed in drops of Tyrode's solution (Sigma). After about 30 s, the zona pellucida began to dissolve. Once the zona was dissolved, the embryos were picked up and rinsed through a drop of M2 to neutralize the Tyrode's solution, then placed in a drop of KSOM. Embryos were moved from this dish to the aggregate plates, placing an embryo into each indentation. Clumps of td-Tomato transduced TSCs were then picked up with a mouth pipette and moved onto each embryo in the aggregate plate. Once settled and in contact with the embryo, the aggregation plates were cultured in an incubator at 37 C under 5% CO2 in humidified air for 46-48 h until the embryos reached the blastocyst stage. Chimeric blastocysts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (ThermoFisher) for 20 min and washed three times with PBS before mounting them on a glass bottom plate (Cellvis) coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma). Embryos were imaged with a Zeiss LSM800, an upright confocal laser scanning microscope.\n\n    A few fixed chimeric blastocysts were used for immunofluorescence stainings. The embryos were washed three times with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated in PBS-T for 1 h or longer at 4 C. Embryos were then washed two times with PBS for 10 min each and incubated with 300 muL of superblock solution (ThermoFisher) for 90 min at RT, before adding the primary antibodies: CDX2 (BioGenex-MU392A-5UC) and Nanog (Cell Signaling, 8822S) with 10 mug/mL of DAPI from BioLegend:422801. The CDX2 antibody came with a signal enhancing reagent, which was used to replace 75% of the superblock solution while incubating with the primary antibody. The embryos were incubated overnight at 4 C, covered from light. The next day, the samples were washed for 10 min each three times with PBST (0.1% Triton X-100) at RT and once with PBS at RT. Secondary antibodies were added (biotium:20015,20047) in special PBS (ThermoFisher) at a 1:300 dilution with DAPI 2 muL in 1 mL of 10 mug/mL (BioLegend) and kept on light rotation for 2 h at RT. Samples were then washed three times with PBS for 10 min. Samples were imaged immediately or kept for up to a week at 4 C before imaging. Imaging was performed with an upright confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM800) with 40x magnification. Maximum intensity Z projections and adjustments to the brightness and contrast were performed in ImageJ/FIJI. Samples larger than the field of view were taken as tiled images and stitched with the Grid/Collection Stitching plugin in ImageJ.\n\n    Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed three times in PBS +0.2% Triton X- for 10 min each. RNA FISH experiments were performed using HCR v3.0 (Molecular Instrument Inc.). The RNA sequences that were used to design probes are listed along with the chosen amplifiers and probe set size: Ezr (NM_009510.2, B4,32), CDX2 (NM_007673.3, B1,29), tdTomato (B5,16). The following amplifiers with Alexa fluorophore were used: 488, 546, and 647. The fixed embryos were serially dehydrated into methanol and stored at -20 C until use. To rehydrate the embryos, they were washed in PBS +0.1% Triton X-(PBST). Embryos were incubated in the hybridization buffer for 30 min at 37 C, then in the hybridization buffer containing the probes at 37 C for 16 h. Embryos were washed 5 times with the wash buffer for 5 min each, then 2 times in 5x SSCT (5x SSC +0.1% Tween 20). Amplifiers were snap-cooled by heating at 95 C for 90 s and cooled to RT for 30 min under dark conditions. Embryos were incubated in an amplification buffer for 30 min at RT before adding the amplifiers and incubating the embryos for 80 min at RT in a humid chamber under dark conditions. Embryos were washed 4 times in 5x SSCT for 5 min each, stained with DAPI (10 mug/ml) from BioLegend in 5x SSCT for 30 min, then washed two times in 5x SSCT. Embryos were stored in 5x SSC at 4 C until imaging. Images of labeled chimeric blastocysts were acquired with an Orca Flash 4.0 sCMOS at full resolution on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope equipped with a Yokagawa CSU W1 Spinning Disk Confocal with 50 mum pinholes. A Nikon 40x long working distance water immersion objective, NA 1.15, was used to acquire all channels with exposure times of DAPI: 20ms, Alexa 488: 200ms, Alexa 546: 250ms, and Alexa 647: 250ms.\n\n    System preparation and simulation procedure: Canonical B-form DNA was created for each simulated sequence using Avogadro 1.2.0. The TEAD4 structure was taken from PDB:5GZB, and selenomethionine residues were replaced with regular methionine by simply renaming the selenium atom to sulfur. In order to align the protein structure from 5GZB onto the created DNA structures, we aligned the phosphorus atoms from the 4th to 10th residue on chain B of the PDB (which correspond to the bases CATTCCT) to the corresponding atoms on the created DNA. Since we simulated TEAD4 dimers, we performed this alignment twice, once for each binding site. This alignment was accomplished using VMD 1.9.3. We combined the two translated copies of the TEAD4 protein and the synthetic DNA sequence into one system using AmberTools20. We used the ff19SB force field for protein atoms, the bsc1 force field for DNA, and the OPC for water and ions. (For a control simulation using CHARMM27, the same procedure was used to create the initial structure, but the system was built in VMD and TIP3P was used as the water model.) Systems were solvated in truncated octahedra of water with a 12 A padding between the solute and cell edge. Systems were charge-neutralized with K+ ions, and additional K+ and Cl-ions were added to bring the system to a concentration of approximately 150 mM KCl. Systems were minimized using NAMD 2.13. During minimization, a cutoff distance of 9 A was used (12 A for CHARMM27), and solvent bonds were held rigid, though all solute bonds were unrestrained. A timestep of 2 fs was used, and PME electrostatics was applied with a grid spacing of 1 A. Ten thousand steps of minimization were performed. For thermalization and production, we used a GPU-enabled build of NAMD 2.14. The same parameters were used as in the minimization, except for the introduction of a Langevin piston to maintain the system pressure at 1 atm and a harmonic collective variable restraint to prevent the ends of the DNA from fraying during the simulation. This restraint was applied between H1 from the terminal guanine and N3 of the terminal cytosine. (The DNA ends with a GC pair on each end, and both ends of the DNA were restrained in the same way.) A force constant of 1 kcal/mol/A2 was applied to maintain this distance at 2 A. During thermalization, all velocities were started from zero and gradually warmed by applying a Langevin thermostat to raise the system temperature to 310 K during a ten ps simulation. The thermalized systems were equilibrated for ten ns, the only difference in configuration from the thermalization simulation being the timestep (increased from 1 fs to 2 fs) and the use of rigid bonds (all bonds, including hydrogen, was made rigid during equilibration and production. Coordinates were saved for every ps for both equilibration and production runs. Simulation stability was verified by plotting protein and DNA RMSD values; all simulations were stable. To verify that the simulations had reached equilibrium, we measured BSA values in the first and last fifth of the trajectory; they showed similar distributions in each case except for the deletion, where the right-hand TEAD4 detached from the DNA toward the end of the simulation. We have provided dehydrated trajectories along with all analysis scripts in Python (Python.org), D (dlang.org), and VMD in one folder. Complete, hydrated trajectories, totaling approximately 5 TB of data, are available upon reasonable request. All MD simulation trajectories can be accessed at https://collaboration.stowers.org/d1e17b38-9a3d-4900-a623-ac32836b32fc/.\n\n    ChIP-nexus and PAtCh-Cap single-end sequencing reads were pre-processed by trimming off fixed and random barcodes and reassigning them to FASTQ read names. ChIP-nexus adapter fragments were trimmed from the 3' end of the fragments using cutadapt (v.2.5). ChIP-nexus and PAtCh-Cap reads were aligned using bowtie (v.1.1.2) and its bowtie to the Mus Musculus genome assembly mm10. Aligned ChIP-nexus and PAtCh-Cap BAM files were deduplicated based on unique fragment coordinates and barcode assignments. ChIP-nexus coverage was normalized was acquired through reads per million (RPM) normalization, where the ChIP-nexus sample coverage was scaled by the total number of reads divided by 106. ChIP-nexus peaks were mapped using MACS2(v.2.2.6) with parameters designed to restimulate the full fragment length coverage instead of the single stop base coverage (--keep-dup = all -f = BAM --shift = -75 --extsize = 150). ChIP-nexus peaks were filtered for reproducibility in a pairwise fashion using the Irreproducible Discovery Rate framework (IDR) (v.2.0.3). The IDR framework selected the peaks used for downstream analysis from the largest pairwise comparison.\n\n    ChIP-seq single-end sequencing reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus genome assembly mm10 using bowtie2 (v.2.4.2). Aligned ChIP-seq BAM files were deduplicated based on unique fragment coordinates and fragments extended based on the average experiment fragment length as determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Normalized ChIP-seq coverage was acquired using the deepTools subfeature bamCompare (v.3.1.3) using parameters to generate RPKM or log2 fold-change scaling (--scaleFactorsMethod = None --normalizeUsingRPKM --binSize = 50) or (--scaleFactorsMethod = readCount --operation = log2 --binSize = 50). ChIP-seq peaks were mapped using MACS2 (v.2.2.6) with default parameters and an applied background coverage using the associated WCE ChIP-seq control experiment. ChIP-seq peaks were filtered for pairwise reproducibility using the Irreproducible Discovery Rate framework (IDR) (v.2.0.3).\n\n    TT-seq 75 bp paired-end sequencing reads were aligned using STAR(v.2.7.3) to the Mus Musculus genome assembly mm10 with the following parameters: outFilterMismatchNmax 2, outFilterMultimapScoreRange 0. SAMtools (v.1.14) were then used to keep alignments with mapping quality greater than 255 (-q 255), and only proper pairs (-f 2) were selected. Strand-specific BAM files for each replicate and combined were generated using the following parameters (samtools view -b -f 128 -F 16; -b -f 80; -b -f 144; -b -f 64 -F 16) and (samtools merge plus_128.bam with plus_80.bam and minus_144.bam with minus_64.bam). Normalized TT-seq coverage was generated using bamCoverage (v.3.1.3) parameter Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM).\n\n    ATAC-seq paired-end sequencing reads were aligned using bowtie2 (v.2.4.2) to the Mus Musculus genome assembly mm10. Normalized ATAC-seq coverage was acquired through RPKM normalization along with following parameters: -bs = 50 --minFragmentLength 10 --maxFragmentLength 1000 --ignoreDuplicate --extendReads\n\n    RNA-seq 100 bp single-end sequencing reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus genome assembly mm10 using STAR (v.2.7.3) with the following parameters: outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate, outSAMprimaryFlag OneBestScore,outFilterMultimapNmax 20, outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.1, outFilterType BySJout,alignSJoverhangMin 8, alignSJDBoverhangMin 1,outFilterMismatchNmax 999,alignIntronMin 20,alignIntronMax 1000000,alignMatesGapMax 1000000,limitBAMsortRAM 10000000000,outSAMattributes NH HI MD AS nM, quantMode TranscriptomeSAM GeneCounts. Rsem-calculate-expression (v1.3.0) was used to generate an expression table with the following parameters: no-bam-output, estimate-rspd, strandedness reverse.\n\n    Images were analyzed in Python 3.9. 3D masks were created with the DAPI label using the Cellpose deep learning package. After a small Gaussian blur of width 1 x 2 x 2 pixels, Cellpose segmentation was performed with the cyto model with a diameter of 60 and minimum cell size of 10000. The trophoblast cells were segmented well with this method in 3D, but the crowded inner cell mass cells were frequently corrected by hand using Napari (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3555620). The masked DAPI was expanded by 4 pixels in the xy direction to encompass more of the cytoplasm HCR label in each cell. The small HCR puncta were found by first performing a Gaussian blur of 2 x 5 x 5 width, then a Laplace filter using Gaussian derivatives with sigma = 0.1, 0.5, 0.5. Finally, the local maximum peaks in intensity are found using the Scikit-image peak_local_max function with a threshold of 11 for the CDX2 channel and 15 for both Ezrin and tdTomato channels. The number of HCR puncta found inside each masked cell was recorded. A threshold was determined to categorize a cell as CDX2 positive (greater than 5 HCR puncta) or tdTomato positive (greater than 15 HCR puncta). The threshold for tdTomato is greater because the HCR hairpin signal is sometimes found on the outside surface of the blastocyst, forming brighter and larger puncta compared to the interior cell signal, which would cause too many cells to be categorized as tdTomato positive. All thresholds are held constant between all images of blastocysts.\n\n    Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated using VMD, with a 1.5 A radius around all atoms. The buried surface area between the two systems was calculated by subtracting the surface area of the combined system from the sum of the surface areas of each component system. Plots were generated using Matplotlib, Scipy, and NumPy with Python 3.10 (python.org). The same protocol was used to calculate the buried surface area values of crystal structures and the enhanceosome model. Figures were generated with Tachyon in VMD; trajectory frames were aligned using a frame-by-frame aligner developed previously. Secondary structures were determined using STRIDE.\n\n    BPNet (v.0.0.23) architecture and software were applied as previously described. Model inputs were 1000 bp genomic sequences centered on the ChIP-nexus peaks of TF of interest. Model outputs were the predicted counts (total reads across each region) and predicted profile (coverage signal across each region) for TFAP2C, TEAD4, CDX2, YAP1, and GATA3 ChIP-nexus experiments. ~150K IDR-reproducible peaks from TFAP2C, TEAD4, CDX2, YAP1, and GATA3 ChIP-nexus experiments were pooled and used as model inputs. Validation datasets were peaks across chr5,6,7,19; test datasets were peaks across chr1,8,9, and peaks across chrX and Y chromosomes were excluded from the analysis. The remaining regions were used for model training. Hyper-parameters were the default BPNet architecture. The trained model performance was assessed by comparing (1) area under the PrecisionRecall Curves (auPRC) for profiles over different bins of resolution between observed ChIP-nexus profiles and predicted BPNet profiles (Figure S1C) (2) Jensen-shannon distance for TF binding profile between observed ChIP-nexus signals to predicted BPNet signals for each TF and (3) counts correlations of observed ChIP-nexus signals to predicted BPNet signals for each TF (Figure S1E) as previously described. The auPRC values were benchmarked alongside replicate-replicate, observed random, and observed-average observed profile comparisons to establish an in-context understanding of predicted profile accuracy. All BPNet models were implemented and trained using Keras (v2.2.4), TensorFlow1 backend (v.1.70), and the Adam optimizer150. The training used an NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU with CUDA v9.0 and cuDNN v7.0.5 drivers. To obtain the Tead double motifs in ESCs for analysis Figure 5G, TEAD4 ChIP-nexus experiments were pooled and used as model inputs to train a single TF model; ~15K IDR-reproducible peaks were used. Validation peak datasets across chr 1,7,3,14, test peak datasets across chr2,8,9, and peaks across chromosomes X and Y were excluded from the analysis. Hyper-parameters, model performances, and BPNet implementation were performed as described above. PAtCh-Cap control in ESCs was from. We performed DeepLIFT and TF-MoDISco on the trained model to generate an ESCs-specific Tead motif set. For analysis in Figure 5G, we used Tead double motifs from fold 1. Additional models were trained with the same architecture as part of 3-fold validation (fold 2 and fold 3). Spearman counts correlation values (top right) were determined by comparing the observed ChIP-nexus counts with BPNet's predicted counts at TEAD4 ChIP-nexus peaks in ESCs (Figure S5I).\n\n    DeepLIFT (v0.6.9.0, derived from the Kundaje Lab fork of DeepExplain (https://github.com/kundajelab/DeepExplain) was applied to the trained BPNet model to generate the contribution of each base across a given input sequence to the predicted output counts and profile signals. Contribution scores for counts and profile outputs were generated for all 5 TF tasks. TF-MoDISco (v0.4.2.2) was then applied for each TF separately. Regions of high counts contribution were identified, clustered based on within-group contribution and sequence similarity, and then consolidated into motifs. The Tfap2c, Tead, Cdx2, Gata3, and Yap1 motifs were manually identified based on their similarity to the known motif and the sharp average ChIP-nexus binding footprint of the corresponding TF. Once motifs were characterized and confirmed, they were used to label genomic instances by CWM scanning as previously described. Briefly, a motif was mapped based on both Jaccardian similarity to the TF-MoDISco contribution weight matrix (CWM) and sufficient total absolute contribution across the mapped motif. Then, motifs were filtered for redundant assignment of palindromic sequences and overlapping peaks. To obtain regions of mapped motif combinations with enhancers for downstream measurement of enhancer activity to get specific mapped motif pairs, motif islands were generated as described. Each island starts as a 500 bp (enhancer window) region centered on the motif and gets clustered and merged with another nearby motif island if they overlap. In this manner, islands get extended if a motif is within less than 500 bp. The motif islands, by their motif combinations with motif numbers, read sums of TFs binding and enhancer activity (provided in Table S4).\n\n    To visualize the correlation between YAP1 binding and the markers of enhancer activity, we selected regions using the following criteria: BPNet-mapped motifs that were absent of ERVs, were within TEAD4 peaks, and showed TEAD4 binding. At those regions, we calculated the total ChIP-nexus read counts for YAP1, selected regions above the median value, and sorted based on the total read counts. These regions were then divided into the top 5000 regions with high YAP1 reads and the 5000 regions with median YAP1 binding. We used this set to calculate normalized reads and generate the TEAD4, YAP1, H3K27ac, Pol II, and Nascent-RNA heatmap.\n\n    We selected mapped regions with only one motif pair from the motif islands set for the following motif-pair combinations: Tfap2c-Tead, Cdx2-Tead, Gata3-Tead4, and Tfap2c-Tead double. We then sorted the regions by the distance between the two motifs and included distances less than 160 bp for display. YAP1 contribution scores from the binding model were used to make heatmaps in ggplot. The in silico motif interaction analysis and odds ratio calculations for the co-occurrence likelihood of motif pairs were performed as described. Statistics for Figures 3C, S3C, and S3D provided in Table S5 and described in STAR Methods.\n\n    Yap1 binding enhancement was calculated by measuring BPNet model predictions across computationally generated sequences where we injected two motifs-a Tead single motif and another motif (y axis on 1G) into 256 randomized sequences. We next averaged predictions across these 256 trials. More precisely, this in silico motif interaction analysis was performed to measure \"YAP1 binding enhancement\" as described previously. When injecting two motif sequences (motif A and motif B) across motif pair distances (d) ranging up to 150 bp. Yap1 binding predictions were measured in these different simulation scenarios where the sum of the read counts predicted across a 50 bp window centered on motif A. We measured four different cases: (1) neither motif A nor motif B was injected into the sequence (hO), (2) motif A only was injected into the sequence (hA), (3) motif B only was injected into the sequence (hB), and (4) motif A and motif B were both injected into the sequence at a designated distance (hAB). After each case was measured across all motif combinations and distances, then averaged across trials, the in silico binding enhancement for each motif in a motif pair was calculated using the following equation: log2((hAB - (hB - hO))/hA). The motif pairs considered were combinations of the highest affinity sequence representations of Tead single (ACATTCCTG), Tfap2c (CCCTCAGGC), Cdx2 (GCCATAAA), Gata3 (AGATAAG), Jun-Fos (ATGAGTCAT), CTCF (CCACTAGGGGGCG), Elf5 (CCGGAAG), Gata3 double (AGATAAGATCT) and Tead double (ACATTCCTGGCATTCC).\n\n    This analysis was to predict TFAP2C and TEAD4 binding on genomic regions with different motif distances and how this changes upon editing the distance between the motifs. From our islands, we selected regions with one Tead single and one Tfap2c motif within less than 200 bp and resized them to 400 bp putative enhancers, and recorded the coordinates of Tfap2c and Tead4 motifs within the putative enhancers for mutations. We then identified the nearest genes using the biomaRt package. For each putative enhancer, we generated sequences for wild-type, mutated motif for each at its original position by mutating the two most contributing nucleotides to the least contributing within that motif. Then, we inserted the same motif at distances in multiples of 10 or 15 within a 400 bp window. These sequences were combined into an array to predict TF binding and contributions at a motif range of 50 bp. The resulting unique enhancer values were exported in R for plotting. The luciferase assay and CRISPR regions were selected by high binding of TEAD4, TFAP2C, and YAP1 at these putative enhancers and by context-relevant gene targets.\n\n    To map regions in the mm10 genome with different Tead double motif spacings, we used pattern matching (with no mismatches) to identify instances of a single Tead motif (RMATTCCWD). Then, regions with two motifs within 23 bp were identified, and the frequencies by which each motif spacing occurred were recorded. Thus, for a motif spacing of 2, the matched sequence is RMATTCCNNRMATTCCNN. The predicted TEAD4 binding signal was then calculated for all motifs injected into randomized sequences and averaged over 256 iterations. The results from each spacing were then averaged.\n\n    To assess the distribution of motif variant frequency, identical sequence patterns of CWM-mapped Tead single and double motif patterns were grouped, analyzed and visualized. To obtain a robust representation, only patterns that occurred in the top 90th percentile and occurred at least 10 times were considered. After injecting each sequence pattern into 256 random sequences, BPNet was used to predict TEAD4 binding. The average predicted signal for each pattern, along with the pattern frequency, was plotted using ggplot.\n\n    This analysis aimed to investigate the potential synergy between each side (each Tead motif) of the Tead double motifs. We selected regions that did not overlap with either ERVs or promoter regions, extracted the sequences of the Tead double motifs, and oriented them in the 5'>3' direction. We then split the motif sequences into two half-sites, each corresponding to a Tead single motif. We then predicted the binding of TEAD4 at the half-sites and the complete double motifs injected into random sequences. The values for the two half-sites were summed and compared to those for the complete double motifs as a measure of synergy between the two half-sites of TEAD4 double motifs.\n\n    This analysis aimed to benchmark the motif discovery and scanning approaches leveraging PWMs (frequency-based) versus CWMs (contribution-based) for analyzing Tead motifs. We performed traditional PWM scanning, leveraging MEME (5.3 and 5.5.3) and FIMO (5.5.3) We ran MEME (-mod anr) on the top 1,000 TEAD4 ChIP-nexus peaks within the central 101 bp regions of each peak summit, returning both a Tead single and Tead double motif. Using FIMO (--skip-matched-sequence --parse-genomic-coord --max-strand --max-stored-scores 10000000), we performed two rounds of motif scanning. The first round was conducted on Tead single and Tead double motif PWMs returned by MEME, described above (called \"PWM-freq\"). The second round was conducted on Tead single and Tead double motif PWMs reconstituted from seqlets returned by TF-MoDISco (called \"CWM-freq\"). We compared each set of FIMO-mapped motifs, alongside the motifs mapped using CWM-scanning, described above (called \"CWM-contrib\") (Figure 4C). This resulted in three groups of mapped motifs.\n\n    For the three groups of motif mappings (PWM-freq, CWM-freq, and CWM-contrib), we scored the sequence match of each motif from each mapping group using the CWM-freq PWM as a reference. We next performed in silico analysis of each mapping group, taking their respective top 5K Tead double motifs and top 20K Tead single motifs based on the sequence-match score described above. We injected each unique motif sequence from these top-scoring motifs into randomized DNA sequences and predicted TEAD4 binding. We evaluated genomic context influencing TEAD4 binding predictions by predicting genomic regions that mapped CWM-contrib motifs labeled as \"CWM-contrib in genomic context.\"\n\n    We performed additional benchmarking of CWM-versus PWM-scanning by leveraging an alternative motif mapping software called HOMER (4.9.1) to identify motifs. Run under default parameters of fragment size of 200 bp and a variety of allowed motif lengths (i.e., 9, 13, 18, 20 bp) from the top 1000 TEAD4 ChIP-nexus peaks, HOMER returned a matched Tead single motif, not the double motif. However, when we looked at the list of de novo motifs similar to the Tead single motif, we could identify the Tead double motif by specifically searching for the pattern (Figure S4A). Given the long list, it is unlikely that the motif would stand out to someone not looking for it.",
        "Results": "    We generated genome-wide, high-resolution binding data for two Hippo signaling effectors (TEAD4 and YAP1) and for potential TSC-specific partner TFs (CDX2, TFAP2C, and GATA3) by using a ChIP-exo technique called ChIP-nexus, in which an exonuclease step generates narrow and sharp binding footprints (Figures 1A and S1A). We used TSCs derived from mouse blastocysts and confirmed that they retain features of endogenous trophectoderm (TE) cells by reintegrating them into the TE layer of blastocyst embryos in an aggregation assay (Figure S1B). The ChIP-nexus binding data revealed that YAP1 and TEAD4 were more correlated with each other than any other TF pair (Figure 1B), consistent with YAP1 binding to DNA through TEAD4.\n\n    We then trained the deep learning model BPNet to predict the base-resolution binding profiles of all TFs from 187,775 reproducibly bound genomic regions (Figure 1C) by separating chromosomes into training, validation, and test groups to confirm model accuracy. We also performed cross-validation on different chromosome combinations to ensure model stability (Figure S1F). For all TFs, we obtained high prediction accuracy for the read counts, as well as profiles and footprint positions on a par with the similarity between replicate experiments (Figures 1D and S1C-S1E). Examples include the putative enhancers of important trophoblast genes such as Fgfr1 (Figure 1D), Amotl2, Pard3b, and Krt8/18 (Figures S1G and S1I). These results show that the model learned general rules for this cell type to predict TF binding anywhere in the genome from sequence alone.\n\n    To understand which motifs contribute to the binding of the signaling effectors TEAD4 and YAP1, we extracted de novo learned motifs. Using an attribution method, we assigned contribution scores to all bases in the input sequences and then summarized learned motifs as a contribution weight matrix (CWM). The CWM motifs were then used to map \"contributing\" motif instances in each genomic region (Figure 1C). These mapped motifs were highly congruent with experimentally observed and predicted TF footprints (Figures 1D and S1G-S1I).\n\n    Among the discovered motifs were the known consensus motifs of the profiled TFs (Figure 1E) and two unexpected motifs: a strictly spaced Tead double motif and a strictly spaced Gata3 double motif (Figure 1E). These motifs are directly bound by TEAD4 and GATA3, respectively, as confirmed by the sharpness of the ChIP-nexus footprints (Figure 1F). YAP1 also showed sharp binding footprints on the Tead motifs, suggesting a tight physical association between YAP1 and TEAD4 on DNA. Given YAP1's stronger dependency on Hippo signaling, we focused on understanding how YAP1 binding is influenced by other TFs. Notably, the model learned motifs for TFs that we did not profile, including JUN-FOS (AP-1), CTCF, and ELF5 (Figure S1F).\n\n    We then used two complementary model interpretation methods to measure whether and how much, on average, each motif influences YAP1 binding (Figure 1G). The first method uses the contribution scores of mapped motifs from genomic regions (Figure 1G, left) and measures each motif's influence across all observed instances in vivo. The second method uses in silico experiments to measure each motif's influence in a randomized sequence background (Figure 1G, right), and thus tests the learned rules in isolation without the complexity of genomic sequences. We injected a Tead single motif with or without another motif and let the model predict how much any given motif enhanced the binding of YAP1 to the Tead single motif. Both methods revealed similar results, providing internal validation of our model interpretation.\n\n    The Tead motifs, which we will refer to as Tead single and Tead double motifs, were both important as expected, but the AP-1 and Tfap2c motifs also had a sizable contribution to YAP1 binding (Figure 1G). AP-1 is present in many cell types and has previously been shown to cooperate with TEAD and YAP in cancer cell lines, confirming the model's predictions. However, we also identified a strong contribution from TFAP2C, which is critical for specifying TE.\n\n    The strong contribution of TFAP2C suggests that Hippo signaling is influenced by cell-type-specific TFs as hypothesized. Interestingly though, the model did not assign all cell-type-specific TF motifs the same importance (Figure 1G). For example, CDX2 and GATA3 were not predicted to help YAP1 bind, although they are critical for trophoblast identity. This suggests that the rules by which TFs boost the binding of signaling effectors are not obvious, but that, with the help of TF binding data, these rules can be learned with a deep learning model.\n\n    Having analyzed TSC-specific YAP1 binding, we investigated whether high YAP1 binding levels are indicative of enhancer activation. We expect YAP1 to be a strong activator based on previous molecular evidence, but many other TFs have transactivation domains, and thus it is unclear how much YAP1 contributes to enhancer activation at a genome-wide level.\n\n    Since no individual assay unambiguously measures enhancer activity, we performed experiments in TSCs to profile multiple markers of active enhancers: ChIP-nexus for RNA polymerase II (Pol II), TT-seq to capture enhancer transcription, ATAC-seq to measure chromatin accessibility, and ChIP-seq for H3K27ac found on nucleosomes flanking active enhancers (Figure S2A). We identified thousands of enhancers that showed enhancer transcription, chromatin accessibility, and H3K27ac, thus meeting our definition of being active enhancers (Table S4). We selected a few enhancers near important trophoblast genes for further characterization. Named after the nearest gene, these include a Bmp7, Rin3, Ezr, Cited2, Amotl2, Bmp7, Dst, and Tjp1 enhancer. They were validated by cloning the minimal central region into a luciferase reporter assay and measuring their activity in TSCs (Figure S2B).\n\n    These data revealed that active enhancers are indeed associated with high levels of YAP1 binding (Figures 2A and S2E-S2H). As an example, strong binding footprints of TFAP2C, TEAD4, and YAP1 are found at the putative downstream Bmp7 enhancer, and the contribution scores show that BPNet used the Tfap2c and Tead single motifs to predict YAP1 binding (Figure 2A). This region possesses all the characteristic features of active enhancers, with central ATAC-seq accessibility, flanking H3K27ac signal, Pol II occupancy, and bidirectional nascent RNA transcription (Figure 2A).\n\n    To examine the global correlation between YAP1 binding and the markers of enhancer activity, we selected all TEAD4 peaks with a Tead motif; we then compared the 5,000 regions with the highest YAP1 binding to 5,000 regions with median levels of YAP1 binding (Figure 2B). The top YAP1 bound regions showed strong H3K27ac signal, Pol II binding, and nascent transcription adjacent to the central region, while no strong evidence of enhancer activity was observed for the more lowly bound set (Figure 2B). To quantify each TF's effect, we calculated the pairwise correlation between each TF's binding and enhancer activity markers (H3K27ac, Pol II, and nascent RNA) (Figure 2C). Among all TFs, YAP1 binding correlated best with the enhancer activity markers. Given the strong transactivation potential of YAP1, we conclude that YAP1 binding is an important determinant for enhancer activation in TSCs, and hence predicting YAP1 binding should serve as a proxy for predicting enhancer activity.\n\n    If YAP1 binding occurs cooperatively and promotes enhancer activation, the cooperating motifs might activate transcription synergistically. Synergistic activation by two motifs has been documented, but the mechanisms are not clear and could vary. We focused on the Tead single and Tfap2c motifs since this motif pair is frequently found at active enhancers (Figure 2). In addition, genes near these active enhancers are enriched for cell fate commitment and GTPase regulation (Figure S2C), consistent with previous studies. Synergistic activation could occur if the Tead single and Tfap2c motif not only contribute to activation on their own but cause additional activation by promoting YAP1 binding. If so, the activity of such an enhancer would depend on BPNet-learned syntax rules for YAP1 binding and thus may depend on the distance between the motifs.\n\n    To test for synergistic activation, we performed luciferase assays using the 200 bp minimal Bmp7 enhancer, which has a Tead single and Tfap2c motif (shown in Figure 2A). To perturb combinations of these motifs in a controlled way while reducing the chance of introducing unknown variables, we used BPNet: for each motif, we mutated the two bases that contributed most to the predictions and tested whether this led to decreased YAP1 binding (Figure S2D).\n\n    Luciferase assays showed that mutating either motif alone was sufficient to strongly reduce the activity while mutating both almost completely abolished the activity (Figure 3A). Thus, in the presence of one motif, the putative Bmp7 enhancer produced only moderate activity, while together, they resulted in activity that exceeded the sum of each motif's effect. These results show that the Tead single and Tfap2c motifs mediate activation synergistically, presumably at least in part by increasing YAP1 binding.\n\n    To test whether the Tfap2c motif boosts YAP1 binding in a distance-dependent manner, we examined the contribution scores of all Tfap2c motifs found near a Tead single motif. This showed that Tfap2c motifs had significantly higher scores in regions where the motif was within nucleosome distance (<150 bp) and showed even higher scores when closer (Wilcoxon test p < 2e-16, Figures 3B and S3A). When we plotted these contribution scores in the genomic regions directly, they visually decreased with further distances between the Tead single motif and the Tfap2c motif (Figures 3C, S3C, and S3D). This suggests that TFAP2C enhances YAP1 binding in a distance-dependent manner through soft motif syntax.\n\n    We next investigated whether TFAP2C directly helps the recruitment of YAP1 or whether the effect on YAP1 binding is mediated through increased TEAD4 binding (Figure 3D). To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed in silico experiments with randomized sequences and analyzed the binding enhancement of TEAD4, YAP1, and TFAP2C with different motif distances. This revealed that YAP1 and TEAD4 binding both depend on the distance of the nearby Tfap2c motif, causing an over 2.5-fold increase in binding of both when the Tfap2c motif is close (Figures 3D and S3B). Notably, the reverse was not necessarily true: TFAP2C binding was not substantially increased (<1.5-fold) in the presence of a nearby Tead single motif (Figure 3D), but showed some increase in the presence of a Tead double motif (Figures S3B and S3D). Given that binding cooperativity is usually assumed to be mutual, this directionality is surprising but consistent with previous observations of soft motif syntax.\n\n    To validate the Tead single-Tfap2c soft motif syntax, we performed luciferase reporter experiments on the putative Rin3, Dst, and Adcy7 enhancers. Using BPNet predictions as a guide for designing experiments, we changed the distances between the Tead single and Tfap2c motifs at three independent regions, by deleting the Tead single motif through minimal mutations and introducing the same motif at a different location (Figures 3F and S3E). In all three cases, the reporter activity of the enhancer changed in the expected direction. For example, when we moved the Tead single motif in the minimal Rin3 enhancer further away from the Tfap2c motif (from 20 bp away to 60 bp away), BPNet predicted lower TEAD4 binding (Figure 3E). This lower binding mirrored the lower activity measured in the luciferase assay (Figure 3F). Moving the two motifs closer to each other increased the luciferase reporter activity of the minimal Dst and Adcy7 enhancers (Figure S3E).\n\n    To confirm that these distance effects are also observed in the genomic context, we performed CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations in TSCs using homologous recombination on the endogenous Rin3 enhancer (Figures S3F and S3G). ChIP experiments on this edited cell line confirmed the reduced TEAD4 binding, H3K27ac, and Pol II levels at the Rin3 enhancer (Figure 3G), while other enhancers remained unchanged (Figure S3H). This demonstrates that changing the distance between motifs through controlled minimal mutations measurably affects enhancer activity markers in an in vivo endogenous context.\n\n    Taken together, we have identified genome-wide rules by which cell-type-specific TF motifs can enhance the binding of the Hippo signaling effectors. We validated that Tfap2c motifs enhance TEAD4/YAP1 through soft motif syntax in a distance-dependent manner, resulting in synergistic enhancer activation. This could represent a general mechanism for how cell-type-specific TFs boost the activity of signaling pathways.\n\n    So far, we have focused on the genome-wide rules and mechanisms by which cell-type-specific TFs influence Hippo pathway activity. To push the boundaries of what can be learned with our approach, we next asked whether we could also discover novel molecular details of the Hippo pathway effectors themselves, which are mechanistically well studied.\n\n    Notably, BPNet discovered the strictly spaced Tead double motif (Figure 1E), which is not considered a canonical regulatory element of the Hippo pathway, although it has been discovered multiple times. The first characterization occurred on the SV40 enhancer, but its identity remained unclear since it did not resemble the Tead single motif. Even after the Tead double motif had been discovered in Drosophila and cancer cells, it often remained unreported in genomics studies.\n\n    To test whether the Tead double motif has simply been overlooked or whether the BPNet approach is particularly suitable to learn this motif, we analyzed our data using traditional genomics approaches (Figure 4A). We found that it is easy to miss the Tead double motif by MEME or HOMER (Figure S4A), but with prior knowledge of suitable settings, a position weight matrix (PWM) similar to that discovered by BPNet/TF-MoDISco can be identified (Figure 4A). However, when FIMO was used to map motif instances in the bound genomic regions with this PWM, the mapped motifs disagreed with the in vivo TEAD4 ChIP-nexus data. While CWM-mapped Tead double motifs consistently show strong TEAD4 footprints, confirming their correct mapping, the PWM-mapped motifs show far fewer footprints (Figure 4B). This problem was less pronounced with Tead single motifs, which mapped more accurately with PWM scanning (Figure S4B). This shows that BPNet outperforms traditional methods in mapping functional motif instances, and that Tead double motifs are particularly challenging to map.\n\n    We next performed in silico experiments to test whether the Tead double motif itself was learned more accurately by BPNet or whether the genomic context provided the necessary context to make better predictions (Figure 4C). The key to CWM scanning is that it considers BPNet model-derived contribution scores in each individual genomic region (Figure 4A). These contribution scores depend on the binding strength of the motif itself and the genomic context, such as neighboring motifs. To distinguish which one was key, we in silico injected the PWM-mapped and CWM-mapped motifs into a randomized sequence background and predicted TEAD4 binding (Figure 4C, methods). This revealed that the CWM-mapped motifs themselves had higher predicted binding than the PWM-mapped motifs, and that this was due to the contribution scores. Genomic context modulated the binding predictions, but did not explain the better performance of CWM scanning (Figures 4C and S4C). This shows that the CWM-mapped Tead double motifs are more accurate because they incorporate BPNet's learned binding strength, and that the binding strength of this motif is not well modeled by a PWM.\n\n    The challenging aspect of the Tead double motif is that it is a long sequence pattern where many bases do not strongly contribute and are highly variable among the mapped motif sequences (Figure 4D). When we analyzed the sequence patterns of the more regular Tead single motifs, the vast majority are commonly occurring patterns, with high-affinity motifs being the most frequent (Figure 4D, left). In contrast, only a tiny fraction of the mapped Tead double motifs have recurring sequence patterns, and the most frequent patterns are not those with the highest predicted affinity (Figure 4D, right). This can explain why a frequency-based PWM representation does not accurately reflect the binding strength and why it has been difficult to identify the Tead double motif on the SV40 enhancer, while the BPNet model learned this motif (Figure S4D).\n\n    Having established the widespread occurrence of the Tead double motif, we asked how much the Tead double motif promotes enhancer activity compared with a Tead single motif. Using our validated putative Cited2 enhancer, we replaced the high-affinity Tead single motif with either a weak Tead double motif (mapped by both PWM and CWM scanning), and a strong Tead double motif (mapped by CWM scanning only, highlighted in Figure 4C). BPNet predicted that replacement with the strong Tead double motif caused a large increase in TEAD4 binding, while the weaker one caused a reduction in binding (Figure 4E). When assayed in a luciferase assay, the strong Tead double motif caused an over 8-fold increase in activity compared with the wild-type Tead single motif. Interestingly, even the weak Tead double motif showed increased activity (~1.9-fold) over the Tead single motif despite lower TEAD4 binding (Figure 4F). This shows that even a weaker Tead double motif is highly active, explaining why it can be functional in so many different sequence patterns.\n\n    These results suggest that the Tead double motif is an important element of the Hippo pathway in TSCs. To test whether this can be generalized to other TEAD family members and cell types, we analyzed BPNet models trained on TEAD1-4 ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE portal (https://www.encodeproject.org/). BPNet discovered the Tead double motif in diverse human cell types for different TEAD family members (Figure S4E), showing that the Tead double motif is generally a widespread canonical motif of the Hippo pathway.\n\n    The nature of the Tead double motif, its strong activity, and strict spacing, suggest that it is bound cooperatively by two TEAD4 molecules. Such cooperativity is also supported by previous gel shift analyses, but it is not known how strong the two TEAD4 molecules interact with each other. They could already come as a dimer, as known for JUN-FOS, or they could only interact on DNA when a corresponding DNA sequence brings them into contact. We, therefore, explored the mechanism of TEAD4 cooperativity using BPNet and all-atom MD simulations (Figure 5).\n\n    The MD simulations were performed by placing two TEAD4 DNA binding domains (PDB: 5GZB) on the high-affinity functional Tead double motif from the putative Tjp1 enhancer (Figures 5A, 5B, S5A, and S5B). This complex was highly similar to one predicted by AlphaFold3 (Figure S5M) and remained stable during the simulations over 500 ns, allowing us to quantify the protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions over time (measured as buried surface area A2) (Figures 5C and S5G, left). We also confirmed that the results were similar using the Tead double motif from the putative Amotl2 enhancer (Figures S5A and S5B, bottom, and S5E) or when using a different force field (CHARMM27 instead of FF19SB) (Figure S5F).\n\n    Our MD simulations revealed that the intermolecular TEAD4 protein-protein interactions are sensitive to the DNA template, consistent with BPNet's predicted changes in binding levels (Figures S5H and S5N, left). The protein-protein interactions were strongest in the presence of the correctly spaced Tead double motif, and weaker when simulating with a 1-bp deletion, a 1-bp insertion, or mutations in one-half of the DNA sequence (Figures 5B, 5C, S5C, S5D, and S5G, right). The protein-protein contacts occur through amino acid residues within a region that is important for TEAD4's cooperative binding to the Tead double motif and is highly conserved between TEAD family members and across evolution (Figures 5D and 5E), consistent with the widespread role of the Tead double motif.\n\n    At the same time, these protein-protein interactions were surprisingly dynamic and labile (Figure 5C), arguing against TEAD4 forming dimers before binding to DNA. They changed on the scale of ~100 ns, which is much shorter than the tens of microseconds seen for stable protein-protein complexes. The contacts made by the involved residues also varied in their molecular details over time. Contacts such as hydrogen bonds (Figure 5D, inset) formed and then dissociated, with no single interaction persisting for the entire trajectory (Video S1). This suggests that the initial DNA-templated protein-protein interactions between two TEAD4 molecules are labile and dynamic in nature, although binding of this complex in vivo may be further stabilized by the Hippo effector partners YAP1 or TAZ.\n\n    To analyze TEAD4 binding cooperativity in vivo and test its dependence on Hippo signaling, we leveraged BPNet (Figures 5F and 5G). Since BPNet accurately predicts TEAD4 binding on Tead single and Tead double motifs, we measured the cooperativity on the Tead double motif as the observed increase in binding over the expected additive binding on each Tead motif contained in the Tead double motif (Figure 5F). This showed consistently strong cooperativity across the genome, with an average of ~4-fold higher TEAD4 binding than expected from an additive model (Figure 5F).\n\n    To test whether this cooperativity was dependent on Hippo signaling, we performed TEAD4 ChIP-nexus in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) where YAP1/TAZ is not nuclear, and trained an independent BPNet model on these data (Figure S5I). In these cells, TEAD4 binding was overall lower than in TSCs, resulting in much fewer bound instances (Figures 5G, S5J, and S5K). This is consistent with TEAD4 binding being stabilized at the Tead double motif by partners in TSCs. However, we observed cooperativity even in ESCs, with a >2-fold increase over the additive signal (Figure 5G). This is consistent with the MD model, where some degree of TEAD4 cooperativity on the Tead double motif is observed in the absence of YAP1/TAZ.\n\n    Finally, we investigated whether the labile interactions we observe for TEAD4-TEAD4 are within range of what has been observed for other TFs that interact on DNA (Figure 5H). Since MD simulations are rarely performed, we quantified and compared the protein-protein buried surface area between TFs from crystal structures, preferably on TFs studied here. Our high-affinity simulation gave an average buried surface area of 112 A2 between the two TEAD4 molecules. For comparison, the JUN-FOS dimer is held together through much stronger protein-protein interactions (2,466 A2), consistent with dimerization before binding DNA. GATA-GATA formed intermediate interactions (530 A2), suggesting that the complex is DNA templated but not as labile as the TEAD4-TEAD4 complex. Finally, we found interaction strengths akin to those of TEAD4-TEAD4 (Figure 5H), most notably those of IRF with RelA (105 A2), p50 (94 A2), and ATF-2 (180 A2) in the enhanceosome model (Figure S5L). This example is particularly relevant as the TFs have been reported to cooperate with a measurable effect on transcription. These results point toward labile interactions being a plausible mechanism for DNA-templated cooperativity.\n\n    Taken together, our results suggest that two TEAD4 molecules cooperate with each other on the Tead double motif through transient and labile interactions (Figure 5H). We propose that labile interactions make this type of cooperativity highly dependent on the sequence template and allow additional stabilization by partners to further fine-tune the readout.\n\n    Having shown that the Tead double motif mediates TEAD4 cooperative binding genome-wide, we wanted to confirm that it mediates the response to the Hippo pathway in vivo. We added the Tead double motif to an endogenous enhancer in TSCs and reintegrated these cells into mouse embryos. We selected the putative Ezr enhancer because it contains a Tead single motif, has all the hallmarks of being an active TSC enhancer (Figure S2F), and its putative target gene Ezr encodes an actin-associated protein that is highly expressed in TSCs. We hypothesized that replacing the Tead single motif with a high-affinity Tead double motif would increase the enhancer's response to Hippo signaling in vivo.\n\n    While it is typically easy to destroy the activity of an endogenous enhancer by mutating relevant TF motifs, it is more challenging to engineer mutations that increase the activity since sequence changes can have unexpected side effects. However, deep learning models are ideal for exploring and evaluating possible mutations, as shown in Drosophila. We, therefore, replaced the Tead single motif with a Tead double motif in such a way that BPNet predicts an increase in TEAD4 binding (Figure 6A, left).\n\n    We then used CRISPR-Cas9-induced homologous recombination to edit the endogenous enhancer in our TSCs (Figure S6A). We performed TEAD4 ChIP-nexus experiments on the edited cells and found that the TEAD4 binding footprint indeed matched the one predicted by BPNet (Figures 6A, right, and S6B). We also tested the modified enhancer sequence in the luciferase assay and found it to increase enhancer activity (Figure S6C). The increase was moderate (~1.5-fold), likely because the wild-type enhancer activity was already high to begin with. To test whether this change affects the expression of Ezr, we performed RNA-seq on the edited cells with the Tead double motif and the wild-type cells with the Tead single motif. This revealed a moderate, statistically significant increase in Ezr transcript levels in the edited cells (Figure 6B).\n\n    We next tested whether this edit increases Ezr expression in mouse embryos in a cell-type-specific way. We marked the edited TSCs (and wild-type TSCs as control) with td-Tomato, aggregated these cells with early mouse embryos at the 4-8 cell stage, and analyzed the embryos when they reached the blastocyst stage, where the outer TE cells are clearly distinguishable from the inner cell mass (ICM) by their expression of Cdx2. We performed HCR-FISH to precisely quantify the expression of Ezr and Cdx2 in these embryos (Figures 6C and S6D-S6F).\n\n    Ezr transcripts were specifically increased in edited cells but not wild-type cells, and only when they became TE cells with nuclear YAP1 (Figure 6C, right). Not all added TSCs maintained their TE identity but occasionally lost Cdx2 expression and acquired ICM identity (Figure S6E), consistent with cell fate plasticity at this stage. Notably, when the edited cells lost TE identity, Ezr transcripts were no longer increased. These findings show that the increased activity of the Tead double motif is specific to the cell type with nuclear YAP1. They also demonstrate that, with the help of BPNet's predictive framework, enhancers can be manipulated to respond more strongly to a cell-type-specific signaling pathway in vivo.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Here, we show as a proof of principle that the cell-type specificity of the Hippo signaling pathway in TSCs is encoded in the cis-regulatory sequences and that the sequence rules reflect the mechanisms by which these sequences are read out. Canonical effectors such as TEAD4 and YAP1 of the Hippo pathway are well studied, but how these effectors mediate different transcriptional responses in different cell types has been a challenging problem, often attributed to the combinatorial complexity of the signaling components or effects of chromatin. The fact that we can train a deep learning model to accurately predict the binding of the signaling effectors in TSCs from sequence alone, and that the binding is predictive of enhancer activation, shows that the cell-type-specific response to Hippo signaling is sequence encoded. Moreover, we found that the learned sequence rules are precise enough to reveal mechanistic insights into how signaling pathway effectors function and interact with cell-type-specific partner TFs.\n\n    The power of this approach comes from training a highly predictive base-resolution sequence model. Since the model can accurately predict test sequences it has never seen during training, it has learned general TF binding rules that apply genome-wide for the cell type it was trained on. These rules include the motif's strength (as shown here for the Tead double motif) and incorporate input from neighboring motifs (e.g., the contribution of Tfap2c toward YAP1 binding). As a result, the tens of thousands of motifs that we mapped inside active enhancers are more accurate than motifs mapped by traditional methods. For example, a frequency-based PWM could not accurately map the long and variable Tead double motif in the genome, explaining why studies in the past did not identify this motif as a widespread canonical element of the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, we used the predictive accuracy of the model for designing follow-up experiments, e.g., performing minimal mutations to achieve a certain outcome.\n\n    A key focus of this study was, however, to interpret the trained model to derive mechanistic insights. We found that the model learned precise rules by which motifs combinatorially predict YAP1 binding, including syntax rules that determine how the distances between motifs affect the binding cooperativity. These syntax rules should depend on the molecular mechanisms by which the corresponding TFs interact. Since we re-discovered expected motifs and their interactions, and validated novel findings, we conclude that the sequence rules indeed mirror molecular mechanisms downstream of the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\n    The motif syntax rules suggested that cell-type-specific TFAP2C boosts YAP1 binding and enhancer activation at motif distances of up to ~150 bp, with stronger effects at closer distances. This soft syntax, which we experimentally validated, is unlikely to involve specific protein-protein interactions and instead points to a nucleosome-mediated mechanism. Such a mechanism, while molecularly unclear, could explain how signaling TFs can receive input from a wide variety of TFs in different cell types without having evolved specific protein-protein interactions. Nevertheless, we found that some cell-type-specific TFs had a stronger contribution to YAP1 binding than others, suggesting that specific properties make them better partner TFs. TFAP2C is likely a strong partner because it is highly expressed, can pioneer chromatin, and interacts with co-activators, which could help YAP1 form condensates. An important challenge in the future will be to measure how TFs interact with each other in different cell types and which properties drive these interactions.\n\n    A different type of syntax was found for the Tead double motif, where two strictly spaced Tead motifs mediate cooperative TEAD4 binding. Using MD simulations, we found that this motif allows two TEAD4 molecules to directly interact with each other, but the protein-protein interactions were surprisingly labile, transient, and dependent on the DNA sequence. Such weak interactions between TFs have been observed in the enhanceosome crystal structure, but their dynamic nature and significance were not known at the time. We propose that such transient interactions are strong enough to stabilize the complex but weak enough that they depend on matching DNA sequences and can be further stabilized through signaling pathway activities.\n\n    In summary, our sequence-driven interpretable deep learning approach reveals motif dependencies and syntax rules that correspond to distinct molecular mechanisms and suggest novel hypotheses that can be further studied experimentally. For example, we also discovered a palindromic Gata double motif. Since previous studies have shown that GATA zinc fingers can bind DNA cooperatively, it should be possible to identify the structural basis for GATA3 binding to this specific motif. Importantly, our approach identifies TF cooperativities that are in many cases cell-type specific and thus open the door to systematically study how signaling pathways target different enhancers in different cell types.\n\n    A limitation of our approach is that it depends on high-quality binding data in the cell type of interest. While BPNet can model lower-resolution ChIP-seq data, the cell-type specificity of signaling effectors makes obtaining comprehensive data across cell types beyond ENCODE challenging. Model training and interpretation also have limitations. For example, we noticed that YAP1 binding correlates better with enhancer activity markers than TEAD4 binding, yet the model interrogation suggested that YAP1 binding is mostly boosted through increased binding of TEAD4. Finally, the precision of MD simulations can give a deceptive sense of accuracy if the simulation does not adequately sample conformation space. Since our simulated system is large, we cannot capture a complete equilibrium ensemble, making MD results a snapshot of the possible behavior of the TEAD4-DNA complex.",

        "Introduction": "    Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) or esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a rare malignancy of the nasal cavity that likely arises from the olfactory neuro-epithelium. An olfactory epithelial origin is suggested by the tumor anatomical location, morphological features, and characteristic gene expression patterns. ONB was first described in 1924 and named \"L'esthesioneuroepitheliome olfactif.\" Due to lack of information on its histological origin, additional names have since been used including olfactory neurocytoma and others. The incidence of ONB is 0.4/million/year, accounting for approximately 2%-3% of nasal cavity tumors. To date, no specific risk factors have been identified for ONB. Hyams histologic grading and Kadish, modified Kadish, and Dulguerov staging are traditionally used to clinically characterize the tumor and aid in treatment planning.\n\n    The rare character of ONB has limited the sample size available for cytogenetic, genomic, and epigenetic studies. Although multiple manuscripts have identified complex genetic and cytogenetic patterns in ONB, only a subset of reported genomic aberrations were consistent across different studies. While these inconsistencies limit the generalizable conclusions regarding the mutational landscape of this disease, it may indicate that ONB is defined by a set of heterogeneous alterations. Previous cytogenetic studies have reported that deletion on chromosome 11 and gain on chromosome 1p were associated with poor prognosis in ONB. In addition to cytogenetic analysis, various sequencing approaches such as pyrosequencing, and more recently next generation sequencing (NGS), have also been used to explore genomic alterations in patients with ONB. Although the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) database as well as other publications in the field of ONB report alterations in TP53, EGFR, CTNBB1, KIT, RET, APC, FGFR2, KDR, PDGFRA, SMAD4, MET, CDH1, SUZ12, PPP6C, IKZF1, TGFBR2, CARD11 and CDKN2C genes, the fraction of ONB with mutations in these genes that present opportunities for targeted therapy is estimated to be up to 50%.\n\n    The goal of this systematic review is to summarize the available ONB cytogenetics, genomics, and epigenetics literature and to suggest potential targetable pathways for precision therapeutics.",
        "Methods": "    A systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. We conducted a systematic literature search using Cochrane, Embase, Pubmed, and Scopus databases. Articles published before May 2020 were included in the review. The key words used for the search included Esthesioneuroblastoma, Olfactory Neuroblastoma, nasal glial heterotopia, nasal glioma, neuroblastoma, nose glioma, olfactory esthesioneuroblastoma, olfactory neuroblastomas, paranasal sinus-nasal cavity, nasal glial heterotopia, olfactory, genomics, genetics, epigenomic, pharmacogenomics, phylogenomic, epigenetic, epigenetics, miRNA, histone, methylation, acetylation, and epigenesis.\n\n    PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Scopus search results were selected as they provided the most comprehensive literature search for the topic. Duplicate articles were removed using Covidence. The title and abstract of all potentially relevant studies were screened for their contents ensuring adherence to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review.\n\n    Cytogenetic studies on clinical samples for ONB patients\n\n    Genomics studies on clinical samples of ONB patients\n\n    Epigenetics studies on clinical samples of ONB patients\n\n    Studies without full text\n\n    Studies not published in English\n\n    Review articles\n\n    Inclusion criteria:Exclusion criteria:\n\n    Data was extracted from all the eligible studies for systematic review. Experimental data involving study design, sample type, and experimental technique was collected from the research articles exploring genetic make-up of patients using various genomics and cytogenetic techniques. Cytogenetic and genomic alterations as well as epigenetic data were extracted from all previous studies.\n\n    Two independent reviewers critically assessed the content of all the studies included in this systematic review. A total of 115 abstracts were categorized into three groups: \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"maybe\"; where \"yes\" indicated abstracts deciphering genetic and cytogenetic changes, \"no\" stood for abstracts depicting that study was a review article or was not published in English, whereas \"maybe\" defined studies focused on head and neck cancers or other cancers of the sinonasal cavity. Among the 115 screened abstracts, 79 were found to be unrelated and were excluded. The full texts of the remaining 36 studies were screened and marked as \"yes\" and \"no.\" This time, \"yes\" indicated studies that explored genetics and cytogenetics of ONB tumors, and \"no\" was assigned to the studies focusing on head and neck as well as sinonasal cancers that did not include ONB samples. Of the 36 studies, 24 research articles and 12 abstracts were included in this review. These 24 studies were directly related to ONB. The 12 abstracts included in our overview were published in conferences and meetings and explored the genetic and cytogenetic makeup of ONB patients.",
        "Results": "    Cytogenetic changes in ONB patients were studied by using different techniques but were limited in number. Initial research hypothesized that a (11;22) (q24;q12) translocation suggested that ONB was related to Ewing Sarcoma. However, a later study analyzing 5 ONB tumors could not identify the EWS gene rearrangement by FISH or the Ewing sarcoma-associated MIC2 antigen by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, an additional study that performed RT-PCR on two ONB specimens did not identify EWS-FLI1 or EWS-ERG translocations, suggesting that ONB is not a member of the primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumor-Ewing's group.\n\n    In a later study of 22 patients, comparative genomic hybridization identified deletion of chromosome 3p and high copy number amplifications on 17q in 90%-100% of tumors analyzed. However, despite the high frequency of these chromosomal changes, cytogenetic studies have ultimately revealed that ONB tumors are cytogenetically complex and the landscape of chromosomal aberrations varies widely. The inconclusive reports may stem from the very small number of cases analyzed, with many of the cytogenetic studies having been carried out on only a single patient. The list of detected chromosomal aberrations is summarized in Table 1. While these cytogenetic alterations can potentially be used as predictive and prognostic biomarkers, their biological relevance remains to be validated.\n\n    Compared to cytogenetic approaches, exploring the genome by high throughput NGS technologies provides a more detailed view of the tumor genome at the nucleotide level. As ONB is rare, there are no large genomic studies to date, with the largest genomic study conducted in a cohort of 41 ONB specimens. Among the 41 tumors, 28 harbored genomic alterations. The study reported TP53 gene as the most commonly altered along with genomic alterations in PIK3CA, NF1, CDK2NA and CDKN2C genes. Genetic changes in TP53 were detected in the DNA binding domain of this tumor suppressor gene, and 17% of patients carried splice site, missense (P278S, R248W, G245C and P278R) and truncation (P190del) alterations. It was also observed that 7% of tumors in this study had alterations in PIK3CA (missense mutations at positions E545Q and E542K) and truncation alterations in NF1, CDKN2A, and CDKN2C genes. Another case report has also documented the presence of a TP53 missense mutation and CDKN2C loss-of-function alteration in a patient with ONB. Notably, the gain of function alteration detected in PIK3CA gene were located in the accessory domain, which has been suggested to be associated with substrate presentation according to the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP).\n\n    Gallia et al found deletions involving the dystrophin (DMD) locus in 12 of 14 (86%) of ONB tumors analyzed in their study. Alterations in DMD gene were detected in both exonic region as well as 5'UTR. DMD has been identified as a tumor suppressor in other tumor types. Interestingly, one of the two tumors that did not display alterations in the Xp21.1 locus, showed a somatic homozygous deletion in LAMA2, bringing the number of ONBs with deletions of genes involved in the development of muscular dystrophies to 13 of 14 (93%).\n\n    Classe et al screened DNA extracted from 14 ONB samples and matched germline DNA from blood or adjacent normal tissue by whole exome sequencing and found that 21.4% of patients carried single nucleotide alterations in the TP53 gene, with 7.14% of these mutations reported to be stop-gain, resulting in a premature transcription termination.\n\n    Topcagic et al, have retrospectively analyzed 23 ONB patient samples by using targeted DNA sequencing, in situ hybridization and gene fusion assays. DNA sequencing of 15 patient samples was carried out; that included a panel of 46 genes in 10 cases, and an extended panel of 592 genes by NGS in 5 cases. In these 15 patients, the study detected alterations in TP53 (H214Y, c673-1G>T and T155_V157del), CTNNB1 (S33_H36del), EGFR (Q276R and T572R), APC (A1474T), cKIT (G565V), cMET (L1321I), PDGFRA (V546L), CDH1 (D756Y), FH (K477dup) and SMAD4 (N468fs) genes. Among the 15 patients analyzed in this study, 20% exhibited missense mutation, single nucleotide variation or deletion in DNA binding domain of the TP53 gene.\n\n    Lazo de la Vega et al, studied 20 ONB samples using targeted multiplexed PCR based NGS. While no recurrent alterations were detected in their study, copy number alterations affecting chromosomes 5, 7, 11 and 20 were identified in a subset of patients. In two tumors, co-amplification of CCND1 at 11q13 and FGFR3 at 4p16 was observed, resulting in potential driver oncogenic event. CCND1 is a core cell cycle regulator that is frequently overexpressed in many solid tumors including head and neck cancers. Missense mutation V272M in DNA binding domain of TP53 gene was detected in one patient. PTEN gene exhibited nonsense mutation Y16X in one patient, resulting in a truncated PTEN protein which is unable to inhibit the PIK3/mTOR pathway. Although there was little overlap of genetic alterations identified by different studies, most of the genomic studies have reported the TP53 gene as frequently mutated in ONB patients, suggesting that a complex signaling network regulated by p53 can be a potential therapeutic target (Table 2).\n\n    Several studies have also detected IDH2 gene alterations in ONB samples sequencing. However, the true frequency of IDH2 aberrations remains controversial. For example, Dogan et al, screened 9 ONB samples using targeted exome sequencing and none of these ONB samples showed alterations in IDH2. In contrast, Classe et al, have detected R172 IDH2 mutation in 16.7% of ONB specimens, which were further validated by pyrosequencing. Gay et al, screened 41 patients and reported two missense mutations, R172S and R172T, in different patients each carrying one alteration. Various studies have reported short variants, truncations, rearrangements, focal copy number alterations and non-focal number alterations in a variety of other genes, but at much lower frequency (Table 2).\n\n    Currently, epigenetic data on ONB are very limited and focus predominantly on DNA methylation. Capper et al, carried out a microarray-based methylation profiling of 66 ONB samples and distinguished four unique subgroups within the histopathological diagnosis of ONB. A total of 64% of ONB tumors were used to define the \"core ONB\" genome-wide methylation profile, while a total of 7 samples formed a second group with global hypermethylation features that were also associated with R172 IDH2 hotspot mutations in all cases. The third group consisted of only 4 tumors with a high level of overall methylation but absence CpG island methylation and lacking IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. The group was heterogeneous and did not fit any of the above inclusion criteria.\n\n    The unique methylome profile of ONB was further confirmed in a study by Dogan et al, in a series of sinonasal tumors that included ONB, using a DNA methylation microarray. While only 4 ONB samples were included, they formed a distinct cluster based on a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering analysis.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The current review systematically summarizes the genetic, cytogenetic, and epigenetic alterations that have been previously reported in ONB. Although heterogeneous chromosomal instability in ONB were predicted by various studies, more cytogenetic alterations were observed in high grade tumors in comparison to low grade malignancies, which is not surprising and has been previously observed in other cancers, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Loss of 3p was found to be the most common chromosomal alteration among patients with ONB and this alteration has been reported to be associated with resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy in other settings. Additional studies have predicted metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with deletion in chromosome 11 and gain on chromosome 1p. While frequent cytogenetic alterations were detected in all chromosomes besides 8 and 20, Valli et al, reported that neither Kadish stage nor Hymans grade was significantly associated with any of the cytogenetic alterations detected in their study. One cytogenetic study that analyzed primary and recurrent malignancies, found that there were decreased trisomies and increased number of partial gains in relapsed tumor in comparison to the primary disease. Patients exhibiting aneuploidic alterations have been treated with energy and proteotoxic stress-inducing compounds such as AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside), 17-AAG (17-allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin) and chloroquinone, however, the applicability of these treatment modalities to ONB requires further investigation. More importantly, platinum-based agents were reported to be efficient against cancer cells with heterogeneous chromosomal instability, suggesting that platinum-based chemotherapy may be an effective approach in treating this disease among the patients with chromosomal instability. In fact, cisplatin has shown efficacy as induction chemotherapy for ONB.\n\n    Although comprehensive molecular profiling for patients with advanced and metastatic disease can be useful in designing defined therapeutic strategies, sequencing of ONB has been limited by low sample sizes due to rarity of the disease. The COSMIC database and published studies have reported alterations in a large number genes, including TP53, EGFR, CTNNB1, KIT, RET, APC, FGFR2, KDR, PDGFRA, SMAD4, MET, PIK3CA, NF1, CDKN2A, CDH1, SUZ12, PP6C, IKZF1, TGFBR2, CARD11, CDKN2C, SND1, cMET and CREB3L1, with subset of these genes being either known tumor drivers or tumor suppressors. For example, alterations in cKIT and PGDFRA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tumors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib, have been investigated in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring the gain-of-function mutations in aforementioned genes, and may be considered for treating ONB patients given the high frequency of cases harboring such alterations. Gay et al have reported mutations in genes associated with mTOR, CDK and growth factor signaling pathways. Inhibitors of these pathways have been used in various cancers including breast, head and neck, lymphoma, and lung cancer.\n\n    The findings of the current review and data extracted from COSMIC database suggest that TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in ONB. Known alterations in TP53 include stop/gain, short variants, truncations, rearrangements and SNPs in the DNA binding domain. These alterations are commonly associated with loss of protein function and have been reported to be involved in driving tumorigenesis of various tumor types, including breast, lung, colorectal and other solid malignancies. In general, ~50% of human cancers carry a loss of function mutation resulting in abolished or reduced p53 protein function. TP53 gene mutations are associated with multiple oncogenic processes, such as loss of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis, DNA repair, as well as inhibition of mTOR signaling axis. The enhanced number of alterations in TP53 among patients with ONB can pave the path for designing new therapies focused on restoring or enhancing the p53 tumor suppression activities. Various molecules including nutlins, MI series, RO5693, PRIMA-1, and RITA have been developed for treatment of cancers with TP53 mutations. Nutlins function by targeting negative regulators of p53 protein, MI series function by reactivation of p53 by p21 mediated cell cycle arrest, whereas PRIMA-1 binds to p53 by Michael addition after getting converted into methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), and its binding at cysteine residues induces apoptosis in tumor cells. Another molecule, COTI-1, induces DNA damage signaling. Many of these molecules are in the preclinical phase, except for two compounds APR-246 and COTI-2 that have progressed to clinical trials. None of these approaches have been tested in ONB patients. Of note, tumors harboring TP53 alterations may respond better to WEE kinase inhibitors that function by acting against G2-M checkpoint regulators of the cell cycle, WEE1 and CHK1.\n\n    While epigenetics research in ONB is recently emerging, it has already demonstrated a promising practical implementation in clinical practice, as ONB harbors unique genome-wide methylation profiles in comparison with other sinonasal malignancies. A pattern of global hypermethylation was described in a subgroup of ONB tumors that harbor R172 IDH2 hotspot mutations, corroborating the complex interplay between genomic and epigenomic regulation. It has been previously described that IDH mutations lead to neomorphic enzymatic activity, and acute myeloid leukemia patients that harbor IDH mutations also demonstrate a hypermethylation phenotype. This represents an attractive area for pharmaceutical targeting, as in vitro data using IDH2 R140Q expression in TF-1 cells that reflects global hypermethylation of clinical acute myeloid leukemia, was reversed by an IDH2 small molecule inhibitor, AGI-6780. It is likely that additional epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs play a role in the onset, progression, and ultimately therapeutic response of ONB, but those remain yet to be determined.\n\n    The rare character of ONB has limited the sample size available for cytogenetic, genomic, and epigenetic studies and contributes to the limitations of this systematic review. Furthermore, the exclusion criteria included studies not in English or without full text which may have limited the scope of articles reviewed. Given its rarity, studies characterizing the landscape of genomic alterations in ONB are still limited, and targeted therapies are lacking for this disease. Thus, additional studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further advance our understanding of the molecular processes underlying the progression of ONB. An increase in available molecular data will assist in detecting potential correlations between changes in the ONB specific genetic landscape and a clinical course of the disease. Furthermore, alterations specific to high grade and low grade ONB may be used for designing novel therapeutic approaches aiming to improve the overall survival of patients with this rare but aggressive disease. As the number of fully sequenced ONB cases continues to grow, comprehensive, well-powered molecular analyses will allow international collaborative networks to correlate the genomic and epigenomic profiles with clinical outcomes and create a map of novel targets for therapeutic exploitation. Not only will this significantly improve our understanding of ONB pathogenesis, but also allow us to guide targeted therapies and potentially adopt these techniques in the routine diagnostic work-up of our patients.",

        "Title": "    Transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis of aging-associated inflammatory signature in mouse liver",
        "Abstract": "    Aging-associated dysbiosis leads to chronic inflammation and the development of a range of aging-related diseases. The gut microbiota crosstalks with the host by providing lipid metabolites and modulating metabolic functions. However, the precise mechanism by which the gut microbiota regulates aging is unknown. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the gut microbiota on the transcriptome and lipidome associated with aging in mouse liver.\n\n    RNA-sequencing was conducted on the livers of young and aged male and female-specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice to comprehensively analyze transcriptomic alterations with aging. We also reanalyzed our previously reported results on aging-associated changes in the hepatic lipidome to investigate the gut microbiota-dependent hepatic lipidome signatures associated with aging.\n\n    In contrast to the findings in male mice, the changes in hepatic transcriptome associated with aging were attenuated in female GF mice compared with those in SPF mice. In particular, the gene sets associated with inflammatory signatures (i.e., inflammation and tissue remodeling) were found to be suppressed in female GF mice. The ChIP-Atlas database predicted that transcription factors associated with sex differences may be involved in the gene signature of aged female GF mice. Significant differences in the lipid profile were observed between aged SPF and GF female mice, including in bile acids, sterol sulfates, lysophospholipids, oxidized triacylglycerols, vitamin D, and phytoceramides. Moreover, notable alterations were identified in the quality of phospholipids and sphingolipids. Integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis identified candidate enzymes responsible for the change of lipid profiles in aged female mice.\n\n    The findings of this study offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiota regulates aging-related phenotypes such as inflammation in the liver, possibly through modulating lipid metabolism in a sex-dependent manner.\n\n    The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s41232-025-00377-2.",
        "Introduction": "    Aging is a complex process characterized by progressive changes in the physiological functions of various organs. This in turn increases the risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases including metabolic syndrome, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Dysregulated composition of gut microbiota (dysbiosis), chronic low-grade inflammatory responses, and abnormal metabolic functions involving lipids are frequently associated with aging and are implicated in the development of aging-related diseases.\n\n    The gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining host homeostasis, including digestion and absorption of food, production of nutrients, and regulation of the host immune system. Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota associated with aging have implications for human health and longevity. Meanwhile, in mice, fecal transplantation from aged specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice into young germ-free (GF) mice has been shown to cause obesity and systemic inflammation in the recipients. In addition, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced symptoms of obesity, insulin resistance, and steatosis were shown to be suppressed in GF mice compared with those in conventional (CONV) mice. It has also been reported that the systemic inflammation associated with aging as observed in CONV mice was attenuated in GF mice. These reports have drawn attention to the role of the gut microbiota in aging, but little is currently known about the mechanisms underlying gut microbiota colonization and aging.\n\n    Intestinal bacteria not only provide the host with metabolites but also affect the host's metabolic functions, thereby influencing its lipid profile. The liver is the primary organ where metabolites absorbed from the intestinal tract through the portal vein are processed. Consequently, liver function is largely influenced by the gut ecosystem. It has been demonstrated that, in GF mice, there is a reduction in de novo hepatic lipogenesis and changes in the composition of fatty acids. In GF mice, the lack of gut microbiota results in the disruption of feedback control mechanisms regulating bile acid production. In addition, sexual dimorphism has been observed in the hepatic expression of metabolic enzymes and in the gut microbiota, which may affect not only the lipid profile of the host but also the physiology and pathophysiology of the liver resulting from dysbiosis. Nevertheless, the potential link between the colonization of gut microbiota in males and females and the age-related change of the liver remains poorly understood.\n\n    Recently, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the lipidomic profiles associated with aging in SPF and GF mice across a wide range of biological samples including the kidney and liver. Consequently, we identified several aging-associated lipid profiles that exhibited sex- and microbiota-dependent alterations. Here, we aim to elucidate the impact of gut microbiota colonization on gene expression and lipid metabolism during the aging process, with a particular focus on the liver.",
        "Methods": "    All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the protocol that was ethically approved by the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences [AEY2023-002(9)]. Four-week-old male and female C57BL/6 N mice were purchased from CLEA (Tokyo, Japan). The GF mice were housed in GF isolators at the RIKEN Animal Facility. All mice were fed with an AIN-93 M diet (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The mice were the same individuals used for lipidomic analysis as previously reported. Liver tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80  C until RNA preparation.\n\n    Tissue samples were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected (500 microL), to which 100 microL of chloroform was added. The mixture was centrifuged, and 150 muL of the obtained supernatant was mixed with 150 microL of 70% ethanol. The total RNA was then extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A quality check of the RNA was performed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Assay kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to determine the RNA integrity number (RIN) (with an average of 8.8). Subsequently, 100 ng of total RNA was used for library preparation with the NEB Next Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Inc., MA, USA). The pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA) at the RIKEN IMS sequence facility, and 50 bp single-end reads were generated. The reads were aligned using STAR onto a mouse reference genome based on UCSC_mm10. The resulting count matrix was analyzed with edgeR (version 3.42.4). Genes were filtered out if they did not meet the criterion of > 1 count per million in at least three samples prior to differential expression analysis. The false discovery rate (FDR) was corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. The transcriptomic dataset is presented in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n    Normalized expression data were examined by GSEA software (version 4.3.3) (Broad Institute, http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea) using MSigDB (version 2024.1.Mm). The number of permutations was set to 1000. Gene sets with an FDR < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\n    Enrichment of transcription factor binding on the gene promoters was analyzed using ChIP-Atlas (https://chip-atlas.org). In Enrichment Analysis of ChIP-Atlas, we input the 24-month-old female GF differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as dataset A or 24-month-old female SPF DEGs as dataset B and selected \"M. musculus (mm10),\" \"ChIP: TFs and others,\" \"Liver,\" and \"100\" as a threshold. For other settings, we used the default parameters. The fold-enrichment scores of transcription factors with predicted binding to one or more gene sequences with the highest peak count and with a Q-value of less than 0.05 are displayed in a heat map.\n\n    Lipid profile data associated with liver aging were obtained from our previous study and reanalyzed. Briefly, the lipidomic data refer to 771 lipid species belonging to 64 lipid subclasses in 2-, 12-, 19-, and 24-month-old, male/female, SPF/GF mouse samples obtained by the MS-DIAL version 4.20 algorithm. Unpaired t-test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between two groups or among three or more groups, respectively. The numerical value appended to each lipid molecular species serves to discriminate metabolites sharing the same annotation but exhibiting different retention times.\n\n    Statistical analysis and data visualization were performed using R Studio (version 4.3.0) or Prism (version 9.5.1). The function \"prcomp\" using the autoscaling method was employed for principal component analysis (PCA). The function \"EnhancedVolcano\" was used to create volcano plots of the results of transcriptomic analysis. The normalized values were converted to z-scores and heatmaps were drawn using the \"heatmap.2\" function. Data are presented as mean +- standard error of the mean (SEM) and P or FDR < 0.05 is considered to represent statistical significance unless otherwise stated in the figure legends.",
        "Results": "    To investigate the overall effect of gut microbiota on liver aging, we performed RNA-seq analyses using liver samples from young (2 months old: 2 M) and aged (24 months old: 24 M), male and female, SPF and GF mice. PCA using autoscaled values was performed to examine the major variance of the dataset (Fig. 1A). In the young group (2 M), a clear separation between males and females was observed, but obvious differences were not seen between SPF and GF in each sex, and the data mapped with a high degree of clustering within each group (indicated by the same-colored shapes within the circle). These results suggest that the liver transcriptome at a young age is strongly influenced by sex differences rather than gut microbial colonization. Aging resulted in a clear separation between young and aged in each group (male SPF, male GF, female SPF, and female GF), indicating that the transcriptome changes with age. Interestingly, whereas little separation was observed between SPF and GF in the male groups, clear separation was observed in the female groups. We examined the expression of genes reported to increase with age in the mouse liver in each group. The results showed that Lcn2 and Clec7a expression significantly increased with age in male SPF, male GF, and female SPF, but the expression levels in female GF were comparable between young and aged (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the RNA-seq dataset is reliable and that aging-associated transcriptomic changes are suppressed in female GF mice compared with those in SPF mice.\n\n    Next, we used a volcano plot to show the changes in gene expression between young and aged mice in the four groups. Using a significance level of 2-fold change (increase or decrease) and FDR < 0.05, we found a total of 1066 DEGs, of which 886 and 180 genes presented increased and decreased expression, respectively, in male SPF mice (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, in male GF mice, the total number of DEGs was 1004, with 832 genes showing increased expression and 172 genes showing decreased expression. In female SPF, 1432 genes were differentially expressed, with 1281 upregulated and 151 downregulated. In female GF, the number of DEGs was lowest at 212, with 157 upregulated and 55 downregulated. In both male and female SPF mice, 671 DEGs were commonly upregulated and 67 were commonly downregulated with aging (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Table 3). Similarly, in GF mice, 97 DEGs were commonly upregulated and 25 were downregulated (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Table 3). In SPF mice, genes commonly upregulated in both sexes included many inflammation-related genes in SPF mice, such as Toll-like receptors, chemokines, immune cell markers, and immunoglobulins. Although a reduced number of such genes was observed in GF mice, upregulated genes also included immune cell markers and immunoglobulins (Supplementary Table 3). Genes commonly downregulated in both sexes included members of the Mup, Serpina, and Ces gene families under both SPF and GF conditions (Supplementary Table 3). To investigate sex-specific transcriptomic changes associated with aging, GSEA was performed in aged SPF and GF mice. In aged SPF mice, ribosome-related gene sets were significantly enriched in males, whereas inflammatory response-related gene sets were enriched in females, reflecting sex-dependent differences in age-related gene expression at late life stages (Fig. 1F). By contrast, GF mice exhibited a different pattern: chromatin-related gene sets were enriched in males, while xenobiotic metabolism-related gene sets were enriched in females (Fig. 1G). These findings suggest that, although some gene expression changes are shared between sexes, aging-associated transcriptomic alterations differ between males and females, and that the influence of the gut microbiota on these changes is also sex-dependent.\n\n    To characterize the effects of gut microbiota on aging, we compared gene expression between SPF and GF-aged mice. As shown in the volcano plot, there were a total of 742 DEGs in female mice, of which 636 genes were highly expressed in SPF and 106 genes in GF (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 4). As shown in Fig. 2B, when the top 25 genes in female mice for both high in SPF and high in GF were depicted in a heatmap, many genes highly expressed in aged SPF were known to be associated with inflammation, especially those related to chemokines (Ccl3, Ccr3, Cxcl13, Pf4) and acting as immune cell markers and being related to immune cell functions (Alox5, Batf, Cd4, Clec10a, Eomes, H2-M2, Ighg1, Klra3, Mgl2, Sh2 d1b1). Serpine1, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a marker of cellular senescence, was also upregulated. The expression of these genes was found to increase with age in SPF mice but did not show significant changes in GF mice, indicating that the aging-associated inflammatory signature was ameliorated in these mice. Most of the genes that exhibited high expression in aged GF mice compared to aged SPF mice belonged to the Mup, Sult3a, and Fmo families. The expression of these genes decreased with age in SPF mice, but this trend was less pronounced in GF mice. Conversely, a total of five DEGs were identified in aged male mice. Among these, one gene was highly expressed in aged SPF mice, whereas the remaining four were higher in aged GF mice (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 5). These five DEGs were illustrated in a heatmap (Fig. 2D). Notably, Csad (a gene involved in metabolism), Gpx6 (involved in the redox system), and Neb (associated with actin filament structure) exhibited similar expression patterns in aged female mice. These findings suggest that the impact of microbiota colonization on gene expression during aging is more pronounced in female mice compared to males.\n\n    We further investigated the association between aged SPF and GF female mice by GSEA to identify pathways affected by the gut microbiota during the aging process. In SPF mice, in addition to the gene sets related to inflammation (granulocyte migration, adaptive immune response, activation of innate immune response), genes related to tissue remodeling (extracellular matrix structural constituent, collagen biosynthetic process, tissue remodeling), cell proliferation (cell cycle DNA replication, mitotic spindle organization), and oxidative stress (superoxide anion generation) were enriched in SPF mice compared with the status in GF mice (Fig. 2E). Meanwhile, gene sets involved in xenobiotic metabolism (xenobiotic metabolic process, monooxygenase activity, sulfation, cellular glucuronidation), amino acid metabolism (amino acid catabolic process), cholesterol metabolism (steroid metabolic process), and bile acid metabolism (bile acid metabolic process) were enriched in GF mice compared with the status in SPF mice (Fig. 2F). Moreover, gene sets involved in mitochondrial energy production (aerobic electron transport chain, fatty acid beta-oxidation) were also enriched in GF compared with those in SPF mice, reflecting the suppression of the decline in mitochondrial energy production with age.\n\n    We analyzed upstream transcription factors corresponding to the differential gene expression signature between SPF and GF in the livers of aged female mice, based on the previously reported ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) datasets using ChIP-Atlas. This in silico analysis predicted the transcription factors Stat5a, Bcl6, Cux2, HNF4alpha, Esr1, Foxa1, and Foxa2, which have been implicated in sex differences, as key transcription factors in the livers of aged female GF mice (Fig. 2G, Supplementary Table 6). In addition, Ppara and Pparg, which are associated with lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function, emerged as key factors in aged GF mice. In contrast, the involvement of Rela, a component of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and Tfe3, both of which are important in regulating inflammatory cytokine expression, was predicted in the livers of aged female SPF mice. Unlike in females, transcription factor prediction using ChIP-Atlas was not feasible in aged male mice due to the limited number of DEGs between SPF and GF conditions. The results indicate that various aging-associated functional abnormalities, including those related to metabolism and energy production, as well as inflammatory signatures, are suppressed in female GF compared with the levels in SPF mice. The results also suggest that both sex-associated transcription factors and those not previously linked to sex differences may be involved in the regulation of these pathways observed in females.\n\n    The discrepancies in the aging process between female SPF and GF mice are assumed to involve functions that regulate aging-related phenotypes, such as inflammatory response. To clarify the potential link between the regulation of aging by gut microbiota and host lipid metabolism, we reanalyzed our previously reported aging lipidome atlas datasets and compared the hepatic lipid profiles between SPF and GF in aged female mice (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table 7). A volcano plot with a threshold of P < 0.05 revealed that 10 species in 7 subclasses were more abundant in SPF and 54 species in 18 subclasses were more abundant in GF. The molecular species that met the criteria are displayed in a heatmap (Fig. 3B). Of these, bile acid BA 24:1;O3;T (taurodeoxycholic acid: TDCA) (ID 1690), BA 24:1;O4;T (ID 1776), BA 24:1;O2;T (ID 1594), and BA 24:1;O3;T (ID 1697) increased with age in SPF mice, while remaining at low levels in GF mice. In contrast, BA 24:1;O4;T (ID 1780) remained at a low level in SPF mice and at a high level in GF mice. Primary bile acids produced by the host from cholesterol are metabolized by gut microbiota to secondary bile acids. The level of TDCA, a secondary bile acid, remained low in GF mice, a finding that appears to support the reliability of these lipid profiles. Sterol sulfate (SSulfate) is a lipid subclass in which the sterol structure is sulfated by sulfotransferases (Sults). Within this lipid subclass, the levels of ST 27:1;O;S (ID 1528) and ST 27:0;O;S (ID 1539) were consistently higher in GF than in SPF from young to old age. The species classified as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), vitamin D, and phytoceramide (Cer_NP) increased with age in GF mice, and the levels were significantly higher than those in SPF mice at old age [LPC 16:1/0:0 (ID: 1926), LPE 16:0 (ID: 1749), LPE 17:0 (ID: 1831), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (ID: 1428), and Cer 18:0;3O/24:1 (ID: 3068)], whereas no age-dependent changes were observed in SPF. Similarly, a total of 26 lipid molecular species of oxidized triacylglycerol (oxTG) were detected, and 18 of them, such as TG 18:1_18:2_18:3;1O (ID 5911), increased with age in GF and showed higher levels in GF than in SPF in the aged mice. Moreover, unique changes in acyl groups were observed in phosphatidylcholine (PC), ceramide (Cer_NS), dihydroceramide (Cer_NDS), hexosylceramide (HexCer_NS), and sphingomyelin (SM). The level of PC with polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) 22:6 was significantly higher in aged GF than in SPF, and PC 16:0_22:6 (ID 4289) and PC 16:1_22:6 (ID 4269) significantly increased with age in GF mice. In addition, the levels of sphingolipid molecular species with fatty acids with 22 to 23 carbons as the N-acyl group were significantly higher in aged GF than in SPF, and among them, Cer 18:1;2O/22:0 (ID 2717), Cer 18:1;2O/23:0 (ID 2821), and HexCer 18:1;2O/22:1 (ID 4221) increased with age in GF. These changes are the hepatic lipidomic signature differentiating SPF and GF in aged female mice, and the colonization of gut microbiota may be the driving factor behind these differences. Conversely, although two molecular species, BA 24:1;O4;T (ID: 1776) and PC 16:0_22:5 (ID: 4304), were identified as common lipidomic alterations between aged SPF and GF mice of both sexes, most lipidomic differences between aged SPF and GF mice were sex-specific (Fig. 3C, Supplementary Table 8). In aged males, characteristic differences between SPF and GF mice included phosphatidic acid (PA), PC species containing 18:0 and PUFA, and diacylglyceryl glucuronide (DGGA), as well as sulfonolipid (SL), a gut microbiota-dependent lipid species we previously reported (Fig. 3D). Although a similar trend in SL levels was observed in aged females, greater inter-individual variability compared to males prevented the detection of statistically significant differences. The significances observed in this analysis may partially reflect differences in abundance variations in aged mice. These lipidomic differences between aged SPF and GF mice may underlie the observed sex differences in transcriptomic changes associated with aging.\n\n    Next, we integrated the transcriptomic and lipidomic datasets and mapped the possible lipid metabolic pathways involved in the lipidomic changes between SPF and GF-aged female mice according to the public KEGG pathway map database (https://www.kegg.jp) and previous reports. The Sult2 family is a group of hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases that are involved in the production of sterol sulfate (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 2F, the gene set related to sulfation was enriched in GF mice compared to SPF mice. The expression levels of about half of the Sults increased with aging in GF mice and were higher than in aged SPF mice, suggesting that these Sults are involved in the accumulation of sterol sulfate in the liver of GF mice (Fig. 4B). Cer_NDS undergoes C4 hydroxylation to yield Cer_NP, which in turn undergoes degradation to phytosphingosine (Fig. 4C). It has been proposed that Degs1, Degs2, and 9130409I23Rik are involved in the abovementioned production pathway, while Asah1, Asah2, and Acer3 are associated with the degradation. The expression of enzymes involved in Cer_NP production was comparable between aged SPF and GF (Fig. 4D). However, the level of Acer3, involved in degradation, increased with aging in SPF, with higher levels in the aged SPF mice than in the aged GF ones. This may have contributed to the difference in Cer_NP between SPF and GF. The lysophospholipids LPC and LPE are generated by the hydrolysis of PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by phospholipase A1/2 (PLA1/2) and are then remodeled to corresponding phospholipids by lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) (Fig. 4E). In female GF mice, the majority of LPC and LPE species were increased with age (Supplementary Table 9). Although the levels of Pla2g15 and Pla2g4f were elevated during the aging process in GF mice, no significant differences were observed between SPF and GF mice at an old age (Fig. 4F). In contrast, the expression of LPLAT genes, including Lpcat1 and Lpcat2, increased with age in SPF mice, resulting in elevated levels in aged mice relative to those in GF mice, suggesting that these remodeling enzymes are responsible for the accumulation of LPC and LPE in GF mice. The quality of phospholipids is regulated by the acyl chain preferentiality of LPLAT. Agpat3, which is known to preferentially introduce 22:6 into lysophosphatidic acid (a common precursor of phospholipids) in mouse liver, tends to maintain a higher expression level in GF than in SPF and was markedly more highly expressed in aged GF than in SPF (Fig. 4F and G). The expression of this enzyme may explain the profile of 22:6-containing PCs.",
        "Conclusion": "    In summary, this study provides substantial insights into the potential link between aging-associated transcriptome and lipidome changes and gut microbiota especially in female mice liver. It is important to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which the colonization of gut microbiota affects the process of aging of the host tissue in a sex-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that changes in sex-related hormonal regulation and lipidome changes are a potential mechanism underlying this relationship. Further research is needed to determine the causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and aging-related phenotypes in a sex-dependent manner. This study provides a basis for future work to develop new therapeutic strategies for aging-associated liver diseases.",
        "Discussion": "    In this study, we found that the gut microbiota affected the changes in the liver transcriptome associated with aging in mice. Female GF mice exhibited attenuated changes in the aging-associated transcriptome, such as inflammatory signatures, compared with those in SPF mice. As an explanation for this, it was predicted that female GF mice may exhibit enhanced regulation of gene expression via sex-related transcription factors. Furthermore, the integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis in female mice suggested that lipid metabolism in the liver was altered in a manner dependent on the gut bacteria, which may be involved in controlling aging-associated phenotypes, including inflammation. These results offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiota regulates liver aging. In particular, sex differences and lipid metabolism may be involved in this process.\n\n    Transcriptomic analysis revealed differences in the aging-associated inflammatory signatures in the liver between female SPF and GF mice. Upregulation of gene sets related to the extracellular matrix and tissue remodeling in female SPF indicates abnormal tissue repair, suggesting that chronic inflammation leads to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. The infiltration of immune cells and the increase in myofibroblasts, which are extracellular matrix-producing cells, play an important role in the progression of these diseases. Since these cells are highly proliferative, the fact that the gene set related to cell proliferation was upregulated in aged SPF mice may be attributed to the proliferation of these cells. Based on these results, it is suggested that the colonization of gut microbiota leads to various age-dependent pathological conditions associated with liver inflammation in female mice.\n\n    A variety of immune cells reside in the liver and contribute to the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis. Previous studies have reported no significant differences in the number of leukocytes or the proportions of natural killer T (NKT) cells and dendritic cells in the livers of female SPF and GF mice under steady-state conditions. Consistently, our transcriptomic analysis revealed no differences in the expression of immunity-related genes between SPF and GF mice in young females (Supplementary Table 3). In mouse models of steatosis, immune cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages, Kupffer cells, and NKT cells are known to be involved in disease pathogenesis. In the Concanavalin A-induced hepatitis model, more severe acute liver inflammation has been observed in SPF female mice compared to GF mice, which has been attributed to the activation of hepatic NKT cells by gut microbiota-derived glycolipid antigens, such as alpha-galactosylceramide and subsequent decline in the frequency of hepatic NKT cells. In contrast, in the context of HFD-induced obesity and hepatic metabolic dysfunction, NKT cells appear to play a protective role, as female mice lacking NKT cells exhibit increased susceptibility to these metabolic disturbances. In both humans and mice, aging has been reported to be associated with a decline in hepatic NKT cell number and functions. Unlike GF mice, NKT cells in SPF mice are continuously activated in a gut microbiota-dependent manner, which may be associated with their age-related decline. In contrast, in the absence of gut microbiota, NKT cell function may be preserved even in old age, potentially leading to the suppression of aging-associated liver inflammation. Our current lipidomic analysis did not identify specific lipid species that regulate NKT cells, highlighting the need for more detailed lipidomic profiling to address this possibility. Collectively, these findings suggest a potential role for gut microbiota-mediated regulation of NKT cells and other immune cells in the development of age-associated liver disorders, highlighting the need for further studies.\n\n    In female mice, the aging-associated inflammatory signature in the liver was reduced in GF compared to SPF mice, suggesting that gut microbiota progress to aging-related inflammation. Consistently, fecal transplantation from aged female SPF mice into young female GF mice has been shown to induce systemic inflammation, whereas transplantation from young SPF mice did not, indicating that aged microbiota may harbor pro-inflammatory factors. Aging-associated dysbiosis has been proposed to increase intestinal permeability, allowing microbial products to enter circulation and trigger inflammation. The absence of such gut-derived factors may underlie the suppressed inflammation observed in female-aged GF mice. Notably, in aged male mice, liver transcriptomic differences between SPF and GF were less pronounced, suggesting that age-related inflammation in males may occur independently of the gut microbiota. Alternatively, certain yet unidentified microbiota-derived lipids may possess anti-inflammatory properties, which could confer protection in male mice. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex differences in understanding the relationship between gut microbiota and age-related inflammation. The observed sex-specific differences in transcriptomic and lipidomic profiles offer new insights into the regulation of aging-related inflammation.\n\n    Our ChIP-Atlas-based analysis of transcription factors suggests that a group of transcription factors related to sex differences may be involved in the aging-associated gene expression in female GF mice. The liver exhibits sexual dimorphism that is achieved by certain sex-related transcription factors, such as Stat5a, Bcl6, Cux2, and HNF4alpha, which are regulated by growth hormone (GH) secreted from the pituitary gland. These transcription factors regulate the expression of various metabolic enzymes and affect the metabolism of lipids, steroids, and xenobiotics. For example, it was shown that mice with Bcl6 deficiency specifically in hepatocytes exhibit resistance to HFD-induced steatosis, observed in both male and female mice, although the tendency is more pronounced in male mice. Bcl6 plays a pivotal role in the repression of female-biased genes in males. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Bcl6 results in the feminization of the male liver and the elimination of its male-biased gene signature. Meanwhile, the expression of Cyp3a41, Cyp3a44, and Mup genes, which are known to be regulated by GH through sex-related transcription factors, was higher in GF than in SPF in aged female mice. This indicates that the age-related decline in the GH-dependent transcriptional axis is suppressed in female GF mice, thereby preventing age-related abnormalities in the liver. The secretion of GH is influenced by a variety of hormones. However, it has been reported that changes in GH secretion in GF mice compared with that in CONV mice resulted in the attenuation of sex-specific diurnal rhythms of gene expression and metabolism. Furthermore, it has been postulated that microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, are involved in the regulation of GH secretion, suggesting the existence of gut microbiota-dependent regulatory mechanisms. Clarifying the role of the gut microbiota in GH-dependent function in aged mice may help to elucidate how the gut microbiota is involved in the differences in liver aging between the sexes.\n\n    There are also differences in liver physiology and pathology between the sexes, such as in the induction of MAFLD by HFD feeding. It has been reported that symptoms are more pronounced in males than in females. In female mice, sex hormones can suppress inflammation and alter various metabolic processes. It has been reported that estrogen administration reduces inflammation and HFD-induced steatosis in mice. In addition, estrogen is known to protect the liver from xenobiotic stimuli by increasing the expression of enzymes such as cytochrome P450, and sulfotransferase in the liver, as observed in aged female GF mice. Furthermore, our analysis of transcription factors suggests that in addition to Esr1, Foxa1, and Foxa2 were also functional in aged female GF mice. Foxa1/2 has been implicated in the sexual dimorphism of hepatocarcinogenesis. It has been reported that liver cancer could be prevented by the estrogen-dependent expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and proliferation in female mice, which was dependent on Foxa1/2. It is thus proposed that estrogen-dependent protective mechanisms are involved in the process by which the livers of female GF mice are protected from the aging-associated inflammatory response.\n\n    It is also possible that xenobiotic enzymes are induced to produce metabolites with endogenous anti-inflammatory properties. The predominant molecular species of SSulfate annotated in this study, ST 27:1;O;S (ID: 1528), is predicted to be a cholesterol sulfate (CS). CS has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the increase in CS is thought to be involved in the suppression of age-related inflammation observed in GF mice. CS is known to be produced by Sult2b1b, expressed in the intestinal epithelium. In addition to Sult2b1b, it has been suggested that Sult2a1, albeit with less specificity, is also involved in the production of CS. It has been observed that the Sult2a gene exhibits higher levels of expression in female mice than in male ones. This sexual dimorphism in Sult2a1 expression in mouse livers is regulated by sex hormones, estrogen in females, and GH. According to the ChIP-Atlas database, there are potential binding sites of the sex-related transcription factors Esr1, Foxa1, Foxa2, Stat5a, and HNF4alpha within a region spanning +- 1 kb from the transcription start site of the Sult2a1 gene. This suggests that the production of CS via the upregulation of Sult2a1 improves the liver pathology associated with aging in a sex-dependent manner. However, further analysis is needed to elucidate the potential mechanism by which SSulfate increases in female GF mice and to clarify its role in liver inflammation.\n\n    The results of the integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis revealed unique differences in lipid metabolism between SPF and GF, which may regulate inflammation in the liver during aging. Phytoceramide is produced by the C4-hydroxylation of dihydroceramide. Previous reports suggested Degs2 as the enzyme responsible for this reaction, but the fact that phytoceramide was not completely abolished by Degs2 deficiency suggests that other enzymes produce it. The KEGG pathway map suggests the possible involvement of the enzyme encoded by 9130409I23Rik, also called Degs1 l, in this reaction. Our findings indicate that the elevation of phytoceramides in GFs is attributable to discrepancies in the degradation system rather than the production system between SPF and GF. Although it is not known whether there are sex differences or gut microbiota-dependent differences in the expression of Acer3, it has been reported that such expression is increased in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients and disease model mice and that inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in such mice are reduced by Acer3 deletion. It has also been reported that phytoceramide activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, suggesting their possible role in regulating aging-related phenotypes in the liver.\n\n    Phospholipids are converted to lysophospholipids by PLA1/2 and recycled to the corresponding phospholipids by LPLATs. Based on gene expression analysis, the accumulation of LPC and LPE in aged GF may be due to differences in the expression of the LPLAT genes, Lpcat1 and Lpcat2, which are known to be involved in the acylation of LPC and LPE. LPC and LPE have been reported to act as signaling molecules that control inflammation. LPC is known to have an inhibitory effect on sepsis and Con-A-induced acute hepatitis, while LPE has an inhibitory effect on animal models of inflammation such as peritonitis and edema. It has been suggested that these effects differ depending on the position (sn-1 or sn-2) and the type (number of carbons, degree of saturation) of the acyl chain. Using the measurement system employed in our previous study, it is not possible to distinguish the sites where acyl groups are attached. Against this background, there is a need for further analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these lipids suppress inflammation associated with liver aging, as well as the potential role of sex differences and gut microbiota in the metabolism of LPC and LPE.\n\n    Differences in acyl chain quality have a significant impact on the properties of lipids. In female GF mice, the amount of PC containing 22:6 increased with age and was higher than in aged SPF mice. PUFAs such as 22:6 have a significant impact on the properties of phospholipids, for example, by increasing the fluidity of biological membranes and acting as precursors of lipid mediators that promote the resolution of inflammation. As membrane fluidity declines with age, it is possible that 22:6-containing PC contributes to inhibit this decline. LPLAT plays an important role in the diversity of phospholipid quality. In particular, Agpat3 incorporates 22:6 into lysophosphatidic acid to produce PA. PA is further metabolized to produce 22:6-containing PC. It has been reported that PC containing 22:6 is significantly reduced in Agpat3-deficient mice. To ascertain whether Agpat3 expression is modulated by sex-related transcription factors, in silico screening of the Agpat3 promoter was conducted using the JASPAR program (https://jaspar.elixir.no). The consensus sequences in the promoter region of Agpat3 were screened using the JASPAR program, which resulted in the prediction of high-scoring binding for Bcl6 (ID: MA0463.1, predicted sequence: CTTCTTAGAGAAGA) and Stat5a (ID: MA0519.2, predicted sequence: TTCTTAGAG). These results suggest that the observed increase in Agpat3 may have contributed to alterations in the PC profile in a sex-dependent manner. Overall, the impact of sex differences and gut microbiota on the expression of metabolic enzymes that contribute to the observed differences in lipid profile remains to be further analyzed to determine the effects of these changes in lipid metabolism on aging-associated phenotypes, including inflammation.\n\n    A comprehensive analysis of age-related lipid changes in the liver is limited in humans due to the invasive nature of liver sampling, with most studies focusing on lipids in the blood samples. In contrast, lipidomic analyses using liver biopsies from patients with hepatic diseases such as steatosis and cirrhosis have identified lipid species associated with disease pathology. In this study, we observed age-dependent increases in cholesterol esters, triacylglycerols, and diacylglycerols, as well as decreases in certain sphingolipids in the livers of SPF mice. These changes have also been reported in human liver diseases. These findings suggest that age-related lipid alterations in the mouse liver may reflect features of human age-associated liver disorders. Our results offer insights into age-related lipid metabolic changes in the human liver and may contribute to the future development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, including microbiota-targeted interventions such as probiotics, and postbiotics for aging-related liver diseases.",

        "Title": "    Timing and Duration of Observation Periods of Foraging Behavior in Natural Grasslands",
        "Abstract": "    The goals of this study were to evaluate the length of time grazing which should be monitored over a 24-h period to predict the grazing behavior of beef heifers within a season and determine the patterns of foraging activity over 24 h. A database was constructed between 2010 and 2012 for beef heifers managed under rotational grazing in a natural grassland. Grazing, rumination, and other activity times were assessed visually during 24 h on 15 occasions. Data were classified according to climatic seasons, generating 12 replicates in summer, 18 in spring, 24 in autumn, and 36 in winter. Treatments were the evaluation of four distinct periods: from sunrise to sunset (DAY-SUN), daylight duration from dawn to nightfall (DAYLIGHT), DAYLIGHT plus 2 h (DAYLIGHT+2), DAYLIGHT to midnight (DAYLIGHT to 0), and the entire 24 h period (CONTROL). Differences for grazing, rumination, and other activities were found in all seasons for the evaluation periods. Sampling sufficiency was reached only with the DAYLIGHT to 0 and CONTROL for all four climatic seasons. The DAYLIGHT to 0 treatment covered 75% of a 24-h period and 95% of the mean foraging time took place during this time interval. Considering grazing distribution during a day, in the warm seasons, the major grazing period during mornings occurred earlier than in the cool seasons, and in cool seasons, the grazing peak was observed during the afternoon. Visual observations from dawn until midnight represented the total grazing time and natural behavior of heifers and could be used to represent grazing activities for the entire day.",
        "Introduction": "    Grazing behavior evaluations can be an important issue when establishing management goals because the behavior of animals on pastures provides clues with which to determine if pasture management decisions are suitable and whether animals are expressing their natural behavior, which is a good indication of animal welfare in pasture-based production systems. Furthermore, the behavior of animals in controlled situations, such as grazing trials, can provide insights into the production data collected in those situations.\n\n    The southern Brazil Campos grasslands are the major foraging systems for beef cattle reared in this region, and the same is valid for other nearby South American countries, such as Argentina, Uruguay, and part of Paraguay. Thus, developing management tools for these grazing systems can provide productivity gains, as well as ensure the welfare of animals. Grazing systems in these natural grasslands are considered an important marketing advantage for these countries, and monitoring ingestive behavior could attest to the adequate state of animal comfort. Management systems that do not take into account whether animals can attain daily forage intake to meet their nutritional requirements may be inefficient.\n\n    Among behavior variables, time spent grazing, and ruminating is the main measured indicative and key variables used as indicators of management efficiency and animal welfare. Other relevant variables of management efficiency could be estimates of dry matter (DM) intake and forage quality that relates to forage on offer and sward structure, but these are not animal behavior traits. For example, ruminants commonly have grazing times between 450 and 600 min/day in temperate pastures and rarely forage <360 min/day, with times that may exceed 760 min/day on subtropical and tropical pastures. In the southern Brazil Campos grasslands, without limitations to inhibit potential intake (e.g., sward height or herbage mass), the time spent grazing commonly ranges between 500 and 650 min/day, regardless of the grazing method used. This variation in grazing time indicates potentially diverse situations and challenges that animals can face, even in situations with abundant forage allowance, attesting to the complex interaction of animals with plants and sward structure. On subtropical natural grasslands, in a wide range of forage allowances, Trindade et al. indicated that both lower and higher levels could limit forage intake, due to limited bite volume and mass at allowances lower than 8 kg of DM/100 kg of liveweight and to limited bite selection above 16 kg of DM/100 kg of liveweight. These bite variations are linked also to grazing time along the day, indicating a \"standard range\" of 500-600 min/day. However, observed grazing times outside of \"standard range\" are indicative that something is wrong with animal management, which could even decrease welfare by forcing unusual behavior on animals, such as grazing during hot periods of the day. Notwithstanding, all these protocols of forage allowance and sward structure could be far from the possibility of farmers to follow at paddock level and depend on shade availability and water quality and availability. However, observing grazing times at key periods of the day could give clues to adequate grazing management.\n\n    Although foraging behavior studies have already been defined as important evaluations, the extent of the evaluations (e.g., during the daylight periods or 24 h periods) that best represent animal behavior remains uncertain. Both protocols were found in the international literature (daylight x 24 h). This is due to three main factors: (i) availability and costs of skilled observers; (ii) circadian behavior rhythms associated with daylight, especially in temperate climates; and (iii) the need for artificial light during the night.\n\n    The 24-h visual evaluations may currently be less feasible, in part, because they require a large number of trained people. Furthermore, artificial light during dark periods may affect the natural behavior of animals, especially if the animals are not very tame or not used to being under artificial light. Thus, many research groups are searching for accurate automatic recording methods of behavior. Nevertheless, continuous 24 h assessments are the most accurate for evaluations, and methods need to be calibrated for automatic recording and evaluating a longer and fixed period, regardless of the climatic season (1,440 min/day). On the other hand, evaluations performed only during daylight periods, regardless of the time interval, have been justified based on the pattern of ruminants' diurnal foraging behavior, especially for the main meals during the day, and have lower labor requirements.\n\n    The problem lies in the autumn and winter assessments. In these climatic seasons, restriction to daylight evaluations could be seriously biased because of the reduced day length (photoperiod) and, more importantly, because during this period the quantity and quality of the forage are substantially different from that during other periods of the year, especially in natural grasslands. Moreover, daylight observations do not consider natural animal behavior. Usually, animals tend to graze at night, mainly in tropical and subtropical conditions. Preference for grazing at night could occur because of more comfortable air temperatures during this period, although nighttime grazing activity has a shorter duration compared with that during daylight. However, these grazing events could represent as much as 35% of the total grazing time over 24 h in hot weather or during long nights. Furthermore, during these foraging events at night, demonstrated that animals have a heavy bite mass. This part of the day needs to be considered in assessments that consider animal welfare and evaluate the efficiency of the management system.\n\n    Thus, considering the importance of the daylight period on behavior and the interaction of the daylight period with temperatures in subtropical environments, the objectives of this work were to evaluate for how long foraging should be monitored over a 24-h period to predict foraging behavior of beef heifers within a season and determine the patterns of foraging activity over 24 h.",
        "Methods": "    The experimental area is located in the southern part of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul state, with the center of the experimental area at ~29 43'30''S, 53 45'33''W. This area belongs to the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM). The local climate is classified as subtropical humid, with a mean ambient annual temperature of 19.2 C and a mean annual rainfall of 1,770 mm at 95 m above sea level. During the trial, the mean maximum temperature was 22.7 C and the mean minimum temperature was 17.1 C, the mean precipitation was of 130.6 mm per month, November is the wettest month (294.9 mm), and October is the driest (53.6 mm).\n\n    The experimental area was 22.5 ha, which was divided into six rectangular paddocks of 3.5 ha each. Each of these six areas was then subdivided into seven smaller sub-paddocks and managed with a rotational grazing method. The criteria that defined the rest period of sub-paddocks was the thermal sum accumulated (degree Celsius per day; degree day, DD) for the duration of leaf elongation of two functional groups of grasses (as described below) that compose the swards of Campos grasslands.\n\n    To define the rest intervals of the rotational grazing method (original trial treatments), mean phyllocron (time in DD for complete leaf elongation) of functional groups A/B and C/D (375 or 750 DD) was multiplied by the number of expanding leaves per tiller, generating the rest periods of each sub-paddock. The number of expanding leaves of grasses in the functional groups is intrinsic to the genetic traits of plants and defines the time of rest intervals. Following this logic, over 3 years, three paddocks were managed using a rest interval of the accumulated thermal sum of 375 DD, and the other three paddocks were managed using 750 DD of the accumulated thermal sum. Therefore, the occupation period was defined by dividing rest intervals (in thermal sum) of each treatment by the number of sub-paddocks, less one (sub-paddock under occupation), resulting in the time, in degree Celsius, of occupation of each sub-paddock. The accumulated thermal sum to manage the paddocks generated a varying number of days for occupying the sub-paddocks, according to ambient temperature and weather seasons.\n\n    The 375-DD rest interval was based on the accumulated temperature for elongation of 2.5 leaves per tiller of grasses of functional groups A and B [e.g., Coelorhachis selloana and Paspalum notatum; ]. The 750-DD rest interval was based on the accumulated temperature for elongation of 1.5 leaves per tiller of functional groups C and D [e.g., Aristida laevis and Saccharum trinii; ]. Those species had an important contribution to sward composition of the area and, consequently, on available herbage mass.\n\n    Over 3 years, when measuring the rest interval effects, a total of 15 experimental evaluations of beef heifer grazing behavior were conducted. All assessments were performed with visual observations during 24 consecutive hours. In each year, a variable number between 24 and 36 beef heifers (at least four heifers per paddock) was evaluated with variable body weights (177-215 kg) and age (12-24 months) (Table 1). Variations in weight and age were within the range for heifers rearing to breed at 2 years of age.\n\n    During the grass growing seasons over the 3 years (springs, summers, and autumns), heifers were only supplemented with mineral salt and had access ad libitum to freshwater. During the first winter (2010), heifers were supplemented with mineral protein salt ad libitum. During the second winter (2011), heifers were supplemented with grounded corn at a proportion of 0.5% of body weight (BW). During the third winter (2012), the heifers were supplemented with 0.5% of BW with wheat bran (85%) and glycerol (15%). In all winter seasons, except for the first when mineral protein salt had its intake limited by NaCl concentration, the intake was not higher than 200 g per animal. In the second and third winter, supplement did not exceed 0.5% of BW and was available only from 09:30 to 10:30 h, when grazing activity is lower. The stocking rate adjustments were made each 28 days using 4.5% of the herbage allowance (4.5 kg MS per 100 kg of BW) considering 70% of grass leaf blades creating part of the sward mass.\n\n    The experimental area was arranged in a randomized block design with the two rest periods as the treatments (375 and 750 DD), with three area replicates (six paddocks with sub-paddocks, three for each rest period), using rotational grazing management. The blocking criterion was the relief. Details regarding management can be found in Barbieri et al..\n\n    Before this 3-year experimental period and 15 behavior assessments, behavior variables were tested through an analysis of variance model (using P <= 0.05 as the significance level). Because there were no differences between grazing and rumination time between 375 and 750 DD treatments, all data were used to form a larger database. Then, these databases were combined by year, generating four evaluations in the first year (4 x 6 paddocks = 24 replicates), six evaluations over the second year (6 x 6 = 36 replicates), and five evaluations in the third year (5 x 6 = 30 replicates). To this new analysis, the year was used as a block in the statistical model to remove possible climatic differences among the years. Next, data were clustered by season, regardless of year (blocked), which generated 12 replicates in summer, 24 replicates in autumn, 36 replicates in winter, and 18 replicates in spring. Each replicate evaluated at least four heifers. Even after clustering the data (years and climatic seasons), grazing and rumination time did not present significant differences between the 375- and 750-DD treatments, making it possible to pool all data to perform the timing and sample sufficiency analysis. The original data and animal performance can be found in Soares.\n\n    The pasture that composes the Campos grasslands presents a well-defined double layer canopy structure. In this case, the lower strata were composed of short-grass species, such as Axonopus affinis and Paspalum notatum, mostly with a prostrate growth pattern and were the major grasses in the above-cited A/B functional groups. These species were highly preferred by free-ranging cattle. In the upper strata were grass species with a tussock-like growth habit, such as Andropogon lateralis and Aristida laevis, the major grasses in the above-cited C/D functional groups. Moreover, the experimental area was mostly composed of C4 metabolic cycle grasses (above 75% of herbage mass). During the cool seasons, sward production was dramatically reduced concomitant with the decrease in its nutritional value.\n\n    The herbaceous vegetation of the area consisted (mean contribution for green herbage mass) primarily of Andropogon lateralis (+-37%), Aristida laevis (+-14%), Saccharum trinii (+-6%), Shorgastrum nutans (+-6%), Paspalum plicatulum (+-3%), Axonopus affinis (+-6%), Paspalum notatum (+-9%); species within the Umbelliferae family, including Eringium horridum (+-3%); and +-16% representing other plant families, including woody plants (each with negligible amounts; <1%). Furthermore, 117 species, representing 33 grass genera, have been documented in this experimental area. Species classified as A and B functional groups (Andropogon lateralis, Axonopus affinis, and Paspalum notatum) comprised 52% of the mean green herbage mass and those as C and D groups (Aristida laevis, Saccharum trinii, Shorgastrum nutans, and Paspalum plicatulum) comprised 29% of the herbage mass. These species and group contributions varied throughout the year, mostly because of the variations in environmental temperatures over time (seasons). See Cruz et al. for details on functional groups. The quantity of senescent plant material also changed across seasons, being lower in the spring (+-20% of total herbage mass) and greater in the winter season (+-55% of total herbage mass). All these values (species contribution and botanical composition) were sampled using the BOTANAL method, as described by Tothill et al..\n\n    Over the 3 years, herbage mass (HM) was measured, each 28-32 days, using a visual standard comparison, calibrated with a double sampling technique, with 20 visual samplings and six samples cut at ground level, using 0.25 m2 quadrats. All regression equations derived from visual assessments were above 0.7 determination coefficient (R2). In each evaluation of HM, sward height was measured with a sward stick at the same points as HM evaluations. We did not consider the tall tussock grasses in sward height measurements.\n\n    All 15 grazing behavior evaluations began on the second day of occupation of the sub-paddocks, regardless of whether the management was 375 or 750 DD (dates in Table 1). The mean time of occupation of the sub-paddocks was 4 days (range from 2 to 5 days in spring and summer) and 7 days (range from 5 to 10 days in autumn and winter). In all assessments, the experimental unit was the sub-paddock and the variables explored were the mean values of at least four tested animals.\n\n    Previously for each assessment, heifers were exposed to night observations with flashlights to acclimate them to this type of light and they were habituated to close handling by people using daily supplementation on grassland. Thus, flashlights and close observations appeared to have minimal effects on the behavior of the animals. In each evaluation, trained evaluators were placed at ground level in \"easy-to-view\" locations for heifer behavior recording. Four trained evaluators were used for each sub-paddock, taking turns every 2 h.\n\n    Total grazing, rumination, and other activity times were visually recorded, every 10 min over 24 consecutive hours, and the results were expressed in minutes per day. Considering that sub-paddocks were 0.5 ha, and animals expressed their behavior in groups, each observer was able to handle a single paddock observation. The recording frequency was chosen based on previous data reported by Gary et al. and Mezzalira et al.. Grazing was defined as including time spent searching, selecting, and gathering (eating) forage, similar to that previously described by Hodgson. Rumination time was defined as the cessation of grazing and the beginning of jaw movements. Time of other activities was considered the time when animals were not foraging or ruminating and could be idle, engaging in social activities, drinking water, or eating supplements.\n\n    As previously described, an analysis of variance showed no differences among treatments (375 and 750 DD rest intervals). Thus, data were recombined in five treatments regardless of the rest intervals. New treatments consisted of the comparison between timing and duration of observation periods to test the sufficiency of sampling duration for grazing time analysis and to determine the behavior of heifers in the natural environment. Again, each paddock area was used as a replicate in each season, generating 12 replicates in summer, 24 in autumn, 36 in winter, and 18 in spring. Differences among seasons were not compared because of the differences in day length among seasons and differences in green biomass availability and herbage quality.\n\n    Validation of the timing and duration of observation periods in each season accounted for grazing, rumination, and other activity times observed over uninterrupted periods of 24 h. Treatments consisted of the evaluation of four distinct periods having different lengths based on the following selected intervals: sun duration:during the day from sunrise to sunset (DAY-SUN); daylight duration:from dawn to dusk (DAYLIGHT); DAYLIGHT plus 2 h (DAYLIGHT+2); DAYLIGHT to midnight (DAYLIGHT to 0); and the entire 24 h (CONTROL) (details in Figure 1). All data were compiled by fractioning the CONTROL dataset.\n\n    To obtain the times of sunrise and sunset, historic data were used (mean of 30 years) registered by the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) station, located 3 km from the experimental area. The mean time of sunrise and sunset was calculated for each season. Using these times, the beginning and the end of the DAY-SUN treatment were identified (Table 2). This information also was used to obtain the dawn and dusk durations [sun position 6  above (sunrise) and -6  below (sunset) the horizon ], and this time was added to the DAY-SUN treatment. The mean values of dawn and dusk (in minutes, mean of each season) were added to the mean sunrise and sunset hours for each season to determine the start and the end of behavior evaluations that defined the DAYLIGHT treatment (see Table 2).\n\n    In addition to these observation periods, to determine if animal behavior was being represented, other evaluation periods were observed. In the DAYLIGHT+2 treatment, animal evaluations were considered from dawn until 2 h after dusk ended. For the DAYLIGHT to 0 treatment, behavior was compiled between dawn and midnight (00:00; midnight). For DAYLIGHT+2 and DAYLIGHT to 0 treatments, the end of the evaluations was considered a fixed period of time. The evaluation period (time), even within the same treatments (except in the CONTROL treatment), was different between climatic seasons, and this occurred because of photoperiod changes among climatic seasons (Figure 1), influencing the time the assessments began.\n\n    The statistical analyses used was a block design model where each year was considered the block. Each paddock was considered a replicate (mean of animals inside the paddocks) and there were six replicates (paddock number in the experimental area) in each trial (15 trials for 3 years). In spring, data were analyzed with 18 replicates, in summer with 12, in autumn with 24, and in winter with 36 replicates. Results are presented separately by season because of the differences in day length among seasons.\n\n    The analysis of grazing time (minute per hour during 24 h) was performed using the mean values of grazing time from all replicates in the database. For this analysis, data were separated by climatic seasons, and using mean values of all replicates in each climatic season, the grazing time (minute per hour) was calculated for each hour of the day. From this, the grazing time in each hour between climatic seasons was compared.\n\n    Initially, data were submitted to a Bartlett test followed by a Shapiro-Wilk test to determine the homogeneity of variances and normality of residuals, respectively. After confirming this, the data were submitted to an analysis of variance and F-test. Mean comparison analyses were conducted using PROC MIXED (Tukey test) in SAS 9.2 software, including the model effects of blocks (years) and treatments (evaluation periods). The criteria for sampling sufficiency of the duration of observation periods were defined as occurring when comparisons between the CONTROL and treatments were similar. For all statistical tests, significance was defined as P < 0.05.",
        "Results": "    The main objective of this article was to evaluate the extent of observations of grazing behavior over a 24-h period to accurately represent this behavior, so we will discuss our data considering at the same time feasibility and representativeness to predict foraging behavior mediated by pasture management practices.\n\n    Mean herbage mass maintained during the experimental years was 3,871 kg DM/ha, ranging from 3,017 to 4,242 kg DM/ha. Furthermore, mean sward height, without tussock species, was 20 +- 3.9 cm, ranging from 17.3 +- 3.3 to 22.5 +- 4.1 cm. Sward characteristics were similar among the paddocks and typical of this grassland formation.\n\n    There were differences (P < 0.05) for grazing, rumination, and other activity times among all seasons and treatments within 24 h (Table 3). There were differences in grazing time even among lower observation period treatments (DAY-SUN vs. DAYLIGHT) in summer and winter seasons. Furthermore, these treatments presented lower (P < 0.05) foraging times than did the time observed in the CONTROL. In summer, grazing time measured in the DAY-SUN treatment represented only 82.7% of the total time spent grazing over 24 h and this treatment evaluated 56.9% of day length. In DAYLIGHT, grazing time observed represented 88.1% of the total grazing time and the DAYLIGHT evaluated 60.4% of day length.\n\n    In winter, the DAY-SUN treatment represented only 47.2% of day length and covered 74.9% of the grazing time observed in the CONTROL. In the DAYLIGHT treatment, 79.7% of the foraging time of the CONTROL was represented and 50% of the day length was observed. Rumination and other activity times were similar between DAY-SUN and DAYLIGHT treatments among all seasons. However, rumination time was lower in these treatments relative to that of the CONTROL.\n\n    In the DAYLIGHT+2 treatment, grazing time differences were observed in the spring, autumn, and winter when compared with other evaluation periods. In this treatment, grazing time was greater than the time spent grazing in the two treatments that evaluated grazing time only during the day clarity period (DAY-SUN and DAYLIGHT) and lower than the grazing time observed in DAYLIGHT to 0 and CONTROL treatments. In spring, DAYLIGHT+2 evaluated 68.1% of the day length and grazing time represented 88% of the CONTROL. During autumn, this treatment evaluated 57.5% of the day length and 81.5% of the grazing time in the CONTROL. During winter, DAYLIGHT+2 represented 84.1% of the CONTROL grazing time, evaluating 58.4% of the day length. Regardless of the season, the DAYLIGHT+2 treatment reached the grazing time representativeness of time grazing by the heifers observed over 24 h. In general, rumination and other activity times increased with the increase in the evaluated period during all seasons.\n\n    Grazing time only began to be represented when a large portion of the night was added to the evaluation period. Sampling sufficiency of the duration of the observation period was achieved when the evaluations were undertaken until midnight (DAYLIGHT to 0 treatment) in the four seasons (treatment DAYLIGHT to 0 vs. CONTROL; summer P = 0.485; spring P = 0.278; autumn P = 0.212; winter P = 0.196).\n\n    Using this evaluation period, during summer, 77.1% of the day length with 97.8% of the CONTROL grazing time was used. In spring, the evaluation period had 76.4% of day length and achieved 91.5% of the foraging time observed during the CONTROL period. During winter, grazing time in the DAYLIGHT to 0 represented 91.5% of grazing activity of the CONTROL, evaluating 72.9% of the day length. In autumn, grazing time in the DAYLIGHT to 0 represented 94.8% of the activity of the CONTROL, evaluating 73.6% of the day length.\n\n    Considering the time spent in rumination and other activities, even with the increase in the observation periods, differences were observed when compared with that of the CONTROL (P < 0.05). Overall, in summer and spring, rumination time during periods of natural clarity (day) represented only 37.6% of rumination time compared with the 24-h period (CONTROL). The remaining rumination time (62.4%) was observed during dark periods (night). In the cool seasons (autumn and winter), 23.9% of rumination time was observed during light periods and 76.1% overnight. Furthermore, the remaining activities followed the same pattern; during summer and spring, 31.1% of other activities occurred during the day (natural light), whereas the remaining time (68.9%) was observed during darkness. In the cool seasons (mean of autumn and winter), 43% of other activities were distributed in the day and 56.9% during darkness.\n\n    Grazing time distribution over 24 h presented some similarities among seasons, mainly when comparing among warm seasons (summer and spring) and cooler seasons (autumn and winter) (Figure 2).\n\n    During warm seasons, the first intense grazing cycle (or peak) occurred earlier than in cooler seasons, at ~04:00 in the morning. At 05:00, grazing activity was more intense during warm seasons than during cool seasons (P < 0.05). In cooler seasons, the first grazing peak started at ~06:00 h. The difference (P < 0.05) in grazing intensity (time spent grazing per hour) between warm and cool seasons was observed until 08:00. In all seasons, after this intense activity, grazing activity was reduced until 10:00 h (more details in the Supplementary File; Table 4).\n\n    During late morning, at ~11:00, a second intense peak of grazing activity occurred in the summer and it was different from that of other seasons (P < 0.05). In this same time of the day (late morning and early afternoon), cool seasons and spring had low intensity and more constant grazing distribution. Regardless of the season, during late afternoon, and at the beginning of the night (16:00-20:00 h), a second intense grazing peak was observed. This peak in grazing activity started earlier in the cool season as compared with that of warm seasons. In winter and autumn, this intense grazing activity started at ~15:00-16:00 h. This grazing peak had, approximately, a duration of 3, 1 h less than the duration of the grazing peak observed during the warm season. In summer and spring, the intense foraging activity occurred between 17:00 and 21:00 h.\n\n    After this grazing peak in the late afternoon, grazing activity was reduced during the early evening. In cool seasons, this grazing activity reduction ranged from 19:00 to 22:00 h. During spring, this reduction was shorter and ranged from 21:00 to 22:00 h, and in the summer, grazing activity was evident from 21:00 to 0:00 h. Furthermore, in spring, autumn, and winter, heifers had another short grazing peak during the night (between 23:00 and 01:00 h). Only during summer did heifers present low foraging activity during the night.",
        "Conclusion": "    Visual observations beginning at dawn until midnight represented the total foraging time in a subtropical natural grassland. This period could be used to represent grazing activities performed during 24 h, as well to evaluate the natural behavior of heifers, and this would be useful for the calibration of automatic recording devices.\n\n    Diurnal evaluations of grazing behavior of beef heifers do not represent the necessary time to represent grazing activities in natural grasslands in subtropical and tropical conditions.\n\n    Beef heifers managed in natural grasslands have a diurnal pattern of grazing. However, there are significant grazing events in dark periods, and there are also significant changes between seasons in the times that animals perform these events. Farmers could use this daytime pattern to establish key periods of the day for observations of grazing behavior, such as the end of the morning grazing peak or the beginning of the evening peak.",
        "Discussion": "    During the 3 years when grazing behavior was evaluated, herbage mass and sward height did not present values in the range of sward structure considered limiting for beef heifer intake on natural grasslands. Thus, the similarities allowed us to assume that the grazing behavior of beef heifers in this study was not influenced by these factors.\n\n    Recently, animal behavior evaluations (or trials) have focused on the observation periods during daylight observations, regardless of the climatic season or pasture type. This observation period was based on the major grazing events featured by the animals by their natural behavior, mostly observed in temperate climate conditions. In such situations, the weather is characterized by milder environmental temperatures during the daylight period and cold environmental temperatures during the night. Thus, because of thermal comfort, grazing activity occurs predominantly during daylight hours and major grazing events occur near sunrise and sunset, with the latter having greater intensity and longer duration.\n\n    However, in tropical and subtropical conditions, the temperature distribution is different over a 24-h period, especially in different seasons, and as seen in our results, to maintain animal welfare, animals distribute their grazing activities differently, having more dispersed foraging activities over 24 h as compared with those in temperate climates. In support of this, in subtropical and tropical climates, animals can conduct a significant portion of grazing during non-daylight hours together with rumination and resting.\n\n    Another important feature related to diurnal ingestive preferences of animals in temperate climates is the high nutritional quality of C3 grass species, a typical trait of the pastures in temperate climates that easily supports animal nutritional demands over the day when the sward is high or herbage mass allows high bite masses. Because of this, night foraging activity is usually characterized as occurring in shorter intervals and less intense bouts. Overall, night foraging represents a small percentage of daily foraging time and contribute minimally to daily herbage intake in temperate climates. However, in subtropical natural grasslands, as in our experiment and as observed by Trindade et al., sometimes the nutrient concentrations of the pasture are poor, and consequently, animals have to spend more time during the day to attend to their energetic requirements, even with no limiting intake factors based on sward conditions (high or mass).\n\n    Thus, evaluations of grazing time, which consider only day length (DAY-SUN and DAYLIGHT), are incomplete in the representation of grazing time and natural behavior of heifers over 24 h (CONTROL). In these situations, grazing time was significantly lower than grazing time normally presented by the animals. Even when 2 h was added past sunset (DAYLIGHT+2), the time spent grazing was significantly lower than grazing time measured over 24 h. This definitively suggests that there is significant nighttime foraging (Figure 2). Champion et al. and Gregorini et al. suggest that both sheep and cows may have significant meals at night. In temperate climates, ruminants have approximately three major grazing events per day: at sunrise, around 12:00, and sunset. However, this pattern is flexible and affected by external environmental conditions, especially environmental temperatures. According to Gregorini et al., an adaptation could be an increase in the length of grazing events and a decrease in the number of meals during short days, or ruminants could increase meal numbers, including times at night to allocate these meals.\n\n    To faithfully represent the natural behavior of heifers, it is possible to confirm that the time extent of grazing behavior assessments that should be evaluated needs to include part of the night. In our case, despite being 35 min less total grazing time than the CONTROL, evaluations using all day and until midnight showed no differences (P > 0.05) when compared with the natural behavior of heifers. To achieve this representativeness, we evaluated 75% of the entire day.\n\n    Additionally, our data support that in a tropical climate situation, sunlight (including dawn and dusk) has a strong influence on animal activity, even in warm environments. Furthermore, another important fact is that grazing events, which occur after sunset, should not be underestimated. Nevertheless, trials assuming that grazing time observed only between sunrise and sunset (natural light) represents an accurate estimate of the grazing time are underestimating the real time that animals spend foraging. This bias can be magnified when this incomplete information is used to estimate/calculate other behavior variables (e.g., bite mass) causing serious misunderstandings, especially in trials were the bite mass is estimated by the division of daily animal intake by the daily bite number, which, in turn, is estimated by multiplying the bite rate by total grazing time.\n\n    Of course, to determine the \"size\" of the evaluation period that must be performed, baseline experiments need to be conducted. In our case, it was possible to reduce the total evaluation period by 25% with no effects in grazing representativeness [all seasons mean: 94% of the total grazing time observed in the CONTROL treatment (P > 0.05)]. This protocol reduces possible overestimations of other dependent variables of grazing time and allows the comparison among trials conducted in similar conditions, mostly by representing the actual grazing time of animals.\n\n    Grazing activity occurs mainly during daylight and the influence of day length changes the foraging patterns of animals (Figure 2). Moreover, the different grazing peaks during different seasons demonstrate the ability of animals to adapt their ingestive activity to variations in daylight, reserving most rumination and rest activities for periods of darkness to maintain their welfare. Furthermore, there are other factors to determine this pattern, such as the difficulty of food selection during dark periods, defense mechanisms, and hormonal factors.\n\n    The extent of grazing taking place during daylight in summer and spring (higher temperatures) compared with that in autumn and winter (lower temperatures) was not highly variable, even though the peaks in this behavior occurred during different periods of the day. In summer and spring, grazing begins earlier in the day compared with that of autumn and winter seasons. Consequently, grazing peaks during the morning are more intense in warm seasons than cool ones. This probably occurs because of the longer photoperiod, which encourages the animals to begin foraging earlier, and thus, it reduces the need for foraging during the hottest period of the day (late morning/early afternoon). After the first meal (morning grazing peak), animals decrease the time spent grazing, probably because of rumen filling.\n\n    Another important practical information indicated by our data is related to the use of feeding supplements in production systems. When the use of supplementary sources of feeding is necessary, supplements should be offered to the animals between the grazing peaks. In our subtropical environment, this means offering it from 08:30 to 09:30 (spring-summer) and from 09:30 to 10:30 (autumn-winter) (Figure 2). Thus, using this information, it is possible to reduce herbage substitution by the supplement, and this was already used in that particular environment. Furthermore, when energetic supplements are used, this management schedule allows better use of herbage nitrogen.\n\n    Grazing peaks earlier in the afternoon during autumn and winter compared with that of summer and spring, which may be a consequence of the interaction of photoperiod and environmental temperatures. The first is related to the light period when animals can distribute themselves for better grazing activity, avoiding the high-temperature periods of the day. Secondly, animals start grazing when temperatures are milder (late afternoon). In seasons with high environmental temperatures, this grazing peak [mainly in summer ] is slightly longer than in other seasons.\n\n    The longer duration and later start of the afternoon grazing peak probably influences the later onset of grazing during the nighttime period during summer. Only during summer did animals not obtain a meal during the night between 22:00 and 01:00 h. Grazing events over the night are also necessary for the animals to maintain their metabolic heat production (by rumen fermentation) during cool seasons. Furthermore, our data of nighttime behavior observations contradicted the assumption that heifers do not forage for significant periods at night. Therefore, if one of the experimental goals is to measure the length of foraging events and represent natural grazing activity, it is necessary to accurately evaluate periods of nighttime grazing, especially under subtropical and tropical climate conditions.",

        "Abstract": "    The NEonate and Children audiT of Anaesthesia pRactice IN Europe (NECTARINE) prospective observational study reported critical events requiring intervention during 35.2% of 6542 anesthetic episodes in 5609 infants up to 60 weeks postmenstrual age. The United Kingdom (UK) was one of 31 participating countries.\n\n    Subgroup analysis of UK NECTARINE cases (12.8% of cohort) to identify perioperative critical events that triggered medical interventions. Secondary aims were to describe UK practice, identify factors more commonly associated with critical events, and compare 30-day morbidity and mortality between participating UK and nonUK centers.\n\n    Seventeen UK centers recruited 722 patients (68.7% male, 36.1% born preterm, and 48.1% congenital anomalies) undergoing anesthesia for 876 surgical or diagnostic procedures at 25-60 weeks postmenstrual age. Repeat anesthesia/surgery was common: 17.6% patients prior to and 14.4% during the recruitment period. Perioperative critical events triggered interventions in 300/876 (34.3%) cases. Cardiovascular instability (16.9% of cases) and/or reduced oxygenation (11.4%) were more common in younger patients and those with co-morbidities or requiring preoperative intensive support. A higher proportion of UK than nonUK cases were graded as ASA-Physical Status scores >2 or requiring urgent or emergency procedures, and 39% required postoperative intensive care. Thirty-day morbidity (complications in 17.2%) and mortality (8/715, 1.1%) did not differ from nonUK participants.\n\n    Perioperative critical events and co-morbidities are common in neonates and young infants. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality data did not demonstrate national differences in outcome. Identifying factors associated with increased risk informs preoperative assessment, resource allocation, and discussions between clinicians and families.",
        "Introduction": "    The incidence of critical perioperative events and morbidity and mortality is higher in neonates and young infants than in older children.\n\n    A high proportion of neonates/young infants undergoing anesthesia have clinically important co-morbidities, with many requiring perioperative intensive care management and/or repeated surgical or procedural interventions.\n\n    Despite some differences in recruited patient population and service delivery, incidences of critical perioperative events, morbidity and mortality were comparable for UK and nonUK participants in the NECTARINE study.\n\n    Postoperative mortality is higher in neonates than in older children, with additional risk factors including co-morbidities, preoperative instability requiring intensive support, sepsis, emergency surgery, birth at younger gestational ages, and complications of prematurity. Severe perioperative critical events are also more common in neonates than in older children. Reported perioperative outcomes frequently relate to clinical indicators (i.e., adverse cardiorespiratory events, changes in vital signs, or laboratory measures) in neonates, whereas patient-centered and comfort measures (i.e., pain, analgesia, nausea and vomiting, and behavior) are common for older ages.\n\n    The APRICOT study recruited over 30 000 children across 33 European countries and identified a higher incidence of critical events in 361 neonates. The subsequent NEonate and Children audiT of Anaesthesia pRactice IN Europe (NECTARINE) prospective multicenter observational study focused on patients up to 60 weeks postmenstrual age requiring anesthesia for surgical or diagnostic procedures, and reported perioperative critical events, morbidity and mortality for 5609 infants undergoing 6542 procedures. Severe critical events requiring interventions occurred in 35.2% of cases, and the triad of hypotension, hypoxemia, and anemia had a major impact on morbidity and mortality.\n\n    Differences in the incidence and management of severe perioperative critical events across countries participating in the APRICOT cohort highlighted variability in pediatric and neonatal anesthesia practice, and raised issues related to training, resources, clinical experience, workload, and infrastructure. As a result, the Trial Steering Committee agreed that secondary analyses for nations contributing large numbers of patients to NECTARINE could test the hypothesis that primary outcome measures were not different from the remaining cohort.\n\n    This manuscript relates to UK recruitment of neonates and infants (</=60 weeks postmenstrual age) requiring general anesthesia for surgery or nonsurgical procedures in the NECTARINE prospective cohort study. The primary aim of this subgroup analysis was to report the incidence of severe critical perioperative events in UK centers, with particular emphasis on cardiovascular, respiratory events, and management of difficult airways. Secondary aims were to compare 30-day morbidity and mortality between UK and participating nonUK centers and explore potential differences in anesthesia practice.",
        "Methods": "    The NEonate-Children sTudy of Anaesthesia pRactice IN Europe (NECTARINE) is a European prospective multicenter observational cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02350348) with participating centers in 31 countries. The study protocol, standardized case report form (CRF) and additional documents are available online (European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care - Clinical Trial Network; https://www.esaic.org/research/clinical-trial-network/completed-trials/nectarine/). The Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (APAGBI) endorsed the study, coordinated a call for UK participating centers, and provided funding for centralized follow-up in the UK. Ethics approvals (National Health Service [NHS] National Research Ethics Service, 16/LO/0238, 16-3-2016; NHS Health Research Authority, 21-3-2016) for parental consent prior to, or within 24 h of anesthesia, and for follow-up were obtained. Thirty-day follow-up was performed via medical records. Standardized follow-up at 90 days was performed by the Great Ormond Street Hospital Somers Clinical Research Facility, following secure transfer of recruited subject information. The recruiting hospital and/or family doctor was contacted initially to confirm the patient's status. Parents had the option to agree to access of the child's medical records but decline direct telephone contact at 90 days. Recruitment commenced at 4 centers on 1-4-2016, an additional 13 centers on 1-5-2016, and ceased on 5-7-2016.\n\n    Data were collected by the anesthesia team onto a standardized CRF, that included details of the following: patient demographics and medical history, preanesthesia assessment, baseline parameters, surgery/procedure, anesthesia management, and perioperative critical events. CRF data was entered into a secure internet-based electronic case record form (OpenClinica, Boston, MA, USA). Following data cleaning and resolution of queries, the final NECTARINE dataset was exported for analysis in October 2019, and national datasets were subsequently available to Lead Investigators.\n\n    Eligibility and data collection for the study are as previously described. In brief, neonates and infants up to 60 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA: gestational age at birth plus chronological age) undergoing anesthesia for surgical or nonsurgical procedures were eligible for inclusion.\n\n    Eight predetermined critical events that required intervention by the anesthesia team related to: oxygenation; carbon dioxide (CO2) and alveolar ventilation; blood pressure; heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm; cerebral oxygenation (if monitoring with near-infrared spectroscopy was available); blood glucose and plasma sodium; hemoglobin levels; and body temperature. The physiological parameter threshold that triggered an intervention(s), and the type and timing of intervention(s) were recorded. Perioperative data collection continued until the patient was discharged from the postanesthesia care unit (maximum 120 min) and/or transferred to a neonatal or pediatric intensive care unit. Thirty-day data included patient status (i.e., at home or in hospital), time in intensive care and morbidity/complications. Mortality data were collected at 30- and 90-day follow-up.\n\n    Quantitative variables are reported as median [25, 75 interquartile range] and compared with Mann-Whitney, or if normally distributed as mean +- standard deviation and compared with Student's t-test. All tests were two-sided. p values are reported to a minimum of p < 0.001, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patient categorical data are summarized as absolute numbers and percentages, and comparisons performed with chi-squared test with p values and odds ratio [95% CI] reported. Throughout, group values and analyses are based on available data, and any missing data are reflected by the reduced sample size (n). The statistical analysis plan for the full NECTARINE cohort was based on an expected percentage of severe perioperative critical events of 11% and estimated a sample of 4941 patients for a logistic regression analysis with more than one covariate. Therefore, analyses for the current subgroup data are restricted to descriptive comparisons. Analysis was performed with SPPS Statistics V27 (IBM, Portsmouth, UK; June 2020).",
        "Results": "    Perioperative data for 876 procedures in 722 patients in the UK represents 13.4% of the 6542 procedures and 12.9% of the 5609 patients reported in the NECTARINE cohort. Nineteen UK centers expressed interest, two were subsequently unable to participate, and 17 centers contributed data for between two and 114 patients (Figure S1). Seventeen patients were excluded following recruitment due to incomplete consent, a large amount of missing data despite queries, or subsequent withdrawal of parent/carer consent.\n\n    Comparing UK data with nonUK cohort data reveals no statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants born preterm (<37 weeks gestational age 261/722 vs. 1739/5609 patients) but a slightly higher incidence of congenital anomalies (OR 1.2 [1.0, 1.4]; odds ratio [95% CI]) (Table 1). At the time of anesthesia, a higher proportion of UK neonates had undergone previous surgery (OR 1.4 [1.2, 1.6]); ASA scores of III-IV were more common (OR 1.9 [1.7, 2.2]); and a higher proportion were graded as urgent or emergency rather than elective cases (OR 4.2 [3.6, 4.9]) (Table 2).\n\n    The majority of UK cases was recruited at major pediatric centers with neonatal and/or pediatric intensive care wards, and 26.7% of cases required intensive care preoperatively. Postoperatively, 39% of cases (341/875) were transferred to intensive care; this was unplanned in four (0.46%) and related to the perioperative critical event in one. The majority of patients remained intubated for transfer to intensive care (238/341; 70%), and intubation was unplanned and related to the critical event in seven (0.8%) cases. Thirty days following the last anesthesia episode, 19/715 (2.7%) patients were still in intensive care, a further 29/716 (4.1%) had been readmitted to intensive care as a separate event, and total intensive care days for these patients ranged from 1-36 (median 7 [3, 21]).\n\n    Anesthesia was required for surgical procedures in 79.8% (gastro-intestinal/abdominal surgery most common) and for procedural or diagnostic interventions in 20.2% (see Table S1 for details).\n\n    UK anesthesia team members included a postfellowship consultant anesthetist plus anesthetist in training for 413/876 cases (47.1%) or consultant only for 303 cases (34.6%). Two or more consultants were involved in 149 cases (17%); this included a senior (>5 years post certification) and junior consultant for 105 cases, plus an anesthetist in training for 34 cases. Only 11 cases (1.3%) were undertaken by anesthesia trainees alone (age range 36.1-57 weeks PMA, ASA-PS >2 in 3 cases).\n\n    Repeated episodes of anesthesia were frequent in UK (269/876, 30.7%) and nonUK participants (2037/5934, 34.3%). At the time of initial recruitment, 138/722 UK participants had required previous anesthesia (>=3 in 22). Throughout the 9-13 weeks of UK recruitment, 104 patients underwent an additional surgery or procedure (1 in 77, 2 in 15, >=3 in 12).\n\n    Anesthesia techniques included general anesthesia in 65.9%, combined general and regional anesthesia in 33.4%, or regional anesthesia alone in 6 cases (0.7%) (Table S2). Airway management included tracheal intubation for the majority of episodes (90.2%), with the oral route (708/788) and uncuffed (607/787) endotracheal tubes most commonly used (Table S3).\n\n    Standard monitoring (ECG, SpO2, capnography, anesthetic agent, and temperature) was reported for all cases. An arterial line was used in 138 (15.8%), central venous catheter in 85 (9.7%), and both in 76 cases. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used in 42 surgical cases (4.8%) at 6 centers.\n\n    Perioperative critical events requiring 455 interventions were reported in 300/876 (34.3%) anesthesia cases, and this incidence is comparable with the full cohort (35.3% [95% CI 34.1-36.4]). Interventions were most commonly for cardiovascular instability (49.3% interventions) and/or hypoxemia (33%) in UK cases, and in the full cohort (60.7% and 36%, respectively). Additional interventions related to the following: alterations in body temperature (n = 49; trigger range 34-39 C); red cell transfusion for anemia (n = 36; hemoglobin trigger range 4.0-11.5 g dL-1); or disturbances in blood glucose (n = 32; trigger reported as </=4 mMol L-1 in 19 and >/=9 mMol L-1 in 10) and/or plasma sodium (n = 3; trigger value 124-138 mMol L-1). In 6 cases, changes in NIRS rSO2 led to an intervention (triggered by absolute value in the range 10-50; or 15-20% decrease).\n\n    Perioperative cardiovascular instability was reported in 130 patients during 148 episodes of anesthesia (Table 3). These patients were born at younger gestational ages, and were more likely to have congenital anomalies, a previous requirement for respiratory support, or patent ductus arteriosus. By 30-day follow-up, a higher proportion of patients with perioperative cardiovascular instability had experienced complications, required intensive care, and remained in hospital (Table 4).\n\n    Inotrope/vasopressor infusions were required preoperatively in 25 cases and were part of anesthesia management from the beginning in an additional 18 cases. Subsequent intraoperative cardiovascular instability requiring intervention was reported in 148/876 (16.9%) cases. Perioperative cardiovascular instability was more commonly associated with the following: younger postmenstrual and chronological age at the time of anesthesia; preoperative intensive support; ASA-PS score III-IV; current cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities; and the need for urgent or emergency surgery (Table 3).\n\n    Critical changes in blood pressure triggered interventions in 142 cases, of which 65 cases required a single intervention and 46 cases required multiple (3 or more) interventions. Baseline systolic blood pressure increased with postmenstrual age at the time of anesthesia (Spearman's rho = 0.41 [95% CI 0.34, 0.47]) was variable across all ages (Figure S2A) but lower in patients who subsequently developed cardiovascular instability (Table 3; Figure S2B). Management of hypotension included administration of intravenous fluid in 134 cases, pharmacological interventions in 57 cases, or both (Table S4). The change in blood pressure that triggered an intervention was variable (average decrease for fluids 41 +- 22%, and for drugs 42 +- 24%) (Figure S2C). Heart rate disturbances triggered 11 interventions (Table S2). Successful treatment was reported in 135 cases, but cardiovascular instability persisted in 4 (3 admitted from intensive care and all transferred to intensive care postoperatively). Thirty cases required interventions for both hypotension and hypoxia and included 7 cases (0.8%) with the composite event of hypotension, hypoxia, and anemia requiring red blood cell transfusion.\n\n    Interventions were required for hypoxemia (11.4%, n = 100) altered CO2 (9.1%, n = 80) or difficult airway management (3.3%, n = 29).\n\n    Hypoxemia triggered interventions in 100 cases (93 patients, 7 patients with hypoxemia in 2 episodes), with 54/100 triggered by SpO2 < 85%. Hypoxemia interventions were more common when anesthesia episodes were required at younger postmenstrual age for urgent/emergency procedures. A higher proportion were requiring preoperative respiratory or intensive care support, and baseline SpO2 was lower (Table 3). Episodes of hypoxemia were more common during maintenance (72%) than induction (24%) or awakening (12%) with >=3 interventions required during 31 cases. Oxygenation improved in 95 cases, but persistent decreases despite intervention were reported in 5 cases.\n\n    Patients requiring intervention(s) for hypoxemia were more likely to have congenital abnormalities or preexisting medical conditions. Thirty-day morbidity was higher, and a lower proportion had been discharged home (Table 4).\n\n    Changes in ventilation in response to altered pCO2 were more commonly triggered by hypercapnia (61/876, 7.0%) than hypocapnia (11/876, 1.3%). Across 80 episodes, a single intervention was required in 38 episodes, with >=3 interventions in 20 cases, and persistent difficulties despite interventions were noted in 10% (8/80) of cases.\n\n    Unplanned intraoperative intubation was reported in 4/876 (0.46%) to improve oxygenation (2 cases) or alveolar ventilation (2 cases).\n\n    Cormack-Lehane scores were graded as 1-2 in 678/787 (77.4%) and 3-4 in 6/787 (0.7%) (Table S3). Interventions for difficult airways were reported in 29 episodes (1 patient during 2 episodes), were unplanned in 20/29, and were associated with difficulty with face-mask ventilation in 2, hypoxemia in 6, and bradycardia in 1 of 29 cases. Successful intubation was achieved in 28 cases, and the most frequent interventions included changing laryngoscope blades (15/29) and/or using a stylet or bougie (13/29). Advanced interventions included video-assisted intubation in 4 and fiber-optic bronchoscopy in 1 case. One patient who was unable to be intubated despite multiple attempts was woken up, but successfully intubated with video-assisted intubation on a subsequent occasion (Table S5).\n\n    Thirty-day morbidity and mortality data were comparable in UK and nonUK NECTARINE participants (Table 5). At 30 days, complications were reported in 17.2% of UK patients. Causes for mortality by 30-day follow-up (8/715, 1.1%) included sepsis, multiorgan failure, congenital, or acquired brain abnormality, and respiratory failure.\n\n    By 30 days, fewer UK neonates (75.9%) had been discharged home compared with the remainder of the cohort (OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.63, 0.92]) as a higher proportion remained in the treating hospital or had been transferred to another hospital (Table 5). Ninety-day follow-up data was obtained for 303/722 patients (42%), with 8/303 still in hospital and additional mortality (3/303) between 30-90 days (Table S6).\n\n    Inhalation rather than intravenous induction was much more common in UK vs. nonUK cases (786/868, 90.5% vs. 3016/5452, 55.3%; OR 7.7 [95% CI 6.1-9.7]).\n\n    Opioid administration at induction and/or during maintenance was reported in 21.6% and 46.3% of UK cases, respectively. Fentanyl was the commonest opioid used in UK and nonUK cases, but remifentanil was given less frequently in the UK (1.4% at induction, 4.4% during maintenance vs. 5.2% induction, 8.8% maintenance), and sufentanil was not utilized in the UK but was reported in other countries (12.7% induction, 10.5% maintenance).\n\n    Baseline hemoglobin for 499/876 UK cases was 11.6 [9.9, 14.4] g dl-1 (median[IQR]) and comparable to the full cohort (11.1 [9.5, 12.9]). Transfusion for anemia and/or cardiovascular instability was reported in 48 (5.4%) cases with a trigger of 8.2 [7.2, 9.3] g dl-1 (6.9% of cases in full cohort with trigger 8.4 [7.5, 9.6]).\n\n    Anesthesia teams frequently included at least one senior anesthetist for both UK (730/875, 83.4%) and nonUK (4771/5664, 84.2%) cases. However, some aspects of service delivery differed. Eleven urgent/emergency procedures (0.11%; 8 surgery, 2 IV access, 1 bronchoscopy) at 7 different UK centers were performed in ICU, which represents a smaller proportion than nonUK cases (252/5414, 4.4%). Inter-hospital transfers were more frequent in the UK, with a higher proportion of patients admitted from another hospital preoperatively (114/876, 13% vs. 390/5666, 6.9%) and discharged to another hospital by 30 days (79/715, 11.1% vs. 178/4505, 4%).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this UK subgroup analysis of the NECTARINE study, perioperative critical events occurred in just over a third of neonatal/infant anesthetics before 60 weeks PMA (875 anesthetics in 722 patients). The overall incidence and the predominance of events triggered by cardiovascular or respiratory parameters are consistent with data from nonUK centers. Within the constraints of the UK sample size, patient factors associated with critical events and subsequent 30-day morbidity and mortality were comparable with full cohort data.\n\n    Serious perioperative clinical events requiring medical intervention were reported in one third of cases. Interventions for cardiovascular instability or hypoxemia were more often required in younger patients born at earlier gestational ages, those with current co-morbidities and requirements for intensive preoperative support (reflected by higher ASA-PS scores), and during urgent/emergency or more prolonged procedures. This is consistent with NECTARINE and previous studies, and reflects parameters included in risk assessment tools for pediatric surgery. These data also highlight the need for enhanced reporting of critical events and quality improvement initiatives. Triggers for intervention were variable, but single data points do not reflect the speed of change that may have occurred, or the degree of change which may be tolerated in neonates with differing co-morbidities.\n\n    The incidence of difficult tracheal intubation in 3.7% of UK cases was lower than 5.8% reported for the full NECTARINE cohort, but the pattern of interventions was similar. Direct laryngoscopy remains the primary choice for endotracheal intubation in neonates with a change of blade or the addition of a stylet or bougie and calling for assistance as the first line for difficult airways. The use of videolaryngoscopy or fiberoptic techniques was rare at the time of recruitment, but evidence of higher success rates with videolaryngoscopy has now been documented. The need for ongoing teaching, training, and frequent practice of difficult airway scenarios, while addressing nonhuman factors, has also been highlighted. Changes to the systematic and continuous use of oxygen during endotracheal intubation while ensuring appropriate and effective use of new technologies may be required. Guidelines for the management of difficult airways in older children are available (e.g., https://www.das.uk.com/guidelines/paediatric-difficult-airway-guidelines), and there are current plans to develop an international, evidence-based consensus for the management of the difficult airway in neonates.\n\n    Thirty-day morbidity was increased in patients with perioperative cardiorespiratory critical events, the proportion requiring intensive care management postoperatively was increased, and fewer patients had been discharged home. Many factors resulting in physiological instability are inter-related, with both hypotension and hypoxia occurring in 30 cases, and in 7 cases, there was co-occurrence of hypoxia, hypotension, and anemia, which was associated with increased morbidity (RR 3.56 [95% CI 1.64-7.71]) and mortality (RR 19.80 [95% CI 5.87-66.7]) in the full cohort. While the UK sample is too small to reliably calculate relative risk, proportions are consistent with analyses derived from NECTARINE and previous studies from major pediatric centers. However, reported rates of anesthesia-related mortality and 30-day hospital mortality can be influenced by definitions, inclusion criteria, methods of reporting, and case-mix (e.g., academic vs. general hospitals). While the proportion of surgical vs. nonsurgical cases (80% and 20%, respectively) and surgical disciplines (e.g., 49% gastro-intestinal surgery) did not differ between UK and nonUK cases, a higher proportion of UK infants had ASA-PS scores of III-IV were requiring respiratory support at the time of anesthesia and underwent urgent/emergency cases. Despite this apparent higher risk case-mix, 30-day morbidity and mortality were not increased for UK cases. However, differences in reporting criteria or preoperative management, variability in interpreting criteria and assigning ASA-PS scores, and the relatively small UK sample size may also be contributory factors. The relative and inter-related contributions of preoperative status, perioperative instability, and postoperative complications to mortality cannot be determined, but data highlight risk factors that can inform discussions with medical care teams and parents/caregivers. There is an ongoing need to understand the impact of postmenstrual age on \"normal ranges\" for physiological parameters (e.g., blood pressure and hemoglobin) and to know when and how to intervene to optimize physiological homeostasis and improve outcome.\n\n    Younger age at birth and at time of anesthesia were associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in those born extremely preterm (<28 weeks PMA) who continue to be at risk for early mortality. The need for surgery following preterm birth has been associated with increased surgical morbidity and 30-day mortality, and also adverse effects on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. The type of surgery and duration of anesthesia and hospital stay also requires consideration, with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome also reported following single or repeated neonatal surgery for major noncardiac anomalies. Impaired tissue perfusion associated with hypotension, hypoxia, and anemia may contribute to brain injury. Interventions based primarily on NIRS values were uncommon in the NECTARINE study, and further prospective trials have been recommended to establish the specificity and benefit of perioperative neuromonitoring in neonates. As a relatively high proportion of UK patients required pre and/or postoperative intensive care admission, data related to surgery and perioperative critical events should be considered when evaluating long-term outcome following NICU.\n\n    The current data highlight resource requirements for delivery of surgical, anesthetic, and intensive care for neonatal patients. Early recognition of \"high risk\" patients and procedures, and timely transfer to specialized centers with experienced staff may minimize adverse outcomes. The UK National Health Service (NHS) has service specifications for neonatal surgery (E02/S/c Paediatric Surgery: Neonates; www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/e02-paedi-surg-neon.pdf) and neonatal intensive care (E08/S/a Neonatal Critical Care; www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/01/e08-serv-spec-neonatal-critical.pdf). Services are organized into clinical networks within geographical catchment areas, and specifications for neonatal intensive care transport (E08/S/b; https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/01/e08-serv-spec-neonatal-critical-transp.pdf) facilitate transfer for specialist care. This service model includes recommendations for clinical care pathways, staffing, capacity, and response times. As a result, UK recruitment included a high proportion of cases from major pediatric centers, and the higher rate of inter-hospital transfers reflects the NHS organizational structure. Alongside UK studies reporting surgical and anesthetic considerations for specific neonatal conditions (e.g., esophageal atresia), the current data highlight issues related to preoperative assessment and co-morbidities that will inform best practice.\n\n    Provision of neonatal anesthesia requires specialist expertise that may take several years to acquire, and a high proportion of NECTARINE cases were performed by senior anesthesia staff. Anesthesia training and standards in the UK are overseen by the Royal College of Anaesthetists, with specific guidelines for the provision of pediatric anesthesia services (www.rcoa.ac.uk/gpas/chapter-10). Training requirements for anesthesia are among the longest in Europe with additional advanced fellowships (e.g., additional specialist pediatric training) frequently undertaken during the \"trainee\" or \"residency\" period. A harmonized European approach to pediatric and neonatal training is required to identify generalizable effects of experience and team cohesion.\n\n    This subgroup analysis has several limitations. As with previous NECTARINE analyses, the effects of preventive measures in the preoperative period, and variability in self-reporting and paper-based data entries remain unquantified. There is potential for under-reporting of events that were tolerated or considered acceptable by some practitioners or in some clinical contexts. The current data relates predominantly to tertiary care of high-risk neonates in the UK and may not reflect rates of complications for healthy neonates/infants undergoing more minor procedures. In addition, due to the proportionally small UK sample size, multivariable analyses were not performed, but descriptive analyses are comparable with the remainder of the NECTARINE cohort.\n\n    Morbidity and mortality following anesthesia is higher in neonates and young infants than older children. Severe critical events requiring medical interventions are common, particularly when anesthesia is required in those with prior or current co-morbidities, at younger postmenstrual ages, or for urgent/emergency surgery. National data can inform discussions of risk with parents/caregivers, highlight ongoing training needs and resource requirements, and identify areas requiring ongoing study or standardization of practice to improve outcome for neonates and young infants.",

        "Title": "    On the influence of the source of porcine colostrum in the development of early immune ontogeny in piglets",
        "Abstract": "    The effects on the ontogeny of serum cytokines and immune cells caused by feeding suckling piglets with sow/gilt colostrum and milk replacer was assessed in the present study. After farrowing, the piglets born were randomized into six groups: GG and SS (n = 10/group): piglets were kept with their dam; GS (n = 10): piglets were changed from gilts to sows; SG (n = 10): piglets were changed from sows to gilts; GMR (n = 6) and SMR (n = 8): piglets from either gilts or sows were isolated from the dams and were bottle-fed ad libitum with commercial formula milk replacer. The piglets remained in the groups during the first 24 h of life and were later returned to their respective mothers. Serum immunoglobulin concentration and lymphocyte proliferation from the blood, spleen, thymus, and mesenteric lymph node of the piglets were assessed at 24 h and at 28 days of age. Serum cytokine concentrations were measured through a cytokine multiplex assay at 24 h. Overall, piglets suckling on sows (SS and GS) had a higher concentration of serum immunoglobulin at 24 h, which was also associated with a rise in plasma cytokine concentration and greater ability of B and T cells from lymphatic organs and blood mononuclear cells to respond to mitogens. We suggest a bias towards Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-cell polarizing and cytokines during the suckling period, which may be influenced by maternal immunological factors in the colostrum, such as dam parity. All findings suggest sow parity having a possible role, which may contribute to exerting a modulating action on immune response development.",
        "Introduction": "    The early development of the immune system of pigs occurs almost entirely during gestation. The immune system has minimal activity until birth. This phase, the fetus is protected from antigenic stimuli from pathogenic organisms, with which it has no contact, due to the diffuse epitheliochorial function of the pig's placenta. Therefore, during gestation, the piglet remains in a sterile, impermeable, and protective environment offered by the uterus, which leads to an absence of antibody production in the fetus. Moreover, the epitheliochorial nature of the pig's placenta does not allow the transference of maternal immunoglobulin (Igs) to the offspring. Hence, these piglets have agammaglobulinemia at birth and are immunodeficient until weaning. After birth, the neonate piglet goes from an intrauterine sterile environment to an external environment that is rich in antigens and pathogenic agents; thus demanding an adequate immune response to survive.\n\n    The beginning of immune system activity may be triggered by events during labor, by the colostrum, and by the environment, seeking to promote protection against foreign molecules and microorganisms that are beginning their colonization and challenge the animal. In fact, a piglet's first four weeks of life represent a critical period in which these animals are more susceptible to diseases. Many factors contribute to this situation, among which are the immaturity of the newborn piglet's immune system. These piglets are not able to develop a satisfactory immune response, since their immune system is still functionally immature and lack the necessary time to generate humoral and cellular immunity. Therefore, the components of the immune system are not completely functional in a newborn piglet, requiring a few weeks to reach maturity.\n\n    The immune system originates still during the intrauterine phase and, in pigs, hematopoiesis occurs in three different places. Initially the first lymphoid organ is the yolk sac, where stem cells emerge, following to the fetal liver, where they are produced. Subsequently, they follow to the thymus for the process of cell differentiation, maturation, and selection of T lymphocytes occurs in the thymus cortex and at approximately 40 days of gestation they can be detected in the thymus, receiving the name of double negative thymocytes. The process of negative and positive selection of thymocytes is not clear and can happen in either the second or third trimester of gestation, given that during this period there is an intense death of thymocytes. In general terms, a positive selection allows the survival of T cells that express T-cell receptor (TCR) that can recognize the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the cells themselves, while a negative selection eliminates cells that connect strongly to their own MHC, an important factor to determine self-tolerance.\n\n    After birth, bone marrow takes on the role of producing lymphocytes and the thymus begins its involution. During the first weeks of life, the immune system progressives rapidly under the shield of passive maternal immunity that originates from the colostrum. Primary (bone marrow and thymus) and secondary (such as spleen, Peyer's patches, and lymph nodes) lymphoid organs are the main components of the immune system and their development and maturation carry out an important role in this process.\n\n    The immunoglobulin absorption period, which originates from the colostrum, happens during the first hours after the piglet is born and can extend to up to 36 h after labor. Absorption occurs through the intestine by means of macromolecule endocytosis after ingesting the colostrum. The colostrum contains a series of components that act directly and indirectly in the immunological function of the piglet. Immunoglobulins are the most common of these colostrum components and offer direct protection against antigens. The most abundant types in the colostrum are immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM), respectively. After being absorbed by the enterocytes they head to the intestinal lymphatic system, IgA is later sent to mucosa surfaces, while IgG remains in circulation. The concentration of IgG in colostrum is several times greater than in the sow's plasma and decreases exponentially over the first 24 h after labor.\n\n    The colostrum also contains leukocyte cells, such as granulocytes (neutrophils, 40%), T lymphocytes (30%), B lymphocytes (13-16%), and macrophages (7-11%). Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 are also present in the colostrum; these substances have an immunostimulant effect on the immune response to mitogens. In piglets either fed with milk replacers and/or substitutes or those that were deprived of sow colostrum, passive immunity transference from sow to litter does not happen and these piglets do not absorb macromolecules, such that the intestinal cells responsible for this absorption represent open vacuoles, demonstrating that there was no macromolecule endocytosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of colostrum from gilts and sows, and colostrum substitutes on the development of the porcine immune system. This was assessed by determining cytokines in the piglets' serum, cell numbers, function, and phenotypic expression of immune cell surface of isolated lymphocytes from the blood, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and thymus and their change with age in the neonatal piglet.",
        "Methods": "    The protocols and the use of animals for this research were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA) from the Embrapa Swine and Poultry National Research Center under protocol # 001/2016. This study was conducted in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\n\n    This study was conducted on nine crossbred Landrace 3Large White (LR3LW) dams. All sows were housed individually on a slatted floor during gestation. Seven days before the expected farrowing, dams were transferred from the gestation to the farrowing room. Sows had free access to water and were fed twice a day on a traditional gestation diet. The gestation diet was provided until the second day of lactation.\n\n    GG group: piglets were kept with their own gilts and allowed to suckle as normal (gilt colostrum, n = 10);\n\n    GS group: piglets were changed from gilts to sows and allowed to suckle as normal (sow colostrum, n = 10);\n\n    GMR group: piglets from gilts were isolated from the dams, kept in containers under controlled temperature and were deprived of colostrum (negative group). Piglets were bottle-fed commercial formula milk replacer for pigs (Vetmilk S, Agrifirm-Brazil) every 1 h during the first 24 h of life (n = 6).\n\n    SS group: piglets were kept with their own sows and allowed to suckle as normal (sow colostrum, n = 10);\n\n    SG group: piglets were changed from sows to gilts and allowed to suckle as normal (gilt colostrum, n = 10);\n\n    SMR group: piglets from sows were isolated, colostrum-deprived, and placed in the same condition as the GMR group (n = 8).\n\n    A total of 30 candidate healthy dams (20 sows and 10 gilts) with similar expected delivery dates were selected and prostaglandin F2 alpha was administered at 6:00 AM on day 113 of gestation to ensure synchronous delivery. Candidate sows/gilts were excluded if the difference in delivery time was more than 1 h. In total, five synchronously delivering adult pregnant multiparous sows (parity = 4~6) and four primiparous gilts were selected for this study. All sows were examined (feed intake, rectal temperature, vulval discharge, and milk production) to exclude the possibility of puerperal disorders, mainly mastitis-metritis-agalactia syndrome. The day of parturition (just after the birth of the first piglet) was considered day 0 (D0) of the experiment. Some piglets from these nine dams remained with their dam, while others were relocated. Thus, six groups were formed:\n\n    The piglets remained in the groups during the first 24 h of life and were later returned to their respective mothers (Fig. 7). Suckling and milk replacer were provided ad libitum. Blood (serum clot activator tubes and heparinized tubes) and colostrum samples were collected from the sows on D1 postpartum. Piglet serum and whole blood (heparinized tube) samples were collected on D1 and D28 after birth. Serum was collected and stored at -80  C until further analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the heparinized blood samples a few hours after collection. Colostrum was manually collected from all functional teats, after the birth of the first piglet (D0) and before suckling. To minimize the contamination of colostrum and milk, the sows' teats were previously scrubbed with iodine alcohol, handled wearing disposable latex gloves and samples were stored in sterile 50 mL conical tubes (TPP; Switzerland) and kept refrigerated. Colostrum and samples were centrifuged for 20 min (1300xg at room temperature), and the upper fat layer was discarded. After the initial treatment, serum and colostrum samples were stored at -80  C for further analysis. On D1 and D28, the piglets from all groups were euthanized at each timepoint. During the necropsy, the spleen, thymus, and mesenteric lymph node were collected in a RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 100 U of penicillin G (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 0.25 microg/mL of fungizone (pH 7.4, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).\n\n    IgA, IgG, and IgM titers in colostrum and serum samples were determined using ELISA kits for porcine IgA, IgG, and IgM quantification (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., USA), which were quantified according to Forner et al.. The concentrations of 13 cytokines were measured in undiluted colostrum and serum samples by Porcine Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Assay (MILLIPLEX MAP, Cat#PCYTMG-23 K-13PX, Merck Millipore, USA), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The quantified cytokines/chemokines were the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). The plates were run on a MAGPIX  analyzer (Luminexcorp, Austin, TX, USA). The software xPONENT version 4.2 (Luminexcorp) and MILLIPLEX  Analyst Version 5.1 (Merck Millipore, USA) were used for data acquisition and analysis, respectively. The median fluorescence intensity, analyzed using a 5-parameter logistic curve fit, was used to calculate cytokine concentrations, which were expressed in ng/mL.\n\n    Heparinized blood samples were diluted 1:3 (v/v) in PBS and the PBMCs were isolated through density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare; Sweden), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The PBMCs were cryopreserved in 95% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; Brazil) + 5% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich; United Kingdom).\n\n    The piglets were euthanized and the spleen, thymus, and mesenteric lymph nodes from each piglet at predetermined time points (D1 and D28) were isolated under aseptic conditions. The isolated tissues were individually disrupted with the plunger of a 1 mL syringe against a 100 microm cell strainer to get single-cell suspension and collected in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco, Brazil) + 2% FBS. Then, the cells were filtered to avoid tissue debris by passing cell suspension through a 70-mum Nylon Cell strainer, and were centrifuged in single-cell suspensions at 300xg for 10 min at 4  C. After that, the cells were resuspended with Pharm Lyse  buffer (BD Biosciences, USA) to lyse red blood cells at room temperature. The lysis reaction was stopped by adding 10 volumes of RPMI 1640 medium + 2% FBS and centrifuged at 300xg for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice, then the supernatant was discarded, the cells were resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium, and the cell number was counted with 0.4% Trypan blue to determine the viable cell concentration. The cells were resuspended and cryopreserved in 95% FBS + 5% DMSO at a final concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL.\n\n    The use of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) in combination with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) enabled the concomitant determination of cell proliferation and activation status of cell subpopulations with a protocol adapted from Chaoul et al.. The viable cells from the spleen, thymus, mesenteric lymph node, and PBMCs were thawed and suspended to the concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and labeled with CFSE (2.5 muM; CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation kit, Invitrogen, USA) for 15 min at 37  C in the dark. Then the labeling process was stopped by the addition of ice-cold RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, followed by incubation for 5 min in an ice bath, in the dark. Finally, the cells were washed twice with RPMI-FBS and further suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium, this medium was supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Brazil), 1 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco, Brazil), 25 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, USA) and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).\n\n    The cells were plated in 24-well plates (5 x 106 cells/well) and cultured for 96 h with complete RPMI 1640 medium at 37  C under 5% CO2, and in vitro mitogens stimulation occurred with 5 microg/mL of Concanavalin A from Canavalia ensiformis (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).\n\n    After 96 h of culture, the cells from lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, and mesenteric lymph node) were visualized using microscopy (EVOS M7000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), then were quantified, suspended in a flow cytometry buffer (1 x 106), transferred to flow cytometry tubes, and labeled for 30 min at room temperature with a cocktail of specific mAbs. For the flow cytometry, we used antibodies raised against porcine leukocyte antigens and isotype controls (BioRad Serotec, Oxford, UK), stabilizing fixative, and compensation beads from BD (North Ryde, Australia). Our flow cytometry panel was carried out following a 4-color panel to assess lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell populations. The following fluorochrome-labeled mAbs were used: panel A): 7-AAD (BD Biosciences, USA), RPE-macrophages (clone BA4D5); panel B): RPE-CD4alpha (clone MIL17), PE-Cy7-CD8alpha (clone MIL12), APC-CD3 (clone PPT3); panel C): RPE-CD4alpha (clone MIL17), PE-Cy7-CD25 (clone K2313B2), APC-CD3 (clone PPT3); panel D): RPE-CD4alpha (clone MIL17), PE-Cy7-CD3 (clone PPT3), APC-SWC2 (or CD27, clone B30C7); panel E): RPE-CD8alpha (clone MIL12), PE-Cy7-CD3 (clone PPT3), APC-SWC2 (or CD27, clone B30C7); panel F): PE-Cy7-SWC7 (or CD19, clone CC55), RPE-CD79a (clone MB-1). The following were used for PBMC: panel A): 7-AAD (BD Biosciences); panel B): RPE-CD79a (clone MB-1), PE-Cy7-SWC7 (or CD19, clone CC55); panel C): RPE-CD4alpha (clone MIL17), PE-Cy7-CD8alpha (clone MIL12), APC-CD3 (clone PPT3).\n\n    For intracellular staining, the cells were treated with the Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions, and stained with CD79a, macrophages, and CD3 mAbs. The antibodies used in the staining were previously titrated for their optimum concentrations. A total of 50,000 events per tube was acquired on the flow cytometer (Accuri C6plus and FACSCanto, Becton-Dickinson, USA) and analyzed with the aid of the software FlowJo (Becton-Dickinson, USA). The lymphocyte and macrophage gates were set on light-scatter properties (forward scatter vs. side scatter). Proliferation by CFSE (reflected by successive decrease of fluorescence intensities by dye distribution to daughter cells) was measured by flow cytometry. The results were expressed as counts of stained cells.\n\n    Comparisons among groups were carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Statistical analyses were carried out using the NPAR1WAY procedure of SAS (2012). Data are expressed as the mean +- standard error. Significance was declared at P <= 0.05.",
        "Results": "    The average weight of piglets at birth was 1.40 kg, with no significant differences among the groups (Supplementary Table S1). The animals that were fed with milk replacer (GMR and SMR) presented diarrhea around 20-36 h after birth. Eight piglets (five from GMR and three from SMR) died during the experiment, before completing 28 days. The deaths in piglets of the GMR and SMR groups occurred in the first 5-20 days of life and body weight differences and reduced mobility were observed, compared to littermates. In addition, the post-mortem analysis of the piglets did not show any respiratory nor gastrointestinal clinical macroscopic signs. Data from the first 24-h of these animals were excluded from the experiment. No significant lesions were observed in the necropsy of these pigs, but body weight measurements demonstrated that the piglets were not growing normally.\n\n    No significant differences were observed among the groups regarding body weight gain during the suckling period at 24 h of age (Supplementary Table S1); but the groups that were fed with milk replacer (GMR and SMR) had a lower body weight gain during the weaning period, at 28 days of age.\n\n    As expected, sow parity had a significant (P < 0.001) effect on colostral IgG concentration, such that the IgG concentrations in the colostrum were higher in sows than in gilts. The IgA and IgM concentrations did not differ between gilts and sows (Fig. 1).\n\n    Piglet serum Ig concentrations at days 1 and 28 of age are indicated in Fig. 2. The IgG and IgM concentration, 24 h from the start of parturition, were consistently lower in piglets fed with milk replacer (GMR, P < 0.0001; and SMR, P < 0.0001) than in the other groups. Serum IgM concentration was higher in piglets that suckled gilt colostrum (GG 3.025 +- 0.632 mg/mL and SG 3.025 +- 0.712 mg/mL) than in piglets that suckled sow colostrum (GS 1.976 +- 0.177 mg/mL and SS 1.876 +- 0.142 mg/mL). The serum IgG level was higher in the SS group, with a mean value of 27.81 +- 1.23 mg/mL. Interestingly, piglets that suckled sow colostrum, such as the SS (27.81 +- 1.23 mg/mL) and GS (25.00 +- 1.55 mg/mL) groups, had higher serum IgG concentrations than piglets that suckled gilt colostrum, which were represented by the GG (22.32 +- 2.05 mg/mL) and SG (23.54 +- 1.37 mg/mL) groups.\n\n    The remaining IgA concentration was also greater in piglets that suckled sow colostrum (3.294 +- 0.714 mg/mL for the SS group and 3.782 +- 0.572 mg/mL for the GS group) when compared to the GG (1.983 +- 0.119 mg/mL) and SG (2.326 +- 0.411 mg/mL) groups, whose piglets suckled gilt colostrum. During lactation at the 28-day mark, the IgA concentration increased three-fold in the SS group (from 3.294 to 12.06 mg/mL) (Fig. 2). The amount of IgA in piglets that suckled sow colostrum and then gilt milk (GS group) was slightly higher than the group that remained with the gilt (GG), however, it was not significantly higher at 28 days (8.346 mg/mL). The animals that received milk replacer (GMR and SMR) were the only ones that did not show an increase in IgA concentration along with lactation.\n\n    As expected, IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations decreased with time in all groups, the levels of these Igs were the highest in the first hour of lactation (Fig. 2). Even so, IgG concentrations in early life were significantly influenced by the parity of the sow providing the colostrum. Piglets that suckled sow colostrum, which were those in the SS and GS groups, showed higher values than those in the GG and SG groups, but this difference did not remain between the groups with mature milk in the weaning period (28 days). Piglets that were not fed with colostrum in the first hours of life but fed with milk replacer (GMR and SMR) showed an increased IgG level on the 28th day of life. IgM concentrations increased over time in the SMR group (from 0 to 2.802 mg/mL, P = 0.05) and in the GMR group (from 0 to 0.923 mg/mL, not significant), and showed a tendency for higher concentrations than the other groups.\n\n    All cytokines (GM-CSF, IFNgamma, IL-1alpha, IL-1ra, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFalpha) evaluated using Luminex were expressed, and the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines analyzed among the piglet groups at 24 h of age are shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S4. To identify if maternal immunological factors transferred to offspring via colostrum play a potential role in ontogeny changes and immunomodulate the immune repertoire of the offspring, the concentration of plasma cytokines and chemokines in dam and piglet groups over the first day of life were measured.\n\n    Comparing the two groups of dams, GM-CSF, IFNgamma, IL-1alpha, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFalpha concentrations were significantly higher in sow colostrum (P < 0.05) and serum (P < 0.05) than in gilts (Fig. 3, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).\n\n    Similar to the analysis of sow cytokines, the concentrations of GM-CSF, IFNgamma, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFalpha were significantly higher in the groups with piglets suckling on sow colostrum (SS and GS) than in the groups with gilt colostrum (GG and SG; P < 0.05). Finally, the lowest concentrations of these cytokines were observed in the groups of suckling piglets that were fed milk replacer (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S4). Overall, we detected a similar developmental pattern for all Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokine correlates. Nevertheless, the production of IL-1RA and IL-8 was higher in groups of suckling piglets that were fed milk replacer (GMR and SMR) than among piglets that suckled either sow or gilt colostrum (SS, SG, GG, and GS), but these values were not significantly higher (Fig. 4).\n\n    Trypan blue exclusion staining and a microscopic evaluation of viability were conducted right after the primary culture cell (thymus, peripheral blood mononuclear cells-PBMCs, spleen and mesenteric lymph node-mLN) at the pre-determined time points (24 h and 28 days), following a flow cytometric analysis. The analysis by flow cytometry showed that the number of macrophage cells, T and B lymphocytes, increased with the age of the piglets in all lymphatic tissues evaluated.\n\n    The gate was performed as described in a previous study conducted by our research group. In summary, the gate was based on forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) properties to estimate lymphocyte population and debris exclusion, whereas doublet cells were subjected to doublet plotting considering the forward scatter height (FSC-H) against the forward scatter area (FSC-A). Dead cell discrimination was excluded using 7-AAD staining. Then, according to CD3, CD4, CD8alpha, CD79a, CD19, CD27, CD25, and macrophage expressions, seven different cell subsets were defined: (i) CD3e+CD4+, (ii) CD3e+CD4+CD27+, (iii) CD3e+CD4+CD25+, (iv) CD3e+CD8alpha+, (v) CD3e+CD8alpha+CD27+, (vi) CD19+CD79a+, and (vii) macrophages+. Therefore, CD3+ cells were considered to represent 100% of T lymphocytes; CD27+ represents central memory T cells; CD25+ represents regulatory T cells; CD79a+ represents B lymphocytes; and macrophages+ represent monocyte/macrophage lineages. The foremost predominant immune cell type in lymphatic tissues evaluated were T lymphocytes (Supplementary Table S6).\n\n    PBMCs cells were stained with CFSE and then activated with Concanavalin A for 24 h and 28 days. The flow cytometry analysis results of these cells are given in Fig. 5. Counterstaining with CD3/CD79a and 7-AAD allowed us to gate on live B and T cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of cells. A higher count of activated B (CD19+CD79a+) and T cells (CD3e+CD4+ and CD3e+CD8alpha+) was observed in groups with piglets that suckled on sow colostrum (SS and GS) at the 24-h mark (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S5). A variety of activated cell changes was observed in the weaning period (28 days, Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S5). The changes from colostrum to mature milk also modified the amount of activated B and T cells in groups of piglets that suckled colostrum from either another dam (GS and SG) or from their dam (GG and SS), and those that were fed a milk replacer (GMR and SMR). In this case, the offspring from sows (SS) that suckled sow's colostrum and mature milk (after 24 h of life) showed a significantly higher amount of activated T and B cells than their siblings from other groups (SG and SMR), as well as piglets from gilts (GG, GS, and GMR), though this was significantly higher in the SS group (Fig. 5).\n\n    A flow cytometry analysis was carried out to determine the colostrum's potential in activating CD3e+CD4+ helper T cells, CD3e+CD8a+ cytotoxic T cells, and T cell subsets in lymphatic organs under Concanavalin A stimulation for 24 h and 28 days of life. The T cell population was more numerous than the B cell population. Spontaneous proliferation by nonstimulated lymphocytes and proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes was significantly affected by age, considering lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood, spleen, thymus, and mesenteric lymph node (Supplementary Table S6). However, piglets fed with milk replacer (GMR and SMR groups) showed lower proliferation lymphocytes than groups fed colostrum (SS, SG, GG, and GS).\n\n    In addition, the proliferation of isolated lymphocytes was analyzed using the CFSE dye and presented through the stimulation proliferation index. Interestingly, the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, when labeled with CFSE, enabled a more thorough analysis and comparison of the differences in lymphocyte proliferation between the groups of piglets (Fig. 6). According to CFSE intensity and number of cells, lymphocyte proliferation was higher in piglets nursed by sows. Subsequently, lymphoid cell subpopulations were also characterized by specific antibodies through flow cytometry.\n\n    The sow colostrum increased the CD3e+CD4+ helper T-cell population and CD4+ T cell subsets at the 24-h time point, such as CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell and CD3e+CD4+CD27+ naive and/or central memory CD4+ T-cell in thymus (CD3e+CD4+  = P < 0.0002; CD3e+CD4+CD25+  = P < 0.0001; and CD3e+CD4+CD27+  = P < 0.0001) and spleen (CD3e+CD4+  = P < 0.0017; CD3e+CD4+CD25+  = P < 0.0091; and CD3e+CD4+CD27+  = P < 0.0036), thus these cells populations were significantly influenced by colostrum according to sow parity (Table 1). The SS group showed an increased count of the CD4+ population when compared to their littermates in the SMR and SG groups (SS   SG   SMR groups) (P < 0.05). Piglets of the GS group also presented a higher content of CD4+ population (CD3e+CD4+, CD3+CD4+CD25+ and CD3e+CD4+CD27+; P <= 0.05) in comparison to their littermates from the GG and GMR groups.\n\n    In relation to the CD3e+CD8alpha+ cytotoxic T cell population in the thymus (P < 0.009), spleen (P < 0.05), and mLN (P < 0.009) at the 24-h mark, the piglets that were allowed to suckle their mother's colostrum (GG and SS groups) showed a significantly higher amount of cytotoxic T cells than the piglet groups that either suckled other mother's colostrum (GS and SG) or were fed with milk replacer (GMR and SMR) (SG   SS   SMR and GS   GG   GMR groups) (Table 1). Similarly, CD3e+CD8alpha+CD27+ memory T cells in the spleen, thymus, and mLN were higher in the GG and SS groups than in the GS, SG, GMR, and SMR groups, though this was only significant in the thymus (P < 0.009).\n\n    We also evaluated the CD19+CD79a+ B cell (SWC7+CD79a+) populations of lymphatic tissues. When the piglets were fed with sow colostrum, a higher concentration of B cells was observed in these piglets (SS and GS groups), in splenocytes (P < 0.05) and thymocytes (P < 0.01). However, B cells from the mesenteric lymph node were higher in piglets born from sows (SS, SG, and SMR) rather than gilts (GG, GS, and GMR) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, piglets that received sow colostrum had a higher amount of B cells than their siblings that were fed either gilt colostrum or milk replacer (SS   SG   SMR and GS   GG   GMR groups) (Table 1).\n\n    Data for age-related changes in the transcription factor expression of T and B cells are shown in Table 2. As expected, a considerable increase of cell population with age was observed. Similar to the observations at 24 h in different organs, Concanavalin A stimulation tended to show an increase in helper T cell (CD3e+CD4+), naive and/or central memory T cell (CD3e+CD4+CD27+) and B cell (CD19+CD79a+) population in piglets that suckled sow colostrum compared to sibling piglets that suckled gilt colostrum and fed milk replacer (SS   SG   SMR and GS   GG   GMR groups). However, the populations of CD3e+CD4+CD25+ and CD3e+CD8a+CD27+ T cells were higher in piglets that were kept with their own dam and allowed to suckle normally (SS   SG   SMR and GG   GS   GMR groups) (P < 0.05). CD3e+CD8a+ T cells isolated from the thymus and spleen showed an increase in piglet groups that suckled other dam's colostrum (SG   SS   SMR and GS   GG   GMR groups). The number of monocytes/macrophages in the spleen, thymus, and mesenteric lymph node tended to be higher in piglets from the sow colostrum groups (SS, SG, and SMR) than in the gilt groups, but the difference was not significant.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The immunoglobulins present in the colostrum are an important component for the initial immunological defense of the newborn, given that in pigs this is the only source of maternal antibodies for the litter. The concentration of IgG in the colostrum of females in the study was a mean 83.51 mg/mL, demonstrating that this was a good quality colostrum, considering a good quality level between 50 and 80 mg/mL of IgG during the first hours after labor. IgG is the most common type of immunoglobulin present in the colostrum and almost 100% of it derives from the sow's serum, which transfers from the blood to the mammary gland by means of the FcRn receptor during colostrum genesis.\n\n    The secretion of IgA and IgM in the colostrum is mediated by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) in the mammary gland. IgA is the second most present type of immunoglobulin in the colostrum and is predominant in the milk, with 40% originating in the blood and most produced in the mammary gland during lactation. However, considering that a high proportion of IgM and all IgG are derived from blood, consequently, almost 90% of immunoglobulins are of blood origin. Although the concentration of IgM in the colostrum observed in the present study did not present differences between gilts and sows, the IgG content was higher in sows, which is consistent with previous results. However, this was not reflected in the concentration of IgA in the total colostrum of the current study, with no differences between primiparous and multiparous sows, contrasting with several recent studies but with similar results to previous studies of our group. These differences may be due to responses to nutritional changes, as well as the genetic advances and moments when the colostrum samples are collected.\n\n    The concentration of IgG in the colostrum is known to be highly variable among sows; therefore, genotype, parity, age, vaccination stage and endocrine status of the sow, nutrition, and herd management influences the yield and composition of the colostrum. The concentration of IgG in maternal colostrum significantly affects acquired immunity and, therefore, knowledge about IgG content in the colostrum using precise measurements is crucial for adequate management when seeking to decrease pre-weaning mortality among piglets. The concentration of IgG in swine colostrum can vary between 48.0 and 95.6 mg/mL. Due to the influence of parity in the concentration of colostrum immunoglobulins, it is expected that piglets that are fed colostrum from sows receive a higher concentration of immunoglobulins than those that are nursed by gilts. Thus, we observed in the present study a difference in IgG and IgM serum concentration among sibling piglets. This variability was a consequence of the type of colostrum that these siblings received; we observed a higher concentration in the SS group than in the SG group, and the GS group had a higher immunoglobulin concentration than the GG group. In the present study, piglets that received colostrum from multiparous sows presented higher serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM than piglets that received colostrum from gilts. Moreover, the sibling piglets that received milk replacers presented a \"negative\" concentration of IgG and IgM during their first 24 h of life and showed a lower concentration than their siblings that received colostrum (GG, GS, SS, and SG).\n\n    The intestinal mucosa is very sensitive to dietary stimuli, so piglets fed only with milk replacers since birth have an early cessation of macromolecule endocytosis. This clarifies the reason why piglets in these groups (GMR and SMR) of the present study did not present any IgG titer in their serum, even once they were returned to their mothers after 24 h of life, thus suggesting that intestinal absorption and closure had already happened. For the same reason, we observed that piglets that suckled gilt colostrum had lower levels of IgA at birth because the IgA concentration in gilt colostrum had a lower absolute value than that of sows, even without statistical difference between sows and gilts. Piglets deprived of colostrum ingestion in the first 24 h of life and/or fed only with milk replacer since birth did not present immunoglobulin titers in their serum after completing these first 24 h of life (groups GMR and SMR), demonstrating that the piglets have agammaglobulinemia at birth and that the only way to acquire immunoglobulin is through the colostrum, thus corroborating several other studies. However, the differences in IgA between piglets that suckled gilt colostrum and the IgG and IgM in piglets fed with milk replacer (GMR and SMR groups) at 28 days of life were reversed, probably due to higher de-novo synthetization of Ig in these piglets. Fetal and newborn piglets use primarily four VH genes and two DH segments to generate their preimmune natural antibody repertoire. The pre-immune repertoire is often limited and may develop in the absence of environmental antigenic stimulation. Moreover, newborn mammals have B lymphocytes and small amounts of de novo synthesized antibodies that are encoded by early rearrangements and developmental events. Thus, colonization of the gastrointestinal tract in mammals affects the development of the mucosal immune system and also appears to stimulate diversification of the preimmune repertoire with increases in the transcription of IgA and serum IgA levels. Therefore, we predicted that the agent responsible for IgA induction in piglets that suckled gilt colostrum was orally introduced, synthesized by the piglets themselves. It is important to note that maternal IgA from the milk did not contribute to the level of neonatal serum IgA.\n\n    During the study, eight animals died. They all died during the period between 5 and 20 days of life, considering that animals were assessed for a period of 28 days. These eight animals belonged to the group that received the milk replacer (five animals from GMR and three from SMR). The piglets had no clinical signs of infection, fever, or diarrhea during the nursing period. Diarrhea was observed during and shortly after the use of the milk replacer, i.e., was observed in the first 2 days of life. Due to the high mortality observed in these animals during the pre-weaning period, we chose to not use more animals since the diet they received during the first 24 h of life left them immunocompromised, according to the immunological assessments carried out among the few surviving animals of the group. In fact, IgG is the clinically most important type of immunoglobulin during these first weeks of life, and the concentration of IgG in piglet plasma after birth is positively correlated with survival. Moreover, the dead piglets had a lower IgG serum concentration than the surviving piglets, indicating that colostrum had not been absorbed, even once they were returned to their mothers and nursed with maternal milk after 24 h. It is important to mention that piglets become immunocompetent after 4 weeks of age. Therefore, reduced growth among the litter and mortality of healthy offspring can be considered a consequence of immunologically poor colostrum production, given that IgG content in colostrum varies greatly among sows.\n\n    The serum concentration of immunoglobulins in piglets also varies greatly between herds and between sows. The present results corroborate that there is a strong association between the IgG concentration found in colostrum and the serum concentration of IgG in the piglet. This demonstrates that an increase in the IgG level of colostrum improves IgG levels in piglets and could potentially increase their survival rates. Paying extra attention to small piglets in a non-homogeneous litter may be necessary to guarantee sufficient IgG absorption. IgG capture can be measured indirectly by registering IgG levels from piglet serum after birth . There is also the possibility that low immunoglobulin serum concentrations among piglets may result from absorption failures, which is related to the intestinal maturation of the piglet. However, the amount of colostrum consumed by piglets and the amount of immunoglobulin presented to the intestine for absorption is unknown.\n\n    Finally, absorption efficiency decreases when the ingestion of the first colostrum is delayed, indicating the importance of ingesting colostrum immediately after birth. Even more important is the transmigration of pathogenic bacteria that can be avoided with colostrum by \"closing the intestine\" in the intestinal lumen. In cattle, the absorption efficiency of IgM decreases as ingestion increases, such that the ingestion of a greater amount of IgM does not increase the absolute amount that is absorbed. The results regarding levels of IgM in the milk replacer group at 28 days suggest that the evolution in concentration of this immunoglobulin is related to an immunity maturation in the piglets, considering that these animals did not ingest colostrum.\n\n    The immunology of the intestinal mucosa is highly complex, given that the surface of the mucosa is not only a predominant factor in the structural and immunological barrier against microorganisms, but also has an important role in the absorption of water and nutrients during the digestive process. In fact, the epithelium of the intestinal villi has an important role in the absorption of colostrum IgG, and likely IgA and IgM for neonatal circulation, and a specialized role for the epithelium of the intestinal crypt in the adsorption of colostrum IgA and IgM. It is important to note that dimeric IgA and pig colostrum IgM offer a \"first antiseptic layer\" for the intestine, avoiding the transmigration of pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, we observed in the present results that piglets deprived from the ingestion of colostrum in the first 24 h of their lives and fed only with milk substitutes during the colostrum phase presented high serum concentrations of IgA at 24 h of life, which were significantly higher than the concentrations observed for piglets in the groups that received colostrum. Levast, et al. suggest that ultra-early weaning directly influences the synthesis of IgA, activates, directly or indirectly, the Th17 pathways, and may be related to alterations in the functions of the mucosa barrier. On the other hand, a delay in weaning allows that endogenous factors of the milk to stimulate the beginning of IgA synthesis, protecting the piglet. Thus, we suggest that the milk substitute stimulated an early synthesis of IgA by the piglet itself. It is likely that a component of the milk substitute acted as an antigen and was transferred to duodenal M cells for the intraepithelial lymphocytes, stimulating the plasma cells of the mucosa to secrete IgA. This increase was transient and was only observed while the animals received the milk replacement. In the lactogenesis phase, no difference was observed among the piglets.\n\n    As demonstrated in our study, corroborating previous efforts, no artificial nursing system using formula and milk replacers can reproduce the functions and characteristics in a pig's organism as maternal colostrum. In this context, the study also assessed the influence of different diets in the first 24 h of life and cell immune development in piglets.\n\n    In this study, colostrum and plasma cytokines were measured in dams and their offspring newborns throughout the first day of life, using a quantitative multiplex protein assay. It is assumed that cytokines are absorbed into the offspring's circulation before gut closure takes place and mammary secretion changes from colostrum to mature milk. Our understanding of early life ontogeny of piglet plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations is limited. In humans, these concentrations can be affected by maturation as well as infectious and/or inflammatory states. Colostrum and plasma concentrations of Th1, Th2 or Th17 cytokines were higher in sows than in gilts, and piglets that suckled sow colostrum also showed higher concentrations of these cytokines in their plasma than piglets that suckled gilt colostrum and piglets fed milk replacer. The production of GM-CSF, IFNgamma, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFalpha was higher in all piglet groups that suckled sow colostrum. But even the groups of piglets that suckled gilt colostrum produced less than half of the amount of GM-CSF, IFNgamma, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFalpha as compared to the SS and GS groups (sow colostrum). This lower cytokine concentration was the same for piglet groups fed milk replacer. Piglets showed higher colostrum-related innate cytokine responses (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10) in the case of multiparous dams. This innate maturation corresponds to a parallel increase in adaptive Th1 (IFN-gamma) responses to mitogens.\n\n    Th cells are a type of T-lymphocyte and their proliferation is able to turn them into effector T-cells, which subsequently differentiate into two distinctive subtypes, Th1 and Th2-lymphocyte cells. Moreover, Th cells either enhance or potentiate the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. Th1-supporting IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha cytokine production are involved in cellular immunity, while Th2 lymphocytes characterized by the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 are mainly involved in humoral immunity. Th17 lymphocytes are known to produce IL-6.\n\n    We then examined the relationship between early innate immune responses and the source of feed in suckling piglets. A greater propensity for innate inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the perinatal period was significantly correlated with piglets that suckled sow colostrum, represented by the SS and GS groups, along with propensity for specific Th1 and Th2 responses in the early postnatal period. Specifically, there were consistent positive correlations between the level of inflammatory cytokine responses at 24 h of life and the development of IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and IL-beta, but also for TNF-alpha. This was also particularly true for anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production. In contrast, piglets fed milk replacer were associated with significantly increased concentrations of IL-1ra and IL-8. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is an anti-inflammatory agent that reduces inflammation by blocking the binding of the agonist receptor ligands. Some properties of the milk replacer composition may be antigenic and supplementary analyses may be useful to detect the degree of immune reactivity against antigens of these products. We thus observed that sow parity is correlated with colostrum and plasma cytokine concentrations. Colostrum and plasma cytokine concentrations from the dam improve the immunological quality of the colostrum with an immunomodulatory effect and is a strong driver of porcine neonatal ontogeny.\n\n    After the piglet is born, the immune system begins to transition towards a microbe-rich extra-uterine environment. Nevertheless, the development of active cellular immunity in the piglet is immature at birth. The ability of B and T cells from lymphatic organs and blood mononuclear cells to respond to mitogens was less developed in the neonate piglet and the number of antigen-presenting cells was lower, which is consistent with other studies. The capacity for active proliferation and clonal expansion of T and B cells, which is required for the generation of adaptive immune responses, was observed at different levels when considering the piglet groups that suckled on sow colostrum and on gilt colostrum, and fed milk replacer; activated B and T cells were higher in piglets breastfed with sow colostrum in the neonatal period (24 h) and then with sow mature milk in the weaning period (28 days).\n\n    We do not yet know whether tolerance can be generated in offspring by additional antigens from components of either another dam's colostrum or milk replacer. We did not observe an increase in regulatory T cells with cytokine production in piglets that either suckled another dam's colostrum or were given milk replacer, which induce the production of regulatory cells that may survive as long-lived memory T cells. Our findings showed higher CD4+CD25+ Treg and CD3e+CD8a+CD27+ T memory/cytotoxic cells in piglets that were kept with their own dam and allowed to suckle as normal, by 28 days of age. The data suggest an accelerated development of these subsets of lymphocytes in these piglets. The functional significance of these changes is unclear because the cell surface markers used in this study do not provide information regarding the level of activity of these cells. Indeed, CD4+CD25+ Treg cells play a vital role in peripheral tolerance and are lower in allergic animals. Several studies have shown that there is an expansion of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in Peyer's patches, LnM, and peripheral lymphoid tissues of mice treated orally with antigens. The regulatory activity of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells is linked to the production of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, and associated with the suppression of the production of Th1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and INF-gamma. These results indicate that nutrition influences the functional capacity and maturation of the T cell population. Thus, the components of the early-life environment and nutrition affects both local development of regulatory components of the mucosal immune system and immune responses to food proteins from milk replacer. Clearly, development of immunocompetence is an absolute requirement for optimum growth and performance. However, in the context of exposure to a wide range of antigens associated with pathogens, a definition of immunocompetence must consider the ability to mount appropriate responses to antigens. This will include the ability to generate tolerance to food and commensal bacterial antigens as well as active immune responses to pathogens.\n\n    The pigs fed with milk replacer (GMR and SMR groups) showed some lymphocytes that were unable to respond to mitogens between 24 h and 28 days, suggesting that immune cells are mainly immature, whereas the piglets that suckled sow/gilt colostrum showed greater amounts of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. We observed that the IgG concentrations in piglet plasma shortly after birth are positively correlated with survival and, in addition, dead piglets had lower serum IgG concentrations than comparable surviving piglets. Our study supports findings regarding immune deficiency for immune cells and cytokine production in neonates, as demonstrated in piglets fed with milk replacer. In addition, our study is also the first to document the influence of sow colostrum on the increase of activated B and T cells, as well as pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion capacity that evolves parallel to Th1 and Th2 maturation over time. Naive T cells do not secrete Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines, thus, changes in cytokine concentrations secreted by either Th1 or Th2 cells are associated with altered proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations and antigen-driven T cell differentiation.\n\n    The trajectories between the first week of life and the remainder of the piglet's vulnerable neonatal period, defined as the first 28 days of life, showed that immune ontogeny does not remain consistent. However, our results demonstrated that animals that were fed with milk replacer had a higher mortality rate than piglets that were fed colostrum. Colostrum plays a major role in the survival of newborn piglets, and studies about the relationship between colostrum and the ontogeny of immune reactions are important to understand the immunological process and the possible factors that could compromise this process. Indeed, our findings also demonstrated that sow parity influences the immunomodulatory effect of colostrum and impacted amounts of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. Whether this early impact on the piglet's life will affect performance is a key question in the field of immune ontogeny and will require further studies. The findings demonstrated that the relative and absolute sizes of lymphocyte populations vary with age during the lactation period because of the maturation of the piglet's immune system during this period. We expect our findings can help define the baseline trajectories of plasma cytokines in neonate piglets and will help to correlate plasma, in future studies, and cytokines with immune response challenges, such as immunization. Lastly, future studies on the influence of sow parity in colostrum and its impact on either mucosal immunocompetence or the gut microbiome of piglets will provide a tool for the implications under practical management conditions in the first hours of a piglet's life.",

        "Title": "    Deciphering the Chameleonic Chemistry of Allenols: Breaking the Taboo of a Onetime Esoteric Functionality",
        "Abstract": "    The allene functionality has participated in one of the most exciting voyages in organic chemistry, from chemical curiosities to a recurring building block in modern organic chemistry. In the last decades, a special kind of allene, namely, allenol, has emerged. Allenols, formed by an allene moiety and a hydroxyl functional group with diverse connectivity, have become common building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of structures and frequent motif in naturally occurring systems. The synergistic effect of the allene and hydroxyl functional groups enables allenols to be considered as a unique and sole functionality exhibiting a special reactivity. This Review summarizes the most significant contributions to the chemistry of allenols that appeared during the past decade, with emphasis on their synthesis, reactivity, and occurrence in natural products.",
        "Introduction": "    Allenes are far considered the most useful and widely employed of the cumullenes. Since Van't Hoff's early predictions about structure and composition, chemists have produced a continuous stream of research in the allene field, facilitated by the perfect balance of reactivity and stability in the allene unit.- Opposite to alkynes or alkenes, allenes show three reaction sites coupled to potential axial chirality. They can behave both as electrophiles and nucleophiles,- and they can undergo cycloaddition reactions,- thermal or radical rearrangements. Besides their synthetic utility, they are also recurring subjects in catalysis and theoretical studies.\n\n    In the last decades, a special kind of allene, namely, allenol, has emerged in both organic and physical organic chemistry, becoming a common building block for the synthesis of a wide range of structures..- Allenols are formed by an allene and a hydroxyl functional group showing diverse connectivity. The synergistic effect of one functional group over the other when sharing the same skeleton makes the allenol unit a unique and sole functional group exhibiting a special reactivity. In one hand, allenols can be viewed as pi-activated alcohols showing an extra reactivity toward eliminations, substitutions, or rearrangements. On the other hand, they can be viewed as allenes bearing extra electron pairs, which promote intramolecular cyclizations or provide an alternative metal-coordination site. This overview is focused in the most recent examples dealing with the enhanced chemical behavior of allenols, leaving aside the more particular situations where the allene and alcohol motifs react separately within the allenol molecules.\n\n    Herein we will discuss the most significant contributions to the allenol chemistry appeared during the past decade. Nevertheless, selected early works will be also mentioned to keep a critic and accurate review about the history of allenols. First of all, we will describe the most representative advances for the synthesis of allenols, specially focusing in the more challenging highly substituted structures and chiral allenes. Also, the different connectivity between the allene and hydroxyl moieties leading to alpha-, beta-, gamma-, or delta-allenols will be detailed. In a second chapter, synthetic utility of the allenol functional group will be discussed. This chapter will be organized according to the diverse reactivity of the allenol skeleton. Thus, in a first section, allenols as special pi-activated alcohols will be considered, mainly showing hydroxyl units as leaving groups through elimination, substitution, aromatization, or rearrangement processes. A second section will describe the bidentate nature of the allenol, acting both as nucleophile and electrophile in annulation reactions. A third section is dedicated to all the examples where the OH group is not leaving or attacking the cumullene bonds. Instead, the alcohol unit is acting as a coordination site facilitating diverse transformations as additions, bond migrations, or isomerizations. A final section will contemplate the most recent achievements in chirality transfer using allenols through any kind of transformation. In addition, and to proof the extensive use of allenols in every field related to organic chemistry, a last chapter will be considered discussing the last contributions in natural product chemistry. Both allenols as key reaction intermediates and as motifs in the final structure will be presented.\n\n    The extensive use of allenols in organic chemistry has also facilitated a considerable number of methodologies for their preparation. In addition to the most conventional routines, such as the allenation of terminal alkynes or the metal catalyzed addition of propargyl derivatives to aldehydes, different strategies have emerged during the past decade to provide more complex structures through more creative procedures. Among the diverse family of allenols, those bearing the hydroxyl unit at the alpha position, namely alpha-allenols, represent the widest number and focus the main part of investigations regarding both synthesis and applications. On the other hand, the synthesis of allenols exhibiting different connectivities such as beta-, gamma-, or delta-allenols have been frequently described following adapted methodologies from alpha-allenol synthesis. Thus, to get a concise discussion with a more homogeneous distribution, a classification according to the synthethic strategy is herein presented. Moreover, differently substituted allenols in both racemic and enantioenriched versions will be discussed.\n\n    The most classical methodologies for the synthesis of racemic allenols start from alkynes, mainly including homologation of propargylic alcohols and addition of propargyl bromides to aldehydes (Scheme 1, reactions a and b). Also, activated allenes have been often used as starting materials in the aldol-type addition to carbonyl compounds (Scheme 1, reaction c).\n\n    Among the homologation procedures, allenation of terminal alkynes from propargylic alcohols is still one of the most common methodologies for the construction of the allenol skeleton. In the late 70s, Crabbe and co-workers reported the first synthesis of allenes from terminal alkynes, isopropylamine, paraformaldehyde, and CuBr as metal catalyst.- The presence of a hydroxyl group in the alkyne unit seemed to activate the transformation providing alpha-allenols with excellent yields. Nevertheless, this transformation was limited to paraformaldehyde leading only to monosubstituted allenols as reaction products. In recent years, Ma research group has extensively investigated the scope of the allenation of terminal alkynes toward the synthesis of di- and trisubstituted allenes, by extending the methodology to diverse aldehydes and ketones. Thus, yields and scope were first improved by changing the original CuBr/propylamine pair for CuI/cyclohexylamine toward the optimized synthesis of terminal allenes 2. This methodology was successfully applied for the preparation of different allenols, such as beta- or gamma-allenols, normally showing low yields under original Crabbe's reaction conditions (Scheme 2, reaction a).- To extend the reaction to normal aldehydes, the same research group assumed that finding the proper metal salt/secondary amine combination should be the key for the direct allenylation. Fortunately, diverse matching combination such as ZnI2/morpholine or CuI/Bu2NH gave successful results from different starting materials (Scheme 2, reaction b); 1,3-disubstituted allenols 3 were therefore accessible. Further extension to trisubstituted allenols 4 was achieved by reaction with ketones using CdI2/pyrrolidine or the less toxic CuBr-ZnBr2/pyrrolidine reagent combination in a sequential addition procedure, or CuBr-ZnBr2-Ti(OEt)4/pyrrolidine in the one pot version (Scheme 2, reaction c).-\n\n    An alternative approach for the homologation of terminal alkynes under copper catalysis employs differently substituted diazo compounds instead of aldehydes. First described by Wang and collaborators, this methodology has also been applied for the synthesis of substituted allenols by diverse research groups (Scheme 3).- Alkyl and aryl-substituted allenes, allenoates, and TMS-disubstituted allenes are described in the recent literature following this strategy. In addition, both alpha- and beta-allenols are accessed with no considerable decrease of yield.\n\n    Allenylation of aldehydes with propargyl derivatives bearing an appropriate leaving group (normally bromides) represent another classical approach for the allenol synthesis. Many reports have appeared dealing with the regioselective control between propargylation and allenylation, including a wide variety of metal catalysts, such as Sn complexes,- Zn,- Bi, or Cd salts. Among all these well-known procedures, In-promoted allenylation in aqueous media has possibly provided the best results.- In this field, Cr-catalyzed allenylation of aldehydes is probably the only contribution appeared during the past decade, allenols are prepared in a complete regioselective manner allowing both racemic and enantioselective synthesis, with the late being further discussed in the next section.\n\n    In a similar approach, propargyl boronic esters have recently shown a good control in the regioselectivity toward the addition to aldehydes. Copper catalysis allowed the synthesis of both alkynol 9 and alpha-allenol structures 10 by switching the phosphine-based ligand (Scheme 4, reaction a). This study has been analyzed from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. Alternatively, the MOF (metal-organic framework)-supported mineral acid catalyst MIL-101 yielded similar alpha-allenols 10 as sole reaction products through a related transformation (Scheme 4, reaction b).\n\n    Kobayashi and co-workers have also reported an example of regiocontrol toward the allenylation versus propargylation of both aldehydes and ketones from boronic esters. In this case, Zn-propargyl or Zn-allenyl species are generated in situ from allenyl-boronic derivatives 11. The regioselectivity of the process was found to be temperature-dependent, yielding alpha-allenol species 12 as major reaction products at lower temperatures (Scheme 4, reaction c).\n\n    Direct allene addition onto carbonyl compounds have also provided several examples of alpha-allenol synthesis through allene-aldol or Baylis-Hillman-type reactions, including both alpha- and gamma-selective additions.- In the recent literature, gamma-addition has been reported from substituted allenoates 14 and 16 and diverse aldehydes through Morita-Baylis-Hillman additions using different catalysts (Scheme 5, reactions a and b). Direct addition of allenes to carbonyls frequently shows scope limitation as activated substrates are needed, normally allenoates. One rare example of this kind of transformation using a different activated allene employs tosyl derivatives 18. Treatment with nBuLi at low temperature yields the corresponding organolithium compound, which is reported to be trapped in the presence of different aldehydes generating alpha-allenols 19 (Scheme 5, reaction c). A wide variety of aldehydes or ketones and arylsulfones are tolerated, although the challenging trisubstitution pattern around the allene skeleton should be already present in the starting material.\n\n    Besides the above-mentioned general strategies for the racemic allenol synthesis, the past decade has witnessed an increasing number of more specific transformation leading to more challenging alpha-allenol structures. Backvall research group has employed protected alkyndiols 20 and 22 through an iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction with Grignard reagents for the synthesis of di-, tri- and tetra-substituted allenols 21 and 23 (Scheme 6, reactions a and b). Acetate-protected hydroxyls act as the leaving group facilitating the cumullene generation, while TBS-protected OH remains unaltered in the final allenol skeleton. The two alcohol units could be placed in either opposite (20) or same (22) side of the alkyne moiety, providing a wider scope and versatility. Also, the mild reaction conditions allowed an extensive functional group compatibility in both the alkyndiol system and the Grignard reagent. Related work from Sherburn's and Dou's research groups have independently shown alkyndiol efficiency in the allenol synthesis (Scheme 6, reactions c and d). Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction from symmetrically substituted alkynes 24 allowed the synthesis of allenes 25. Nevertheless, only sterically hindered boronic acids were tolerated to avoid 2-fold addition processes (Scheme 6, reaction c). The use of rhodium catalysis in a similar transformation from diols 26 provided higher control toward the single addition reaction. Less hindered boronic acids were allowed, and unsymmetrically substituted alkyndiols 26 were also tolerated under Rh conditions (Scheme 6, reaction d).\n\n    Propargyl epoxides 28 have also been employed for the synthesis of substituted alpha-allenols through SN2'-type reactions in the presence of nucleophiles.- While C-based nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents have been previously reported in classic methodologies, heteronucleophiles are much more scarcely described.- Nevertheless, recent publications have started to focus in this transformation for the synthesis of allenes showing carbon-heteroatom bonds, not easily accessible through any other approach. Thus, B-, P-, and Sn-decorated allenols 29-31,- have been synthesized using different transition metals as catalysts and mild reaction conditions (Scheme 7).\n\n    Multicomponent reactions allow the synthesis of highly substituted and complex structures in one single step. This approach has been recently applied to the synthesis of beta- and alpha-allenols from allenyl or propargyl boronic compounds, respectively. Petasis and co-workers have reported the synthesis of allenyl aminoalcohols 35, exhibiting a beta-allenol motif, by a metal-free three-component process using allenyl boronic acids 32, amines 33, and hydroxyaldehydes 34. Regioselectivity (allenylation vs propargylation) was found to be dependent on the amine. Thus, secondary aliphatic amines selectively furnished the corresponding allenols (Scheme 8, reaction a), while primary and aromatic amines yielded the propargylation products. Alternatively, Thomson research group described a multicomponent reaction from alkynyl trifluoroborate salts 36, hydroxyaldehydes 34, and sulfonylhydrazines 37. The strategy was based in the in situ decomposition of the intermediate propargyl diazine 38 to yield the allenol compound 39 as sole reaction product through a so-called traceless Petasis-type process (Scheme 8, reaction b).\n\n    More particular transformations to yield the allenol motif include the synthesis of exocyclic allenols through carbocyclization of both allenynes, or carbonyl enynes, the deoxygenation of pentadiyn diols, the aza-Cope-type rearrangement of propargyl indoles, one example of ethynylation and SN2' reaction, or transformations from 1,3-enynes, such as alkylarylations, or hydromagnesiation.\n\n    Asymmetric synthesis and chirality transfer processes have attracted much attention during the last years. Enantioenriched starting materials as chirality transfer agents represents one of the most common approaches. Thus, great interest has been shown in the design and synthesis of enantioenriched allenols, useful building blocks in asymmetric synthesis through diverse transformations as it will be later detailed. Because of the orthogonal distribution of cumullene molecular orbitals, allenes exhibit axial chirality when differently substituted. In addition, the presence of the extra alcohol unit in the allenol skeleton provides a potential stereogenic center. Synthesis of enantioenriched allenols may therefore contemplate axial chirality generation, central chiral generation, or both in the most complex cases. The principal methodologies for the synthesis of enantioenriched allenols that will be discussed in this section may be divided in three general groups; chirality transfer from enantioenriched starting materials, asymmetric synthesis using enantiopure catalysts, and dynamic resolution of racemic allenols.\n\n    Allenation of terminal alkynes of terminal alkynols has also been investigated in the asymmetric version to yield optically pure allenols. Ma and co-workers have employed differently substituted prolinols 42 and 45 as chirality transfer agents providing practical yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities. TBS-protected alkynols 40 were first explored in combination with both (R)- and (S)-diphenylprolinol (42). Axial enantioselectivity is perfectly controlled from the absolute configuration of the amines 42 (Scheme 9, reactions a and b), while the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl carbon in the starting alkynol 40 is retained throughout the reaction when enantioenriched substrates were tested (Scheme 9, reaction c). The authors also point that the bulky TBS group in the alkynol 40 may have double role by avoiding the allene racemization and enhancing the enantioselectivity. In a later work, dimethylprolinol (45) was found to exhibit higher enantiodirection, allowing the use of unprotected alkynols 44 as starting materials and extending the scope to the obtention of beta-, gamma-, and delta-allenols (Scheme 9, reaction d).\n\n    Yu's research group has envisioned an aldol allenoate addition to aldehydes 47 promoted by chiral bromoboranes 48 in the presence of tertiary amines. Both regiochemical and stereochemical outcomes of the reaction are explained through a Curtin-Hammet-type transition state 49, selectively favoring gamma-addition products 50 and providing excellent chiral and central enantioselectivities (Scheme 10). The methodology was also applied for the kinetic resolution of racemic aldehydes, and further generation of the butenolide core of the natural product (+)-xilogiblactone A.-\n\n    Enantioenriched oxiranes have also been employed for the synthesis of di- and trisubstituted allenols with good diastereoselectivites.- Two related approaches based in metal catalysis and organoboron reagents have been described. Propargyl epoxides 51 undergo a ring-opening through a syn-hydride borane addition using MeOH as proton shuttle, followed by selective syn-elimination catalyzed by copper salts. The proper phosphine-base combination seemed to be crucial for the axial selectivity toward allenols 52 (Scheme 11, reaction a). On the other hand, enynyl oxiranes 53 have been reported to react through a formal SN2' mechanism in the presence of aryl boronic esters and palladium catalysts to provide enantioenriched allenols 54 (Scheme 11, reaction b).\n\n    Another example of a central-to-axial chirality transfer uses optically pure ethynyl beta-lactams 55 and different aldehydes for the asymmetric synthesis of structurally complex allene diols 56. The process includes initial in situ generation of the propargyl indium reagent, and further addition onto aldehydes. Although complete selectivity in the generation of the new alpha-hydroxy chiral center was not achieved, a reasonable dr = 11:89 could be attained (Scheme 12).\n\n    Ma and colleagues have accomplished the synthesis of enantioenriched beta- and gamma-allenols 58 taking advantage of the reduction of optically pure allenoic acids 57 with LiAlH4 (Scheme 13, reaction a).- The preparation of enantioenriched alpha-allenol 60 from allenoic acid 59 required an esterification followed by reduction with DIBAL-H (Scheme 13, reaction b). The above processes occur with efficient chirality transfer, which shows the high synthetic potential of this methodology in asymmetry synthesis. The DIBAL-H-promoted reduction of racemic alpha-allenoates into alpha-allenols can be conveniently achieved, while the LiAlH4-assisted reduction of enantioenriched alpha-allenoates 61 (Scheme 13, reaction c and the double 1,2-addition of allyl magnesium chloride to axially chiral alpha-allenoate 63 (Scheme 13, reaction d) generated with retained chirality the corresponding optically active alpha-allenols 62 and 64, respectively.\n\n    [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement of propargylic ethers provides the alpha-allenol skeleton in one single synthetic step. A first approach to the asymmetric version of the Wittig rearrangement was applied to the synthesis of a pharmacologically attractive alpha-hydroxy gamma-amino acid 66 bearing an allene unit, despite in poor yield (Scheme 14, reaction a). More recently, a Wittig-based methodology was also employed for the synthesis of a family of substituted asymmetric alpha-allenols 68. In this case, a remote chiral sulfoxide in the starting propargylic ether 67 was responsible of the stereochemistry, behaving as a chiral inductor rather than a chirality transfer agent (Scheme 14, reaction b). In both cases, good diastereoselectivities were achieved, although no axial chirality is described, and the lack of a wider scope in the methodology leaves much work yet to be explored in this field.\n\n    Other examples dealing only with central chirality in the newly formed hydroxyl carbon use the asymmetric version of the allenyl boronate addition onto aldehydes. Zn catalysis provides complete regioselectivity toward the allenylation versus propargylation processes, while chiral alpha-amino aldehydes 69 are responsible of the stereoselectivity observed as chiral inductors. Diastereoselectivity can be tuned by simply modifying the aldehyde substitution. NHBoc-substituted aldehydes led to syn amino allenols 71 though a Cram-chelation model 71', while NBnBoc-substituted aldehydes yielded anti isomers 72 through a Felkin-Ahn addition model 72' (Scheme 15).\n\n    More specific transformations include the asymmetric propargylboration of aldehydes using 10-trimethylsilyl-9-borabicyclo[3.3.2]decanes, or Barluenga's multicomponent reaction of chromium carbenes 73, oxazolidine-2-ones lithium enolates 74, and Grignard reagents 75 to yield highly substituted cyclohexenones 76 bearing allenolic units. Central-to-central chirality transfer is reported, using optically pure oxazolidines as chiral inductors, and yielding allenols 76 showing up to 99% ee (Scheme 16).\n\n    Because of the more effective and economic chirality transfer approaches based in enantiopure catalysts, the past decade has experienced a decay in the number of contributions dealing with kinetic resolution strategies. Nevertheless, pioneer research groups in this field such as Backvall's,- have continued their interest in kinetic resolution strategies proposing new alternatives and more efficient procedures.\n\n    Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) by means of thermal or chemical induced isomerization has been extensively used to overcome the limited yield disadvantage inherent to KR. Axially chiral trisubstituted alpha-allenols 78 were obtained through esterification of 77 in the presence of lipase from porcine pancreas and vinyl butyrate. DKR was achieved by using palladium catalysis, inducing the allene 77 isomerization through the corresponding pi-allyl palladium complex. The reported hybrid chemo-enzymatic methodology led to improved yields up to 83%, and good enantioselectivities (Scheme 17).\n\n    One different conceptual approach to get access to chiral allenols with high yields employs prochiral starting materials in desymmetrization processes. Thus, allene diols 79 react selectively with vinyl butyrate in the presence of Lipase from porcine pancreas as sole catalyst to yield optically pure monoesters 80. Yields were good to excellent for allenes bearing aromatic susbtituents, and expectedly lower for aliphatic systems, though practical high enantioselectivities up to 99% were reported (Scheme 18).\n\n    The group of Ma reported in 2002 the use of Novozym-435 as a convenient biocatalyst for the kinetic resolution of racemic alpha-allenols, giving rise to enantioenriched (S)-(-)-alpha-allenols and (R)-(+)-alpha-allenyl acetates in an efficient way. Hong and co-workers have contributed to the asymmetric synthesis of allenols with central chirality by developing different KR methodologies. In this regard, both enzymatic and chemical alternatives have been studied. Acetylation of alpha-allenols 81 in the presence of the appropriate lipase allowed the preparation of optically pure compounds (R)-81 and (S)-82 with yields up to 50% and enantiomeric excesses above 99%. After an enzyme screening, lipase AK (Pseudomonas fluorescens) was identified as the best candidate to achieve this transformation. The methodology was expanded to many differently substituted terminal allenols, including alkyl-, alkenyl-, and aryl-decorated structures (Scheme 19).\n\n    Taking advantage of the transition metals ability to catalyze allenol cycloisomerizations, which will be further discussed in the next chapter, a chemical KR of allenols was envisioned. The chiral silver phosphate 84 allowed the selective oxycyclization of the (S)-enantiomers from the racemic mixture of allenols 83. Thus, enantioenriched dihydrofurans 85 were obtained, while unreacted (R)-allenols 83 were recovered. Both species were easily separable after column chromatography, providing aryl-substituted terminal allenols with yields up to 50% and up to 99% ee (Scheme 20).\n\n    The use of enantiopure catalysts represents a strategy of increasing interest in asymmetric synthesis. The possibility to avoid the preparation of optically pure starting materials in large scale, along with the catalyst recycling facilitates more economic synthetic routes. Regarding the synthesis of enantioenriched allenols, both enantiopure ligands in metal catalysis and enantiopure organocatalysts are described.\n\n    Ma and co-workers have studied the asymmetric allenation of terminal alkynes using enantiopure ligands as chirality transfer agents in the synthesis of enantioenriched alpha-allenols. Readily available propargylic alcohols 86 were first submitted to Cu catalysis using pyrrolidine (88) as amine and (R,Ra)-PINAP as ligand. To achieve practical reaction conversions, cocatalysts ZnBr2 or CdI2 were needed, describing a one pot/two steps and a one pot/one step procedures respectively (Scheme 21, reaction a). Further investigations on this transformation revealed that increasing the amine ring size (90) led to high enantioselectivities under CuI as sole catalytic species in a more efficient and economic manner (Scheme 21, reaction b). Also, reversal enantioselectivity was easily achieved by using enantiomer (R,Sa)-PINAP as chiral ligand. Good axial enantioselectivities were reported through a versatile and practical methodology.\n\n    Aldol-type additions of both propargylic and allenyl substrates onto carbonyls also find a stereoselective variant based on the use of chiral ligands in transition metal catalysis for the synthesis of alpha-allenols. Alkynylogous aldol reaction from propargylic carboxylates 91 catalyzed by copper salts and (R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS (94) as chiral ligand was found to be very effective for the synthesis of 2,3-allenols 93 from aromatic aldehydes (Scheme 22, reaction a). On the other hand, aliphatic aldehydes showed better stereoselectivities in the presence of (R,R)-Ph-BPE (95) as chiral ligand, which provided opposite central enantioselectivity. In both cases, high diastereo- and enantioselectivities were obtained (Scheme 22, reaction a). Au (III) salts have been reported to promote the aldol-type addition of allenic esters 96 onto isatin 97. In this case, a chiral N,N-dioxide 99 was used as chirality transfer agent, providing tri- and tetra-substituted allenols 98 in good to excellent yields and good enantioselectivities (Scheme 22, reaction b). In a different approach, condensation of boronic acids with alpha-hydroxycarbonyls 100 formed 1,3-dioxaboroles 102, which can be used as electrophiles in asymmetric allenylation reactions for the synthesis of beta-allenols. Thus, racemic allenes 101 were transformed into enantioenriched allenols 103 using palladium catalysis and enantiopure phosphine ligands (Scheme 22, reaction c).\n\n    1,3-Enynes have also been employed as common starting materials for the asymmetric synthesis of allenols exhibiting diverse allene-hydroxyl connectivity. Challenging tri- and tetra-substituted allenols 107 showing axial chirality are accessible through a cooperative Cu-Pd arylboration of enynes 105. Treatment of boron intermediates 106 with NaBO3 eventually yielded the expected alpha-allenols 107. The appropriate use of both metal catalyst and the noncommercial chiral sulfoxide 112 as ligand is reported to be responsible of the high enantioselectivity observed, avoiding racemization of allenyl copper intermediates (Scheme 23, reaction a). In a different contribution, related 2-trifluoromethyl enynes 108 decorated with a hydroxyl group, provided the allenol skeleton through a similar Cu-catalyzed 1,4-protoborylation or 1,4-protosylilation. In this case, new designed chiral bisoxazoline ligands 113 showed the best results yielding up to 97% ee (Scheme 23, reaction b). Alternatively, copper hydride semireduction of enynes 110 provided axially chiral disubstituted allenols 111. Mild reaction conditions and the use of water as proton source allowed a wide functional group compatibility. Commercially available 1,2-bis((2S,5S)-2,5-diphenyl-phospholano)ethane [(S,S)-Ph-BPE] (114) showed enantiomeric excesses above 99% (Scheme 23, reaction c).\n\n    Besides the above-mentioned coupling reaction with enynes, organoboron reagents have shown great versatility toward allenol preparation, both starting from diverse substrates and through different transition metal-catalyzed reaction mechanisms. Cross-coupling reaction between propargylic carbonates 115 and boronate complexes 116 under Pd catalysis afforded beta-boryl allenes 117 as reaction intermediates. Again, boron functionalization was effectively used as hydroxyl precursors by treatment with NaBO3. (S,S)-MandyPhos ligand (119) was employed to induce central chirality, providing beta-allenols 118 with good yields and enantioselectivities up to 98% (Scheme 24, reaction a). A related approach reacted vinyl arenes 121 and bis(pinacolato)diboron B2(pin)2 with propargylic phosphates 120 under Cu catalysis and (R,S)-Josiphos (124) as chirality transfer agent. Following a similar strategy, the hydroxyl group was obtained after treatment of the corresponding beta-boryl allenes 122 with NaBO3 (Scheme 24, reaction b).\n\n    More particular transformations based on enantiopure ligands include reaction between diazoesters 125 and propargylic compounds 126 through a tandem ylide formation/[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (Scheme 25, reaction a), [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement of propargylic isatins 128 (Scheme 25, reaction b), Wacker-type oxyallenylation of cyclic alkenes 131 (Scheme 25, reaction c), or a Cr-catalyzed addition of propargyl bromides 136 onto aldehydes (Scheme 25, reaction d).\n\n    Enantiopure organocatalysts have been scarcely reported for the synthesis of allenols. Nevertheless, during the last years, different research groups have started to apply this methodology to the asymmetric addition of propargyl and allenyl compounds to carbonyls. This transformation unravelling intriguing catalytic strategies allows the synthesis of both axially and centrally chiral allenols with good yields. Hoveyda's research group has described a general methodology for the asymmetric nucleophilic addition to carbonyls controlled by fluorine-ammonium electrostatic interactions. The organocatalyzed procedure was applied to the addition of allenyl boronic complexes 140 to trifluoromethyl ketones 139, yielding alpha-allenols 142. An enantiopure organocatalyst 141 showing the appropriate electronic features delivered allenols 142 in excellent yields and enantioselectivities above 99% (Scheme 26, reaction a). Chen and co-workers have also studied a related organoboron addition onto carbonyls for the asymmetric approach to the allenol skeleton. In this case, propargylic boronates 144 were added to aldehydes in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid 145, providing alpha-allenols 146 with good to excellent yields and showing central chirality with up to 99% ee (Scheme 26, reaction b).\n\n    Following with the extensive use of unsaturated organoboron compounds, and continuing with the applications of Petasis-type reactions, Thomson and co-workers have developed a chiral organocatalyzed version of the multicomponent reaction between propargyl boronates 147, protected aldehyde 148, and sulfonyl hydrazine 149. Enantiopure biphenol 150 gave access to enantioenriched allenols 151 displaying axial chirality, with moderate to good yields and up to 99% ee (Scheme 27).\n\n    Organocatalyzed alkynylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction also constitutes a feasible methodology for the asymmetric allenol preparation. List and collaborators have recently reported an enyne addition onto aldehydes catalyzed by a newly designed chiral disulfonimide 154. Challenging tetrasubstituted allenols 155 were prepared, exhibiting both axial and central chirality. The scope of the transformation includes aromatic aldehydes 152 and differently substituted alkyl enynes 153. Mild reaction conditions are reported, leading to moderate or excellent yields, diasteroselectivities up to 27:1, and enantiomeric excesses up to 98.5% (Scheme 28).",
        "Methods": "    Hydroxyl units are traditionally considered bad leaving groups in organic chemistry, unless previous OH-activation has been made. pi-Activated alcohols are a special class of hydroxylic compounds in which the positive charge at the alpha-carbon is stabilized by the presence of conjugated pi-orbitals. Taking advantage of this particular reactivity, pi-activated alpha-allenols have been reported to undergo a wide number of transformations where the C-O bond cleaves at one certain point of the reaction mechanism. In this context, reactivity of allenols may be divided in two main groups: (i) those where the OH leaves the molecule at the first steps of the mechanism, leading normally to the diene, enone or enyne skeletons, and (ii) those where the OH loss occurs at the final stages of the process, which are normally found in tandem reactions for the synthesis of aromatic rings and alkaloids. Thus, either when a 1,3-migration reaction takes place or an external nucleophile attacks the central allenic carbon promoting the extrusion of the previously activated alcohol in a SN2'-type reaction, diene/enone skeletons may be formed (Scheme 29, path a). On the other hand, if a base abstracts a terminal allenic proton, rearrangement and activated alcohol elimination can take place to yield the enyne motif (Scheme 29, path b). In addition, when the allenic carbocation resulting from C-O bond dissociation is stable enough, an allene transfer process may happen by nucleophilic trapping, retaining the allene moiety (Scheme 29, path c). Finally, C-OH cleavage can take place through a further dehydratation step after carbo- or heterocyclization processes, leading normally to aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds (Scheme 29, path d).\n\n    Dienes are easily generated from allenols and protected allenols trough 1,3-rearrangement processes. Several methodologies including acid or base promoted isomerizations and metal promoted reactions have been recently reported.-\n\n    Starting from allenols 156 and the appropriate sulfonyl chloride, the Alcaide and Almendros research group described a novel [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of nonisolable alpha-allenic methanesulfonates and arylsulfonates 157. The formal OH migration to yield dienes 159 is proposed to proceed through a six membered ring transition state 158 (Scheme 30). DFT calculations supported an aromatic transition state in accordance to a pericyclic reaction mechanism, in view of a negative nucleus independent chemical shift obtained at the ring critical point of the electron density (NICS = -6.5 ppm). Also, a low calculated activation barrier of only 17.7 kcal/mol shows coincidence with the mild experimental reaction conditions needed for the transformation.\n\n    The methodology was extended to a wide number of substituted allenols 156 and applied to the preparation of different fused polycyclic structures. In one hand, a tandem [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement/Diels-Alder reaction provided optically pure tricyclic beta-lactams such as 160 (Scheme 30, reaction a). On the other hand, related [3,3]-sigmatropic transposition of arylsulfonyl allenes produced dienes 159b or 159c, which are employed to the synthesis of enantiopure polycyclic sultones such as 162b or 162c trough a two-step sequence (Scheme 30, reactions b and c).\n\n    Wang's research group has presented an alternative procedure for the [3,3]-sigmatropic allenol rearrangement using sulfonic acids 164 instead of sulfonyl chlorides. The methodology was applied to di- and trisubstituted allenols 163 (Scheme 31, reaction a). Related work from Lee and collaborators provided E-dienes 167 with good yields and good to excellent stereoselectivities using trimethylsilyl triflate or trimethylsilyl chlorides 166. In this case, triflate- and chlorine-decorated dienes 167 were respectively prepared, expanding the scope of diene functionalization. DFT calculations also pointed to a similar six membered aromatic transition state, based on hydrogen bonding. Nevertheless, the change of 1,3-migration reagent from sulfur- to TMS-derivatives seemed to induce a slight loss of stereoselectivity, leading to E/Z mixtures in rates depending on the allenol substitution (Scheme 31, reaction b).\n\n    Different 1,3-migration strategies involving a previous reaction of the OH unit in alpha-allenols with coupling or protecting reagents have appeared. Thus, reaction of allenols 163 with TsNCO yielded the corresponding allenic N-tosylcarbamates 168. Taking advantage of the thermal instability of these N-tosylcarbamates, a decarboxylative aza-Michael addition/elimination sequence generating dienes 169 has been induced by heating at 125  C in the presence of a basic catalyst (Scheme 32, reaction a). The 4-ethoxycarbonyl substitution on the allene moiety seems to be crucial for the transformation, although both alkyl and aryl substituents at the carbinolic core are well tolerated, and excellent steroselectivities achieved.\n\n    Protection of the hydroxyl group as acetate led to acetoxyallenes 170, which were described to undergo an Ireland-Claisen-type rearrangements in the presence of a base. A [3,3]-sigmatropic reaction mechanism was therefore proposed, proceeding via a six membered chair-type transition state 172 (Scheme 32, reaction b). It was also described the use of N,N-dimethylacetamide dimethylacetal as protective reagent instead of acetic acid, promoting an Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement leading to similar results.\n\n    Reaction of the alcohol unit in allenols 174 under Mitsunobu conditions using N-isopropylidine-N'-2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazine (175) as nucleophile, led to allenyl diazenes 176. Those substrates were envisioned as precursors of 1,3-dienes through a reductive transposition, via a retro-ene-type transition state 177. The above methodology generated unsubstituted dienes 178 in moderate to good yields. Opposite to previously mentioned [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements, the reaction course proceeded with a notable lack of stereoselectivity, yielding cis/trans dienes in rates from 3:1 to 1:1 (Scheme 32, reaction c).\n\n    Preprepared HCl or HBr solutions in ether or ethyl acetate are reported to promote the isomerization of (1-hydroxybuta-2,3-dien-2-yl)diphenylphosphine oxides 179 into chlorinated or brominated phosphinoyl 1,3-butadienes 180. The methodology is applied to primary alcohols, and no stereocontrol is stated at the C3-C4 double bond. Added value to this acid-promoted metal-free methodology is given by further applicability of halogenated dienes 180 on epoxidation or Suzuki-type reactions, providing tetrasubstituted epoxides 181 and aryl-substituted dienes 182, respectively (Scheme 33).\n\n    A conceptually different approach for the synthesis of dienes was based on a SN2' reaction in 1-acetoxy-2-allenoates 183. DABCO addition onto the central allenic carbon induced the generation of 1,3-dienes 184 facilitated by extrusion of the AcO group. Tong and co-workers envisioned intermediate 1,3-diene-2-amonium species 184 as adequate 1,3-bis(electrophiles) for the reaction with 1,3-bis(nucleophiles) in a formal (3 + 3) ring closing reaction. Indoline-2-thiones 185 were selected as ideal candidates, showing 1,3-bisnucleophilic nature in the presence of a weak base. Thus, reaction of 1-acetoxy-2-allenoates 183 and indolines 185 in the presence of DABCO provided dihydrothiocarbazoles 186 through a SN2'-SN2' reaction sequence (Scheme 34).\n\n    Metal species are also reported to promote isomerization of allenols to dienes in both equimolecular and catalytic manner. The cobalt-catalyzed regioselective C8 dienylation of quinoline N-oxides with allenylcarbinol carbonates has been reported by Volla and co-workers, while the use of unprotected allenylcarbinols as the dienylating agents resulted in diminished yields. Alcaide and Almendros research group has described the use of FeBr3 or FeCl3 for the halogenation/rearrangement of 2-indolinone-tethered allenols 187 yielding 2-halo-1,3-dienes 188 (Scheme 35, reaction a). The transformation tolerated different substitution on the aromatic ring and exhibited complete Z-selectivity in every case. The high stereoselectivity observed could be explained considering a pseudopericyclic transition state 189, rather than a stepwise reaction mechanism. Thus, reaction course could be initiated by coordination of the OH group to the metal salt acting as a Lewis acid. Then, a six-membered chair-type transition state 189 facilitates the cleavage of the hydroxyl with concomitant halogen delivery. Extra coordination of the metal ion with the C=O group displayed in axial position could also support the high stereoselectivity found for this transformation. Further Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction from 2-halo-1,3-dienes 188 and aryl boronic acids 190 provided the corresponding aryl-substituted dienes 191, showing the synthetic applicability of the methodology.\n\n    Following a similar idea, Lin and co-workers developed a FeBr3-mediated bromination/rearrangement reaction to yield related 2,5-dibromo-4-aryl-1,3-pentadienes 193. Further one-pot N-alkylation/Diels-Alder reaction with tosyl-amines 194 provided products 195 bearing the hexahydro-1-H-isoindole skeleton with good yields and high diastereoselectivities (Scheme 35, reaction b).\n\n    The ability of alpha-allenols to easily isomerize to dienes through 1,3-migration reactions was also illustrated during the attempts to oxidize allenyl vinyl alcohols to the corresponding allenyl vinyl ketones. Harmata and collaborators envisioned the synthesis of ketones 198 as starting materials for Nazarov cycloadditions using PCC as mild oxidant. Surprisingly, Cr-mediated 1,3-migration took place leading to unexpected alpha'-hydroxydienones 197 (Scheme 36). According to the authors, a mechanistic explanation for this result could start from formation of the chromate ester 199, followed by 1,3-transposition through the habitual six-membered chair-type transition state 200 to give the chromium enolate 201. Spontaneous (2,3)-sigmatropic rearrangement could produce the new chromate ester 202, which could yield the observed dienyl ketones 197 after hydrolysis. The methodology was extended to a wide number of structures with different substituents, exhibiting moderate to excellent yields and excellent stereoselectivity.\n\n    Metal species in catalytic amounts have also been reported to promote allenol transformations into dienes showing several advantages. As previously mentioned, phosphinoyl allenols were described to react in the presence of acid solutions yielding phosphinoyl dienes despite of low efficiency and lack of stereoselectivity (179 to yield 180 in Scheme 33). Nevertheless, related 4-phosphoryl-2,3-allenols 203 have been recently found to provide the corresponding 1-phosphoryl 1,3-butadienes 205 in excellent diastereoselectivities using palladium catalysis through a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with aryl boronic acids 204 (Scheme 37). A plausible reaction mechanism could start with coordination of the metal species to the terminal C-C double bond, and simultaneous activation of the OH groups with the boronic acid in complex 206. C-O bond cleavage would then take place generating the corresponding pi-allyl palladium complex 207. The high diasteroselectivity resulting from this transformation could be explained by the extra coordination of the metal unit with the P(O) group, leading to the stabilized vinyl palladium complex 208. Transmetalation and reductive elimination in species 209 would provide observed phosphinoyl dienes 205 and regenerate Pd(0) to the catalytic cycle (Scheme 37).\n\n    Palladium and platinum catalysis has also been employed in the transformation of simple allenols and boronic acids. Exploring the addition of arylboronic acids onto a wide variety of allenes, one example of 1,3-diene synthesis is reported when allenol 210 is submitted to Pd or Pt conditions in the presence of boronic acid 211. Nevertheless, chemoselectivity is not complete, and addition of boronic acids without dehydratation is observed (Scheme 38, reaction a).\n\n    A rhodium-catalyzed alternative for this transformation was described using 4-arylbuta-2,3-dien-1-ols (214) as starting material and different aryl boronic acids 215. In this case, carbometalation across the phenyl-substituted allenic bond, followed by delta-elimination of Rh(I)-OH was proposed as mechanistic rationale. Again, metal catalysis provided higher selectivity toward the Z-dienes 216 compared with the metal-free analogous transformation. Nevertheless, the lack of an extra coordination site such as the phosphoryl group in allenols 203 resulted in a slight decrease in the Z/E ratio, observing mixtures of diastereomers (from 89:11 to 95:5) in dienes 216 (Scheme 38, reaction b).\n\n    The palladium-catalyzed preparation of (1Z)-1,2-dihalo-3-vinyl-1,3-dienes 220 has been accomplished in a stereoselective manner through the coupling between allenol esters, namely 2,3-butadienyl acetates 218, and haloalkynes 219 in the presence of lithium bromide (Scheme 39, top). Particularly interesting is the finding that haloalkynes show increase reactivity in comparison with allenes or acetylenes under the halopalladation reaction conditions. A plausible reaction path is depicted in Scheme 39 (bottom). The initial formation of alkenyl-palladium intermediates I should occur by trans-addition of the halide toward haloalkynes 219. Next, the carbopalladation reaction with allenol acetates 218 should form allyl-palladium intermediates II. beta-Heteroatom elimination releases trienes 220 with concomitant regeneration of the catalytic species.\n\n    A different mechanistic pathway was proposed to explain the results observed from the reaction of different alpha-allenols 221 in the presence of catalytic amounts of iron triflate or iron trichloride. Opposite to the above-mentioned halogenation/rearrangement reaction of allenols promoted by iron halides in equimolecular manner (compounds 191 and 193 in Scheme 35), catalytic addition of similar metal species yielded the enone skeleton 222 through a Meyer-Schuster-type rearrangement (Scheme 40). The methodology showed best results for aryl- and heteroaryl-substituted allenols, and Fe(OTf)3 as metal catalyst, avoiding halogenated byproducts as observed in the presence of FeCl3, or decomposition products when acid catalysis was employed. The high E-selectivity observed in final enones 222 was found to be independent of the geometry in the starting materials, pointing to a stepwise reaction mechanism. Thus, first coordination of the metal species to the hydroxyl group in intermediate 223 could led to carbocation 224 by C-O bond cleavage. Addition of one molecule of water could then generate the metalated complex 225, evolving to the experimentally observed enones 222 through sequential demetalation/isomerization processes (Scheme 40). A related mechanistic pathway has been recently proposed by Gao and Xu et al., for the acid-catalyzed synthesis of ketophosphine oxides, although in both cases an alternative mechanistic pathway describing the inverse addition/elimination sequence may not be discarded.\n\n    Trost's research groups have extensively investigated the metal-catalyzed Meyer-Schuster rearrangement of allenols 227 from a different perspective. Instead of delivering the corresponding enones from demetalation/isomerization of species 228, intermediates 228 were envisioned as coupling reagents with both electrophiles and nucleophiles, providing a wide and diverse family of functionalized ketones. Thus, reaction of vanadium enolate 228 with vinyl epoxides 229 as masked aldehydes in the presence of a Lewis acid, provided aldol products 230 (Scheme 41, right). Vanadium enolates in the presence of diazocompounds 231 as electrophiles provided ketones 232 from a direct sigmatropic amination reaction (Scheme 41, bottom). Noteworthy, reaction of allenes with diazocompounds are well-known to yield vinyl diazines through Alder-ene mechanisms. On the other hand, reaction of vanadium enolates 228 with different nucleophile halogen sources such as NCS or NFSI provided the corresponding alpha-haloketones 233 with moderate to excellent yields (Scheme 41, left).\n\n    The allenol-enone metal-catalyzed isomerization has been recently proposed as an intermediate step toward the synthesis of spirocyclic scaffolds in compounds 237. First, treatment of sulfonyl allenols 234 with a Pd catalyst yielded the corresponding enones 235, through a 1,3-migration rearrangement via the corresponding metal-enolate 238. Enones 235 evolved in the presence of a base and p-quinone methides 236 to the observed adducts 237 through a cascade Michael-type addition/ring closing reaction (Scheme 42).\n\n    Bis(trifyl)enones 242 have been recently prepared from alpha-allenols 239 unravelling a reversal regioselectivity for the reaction of allenes with electrophiles. Almendros et al. have reported the reaction of allenols 239 with the in situ generated strong electrophile Tf2C=CH2 (241). The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions in the absence of catalysts or additives (Scheme 43, reaction a). Interestingly, complete selectivity was found in the reaction of substrates 239a or 239b bearing an alkene or an extra allene unit (Scheme 43, reaction b and c, respectively), illustrating the divergent chemical behavior of allenes versus allenols. Thus, addition of 2-(2-fluoropyridinium-1-yl)-1,1-bis(triflyl)ethan-1-ide (240) to the reaction media spontaneously generates bis(trifyl)ethene (241), which undergoes a selective electrophilic attack toward the terminal allenic carbon in 239, opposite to the commonly reported central carbon atom electrophilic attack. The proposed reaction mechanism is followed by addition of water to the central positively charged carbon in 243 and by a 1,5-proton shift in the resulting species 244 to generate intermediate 245. Dehydratation would finally yield the experimentally observed enones 242 (Scheme 43, bottom). Computed calculations for the reaction profile supported the mechanistic hypothesis, stating a rare electrophile-mediated transformation of allenols into enones instead of the usual nucleophile-based procedures. Also, the unexpected regioselectivity leaves a door open for a further exploration of the yet intriguing reactivity of the allenol moiety.\n\n    The ability of allenols to isomerize into dienes has been applied to more particular transformations in the context of the intermolecular addition of phenols. Ga(OTf)3 catalyzes a cascade process from oxindole-based allenols 187 and phenols 247 providing dihydrobenzofuran compounds 248 with moderate to good yields and practical diasetereoselectivities (Scheme 44). A mechanistic proposal to explain this result could start by a double coordination of the Lewis acid catalyst with both the OH unit from the phenol and the inner double bond from the allenol in complex 249. Then nucleophilic attack from the ortho position of the phenol to the central allenic carbon could generate intermediate 250. Loss of water would then lead to the diene skeleton 251, which may undergo intramolecular oxycyclization to build the dihydrobenzofuran system in oxonium ion 252. TfOH extrusion and demetalation would then provide the observed oxindole-functionalized dihydrobenzofurans 248 (Scheme 44).\n\n    During the attempts to oxidize the alcohol group in different allenols employing the Swern protocol, Ma and co-workers developed a straightforward methodology for the transformation of alpha-allenols 254 into conjugated enynes 255 and chlorinated dienes 256. It was found that the presence of triethylamine as a base notably favored the enyne 255 synthesis, while the presence of DMSO promoted the halogenation/isomerization process toward the diene 256 generation (Scheme 45, reaction a). Nevertheless, complete selectivity was only achieved in certain cases. Besides, this divergent protocol was restricted to a particular type of 2,3-allenols, namely, allenols having a 2-ethoxycarbonyl substituent. This example clearly illustrates the divergent behavior of allenols under subtle modifications on the experimental reaction conditions.\n\n    Alcaide and Almendros research group has presented an alternative procedure for the same transformation avoiding competitive halogenation/isomerization processes. Related OH-activation/elimination strategy was described, employing different reagents and bases. Thus, reaction of differently substituted alpha-allenols 259 with acetyl chloride and NaOH in aqueous media yielded conjugated E-1,3-enynes 260 in good yields and complete regio- and stereoselectivity. In addition, the methodology was compatible with a wide range of functional groups, and extended to hindered tertiary alcohols, which are frequently unreactive in acetylation processes (Scheme 45, reaction b).-\n\n    Sawama and collaborators have developed a phosphate-mediated synthesis of related conjugated E-enynes 263 from allenols 262. Trimethyl phosphate was used as activator of the hydroxyl group, while NaH acted as the basic reagent favoring the enyne synthesis by H2 release. Terminal substitution at the allene moiety 262 was tolerated, providing the synthesis of challenging inner alkynes and allowing therefore the extension of the methodology, despite of a slight decrease in the E/Z selectivity (Scheme 45, reaction c). Lee has described an efficient protocol for the direct and stereoselective conversion of allenyl acetates into (E)-alpha-ethynyl-alpha,beta-unsaturated esters 255 using DABCO in catalytic amounts (10 mol %).\n\n    Metal catalysis has been scarcely reported for the allenol-enyne transformation. One rare contribution described the use of Cu(OTf)2 acting both as hydroxyl activator and proton catcher. Thus, alpha-allenols 265 reacted in the presence of catalytic amounts of copper triflate providing enynes 266 in good to excellent yields and complete E-selectivity (Scheme 46, reaction a). The methodology was reported to be useful starting from secondary aryl-substituted allenols and was also extended to the synthesis of dienynes and enedyines. The reaction is proposed to require an initial C-O bond cleavage promoted by the Lewis acidic nature of the metal salt, yielding allenic carbocation species 269 and metal complex Cu(OTf)(OH) 268. Loss of water would then generate observed enynes 266 and regenerate the metal catalyst Cu(OTf)2 (Scheme 46, bottom). Further Z-E isomerization experiments on Z-enyne 266a' under similar reaction conditions showed that formation of the observed E-enynes 266 should be thermodynamically controlled (Scheme 46, reaction b). Zwitterionic allenyl copper species Cu-270 and Cu-270' are proposed as intermediates in the observed alkene isomerization.\n\n    Enynes have been also proposed as reaction intermediates in the transformation of allenols into the 2H-pyran-2-one skeleton, or into substituted benzene rings. 3-Hydroxy-4,5-dienoates 271 can be converted into differently substituted pyranones 272 under protic acid catalysis. Protonation of the hydroxyl group followed by elimination of water is proposed to generate 1,4-enynes 273 as reaction intermediates. Addition of water to the terminal propargylic carbon atom on 273 and further intramolecular transesterification could explain the obtained 2H-pyran-2-ones 272 (Scheme 47, reaction a).\n\n    Iodine is well-known to efficiently promote the dehydratation of tertiary alcohols. When propargylic allenols 274 were treated with I2 in refluxing acetonitrile, iodobenzaldehydes or iodoarylketones 275 were synthesized, depending on the alkynyl substitution in 274. In this case, allenyl enynes 276 are described as plausible intermediates for this transformation. Further iodine activation of the triple bond followed by allene-alkyne cyclization would furnish the aromatic core in 275, while the observed carbonyl functional groups may proceed from oxidation of the iodine substituent by atmospheric oxygen (Scheme 47, reaction b).\n\n    In a related approach, allenols 274 reacted with thiophenols 277 under transition metal catalysis generating 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene rings 278. Ring closing and aromatization reaction is triggered by the nucleophilic addition of thiophenols 277 to the central allenic carbon in intermediates 279. InI3 exhibited a dual behavior as sigma- and pi-acid because it was used as metal source, activating both the hydroxyl group in 279 and the alkyne functional group in enyne intermediate 280 (Scheme 47, reaction c).\n\n    The cleavage of the C-O bond in the allenol skeleton after the appropriate hydroxyl activation may result in the generation of an allenic carbocation. When this kind of carbocation is trapped by a nucleophile without isomerization or rearrangement, the overall process results in a formal allene transfer reaction. Because of the high reactivity of the allene functional group, transfer reactions where the allene moiety remains unaltered are still rare. Nevertheless, recent reports have appeared dealing with this transformation and its synthetic applications.\n\n    Ma and collaborators have used diverse alpha-arylallenols 281 as precursors of stabilized allenic carbocations 284 under acid catalysis. Thus, treatment of 281 with p-toluenesulfonic acid in the presence of indoles 281 as nucleophiles, yielded 3-allenyl indoles 283 with moderate to excellent yields through an allene transfer process. 3-Allenyl indoles 283 were employed as precursors for the synthesis of a family of heteroaromatic compounds 285 showing the carbazole scaffold. The synthetic strategy included a carbocyclization process catalyzed by gold, followed by oxidation of the resulting dihydrocarbazoles with DDQ to yield the fully aromatic structure in compounds 285 (Scheme 48).\n\n    Tsukamoto's research group has developed a metal-catalyzed variant of the allene transfer reaction, employing primary alcohols 286 and diverse pronucleophiles (287, 290). The reaction is reported to possible proceed through a pi-allyl palladium complex intermediate 289, generated by the oxidative addition of Pd(0) species to allenols 286. Nucleophilic addition toward the unsubstituted carbon on the pi-allyl complex would furnish the new allene structure 288 (Scheme 49, reaction a). When the reaction takes place with ketones 290 bearing electron-withdrawing groups as pronucleophiles allenones 291 are obtained, which in situ undergo a palladium-catalyzed oxycyclization providing vinyl dihydrofurans 292 (Scheme 49, reaction b).\n\n    Oshima and collaborators have reported a different strategy to achieve the allene transfer process. Copper carbene complexes 295 have shown great activity promoting a challenging C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond cleavage (Scheme 50, top, path b) in allenol structures 293, instead of the more frequent C-OH dissociation (Scheme 50, top, path a). Coordination of the metal species with both the OH group and the cumullene is reported to generate metal intermediate 297, which may evolve through PhCOMe elimination providing copper propargyl complex 298. This strategy induced an umpolung on the normal electronic charges in allene transfer processes, allowing the reaction of allenols with electrophiles such as imines 294. As a result, allenyl amines 296 were synthesized and in situ submitted for aza-cyclization reaction yielding the pyrrole scaffold in compounds 299 with good to excellent yields (Scheme 50).\n\n    Although less frequent, the C-OH bond dissociation can happen at the last stages of the reaction pathway, opposite to what has been so far reported in diene, enone, enyne or allene transfer procedures. Late OH release takes normally place in the form of dehydration leading to aromatic or conjugated systems, and it usually constitutes the driving force of the transformation.\n\n    This methodology has been extensively used for the synthesis of different structures exhibiting the carbazole motif, a natural occurring alkaloid showing a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities. Both platinum and gold catalysis have been found to catalyze the carbocyclization/dehydration of indole-tethered allenols to yield the carbazole skeleton in a highly efficient manner.- Ma and collaborators have invested much effort in developing synthetic routes to carbazole-based natural products through this approach, later discussed in the natural products section.\n\n    The Alcaide and Almendros research group has focused its research in this field on the mechanistic insights of this transformation under gold and palladium catalysis. Indole-tethered allenols 300 may exhibit three possible reaction sites, leading therefore to the corresponding carbo-, oxy-, or aza-cyclization products 301, 302, and 303, respectively. Despite the ability of gold salts to promote oxy-cyclization reactions, complete selectivity toward the carbo-cyclization process (compounds 301) was found in the presence of AuCl as metal catalyst (Scheme 51, top). The transformation succeeded for both methyl- and sterically hindered phenyl-substituted allenols 300, leading to the carbazole core 301 with good yields. The reaction mechanism was proposed to start with coordination of the metal to the terminal allenic bond, followed by a 6-endo carboauration process generating the zwitterionic vinyl gold specie 305. Loss of HCl would then lead to the neutral complex 302. A final dehydration and protodemetalation step should furnish the experimentally observed carbazoles 301 and return AuCl to the catalytic cycle (Scheme 51, bottom).\n\n    Taking advantage of the more pi-coordinating nature of palladium ions, a tandem reaction including a similar carbo-cyclization process followed by cross-coupling reactions of allenols 300 with allyl bromides 307 was envisioned (Scheme 52, reaction a). Different allyl-substituted carbazoles 308 were synthesized in good yields and complete regioselectivity. Noteworthy, when related cross-coupling reaction was performed in the presence of a second allenic unit 309, pharmacologically attractive 3-(buta-1,3-dienyl) carbazoles 310 were obtained (Scheme 52, reaction b). Yields were moderate to good and a wide number of allenols bearing a different pattern of substitution were reactive under those conditions. In addition, the transformation took place in a complete chemo- regio- and stereoselective manner, showing a previously unreported cross-coupling reaction of two allenic moieties including a carbocyclization process. Interestingly, two allenol units 300 and 309 showing a different chemical behavior can be found in this reaction. Indole-tethered allenols 300 behaved as pi-activated alcohols where the late C-OH cleavage leads to aromatic rings through dehydration. On the other hand, acetyl protected allenols 309 behaved as activated alcohols where nucleophilic addition toward the central allenic carbon leads to the diene skeleton, as previously illustrated in prior sections. The authors proposed a mechanistic pathway starting from coordination of the palladium ion to the terminal allenic double bond to give complex 311, followed by 6-endo carbopalladation generating vinyl palladium species 312. HCl extrusion and dehydration would provide palladacarbazole 313. Then cross-coupling reaction toward the central allenic carbon of the acetyl-protected allenol 309 would lead to intermediate 310. Observed butadienyl carbazoles 310 could be eventually obtained by deacetoxy palladation of intermediates 314, regenerating the catalytic species after loss of one molecule of AcOH.\n\n    DFT calculations revealed a computed carbocyclization reaction profile notably lower in energy compared to the oxycyclization process from indole-tethered allenols 300, supporting the chemoselectivity observed in the first step of the tandem reaction. Also, the complete stereoselectivity observed in the diene generation can be explained considering the computed results for the depalladation step (Scheme 53). Free rotation along the C-C single bond in intermediate 314 could lead to both cis-315 or the more stabilized trans-315 complex. Demetalation step is calculated to proceed through a lower energy barrier from trans-315 adduct, yielding the also more favored trans-316 coordination complex. Thus, the more plausible reaction pathway is the kinetically and thermodynamically controlled trans-deacetoxypalladation process via transition state TS1-trans.\n\n    3-Halo-(indol-2-yl)-alpha-allenols 317 revealed an intriguing reactivity pattern, showing divergent behavior depending on the halide substitution. 3-Chloro- and 3-bromo-indoles reacted with gold salts to yield dienes 318 via a 1,3-hydroxyl migration in complex reaction mixtures (Scheme 54, top left). Also, traces of oxycyclization products were observed. Interestingly, palladium catalysis only provided dihydrofuran systems 319 in low yields when 3-bromo-(indol-2-yl)-alpha-allenols 317 were employed (Scheme 54, bottom left). Noteworthy, when iodine-substituted indoles 317 were submitted to gold-catalyzed conditions a different reactivity was observed, obtaining mixtures of the previously reported carbazole structures 301 along with novel iodocarbazole compounds 320 (Scheme 54, top right). Complete selectivity toward the iodocarbazole skeleton was achieved under palladium conditions, yielding structures 320 with moderate to good yields (Scheme 54, bottom right). Opposite to normal metal catalyzed reactions from aryl halides where the halogen atom is lost during the reaction course, the observed iodine reincorporation into the final skeleton means an atom-economic improvement and unravels an unreported reaction mechanism.\n\n    DFT calculations supported a 1,3-intramolecular iodine migration from dihydrocarbazole intermediate 321 to generate the corresponding iododihydrocarbazole 322. Iodonium cation 322 is proposed as the most favorable intermediate to achieve this transformation (Scheme 55, top). Also, computed reaction profile comparison of the migratory ability of chlorine, bromine, and iodine derivatives 321 supported the observed results. Activation barriers for the intramolecular 1,3-migration process are much higher for Br and Cl-substituted indoles (TS2-Br and TS2-Cl, respectively), leading therefore to diene adducts 318 or dihydrofurans 319. On the other hand, a lower energy barrier for the 1,3-iodine migration through transition state TS2-I facilitates the halogen recycling toward iodocarbazoles 320 (Scheme 55, bottom).\n\n    In a different approach, a wide family of naphthopyrans exhibiting large pi-conjugation have been prepared. Naphthol (325) and related polyaromatic compounds reacted with conveniently substituted alkoxyallenes 324 in the presence of acid catalysts through a cascade process, providing naphthopyrans 326 in moderate to excellent yields. The reaction sequence includes a first allylation step to generate allyl naphthols 327, followed by oxycyclization, loss of one molecule of HOBn to build intermediate 315, and final dehydration to give the observed polyaromatic structures 326. Late C-OH cleavage inducing the extended conjugation in systems 326 is assumed as the driving force of the overall transformation (Scheme 56).\n\n    The inherent reactivity of hydroxyl groups and activated allene moieties as nucleophiles and electrophiles respectively, has prompted the oxycyclization reaction as one of the most extensively and traditionally reported transformation. The 5-Endo-trig cyclization leading to the dihydrofuran skeleton, 6-endo-trig processes providing dihydropyran motifs and cocyclization processes such as cyclocarbonilations leading to lactones have been widely employed in organic synthesis, exhibiting diverse applications in catalysis or natural products preparation.- During the past decade the investigations in this field have been focused on developing new and more selective strategies for the oxycyclization reaction, greener and more economic procedures, and more sophisticated transformations for the synthesis of challenging molecular targets through tandem processes. Opposite to the pi-activated alcohol reactivity discussed in the previous section, bidentate reactivity is not limited to alpha-allenol systems. Although less frequently reported, reactivity from beta-, gamma-, and delta-allenols will be also discussed. In addition, the oxycyclization of allenols has been largely employed as model reaction for the design of new catalysts with improved reactivity.\n\n    Alcaide and Almendros research group has devised a dual selectivity strategy for the oxycylization of alpha-allenols based both on the metal catalyst and on the allene substitution. To achieve a rare 4-exo-dig vs the most common 5-endo-trig cyclization, aryl-substituted allenes 330 were synthesized to induce an extra stabilization on the eta2 gold intermediate complexes and to promote the nucleophlic attack toward the central allenic carbon. Interestingly, the selectivity toward the oxetene adducts 331 was improved by raising the temperature, indicating thermodynamic control over the 4-exo-trig products 331 (Scheme 57, top right). DFT calculations also supported this result, pointing to a reaction mechanism proceeding through a zwitterionic oxetene gold complex 335, which after loss of HCl and 1,3-gold migration could provide the rearranged neutral oxetane 337. A rare beta-hydride elimination in gold catalysis could explain the observed oxetene adducts 331 (Scheme 57, bottom right).\n\n    The use of platinum salts in substrates 330 revealed a divergent behavior toward the cycloetherification process. While PtCl2 cleanly provided the expected dihydrofuran systems 332, the addition of AgOTf promoted a dramatic change in the reactivity yielding exclusively substituted enones 333 (Scheme 57, top left). Supported on the precedents reported by the same group, the authors proposed a reaction mechanism passing by similar oxetene intermediates 335. A ring opening process instead of metal-migration to yield complex 338, followed by deprotopalladation would furnish the observed enones 333 (Scheme 57, bottom left). In addition, control experiments indicated the active role of silver ions in the reaction mechanism, through a yet not fully understood bimetallic catalytic species.\n\n    Cycloetherification versus carbocyclization/dehydration has also been recently studied as a substrate-dependent methodology in metal-catalyzed experiments. alpha-Aryl-alpha'-hydroxyallenic esters 339 undergo 5-endo oxycyclization to yield aryl-substituted dihydrofurans 340 when the aryl moiety is decorated with electron withdrawing or mild electron donating groups (Scheme 58, reaction a, right). Nevertheless, and under similar reaction conditions, allenoates 339 were previously reported to provide functionalized naphthalene derivatives 341 when the aryl unit bears strong electron donating substituents (Scheme 58, reaction a, left). In this case, the enhanced nucleophilicity of the aromatic ring seems to be responsible for the reactivity switch of hydroxyallenic esters 339 toward a sequential carbocyclization/dehydratation, which is also favored by the extra stability of final aromatic compounds 341. A related approach from novel (indol-3-yl)-alpha-allenols 342 on the selective oxycyclization versus carbocyclization/aromatization process which can be easily modulated by changing the substitution on the pyrrolic nitrogen in 342 has been described. Thus, deactivated indoles yielded dihydrofuran derivatives 343 by gold-catalyzed cycloetherification processes with moderate to excellent yields, also allowing a wide functional group compatibility (Scheme 58, reaction b, right). On the other hand, NH-indoles 342 provided the carbazole skeleton 344 through a previously described tandem carbocyclization/dehydratation reaction. Moreover, cross-coupling reaction in the presence of allyl bromides and palladium catalysts generated the corresponding allyl-carbazoles 345 in good yields and in a regio- and chemo-selective fashion (Scheme 58, reaction b, left).\n\n    Allenyl acetates have also been used as competent substrates in cyclization reactions. Thus, Zhang reported a gold-catalyzed formal [3 + 3] benzannulation strategy for the preparation of polysubstituted benzyloxy arenes from 4-(benzyloxy)hexa-1,4,5-trien-3-yl acetates, while Mukai described a protocol for the formation of indole-2,3-quinodimethanes utilizing a potassium carbonate-promoted aminocyclization of 2-(2-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)aryl)buta-2,3-dien-1-yl acetates with concomitant acetic acid release In an earlier report Cha prepared ethynyl-substituted ciclopropanes through the reaction of beta-allenyl tosylates by basic treatment with LDA, in a cyclization which is supposed to proceed by sequential deprotonation of the internal allene hydrogen and cyclization with concurrent 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid loss.\n\n    Different reports on the oxycyclization reactions selectivity including a competitive ring expansion versus cycloetherification in 3-allenyl-3-hydroxyindolones, counterion-controlled double bond isomerization in the oxycyclization of delta-allenols, or substrate-dependent 5-endo- versus 6-endo- in phosphorus-based allenols have appeared.\n\n    Much effort has also been invested in developing different procedures to achieve the cycloetherification reaction from more economic or greener perspectives. In this regard, mercury salts were found to catalyze the oxycyclization of alpha-allenols 346 in a cheaper approach, compared to the most frequent precious metal-based methodologies. Thus, inexpensive and water-tolerant Hg(ClO4)2 3H2O provided the dihydrofuran skeleton 347 in good yields and wide scope, as it happens in sterically hindered tertiary allenols (Scheme 59, reaction a). In addition, complete selectivity toward the oxycyclization was observed even when electron rich aryl allenols 346a were employed, which normally led to mixtures 348a/347a under gold catalysis (Scheme 59, reaction b).\n\n    Recent metal-based alternatives to the classic cycloetherification reaction include the use of stoichiometric amounts of copper carboxylates 350 for the dioxygenation of allenols 349. Dihydrofuran systems 351 decorated with the vinyl carboxylate ester functionality were obtained through a 5-exo-trig cyclization of gamma-allenols (Scheme 60, reaction a). Exocyclic gamma-allenol 352 has been also described to react through a 5-exo-trig cyclization path in a Pd(0) catalyzed reaction (Scheme 60, reaction b). On the other hand, silver fluoride has been effectively used for the 5-endo-trig oxycyclization of highly substituted and sterically encumbered alpha-allenols 354, leading to dihydrofurans 355 exhibiting excellent yields and wide group compatibility (Scheme 60, reaction c).\n\n    Palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) have shown high efficiency catalyzing the oxycyclization of differently substituted alpha-allenols 356a and 356b. Preformed nanoparticles using PdCl2 as metal source, K2CO3 as reducing agent and TBAB as stabilizer led to a wide family of dihydrofuran systems 357a and 357b in similar yields as the ones reported through the classic precious-metal approaches in homogeneous conditions (Scheme 61). Interestingly, phenols were needed as additives to achieve higher yields and conversions. TEM analysis showed an average particle size of 2.2 nm, and recycling experiments indicated a slight loss of the catalytic activity of solely 8% after four cycles, pointing to a low grade of bleaching in the catalytic system. Although higher temperatures are required compared to analogous homogeneous strategies, the lower catalyst loading of 1 mol %, the higher recycling performance, and the use of water as solvent establish the PdNP methodology as an effective greener procedure.\n\n    An alternative strategy for the catalyst recycling has been recently reported by Krause and collaborators, based on the use of gold catalysis in ionic liquids. Different trifluoromethylated allenols 358 were selected as model substrates for the 5-endo-trig cyclization reaction using both cationic and neutral gold species (Scheme 62). 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [BMIM][PF6] was selected as the best ionic media, allowing full conversions in most of the cases. Allenols 358 formed droplets when added to [BMIM][PF6], creating a heterogeneous system and allowing the gold catalyst recovering. A low decline of the yield in just 8% after 5 runs shows the practicality of the procedure. Also, mechanistic studies revealed a remarkable kinetic change when allenols bearing a R4 = CF3 substituent were submitted to Au-cycloeteherification conditions. In this case, formation of the pi-complex was identified as the rate-determining step, opposite to the most habitual protodeauration reaction as the regulating step in gold-catalyzed oxycyclizations. This change is probably due to the stronger deactivating effect of the CF3 group when located at the terminus of the allenic moiety.\n\n    Gold catalyzed-cycloetherification has also been involved in the preparation of different compounds exhibiting an added value as molecular materials or naturally occurring alkaloid fragments. The 5-endo-dig cyclization of alpha-allenols 363 has been employed as one of the key steps en route to cyclophanes 365. Thus, double oxycyclization of allenols 363 led to bis(dihydrofurans) 364. Ruthenium-mediated ring closing metathesis yielded the expected aromatic, sugar- or beta lactam-based cyclophanes 365 (Scheme 63, reaction a).\n\n    In a different approach, the tetracyclic indoline skeleton 368 was synthesized by a gold catalyzed cascade reaction, including a propargyl migration in aniline based compounds 366 to yield allenic indole intermediates 367. Further cyclization and rearrangement provided the observed bridged indolines 368. Challenging three-dimensional polycyclic skeletons are furnished, building three rings and four C-C bonds in one sole operational step (Scheme 63, reaction b).\n\n    A metal-free oxycyclization of allenic hydroxyketones 369 in aqueous media has been reported. Inexpensive NaOH promotes the nucleophilic attack of the OH group toward the central allenic carbon through oxa-Michael-type reaction, yielding 3(2H)-furanones 370 with good yields (Scheme 64, reaction a). Moreover, cyclization may be achieved spontaneously by TBAF-mediated deprotection of silyl allenic ethers 371 (Scheme 64, reaction b). Noteworthy, gold catalysis failed promoting the oxycyclization of allenic hydroxyketones 372, stablishing the reported metal-free strategy as an alternative for the most common catalytic procedures.\n\n    Despite that most of the transformations involving nucleophilic hydroxyls embedded in allenol moieties lead to cyclic final structures, mainly 5- or 6-membered oxacycles, some reports have appeared presenting the synthesis of open-chain products. Alcaide and Almendros research group have envisioned a change on the selectivity of the nucleophilic attack of allenols to rhodium carbenoids derived from triazoles, depending on the heterocycle substitution. Reaction of allenols 356 with 4-aryl-substituted triazoles 374a yielded pirrolines 373, while 4-acetyl-substituted triazoles 374b provided diketones 375, under otherwise identical reaction conditions (Scheme 65, top). Thus, when 1-tosyl-1,2,3-triazoles 374a presented an aryl group in C4, allenols 356 behaved as C-nucleophiles, generating intermediates 378 as the product of the nucleophilic addition of the central allenic carbon onto the rhodium carbenoid in intermediates 377. Further aza-cyclization of 378 yielded the experimentally observed pirrolines 373 (Scheme 65, bottom, left). Nonetheless, when 4-acetyl-1-tosyl-1,2,3-triazoles 374b were employed, allenols 356 selectively behaved as O-nucleophiles, leading to species 379 as reaction intermediates. Then, regeneration of the ruthenium species and protonation would provide allenyl vinyl compounds 380, which spontaneously evolve through a Claisen-type rearrangement to the observed final structures 375, exhibiting both the interesting 1,2-diketone and Z-1,3-diene frameworks (Scheme 65, bottom, right).\n\n    Zimmer, Reissing, and collaborators accessed the 1,2-diketone framework from alpha-allenols through a different pathway. Reaction of alpha-hydroxy methoxyallenes 381 with mCPBA yielded acyloxy-substituted 1,2-diketones 382 in reasonable yields. A mechanism rationale for this transformation would start from selective epoxidation of the proximal allenic double bond in 381 to generate intermediate 383. Acid-promoted ring opening and tautomerization would then lead to dicarbonyl 385, which may suffer intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the former allenol moiety providing oxiranium 386. Nucleophilic attack of 3-chlorobenzoate would promote the ring opening of cationic intermediates 386 generating the observed diketones 382 after loss of methanol (Scheme 66).\n\n    Enallenols, multifunctional molecular targets bearing an alkene and allene moieties along with a hydroxyl group, have attracted recent interest due to their divergent and intricate reactivity. Alkenol versus allenol selective reactivity has been encountered in metal-catalyzed reactions of different enallenols such as beta-lactam-based compounds 387 or acyclic derivatives 390. Noteworthy, FeCl3 was found to exclusively provide alkenol oxycyclization adducts 388 and 391, leading therefore to the tetrahydrofuran skeleton (Scheme 67, right). On the other hand, gold and platinum salts selectively catalyzed the allenol 5-endo-trig oxycyclization of 387 and 390 generating the dihydrofuran motifs 389 and 392 in a chemoselective manner (Scheme 67, left).\n\n    Density functional theory calculations showed coincident results according to the experimental observations. Thus, in both gold-based alkenol (reaction profile from 393) and allenol (reaction profile from 394) cyclizations, protodemetalation was identified as the bottleneck step of the whole process, finding a much lower energy barrier for the allenol cyclization resulting in the formation of dihydrofuran 396 (Scheme 68, left). Nevertheless, activation of the hydroxyl unit in substrates 397 should be the starting point of the catalytic cycle when iron salts are present, triggered by their strong Lewis acidity. In this case, alkenol cyclization pass by a notably lower energy barrier to yield the tetrahydrofuran skeleton 395 under kinetic control (Scheme 68, right).\n\n    Different reports on enallenol chemistry have stated the importance of designing the appropriate enallenol skeleton to modulate its reactivity. Backvall and co-workers have explored enallenol cyclization reactions under palladium catalysis in the presence of different cocyclization partners. In both substrates 398 and 403, where the previously mentioned allenol versus alkenol competitive cyclization is not feasible, palladium catalyzed cocyclization reaction should start by dual coordination of the metal ion with both allene and alkene moieties (coordination intermediates 400 and 406). Thus, when enallenols 398 were submitted to Pd(OAc)2 tretament under CO atmosphere, spirolactones 399 were obtained as sole reaction products in moderate to good yields. The process includes a cascade oxidative carbonylation-olefin insertion to form intermediates 402, followed by a second CO insertion-lactonization sequence providing spirocycles 399 (Scheme 69a). Noteworthy, three C-C single bonds, one C-O bond, and an all-carbon quaternary center are generated in one single operational step. On the other hand, when enallenols 403 were treated with palladium catalysts in the presence of terminal alkynes 405 as cocyclization partners, substituted furans 404 were obtained with good to excellent yields. In this case, a heterogeneous palladium catalyst was employed, based on an aminopropyl-decorated siliceous mesocellular foam which hosts palladium nanoparticles, exhibiting great performance and high recyclability. Again, palladium insertion into the central allenic carbon would yield intermediate 407, which may evolve through alkyne insertion to adduct 408. Nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl unit to the Pd-activated alkyne and further isomerization would furnish the observed furans 404 (Scheme 69b).\n\n    Co-cyclization of allenols with aldehydes through Prins-type processes have also been reported, providing the synthesis of oxacycles with different ring sizes. beta-Allenols 409 react with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 as Lewis acid catalyst to yield the dihydropyran skeleton 410 in moderate yields (Scheme 70, reaction a). When allenols 409 were treated with In(OTf)3 as Lewis acid catalyst, major efficiency in terms of catalyst loading toward the cocyclization adducts 410 was found (Scheme 70, reaction b). Interestingly, reaction of 5,5-dimethyl substituted beta-allenol 409a and aldehydes under In(OTf)3 catalysis exhibited a special behavior. After the expected Prins-type cocyclization of 409a and the corresponding aldehydes, indium-mediated ring opening and further rearrangement took place, generating the alternative dihydropyran structures 411 in practical yields (Scheme 70, reaction c). In addition, tetrahydrofuran-based compounds 413a were achieved by reaction of alpha-hydroxy allenylsilane 412a with alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes under acid catalysis. Also, larger ring sizes were accessible through this methodology in excellent yields, such as 3,4-dimethylidene oxepanes 413b obtained from the reaction of gamma-allenol 412b using both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes (Scheme 70, reaction d).\n\n    One recurrent strategy to achieve the synthesis of poly substituted furans or dihydrofurans lays on the metal-catalyzed oxycyclization of alpha-allenols, followed by a cross-coupling process using diverse reagents such as aryl halides. Taking advantage of the low redox potential of palladium, many reports have appeared describing cascade processes of allenols promoted by palladium salts.- Thus, a multicomponent reaction of alpha-allenols 414 with aryl iodides 415, aliphatic alcohols 416 and carbon monoxide led to tetrasubstituted furans 417 through an oxidative addition/carbonylation reaction sequence (Scheme 71, reaction a). In a similar approach, the presence of tertiary amines 418 instead alcohols 416 in the reaction media provided the corresponding methylene acetamide-decorated furans 419 (Scheme 71, reaction b). Gong and collaborators have reported a related methodology using allenol 414a, aryl iodides 415 and imines 420 as reaction partners also under palladium catalysis to provide an extense family of oxazolidine derivatives 421. In this case, the proposed reaction mechanism includes carbopalladation onto the central carbon atom of the allene moiety, nucleophilic attack of the oxygen onto the C-C double bond of the imine, and latter ring closing step through nucleophilic addition of the nitrogen onto the inner pi-allylic carbon atom (Scheme 71, reaction c).\n\n    Palladium species have also been found to be useful catalyzing homodimerization and heterodimerization processes of allenols. PdCl2 in the presence of NaI as additive has shown great activity promoting the tandem oxycyclization-cross-coupling reaction of 2-substituted allenols 422a, yielding 4-(1',3'-dien-2'-yl)-2,5-dihydrofurans 423 (Scheme 72, reaction a). Interestingly, the reaction of two different allenic species under similar reaction conditions allowed the synthesis of substituted dihydrofurans 424, as a result of the chemoselective oxycyclization of 2-substituted allenols 422b, followed by cross-coupling reaction with 2-unsubstituted allenols 422c (Scheme 72, reaction b).\n\n    Besides the classical palladium-cross-coupling strategies, the past decade has started to witness the use of different metals to improve the efficiency and expand the scope of the methodology. Rhodium catalysis has been used to promote an oxycyclization-cross-coupling reaction of allenols with diverse benzamides including a challenging arene C-H bond insertion. Reaction of alpha-allenols 425 with Rh(III) species in the presence of N-methoxybenzamides 426 smoothly generated substituted dihydrofurans 427 with moderate to good yields. Notably, a wide substitution pattern on the allene moiety is tolerated, including sterically hindered substrates and tertiary alcohols. The most plausible reaction pathway would start by rhodation of benzamides 426 through the C-H bond, facilitated by coordination with the amide unit in complex 428. Further coordination with the allene moiety of 425 and oxyrhodation would afford intermediate 429, which could easily undergo reductive elimination to yield dihydrofurans 427 and liberate Rh(I) species. Atmospheric oxygen was used to reoxidize the catalytic species, returning the Rh(III) to the cycle (Scheme 73). A mechanistically different arene functionalization dealing with the intermolecular cyclization reaction of beta-allenols in the presence of indoles catalyzed by a platinum salt, has been reported to afford C3-substituted indole derivatives with a tetrahydro-2H-pyran ring.\n\n    Opposite to palladium or rhodium species, the high redox potential of gold makes the oxidative addition/reductive elimination steps hard to perform on gold-mediated transformations, and consequently inadequate for cross-coupling reactions. On the other hand, the well-known ability of gold salts to catalyze allenol oxycyclizations, frequently the first step in cross-coupling processes, has prompted different research groups to find solutions to circumvent this problem. Thus, photoredox catalysis has been successfully applied to achieve a gold-mediated cross-coupling reaction of allenols and diazonium salts. Allenols 430 reacted with aryldiazonium salts 431 in the presence of AuClPPh3 and [Ru(bpy)3][PF6]2 as photoactive catalyst under visible light. The reaction provided a wide family of 2,3,4-trisubstituted dihydrofurans 432 in a regioselective manner (Scheme 74). Yields were moderate to excellent, finding the best results when deactivated aryldiazonium salts 431 were employed. In addition, diverse functionalities were well tolerated, such as CF3, Br or OMe. A mechanistic proposal may start from oxidative arylation of the gold species promoted by single electron transfer from photoactivated ruthenium complex, generating Au(III) species 434. Coordination of 434 onto the allenic moiety of 430 resulted in complex 435, which would induce the oxycyclization step, generating intermediate 436. Reductive elimination would then recover the Au(I) species to the catalytic cycle and explain the formation of the observed 4-aryl-dihydrofurans 432 after deprotonation.\n\n    The reactivity of allenols has also been used in catalysis as a platform for testing the versatility of recently developed metal complexes. The allenol oxycyclization process has been applied as a model reaction to investigate new catalytic pathways along with the design and tuning of novel catalysts. In this context, Rueping and collaborators have informed of a rare metal-ligand dual catalysis for the cycloisomerization of beta-allenols. Allenes 437 bearing a beta-hydroxyl unit reacted with catalytic amounts of iron cyclopentadienone complex 438, yielding 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrans 439, through a selective 6-endo-trig oxycyclization/double bond isomerization process (Scheme 75, reaction a). The methodology was extended to both aromatic and aliphatic substituted allenols, providing the pyran skeleton in good yields. In addition, benzoxepine structure 441 was also accessible under similar reaction conditions through a more challenging 7-endo-trig heterocyclization (Scheme 75, reaction b). The cooperative metal-ligand catalysis strategy was further applied to the synthesis of dihydrofuran systems 443 through a 5-endo-trig cycloetherification of alpha-allenols 442 (Scheme 75, reaction c). Experimental and computational investigations revealed the role of the cyclopentadienone ligand as proton scavenger in a doubly activated intermediate complex 444. Also, it is proposed to act as proton shuttle/proton acceptor facilitating the 1,2-H shift to overcome the eventual double bond isomerization.\n\n    Widenhoefer and co-workers have selected the oxycyclization of 2,2-diphenyl-4,5-hexadien-1-ol (445) furnishing vinyl tetrahydrofuran 449 to perform the first mechanistic investigation on gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylations. Experimental observations gave light to two major significant conclusions: (i) reversibility across the C-O bond formation step, and (ii) the presence of outer sphere bis(gold) vinyl species 447 acting as catalyst reservoir. Intermediate 447 was characterized from in-solution samples after treatment of stable vinyl gold complex 446 with (L)AuOTs at low temperature (Scheme 76, top). Then NMR monitoring experiments of the catalytic hydroalkoxylation of allenols 445 indicated the uninterrupted presence of bis(gold) vinyl species 447 during the whole reaction time. According to the results obtained from kinetic and deuteration experiments, the proposed catalytic cycle would start with a reversible C-O bond formation to generate mono(gold) vinyl intermediate 446 and HOTs. Aggregation should take place at this point to produce bis(gold) intermediate 447 in an outer-sphere equilibrium with mono(gold) species 446. Also, kinetic experiments pointed the protodeauration of intermediate 446 as the rate-determining step, excluding a possible disproportionation of bis(gold) vinyl intermediate 447 as an alternative to yield the final tetrahydrofuran 449 (Scheme 76, bottom).\n\n    Related bis-benzylic beta-allenol 450a undergoes elimination in the presence of the major part of gold catalysts to yield conjugated vinyl allenes 451a instead of the oxycyclization product 452a (Scheme 77, reaction a). Same result has been observed on similar acid-sensitive allenols 450, due to the acidic nature of gold salts and complexes. Lacote et al. have envisioned a gold self-buffering catalytic system to solve this problem and achieve the cycloetherification products 452 in substrates were dehydratation competes. Polyoxometalate (POM)-based catalyst 453 were designed and synthesized, using organotin-substituted polyoxotungstate [P2W17O16{Sn-(CH2)2-CO}]6- as POM surface and omega-amino gold phosphine complexes to provide the active metal site. Thus, acid-sensitive allenols 450 were treated with a catalytic amount of 453 and AgSbF6 to induce the activation of the gold specie as cationic gold. Conversions of allenols 450 into dihydropyran structures 452 were complete in all cases, with moderate to excellent yields and no elimination byproducts identified (Scheme 77, reaction b). Interestingly, mechanistic insights revealed a multiple role from the POM-Au catalyst: Coordination of the cationic gold to the surface may stabilize the intermediate 454, reducing catalytic activity at the same time it improves catalyst recyclability. The POM surface should be also acting as proton catcher, buffering the reaction media and facilitating the formation of intermediate 456. Nevertheless, eventual protodeauration step to yield final adducts 452 would need a disfavored proton release from the POM skeleton, explaining the low reaction rates (up to 5 days to completion) compared to regular homogeneous gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylations. Finally, special solubility of POM systems provides catalyst recycling, constituting this approach as a greener and more economic strategy.\n\n    During the past decade, different contributions on gold catalysis have appeared describing both a rationale design as well as synthesis and applications of novel catalysts that could be able to provide higher efficiency and greener procedures. Noteworthy, the hydroalkoxylation of allenols has been frequently chosen as model reaction. Hilvert's research group has described the synthesis of thiazolium gold(I) carbenes 457, as a greener alternative to the well-known imidazolium analogous. The higher hydrophilicity of thiamine units, together with the presence of a pyrophosphate group, improves the catalyst stability, and allows the use of aqueous media in hydroalkoxylation reactions. Thus, gamma-allenol 458 could be successfully transformed (up to 98% conversion) into tetrahydrofuran 459 under mild reaction conditions and open-air experiments (Scheme 78).\n\n    In the pursuit of more economic and environmentally friendly strategies including precious metal catalysis, Lipshutz and co-workers have recently reported the use of gold(I) salts in micellar systems. Surfactant Nok (SPGS-550-M) was employed in combination with the newly synthesized gold(I) salt 460, showing an improved lipophilicity (Scheme 79). The micellar cavities based on aggregation of Nok molecules in aqueous media behaved as organic-based nanoreactors, encapsulating the hydrophobic reagents and therefore increasing their effective concentration. Thus, both uses of solvent and catalyst could be minimized, resulting in high conversions with catalyst loadings of 0.1 mol %. Also, an E factor of 7.6 for the oxycyclization of allenols 462 into spirocyclic systems 463 indicates the promising greener advantages of the micellar-based strategy.\n\n    Bergman, Raymond, Toste, and collaborators have introduced supramolecular chemistry in gold catalysis from a different perspective. Gallium-based tetrahedral macromolecule 464 has been used as a supramolecular host for cationic gold species, acting as an enzyme-mimic catalyst. Again, hydroalkoxylation of allenol 458 has been selected as model transformation, to study the catalytic activity of Au-464 species (Scheme 80). Noteworthy, encapsulation of the gold salt induces ionic bond dissociation, resulting in more active \"naked\" cationic gold species. Thus, the catalytic activity is 8-fold increased compared to regular homogeneous cationic gold procedures, and up to 67 catalytic turnovers were observed.\n\n    Following a similar concept, Reek et al. have envisioned a gold(I) system bearing supramolecular ligands, as inductor of selectivity in the oxycyclization reaction of allenols. Pyridyl-decorated phosphoramidite ligands 465 were used to both bonding to the active gold ion and to link Zn template 466 through the pyridyl nitrogen atom, generating the supramolecular structure 467. Although lower conversions were achieved compared to AuCl(L) complexes under similar reaction conditions, complete selectivity toward 5-exo-trig cyclization of allenol 468 was observed, yielding vinyl tetrahydrofuran 469 as sole reaction product (Scheme 81).\n\n    Besides the allenol transformations where the hydroxyl group behaves as a leaving group or as a nucleophile, seen in previous sections 3.1 and 3.2 respectively, the recent literature has also provided several examples of alternative hydroxyl-assisted reactions. This third class of allenol reactivity includes both metal-catalyzed processes where the M-O coordination is crucial for a specific transformation as well as bond migration reactions promoted by the hydroxyl lone electron pairs. In those cases, the hydroxyl unit is retained unaltered in the final products or oxidized into a carbonyl group.\n\n    Araki and co-workers reported one early example of OH-assisted allylindation of allenols. Hydroxyl-chelated bicyclic species are reported as the most plausible transition states for this transformation.\n\n    Gong and collaborators have reported a three-component methodology for the synthesis of 3,3'-disubstituted allylic alcohols under palladium catalysis. Treatment of allenic alcohol 471 with aryl iodides, catalytic amounts of a Pd(0) complex and the adequate pro-nucleophile 472 or 473, provided allylic alcohols 474 and 475 with moderate to good yields and complete Z-selectivity (Scheme 82, reaction a). The hydroxyl group in the allenol skeleton 471 is proposed to perform a double role: (i) enhancement of the reactivity by palladium-coordination in metallacycle intermediate 481, and (ii) both regio- and stereodirection for the addition of the aryl and nucleophile moieties. A mechanistic proposal for this transformation would start with the oxidative addition of the Pd(0) catalyst to the corresponding aryl iodide to generate Pd(II) intermediate 479. Coordination and carbopalladation would furnish the above-mentioned cyclic intermediate 481. Reaction with the in situ generated nucleophile followed by reductive elimination could lead to the observed allylic alcohols 474 or 475 (Scheme 81, bottom). Interestingly, allene 476 lacking hydroxyl unit, failed to yield the corresponding substituted alkene 477, supporting the proposed mechanistic pathway and the coordinative role of the OH group in the reported transformation (Scheme 82, reaction b).-\n\n    Zhang's research group has reported a three-component palladium-promoted variant for the synthesis of allylic alcohols from allenol 471, aryl iodides, and alcohols as O-nucleophiles. In this case, a cooperative borane-palladium catalyzed strategy was developed. Triethyl borane was used as coordinating agent, directing the addition of alcohols 483 toward the inner allenic carbon through intermediate 485. The methodology was extended to a wide variety of substituted aryl iodides and both aromatic and aliphatic alcohols 483, providing allylic alcohols 484 in moderate to good yields (Scheme 83).\n\n    Recent examples on allenol reactions triggered by metal-oxygen coordination includes Shi's contribution on Ru-catalyzed oxidative isomerization of vinylidene cyclopropanes 486 to aldehydes 487 trough intermediate 488 (Scheme 83, reaction a). Also, Lu and collaborators have reported the reaction of aromatic amides 490 and allenols 491 in the presence of catalytic amounts of Rh(III) to yield gamma-lactams 492 (Scheme 84, reaction b). The authors stated the significant role of the hydroxyl group in controlling both the regio- and the stereochemical outcome, probably through coordination with the rhodium atom in intermediate 493. A control experiment from allene 494 lacking hydroxyl group, which lead to complex reaction mixtures supported the Rh-O coordination hypothesis (Scheme 84, reaction c).\n\n    The cyclopentenone skeleton is a recurring target in organic synthesis, exhibiting an extense range of biological activities and synthetic applications. Besides the well-known Pauson-Khand and Nazarov cyclizations, metal-catalyzed cycloisomerizations have recently appeared as synthetic strategies to achieve the cyclopentenone motif.- In this context, Cha and co-workers have described an allenol-based ring expansion process involving a ruthenium-oxygen coordination to provide the cyclopentenone system. Thus, allenyl cyclopropanols 495 were treated with ruthenium complex 496 and In(OTf)3 as additive, generating cyclopentenones 497 in moderate to good yields (Scheme 85, reaction a, left). The mechanistic pathway may start from dual coordination of the metal in alcoholate 498. Ring opening of the strained three-membered ring would then provide intermediate 499, which might evolve through a migratory insertion to cyclic intermediate 501. Eventual ligand exchange would explain the observed cyclopentenones 497 and return the active metal species to the cycle (Scheme 85, reaction a, right). Alcaide and Almendros research group has also contributed to the allenol/cyclopentenone transformation in the context of a cooperative bimetallic catalysis. In this case, 2-iodoaryl allenols 503 and 505 were treated with [(PPh3)2PdCl2] and CuI as bimetallic pair, yielding differently substituted fused cyclopentenones 504 and 506 in good yields (Scheme 85, reaction b), through a proposed intramolecular Heck-type coupling reaction mechanism.\n\n    Hydroxyl-assisted bond migrations in allenol systems have been frequently reported by different research groups. Ma and collaborators have pioneered halogen-promoted 1,2-aryl shift, and 1,2-H shift in allenol skeletons. Thus, secondary and tertiary allenols were reported to smoothly generate 3-halo-3-alkenals and 2-halo-2-alkenyl ketones respectively, under halogenating reagents such as Br2, I2, NIS, or NBS. During the past decade, related halogen-promoted 1,2-bond migrations in allenol systems have been employed in ring expansion processes. Moreover, selenating reagents were found to induce an intriguing selectivity on this transformation. Thus, 2-azetidinone-tethered allenols 507 were reported to undergo a selective 1,2 C-C bond migration in the presence of NBS, providing tetramic acids 510 (Scheme 86, reaction a). In contratst, the use of N-phenylselenophthalimide as electrophile promoted the oxycyclization process yielding spirocyclic seleno-beta-lactams 511, under otherwise similar reaction conditions. Species 508 and 509, formed by coordination of the electrophile to the proximal and distal allene double bond respectively, are proposed as raisonable intermediates for the divergent transformation (Scheme 86, reaction a). In addition, 2-indolinone-tethered allenols 512 under NBS conditions provided the corresponding quinolone skeletons 513 and 514 through a related ring expansion process (Scheme 86, reaction b, right). Noteworthy, mixtures of two regioisomers were frequently found, quinolone-2,3-diones 513 as major products from a C3-C4 bond cleavage, together with quinoline-2,4-diones 514 from a less favorable C2-C3 bond breakage. Interestingly, selenating reagents improved the divergency of the process, finding selenoquinoline-2,3-diones 515 as major or sole reaction products in the presence of N-phenylselenophthalimide (NPSP) (Scheme 86, reaction b, top left). Spirocyclic selenolactams 516 where achieved when phenylselenyl bromide was used. Also, AuCl3-NPSP cocatalyzed reaction of allenols 512 favored the formation of the spirocyclic products 516, probably due to the gold ability in promoting oxycyclization transformations in allenols (Scheme 86, reaction b, bottom left).\n\n    Toste's research group has presented a photoredox-catalyzed ring expansion methodology in ciclopropane-linked allenol systems. Compounds 517 undergo ring expansion and oxidative arylation processes in the presence of electrophilic gold(III)-aryl complex 520 which is generated in situ from benzenediazonium salt 518. Coordination of the gold complex to the proximal allenic double bond in allenols 517 to give intermdediates 521 would promote the oxidative ring expansion process toward intermediates 522. The observed four-membered cyclic ketones 519 are obtained in practical yields from reductive elimination of intermediates 522 (Scheme 87). On the same basis of photoredox catalysis, Almendros and Luna et al. have recently reported the synthesis of 3-(arylsulfonyl)but-3-enals 525 from allenols 523, sulfur dioxide, and arenediazonium salts 524 under visible light. The proposed mechanistic pathway includes a C-C bond migration facilitated by the latter oxidation of the hydroxyl group to the corresponding aldehyde in compounds 525 (Scheme 87, reaction b).\n\n    Liu and co-workers have reported a methoxy-assisted allene migration to explain the synthesis of pyrroles 530 and pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline derivatives 531 from 4-methoxy-1,2-dienyl-5-ynes 526 with anthranil (527). Anthranil is proposed to attack the pi-activated alkyne moiety in complex 528 (formed in the presence of gold salts), generating alpha-imino gold carbene intermediate 529. 1,2-Allene migration and further gold-mediated aza-cyclization would furnish pyrroles 530. When allene ester systems are employed, subsequent aldol reaction would explain evolution toward the polycyclic structures 531 (Scheme 88, top). On the other hand, reaction of 4-methoxy-1,2-dienyl-5-ynes 526 with isoxazole (532) as nucleophile provided the indolizine skeleton 536 and 537 under identical reaction conditions, unravelling a different mechanistic pathway. In this case, alkyne attack to the pi-activated allene moiety in gold complex 533 would produce cyclic intermediate 534, which afer methoxy-assisted ring-opening and isomerization could lead to vinyl gold carbene 535. Nucleophilic attack of the isoxazole unit to the gold carbene carbon followed by a cascade azacyclization/rearrangement and aromatization would explain the observed indolizine compounds 536 and 537 (Scheme 88, bottom). Selenium-based pi-acid-type catalysis has been used for the preparation of alpha,beta-unsaturated alpha'-alkoxy ketones from alkoxy-allenes through alkoxy migration.\n\n    The development of new strategies to provide enantioenriched molecules constitutes one of the principal interests of the chemistry community. During the past decade, allenol-based reactions have also provided a notorious and increasing number of chirality transfer methodologies to get access to a wide family of enantioenriched structures. Chirality transfer from both central and axially chiral allenols has been reported. Also, it has been described the use of racemic allenols as precursors for the obtention of enantioenriched final compounds employing enzymatic catalysis, optically pure ligands in metal catalysis, and hybrid methodologies.\n\n    The Alcaide and Almendros research group has described the synthesis of optically pure dihydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, and tetrahydrooxepine skeletons from enantiopure beta,gamma- and gamma,delta-allendiols. Also, furan systems were synthesized. The methodology revealed an intriguing selectivity toward the oxycyclization reaction of secondary hydroxyls versus primary hydroxyls in both beta,gamma- and gamma,delta-allendiols. The choice of the metal catalyst and the appropriate substituent was found to be crucial to achieve the optimal regioselectivity. Thus, beta,gamma-allendiols 538 reacted with gold(III) salts to produce the dihydropyran skeleton 539 through a 6-endo cycloisomerization process involving the secondary hydroxyl group and the terminal allenic carbon (Scheme 89, reaction a, top right). Interestingly, allendiol 538 provided carbaldehyde 540 in the presence of platinum salts, from a similar 6-endo cycloetherification reaction followed by a subsequent oxidation (Scheme 89, reaction a, bottom right). In contrast, furan 541 was obtained when beta,gamma-allendiol 538 was exposed to a lanthanide complex under catalytic conditions, through a 5-exo cyclization toward the central allenic carbon (Scheme 89, reaction a, top left). Although palladium salts failed in promoting an effective cycloetherification to yield dihydropyrans 539 from allendiols 538, the use of a Pd(II) catalysts and allyl bromide as coupling counterpart smoothly led to substituted dihydropyrans 542 (Scheme 89, reaction a, bottom left). This transformation revealed a selective 6-endo cyclization/cross-coupling cascade reaction toward the terminal allenic carbon. On the other hand, benzyloxy homologous gamma,delta-allendiols 543a provided dihydrofurans 544a under gold(III) catalytic conditions (Scheme 89, reaction b, top right). Noteworthy, diastereomer 543b provided the corresponding 5-membered oxacycle 544b through a related 5-exo-trig cyclization, but exhibiting a decrease in the diastereoselectivity (Scheme 89, reaction b, top left). Although platinum catalysts did not show efficiency in the conversion of gamma,delta-allendiols into oxacycle systems, lanthanide complexes provided dihydrofuran 544a in similar yields as gold salts (Scheme 89, reaction b, right). More interestingly, palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction conditions unravelled a dramatic change in the regiochemistry of the oxycyclization reaction depending on the absolute configuration of the starting material. Thus, gamma,delta-allendiols 543b provided the substituted tetrahydrooxepine 545 through a rare 7-endo-trig cyclization, while diastereomer 543a yielded tetrahydrofuran 545 through a 5-exo-trig cyclization toward the inner allenic carbon (Scheme 89, reaction b, bottom).\n\n    More recently, the same research group has reported the metal-based chemoselective aza- versus oxy-cyclization reaction of enantiopure alpha-amino-beta-hydroxyallenes. Gold salts were reported to selectively promote the 5-endo azacyclization toward the synthesis of optically pure 2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrroles, while the palladium cyclization/cross-coupling cascade strategy yielded 6-dihydro-2H-pyrans through a 6-endo cycloetherification reaction. Also, optically pure beta-lactam-tethered allenols were employed as chirality transfer reagents for the preparation of a wide variety of enantiopure polycyclic structures, such as morpholines, oxocines, dioxonines, and the already mentioned tetramic acids 510 and spirolactams 511 (see Scheme 86), through halogen or selenium-promoted reactions, respectively.\n\n    Ma and collaborators have described the synthesis of enantiopure oxacycles from optically pure allenols presenting a tetrahedral chiral carbon through metal-catalyzed cascade processes involving oxycyclization steps. Highly substituted 2(5H)-furanones 548a/548b were obtained by treatment of allenols 547a/547b with Grignard reagents and CO2 atmosphere (Scheme 90, reaction a). The proposed reaction mechanism starts with the insertion of the organometallic reagent into the terminal allenic double bond, generating the cyclic intermediate 549 by Mg-O interaction. Reaction with CO2 would produce the corresponding gamma-hydroxy-Z-alkenoic carboxylic acid 550, which could undergo lactonization to yield the observed butenolides 548 without racemization.\n\n    In a different approach, oxa-bridged benzocycloheptanes 551a/551b were synthesized by reaction between optically pure allenols 547 and iodobenzaldehyde in the presence of palladium salts and a base (Scheme 90, reaction b). In this case, initial oxidative addition of Pd(0) species into the aryl halide would provide intermediate 552. Then, carbopalladation of the corresponding allenol 547 (547b in Scheme 90, reaction b, bottom) would produce both pi-allyl intermediates anti-553 and syn-553, being the latter the most sterically favored. Intramolecular attack of the alkoxide to the carbaldehyde group in syn-553 would lead to diastereomers 554 and 555. The observed diasteroselectivity of the overall process could be explained by selective oxycyclization toward the allylic position in 554, providing the less sterically hindered oxa-bridged benzocycloheptanes 551b from allenes 547b.\n\n    Taking advantage of the versatile chemical behavior of the enallenol skeleton, Backvall research group has reported the preparation of a wide variety of molecules exhibiting high structural diversity and up to two sterogenic centers in optically pure form. Enantioenriched enallenol 556 reacted with Pd(TFA)2 under CO atmosphere to yield bicyclic lactone 557 with complete enantioretention (Scheme 91, reaction a). The reaction mechanism to explain this transformation would include a palladium-mediated allene-alkene carbocyclization reaction, followed by a sequential carbonylation/lactonization step, resembling previous palladium-lactonization of enallenols (see Scheme 69, section 3.2). Homologous enallenol 558 provided cyclohexanol skeleton 559 in good yield in the presence of B2pin2, exhibiting also full enantioretention (Scheme 91, reaction b). Homogeneous Pd(OAc)2 catalysis was employed to achieve this transformation, which should imply a related allene-alkene carbocyclization followed by ligand exchange with the borane reagent and reductive elimination. Noteworthy, coordination of the hydroxyl unit with the metal ion at the first stages of the reaction mechanism is proposed to be crucial to explain formation of compounds 557 and 559.\n\n    In contrast, enallenols 560 were transformed into oxaboroles 561 by reaction with B2pin2 under heterogeneous palladium catalysis (Scheme 91, reaction c, right). Enantioenriched allenols 560 were prepared through kinetic resolution of the racemic mixture using Candida Antarctica Lipase B, showing >99% ee. Interestingly, despite of the palladium ability to induce racemization in allylic alcohols, no loss of optical purity was detected. The same catalytic system provided gamma-lactones 562 in optically pure manner from reaction of allenols 560 under CO atmosphere. Moderate to good yields were achieved with full retention of the enantiopurity in final compounds 562 (Scheme 91, reaction c, left). Amino-supported heterogeneous palladium has also been recently used by Backvall et al. in a domino reaction from related enallenols with alkynes. The chelating activity of the hydroxyl group is responsible of the observed diastereoselectivity.\n\n    More particular methodologies for the synthesis of stereodefined oxacycles have been recently reported. Anderson et al. have described the reaction of enantiopure cyclic alkynyl carbonates with palladium catalysts to yield alkynyl tetrahydrofuran systems through in situ generated allenol-palladium intermediates. Guinchard and collaborators have employed gold-catalyzed cyclizations of tetrahydro beta-carboline structures decorated with enallenol motifs for the synthesis of optically pure decahydrofuro[2,3-f]indolo-[2,3-a]quinolizines. Gold(I) salts have been reported to exhibit optimal reaction conversions providing full enantioretention and good control on the enantioselectivity of the newly formed sterogenic centers.\n\n    Opposite to the most commonly reported cyclization reactions, intermolecular processes involving enantioenriched allenols in asymmetric synthesis are scarce. Taking advantage of the chelating effect of the hydroxyl group, as explored in section 3.3, palladium-catalyzed multicomponent reactions of different allenols 563, aryl iodides 564 and benzylamine proceeded with no loss of enantiopurity, even in the absence of enantiopure phosphine ligands. Interestingly, a change on the allenol substitution provided a dramatic change on the regioselectivity. Thus, phenyl-substituted allenols yielded homoalylic alcohols 565, while alkyl-substituted substrates provided allylic alcohols 566, through the attack of the amine to the terminal allenic carbon (Scheme 92).\n\n    Opposite to central-to-central chirality transfer methodologies from enantioenriched allenols, reports on axial-to-central chirality transfer using axially chiral enantioenriched allenols are rare. One of the principal challenges to circumvent is the ease of racemization of the allene moiety under metal catalyzed conditions. Normally, metal activation of the allene unit starts with pi-coordination of one of the double allenic bonds with the metal ion in a eta2 complex 567 (Scheme 93). When such intermediates are in equilibrium with the corresponding pi-allyl cations 568, free bond rotation falls into loss of the optical purity of the allene moiety. Avoiding the above-mentioned equilibrium by stabilizing the eta2 complex constitutes one of the most recurrent strategies to achieve axial chirality transfer reactions in allenes. The choice of the metal catalyst and the appropriate substituents on the allene core are the principal tools to achieve a successful chirality transfer transformation.\n\n    In the context of allenol-based reactions, Lalic and co-workers have reported the first synthesis of teytrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran systems bearing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic center. Substituted beta- and gamma-allenols 570 were submitted to gold catalysis providing the expected oxycyclization products 571 with good to excellent yields and a chirality transfer of up to 99% (Scheme 94). Gold(I)-based salts bearing a tosylate group together with electron-rich sterically hindered phosphine ligands were found to provide the best results, also promoting complete E-selectivity in the double bond formation in compounds 571. A plausible reaction mechanism would start from coordination of the metal species to the proximal double bond in intermediate 572, followed by carbometalation to furnish vinyl gold intermediate 573 without the occurrence of allene racemization. Opposite to Widenhoefer's statement about digold alkenyl intermediates as catalyst resting states, monogold(I) intermediate 573 is herein presented as the most likely resting state due to the weakly electrophilicity of the gold complex, and the highly coordinating character of the counterion.\n\n    Similarly, Yin's research group has reported the synthesis of substituted dihydrofurans 575 showing up to 20:1 dr through a gold-catalyzed oxycyclization process. Allenols 574, exhibiting both axial and central chirality, have been prepared according to the previously mentioned asymmetric Cu-catalyzed alkynylogous aldol reaction (Scheme 22, reaction a), and successfully converted into cyclic structures 575, current motifs in anti-Alzheimer and Down's Syndrome drugs (Scheme 95).\n\n    A different approach based on gold catalysis has been reported by Krause and Lipshutz et al., following their interest in discovering new micellar systems to provide greener methodologies, high catalyst efficiency and recyclability. It has been reported that micellar catalysis in aqueous media was also effective for the synthesis of enantioenriched structures from alpha-allenols, employing poly(oxyethyl)-alpha-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS, 578) as amphiphile and AuBr3 as metal source. Dihydrofuran structures 577 bearing two stereogenic centers were achieved, exhibiting good to excellent yields and complete chirality transfer (Scheme 96).\n\n    Ma and collaborators have synthesized optically pure lactones 581a and 581b from N-methoxybenzamide 580 and enantioenriched substituted allenols 579a and 579b under rhodium catalysis conditions (Scheme 97). Axial chirality in starting allenols 579 was fully transferred into lactones 581 exhibiting a stereogenic center with moderate yields. The mechanistic proposal would start with rhodation of the N-methoxybenzamide unit 580 to yield cyclic intermediate 582 (Scheme 97, bottom). Coordination of the metal ion to the less substituted allenic bond would then lead to complex 583, in equilibrium with the less favored intermediate complex 584. Carbometalation of the allenic double bond from the less sterically hindered adduct 583 could explain the E-selectivity observed, furnishing vinyl rhodium compound 585, which may suffer protonolysis to give 586. Eventual lactonization would explain the experimentally observed cyclic structures 581.\n\n    Metal-free strategies regarding axial-to-central chirality transfer are scarce. Zhang and Bao and collaborators have recently reported the NIS-promoted allenol oxycyclization to yield dihydropyran systems showing central chirality. Sakaguchi and Ohfune and co-workers have described the enantiomeric version of the Prins-type reaction of allenols with carbonyls. beta-Allenols 587 bearing a terminal silyl group were selected as chirality transfer agents, reacting through an uncommon 5-endo-trig cyclization in the presence of TMSOTf as Lewis acid catalyst and both aldehydes and ketones as reaction counterparts. Silylalkynyl-decorated tetrahydrofurans 589 were obtained as single diastereomers, exhibiting two stereogenic centers (Scheme 98, reaction a). To test the axial-to-central chirality transfer efficiency, enantioenriched allenol 587a was synthesized with a 92% ee. Reaction of 587a with benzaldehyde (588a) and TMSOTf as acid catalyst provided the expected oxycyclization product 589a showing an enantiomeric excess of 78%. Increasing the Lewis acid load up to 1.1 equiv allowed an 85% ee in final tetrahydrofuran 589a, showing solely slight racemization during the reaction (Scheme 98, reaction b).\n\n    Metal catalysis offers a wide variety of alternatives to achieve an efficient chirality transfer with associated formation of enantioenriched molecules. The most traditional and extended strategy is based in the joined use of the metal along with a chiral phosphine ligand which induces enantioselectivity during the reaction. Michelet and Scalone and collaborators have synthesized an unprecedented bromine-decorated diphosphine ligand (S)-591 showing chiral atropisomerism. The catalytic system Ag/591 was applied for the synthesis of vinyl tetrahydrofurans 592 through a 5-exo-trig cyclization of gamma-allenols 590. Yields were moderate to excellent, and enantiomeric ratios up to 91.5:8.5 were stated (Scheme 99, reaction a). Ma's research group has devised an enantioselective palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of gamma-allenols 590 with aryl iodides 594 yielding styryl tetrahydrofuran systems 577 through a similar 5-exo-trig cyclization. Optically pure diphophine (R,R)-591 was employed, finding enantioinversion in vinyl-substituted tetrahydrofuran structures 595 with respect to systems 592. Good yields and up to 92% ee were stated (Scheme 99, reaction b).\n\n    Zhang's research group has envisioned an accelerative gold catalysis by ligand-metal coordination to gamma-allenols 590 providing vinyl tetrahydrofuran skeletons 595 (Scheme 100, reaction a). Opposite to classic enantiopure ligand approaches, where chiral induction is frequently based in sterically hindered ligands which normally show a decelerating effect in the reaction rate, Zhang's ligand (R)-596 bearing an amide remote group exhibited an 88-fold rate increase compared with unsubstituted bisphenyl- or bisnaphthyl phosphines. Simoultaneous metal-allene and carbonyl-hydroxyl coordination in intermediate 597 explains the enhancement of the catalytic activity, yielding tetrahydrofurans 595 with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities up to >99% ee. Also, catalyst loadings as low as 200 ppm were allowed. A similar strategy was applied to the synthesis of enantioenriched dihydrofuran structures from in situ generated alpha-allenol systems. The 5-exo-trig oxycyclization of gamma-allenol 598 has also been in the focus of an intriguing case of enantioinversion in final vinyl tetrahydrofuran molecules (S)-592a and (R)-592a (Scheme 98, reaction b). Furstner et al. have found that even under the same optically pure gold catalyst 599, formed from AuCl and phosphoramidite (S,S,S,S)-599, enantioselection could be achieved by changing the solvent, temperature, and counterion. Moreover, a synergistic effect between the three parameters could be perform, achiving enantiomeric excesses from 97% ee in (R)-595a (Scheme 100, reaction b, right) to 68% ee in (S)-592a (Scheme 100, reaction b, left). Experimental and computational studies revealed that a change in the rate determining step lays on the base of the change in the sterochemical outcome. Protic solvents and coordinating counterions supported an additive-assisted reaction mechanism favoring the (R)-595a isomer. Also, temperature has a dramatic entropic effect, promoting the additive-assisted mechanism on cryogenic conditions providing (R)-579a isomer as major compound.\n\n    Related enantiopure oxaphosphorous ligands 602 and 603 have been used in the context on an unprecedented enantioselective silver-catalyzed oxycyclization of allenols. Reaction of Ag2CO3 salts with the corresponding phosphoric acid yielded catalyst complexes Ag-602 and Ag-603. Treatment of different allenols 600 with the preprepared catalytic species allowed the synthesis of vinyl tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran compounds 601 (Scheme 101). Also, furanones were obtained starting from the corresponding allenic carboxilyc acids. DFT calculations on this transformation pointed to ionic interactions between ligand and substrate as the major forces contributing to the enantioselectivity of the process.\n\n    Chemical desymmetrization of prochiral allendiols has been accomplished using palladium catalysts and enantiopure phosphoric acids as ligands. alpha,alpha'-Allendiols 604 were submitted to Pd(OAc)2 catalysis in the presence of catalytic amounts of chiral ligand (R)-605, generating dihydrofurans 606 in good to excellent yields, and practical enantiomeric excesses up to 85% ee (Scheme 102, reaction a). Adduct 607 was proposed as the stereodetermining intermediate, showing a dual interaction of the catalytic system and the allenol unit through both metal-coordination to the central allenic carbon and hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group. In a similar but conceptually different approach, gamma,gamma'-allendiols 609 were converted into enantioenriched tetrahydrofuran derivatives 611 through a gold-catalyzed oxycyclization (Scheme 102, reaction b). In this case, enantiopure phosphoric silver salts (R)-609 were introduced in the reaction system as chiral counterions, while achiral phosphine ligands such as 610 are linked to the reactive gold ion and are used as enantioselectivity modulators. This methodology allowed the generation of two stereogenic centers in one single operational step, furnishing oxacycles 611 with good to excellent yields and up to 93% ee.\n\n    Different authors have investigated the synergistic effect of both enantiopure chiral ligands and enantiopure counterions to achieve higher enantioselectivities without loss of catalytic activity. Regarding allenol oxycyclizations, Mikami et al. have described the use of neutral dinuclear gold complexes 613 as catalytic species with improved activity for the 5-exo-trig cyclization of substituted gamma-allenols (Scheme 103, reaction a). The optimal reaction conditions were found when same catalytic amount of 613 and the silver salt Ag-614 bearing an enantiopure chiral phosphoric acid counterion were added. Vinyl tetrahydrofurans 615 were obtained with good to excellent yields and up to 95% ee. According to experimental studies, it has been proposed species (R)-616 from ligand exchange with one equivalent of silver complex Ag-614 as the catalytically active system. Complex (R)-613 in the absence of silver salts was ineffective for the indicated transformation, while complex (R)-617 from the addition of two equivalents of Ag-614 showed lower yields and enantioselectivity (Scheme 103, reaction a). Toste and co-workers described the enantioselective aza-cyclization/halogenation tandem reaction of allenamides 618 with brominating reagent 619 to yield bromovivnyl pyrrolidine structures 621 under gold catalysis in the presence of BINAP-type ligands (Scheme 103, reaction b). The methodology also included one example of 5-exo-trig oxycyclization of gamma-allenol 622 to produce bromovinyl tetrahydrofuran 625 (Scheme 103, reaction c). This transformation promoted by gold catalyst 623 provided a poor enantioselectivity (25% ee) of the indicated structure 625. Interestingly, the combined use of 623 and silver salt Ag-624 bearing a chiral counterion provoked a remarkable impact, both increasing the selectivity up to 86% ee and reverting the enantioselectivity compared to adducts 621.\n\n    Despite the widespread presence of carbocations in organic synthesis, its utilization as reaction intermediates in asymmetric synthesis is still scarcely described. The challenging facial discrimination in planar carbocation species has been mainly limited to diastereoselective-substrate control, or to the addition of an enantiopure chiral anion forming ion pairs with the carbocationic molecule. Carreira research group has envisioned an alternative approach for developing asymmetric SN1-type reactions in alpha-allenols and related systems, based in eta2 coordination complex 633 (Scheme 104, bottom). Species 633 formed from interaction of iridium salts bearing an enantiopure chiral phosphine and the distal double bond of the allene moiety can be considered as mimics of diastereoselective-control substrates and constitutes one rare example of enantioselectivity in allenol transformations apart from oxycyclization processes. Thus, racemic Boc-protected alpha-allenols 626 reacted with organozinc nucleophiles 628 in the presence of iridium catalysts Ir-(R)-627 to provide compounds 629 in practical yields and excellent enantioselectivities, through an asymmetric allene-transfer reaction (Scheme 104, reaction a). In addition, related methodology has been applied to describe the first example of an enantioselective reductive deoxygenation of tertiary alcohols. Thus, racemic alpha-allenols 630 were submitted to catalytic system Ir-(S)-627 in the presence of Hantzsch ester analogues 631 as hydride source, providing enantioenriched allenes 632. Kinetic and computational insights revealed the presence of eta2 carbocationic complexes as the most plausible reaction intermediates (Scheme 104, reaction b).\n\n    Different approaches to achieve asymmetric synthesis from racemic allenols and enantiopure catalysts also includes denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3H)-ones with allenes under nickel catalysis, synthesis of 1H-isochromene structures through copper catalyzed oxycupration/allylation reaction using optically pure phosphine ligands, the enantioselective synthesis of spiropentanes from hydroxymethylallenes catalyzed by Zn, the asymmetric palladium-catalyzed homoallenilation of amines, or the synthesis of cyclodextrin-tethered gold(I) carbene complexes as water-soluble and recyclable catalysts for several transformations including oxycyclizations of alpha- and gamma-allenols.\n\n    Racemic 2-(2',3'-alkadienyl)malonates were obtained through the Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed alkylation reaction of allenyl acetates with malonates while racemic allenes bearing a quaternary carbon center alpha to the cumullene were prepared by [Ir(cod)Cl]2/dppe-catalyzed allylic alkylation of 1,1-disubstituted-2,3-butadienyl acetates with malonates. A smart approach for obtaining optically active allenes is the direct preparation from achiral allenyl acetates, allenyl phosphonates, and allenyl carbamates via pi-allylmetal intermediates, taking advantage of the great leaving aptitude of the acetate, phosphonate, and carbamate moieties. Imada, Murahashi, and Naota achieved the metal-catalyzed synthesis of enantioneriched alpha-allenamines 635 by asymmetric amination of allenyl phosphonates 634 using Pd2(dba)3CHCl3 as the palladium source and (R)-SEGPHOS as the ligand (Scheme 105, reaction a). Starting from precursors 1, the same research group did also reported the asymmetric alkylation with 2-acetamidomalonate. Trost and co-workers accomplished the asymmetric synthesis of allenes (S)-635 and (S)-637 from allenyl acetates 636 by palladium-catalyzed dynamic kinetic reactions with both malonates and amines involving alpha-methylidene pi-allylpalladium species (Scheme 105, reaction b). The optimized reaction conditions require the use of Pd2dba3 (2.5 mol %), phosphine 104 (7.5 mol %), THACl (tetrahexylammonium chloride) (5 mol %), and a base in THF. Hamada performed the same palladium-catalyzed reaction between allenyl acetates 636 and malonates but replacing Trost ligand with (S,RP)-DIAPHOXs, a chiral nonracemic diaminophosphine oxide, which results in the formation of axially chiral allenes (R)-637 in good yields with up to 99% ee. The above-mentioned palladium-catalyzed amination of allenyl phosphonates, and the addition of malonates to allenyl acetates, have also been explored by Ma and collaborators in the context of achieving central as much as axial chirality from racemic allenes. The same research group has deeply investigated different allenyl esters in the presence of various nucleophiles yielding substituted allenes exhibiting both types of chirality. Thus, racemic allenyl acetates 638 have been reported to undergo a SN2'-type oxidative addition in the presence of palladium complexes and enantiopure (R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS as ligand. Echoing effect between the central and axial chirality is stated, providing enantioenriched allenes 640 showing both axial and central chirality (Scheme 105, recation c). Asymmetric allenylation of malonates have also been achieved using racemic allenyl carbonates. Selectivity between mono- and bis-allenylation is reported using Pd2(dba)3/(R)-DTBM-SEGPHOS as catalytic pair. In a related work, a smart approach to allenylamines exhibiting axial chirality has been accomplished through the palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative amination of allenyl carbamates 641. Pd2(dba)3/(S)-DTBM-SEGPHOS catalytic pair promotes the loss of CO2 providing the corresponding pi-allylpalladium intermediates. Further nucleophilic attack of the in situ generated amide ion yields the observed allenylamines 635a exhibiting up to 99% ee and good to excellent yields (Scheme 105, reaction d).\n\n    Although enzymatic systems have been largely employed as biocatalysts for KR and DKR in allenol synthesis, strategies for the preparation of enantiopure compounds from racemic allenols including enzymatic resolution are almost unexplored. Backvall research group has contributed to develop this methodology with the synthesis of dihydrofuran and cyclobutanol skeletons with excellent enantiomeric excesses. During attempts to achieve an efficient DKR of allenols, Shvo catalyst (645) was used in combination with Candida Antarctica lipase B (CAlB) to promote the expected consecutive recemization and selective acetylation of alpha-allenols 642. Despite the well-known activity of ruthenium catalyst 645 for the racemization of secondary alcohols, oxycyclization products 643 were found instead, along with the corresponding acetylated allenols 644 (Scheme 106, reaction a). Noteworthy, enantioselectivities in dihydrofuran skeletons 643 were remarkably higher in comparaison with any other standard oxycyclization procedure. In addition, mechanistic insights pointed to ruthenium carbene species 647 as reaction intermediates, explaining the eventual double bond isomerization found in final adducts 643 through a 1,2-H shift. Alternatively, a cheaper and less toxic approach based on iron catalyst 646 and same enzymatic system allowed the preparation of dydrofurans 643 through milder reaction conditions (Scheme 106, reaction b).\n\n    The same research group has also taken advantage of the fruitful reactivity of enallenol skeletons under palladium catalysis, previously mentioned in section 3.2, to perform the synthesis of cyclobutenol structures. Reaction of racemic enalenols 648 and boronic esters 649 in the presence of palladium nanoparticles yielded the four-membered ring systems 650 trough a tandem carbocyclization/borylation reaction. Moderate to good yields and high diastereoselectivities were observed. In addition, palladium nanoparticles were suspended on amino-decorated mesocellular foam (Pd-Amp-MCF), providing high recyclability and efficiency (Scheme 101, reaction a). In combination with biocatalyst CAlB, cyclobutenol structure (1S,4S)-650a was obtained with a good 83% yield from enantioenriched enallenol (S)-648a, and a high 95% ee (Scheme 107, reaction b). From the mechanistic point of view, hydroxyl group is proposed to perform a multiple role, promoting the carbocyclization process by coordination with the metal unit, and directing the stereoselectivity on final adducts 630 through intermediates 651.\n\n    Following their interest in supramolecular host-guest catalyzed reactions (see Scheme 80, ref, Bergman, Raymond, and Toste and collaborators have extended the applications of Ga4L6-encapsulated gold ions 464 in tandem reactions with biocatalysts. Nonencapsulated metal catalyst, especially gold species, can partially poison biocatalysts by binding amino-acid groups from the protein skeleton. This fact may incur in a loss of catalytic activity, unless great excess of enzyme is used. In addition, the use of supramolecular hosts exhibited many other advantages such as catalyst stabilization or aqueous media allowance. Thus, racemic acetylated gamma-allenols 652 were reported to undergo KR in the presence of different enzymes such as Amano lipase PS providing enantioenriched allenols 653, which after oxycyclization in the presence of supramolecular catalyst 464 yielded dihydrofurans 654 showing up to 96% ee. Notably, the supramolecular host-guest catalytic system 464 allowed a decrease in the enzymatic loading to six units, compared with the 25 units needed when naked Me3PAuCl complex was used as catalyst. Kinetic experiments supported the hypothesis of the enzyme poisoning from free metal salts, revealing no interference between encapsulated gold systems 464 and lipase enzymes (Scheme 108).\n\n    The diverse reactivity of allenols under different reaction conditions has been applied to the synthesis of a wide family of natural and pharmaceutically attractive products. During the past decade, several reports have appeared describing the total synthesis of naturally occurring structures incorporating allenol chemistry, normally as a key step in the whole reaction sequence. Also, natural products have been characterized and synthesized exhibiting the allenol motif in the final structure. In the first part of this section, the most significant and recent uses of allenols as key intermediates in total synthesis will be described. In a second part, allenol synthesis strategies applied to the preparation of natural product bearing an allenol unit will be detailed.\n\n    The great ability of allenes to undergo carbo- and heterocyclization reactions has been largely employed for the synthesis of the cyclic core of different naturally occurring compounds. Concretely, oxycyclization of allenols has been one the most recurring tools to get access to natural products containing 5- and 6-membered oxacycles. Silver catalysis has been frequently described to provide tetrahydrofuran systems from ennartioenriched allenols without racemization. In this context, Ballereau and co-workers have reported one short synthetic route to the natural product Jaspine B (655), a cytotoxic marine compound consisting in a trisubstituted tetrahydrofuran skeleton. The heterocyclic core was obtained through a silver-catalyzed 5-endo-trig cyclization of alpha-allenol 657, obtained from the enantioselective Crabbe-type reaction of propargylic alcohol (655) with aldehyde 656 using optically pure (R)-alpha,alpha-diphenylprolinol as secondary amine (Scheme 109, reaction a). Axial-to-central chirality transfer from enantioenriched allenol 657 allowed the full retention of the enantiopurity in dihydrofuran 658. Further transformations included epoxidation, ring opening reaction in the presence of sodium azide and reduction to yield Jaspine B (659) in 12% overall yield through a six-step sequence.\n\n    Deska et al. reported the desymmetrization of prochiral allendiol 660 using enzymatic catalysis providing enantioenriched allenol 661 exhibiting 99% ee (Scheme 109, reaction b). Silver-catalyzed 5-endo-trig cyclization followed by enzymatic ester hydrolysis generated the corresponding dihydrofuran skeleton in product 662, with no racemization observed. Compound 662 was used as precursor for the synthesis of diastereomers Hyperione A (663) and Hyperione B (664), secondary metabolites found in the leaves of Hypericum Chinese, showing pharmaceutical activity.\n\n    (+)-Sylvone A (669) is a highly functionalized tetrahydrofuran metabolite principally extracted from the seeds and fruits of piper sylvaticum and piper logum plants. Yu's research group has envisioned a synthetic sequence to yield (+)-Sylvone A, based also on a silver-catalyzed 5-endo-trig cyclization of enantioenriched alpha-allenols. In this case, optically pure borane 666 was used as chiral inductor in the enantioselective aldol-type reaction of allenoate 665 with 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde to yielded enantioenriched allenol 667 exhibiting 93% ee (Scheme 109, reaction c). Silver nitrate was then employed as the most convenient metal catalyst to promote the dihydrofuran generation from 667 to compound 668 avoiding racemization processes. Further transformations including a Michael addition provided the expected natural product (+)-Sylvone A (669) through a short 5-step reaction sequence.\n\n    Metal-catalyzed oxycyclization of alpha-allenols have also been involved in longer synthethic pathways toward the synthesis of natural products exhibiting higher structural complexity. Carter et al. have reported the total synthesis of macrolide 670, a naturally occurring product found in Amphidinium sp. organisms. Compound 670 shows one of the most densely functionalized structures among the family of amphidinolides, and 11 stereogenic centers, endowing both a synthethic and analytical challenge. Also, two trans-disposed tetrahydrofuran units are present in the skeleton of compound 670, both synthesized from optically pure alkynol 671 (Scheme 110, reaction a). In the presence of AgBF4 as metal salt, alkynol 671 rearranges to produce alpha-allenol 672 as nonisolable reaction intermediate. In situ oxycyclization of 672 generates dihydrofuran 673 in 85% yield and dr >20:1. The complete synthesis of macrolide 670 comprises 34 steps in the longest linear sequence, and its synthesis has helped to elucidate the absolute configuration of the whole structure, unresolved since its first isolation more than two decades ago.\n\n    Leiodolide B metabolite (674) is a natural product isolated from marine sponges, showing a challenging tetrahydrofuran unit bearing four stereogenic centers on its northern fragment (Scheme 110, reaction b). Furstner and collaborators have envisioned a total synthesis of compound 674 through a 26-step reaction sequence. To achieve the tetrahydrofuran structure with the appropriate stereochemistry, a silver-promoted 5-endo-trig oxycyclization of enantioenriched alpha-allenol 675 was proposed. In this manner, dihydrofuran 676 was therefore achieved in high 91% yield and further converted into tetrahydrofuran 677. Further transformations allowed the preparation of macrolide 674, although full charecterization and interpretation of the naturally isolated analogous remains unresolved, leaving the quest for the Leiodolide B absolute configuration still open.\n\n    The gamma-butyrolactone scaffold is ubiquitous in nature and present in different biologically active alkaloids. Stenine (578) and Stemoamide (579), two naturally occurring heterocycles from the stemona alkaloid family, exhibit a gamma-butyrolactone unit which has been achieved trough a ruthenium-catalyzed carbonylation of allenols. In both cases, related exocyclic allenols 580 and 583 were synthesized and submitted to ruthenium catalysis under CO atmosphere to yield butenolide systems 581 and 584 (Scheme 111). In the final steps of the synthesis of the stenine and stemoamide cores, double bond reduction by treatment with Mg/MeOH and nickel boride, respectively, led to the desired compounds 682 and 679.\n\n    In a recent total synthesis of (+)-Xilogyblactone A (685), an alternative gold-based methodology has been introduced to access the butanolide motif. tButyl allenoate 686 reacted through an asymmetric aldol-type transformation with aldehyde 687 in the presence of enantiopure organoboron reagent 666. Enantioenriched alpha-allenol 688 was therefore synthesized exhibiting >99% ee. Interestingly, gold treatment of allenol 688 yielded the butenolide skeleton from selective nucleophilic attack of the carboxylic oxygen to the allene moiety. (+)-Xilogyblactone (685) was obtained after acidic hydrolysis of the TBSO group through a short three-step sequence and a 41% overall yield (Scheme 112). A related gold-catalyzed cycloisomerization of allenyl carboxylates has also provided the gamma-butyrolactone unit in the total synthesis of Xestospongienes E, F, G, and H.\n\n    Dihydropyran and tetrahydropyran fragments found in natural products have been accessed from oxycyclization of beta-allenols through diverse strategies. The dihydropyran C1-C15 subunit 689 of Sorangicin A, a potent antibiotic isolated from Sorangium Cellulosumi bacteria, has been synthesized through the gold-catalyzed 6-endo-trig cyclization of enantioenriched beta-allenol 692a, prepared from oxidation and further asymmetric reduction of the diastereomeric mixture 692a/692b (Scheme 113, reaction a).\n\n    Prins-type cyclization of beta-allenol 695 with dimethyl acetals 696 and 697 followed by Tsuji reduction led to the C14-C35 fragment of Eribulin (693) and the C14-C38 fragment of Halichondrin (694), respectively, two macrolides of marine origin exhibiting potent antitumor activity. Chirality transfer from enantioenriched allenols and acetals led to the stereocontrolled generation of the C27 sterocenter, and further Tsuji reduction under palladium conditions provided the stereodefined C25 center in both fragments 693 and 694 (Scheme 113, reaction b).\n\n    A more intrincate reaction mechanism was envisioned for the synthesis of (-)-Gilbertine natural product (680), a member of the uleine alkaloid family. Allenyl azide 678 undergoes photoinduced azacyclization to yield indolidene intermediate 679, which after 6-exo-trig oxycyclization reaction from the hydroxyl group yields the fused tetrahydropyran skeleton, favored by the formation of the more stable indol aromatic ring in compound 680 (Scheme 114).\n\n    In the context of allenol oxycyclization reactions toward the synthesis of naturally occurring products, related allenyl hydroxylamines have been described to undergo in situ cycloisomerization to yield polycyclic oxazines en route to the total synthesis of Casuarine, Australine, and diverse non-natural derivatives.\n\n    Breit and co-workers have recently reported a diasteroselective synthesis of dihydropyrans through the rhodium-catalyzed oxycyclization of both terminal and internal allenols, using dppf as ligand. The methodology has been successfully applied to the synthesis of (-)-centrolobine (683) through a six-steps reaction sequence and 20% overall yield (Scheme 115).\n\n    The beta-allenol scaffold has been also presented as precursor of acyclic fragments. Syn-1,3-diol is a common motif in every compound of the statin family. Breit and collaborators have developed the diasteroselective synthesis of syn-dioxanes 690 from in situ generated allenyl hemiacetals 689 as syn-1,3-diol precursors (Scheme 116). The asymmetric version of this transformation was achieved using acetylsultam borylenolate 686 as chiral inductor. Coupling reaction of compound 686 with allenyl carbaldehyde 687 followed by amide hydrolysis led to enantiopure beta-allenol 688. Further coupling reaction of syn-dioxanes 690 with the appropriate phosphoryl compound 691 and acetal hydrolysis allowed the total synthesis of Rosuvastatin (684) and Pitavastatin (685).\n\n    As previously mentioned in section 3.1.2, tandem carbocyclization/dehydratation reactions of allenols constitute straightforward procedures for the preparation of aromatic and heteroaromatic polycyclic structures. Ma and co-workers have employed this strategy for the synthesis of a wide variety of alkaloids from the carbazole family, starting from readily available methoxypropadiene (693) and indole-2-carbaldehydes 694. Treatment of methoxypropadiene (693) with nBuLi in the presence of indole-2- carbaldehydes 694 led to indole-tethered allenols 695 (Scheme 117). Carbocyclization of compounds 695 under precious metal catalyzed conditions followed by in situ dehydratation provided 2-methoxy-3-methylcarbazoles 696 in high yields. Carbazoles 696 were employed as key intermediates for the synthesis through short reaction sequences of natural occurring alkaloids such as Siamenol (697) or the Clausine family drugs (698-700), both exhibiting promising anti-HIV activities and commonly used in traditional medicine. Also, Girinimbine (701), Murrayacine (702), or Mukoenine-type structures (703, 704), showing cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of cell lines were obtained.\n\n    Cycloaddition reactions involving allenol molecules en route to natural products and fragments have also been described. Early examples deal with the Diels-Alder of allenols and methyl propiolate in the total synthesis of Quassin. More recent advances include the intramolecular (5 + 2) cycloaddition of allenol 705 for the synthesis of the tetracyclic core of Bufogargarizin C (707) (Scheme 118, reaction a), or the tandem Diels-Alder/carbonyl-ene reaction from allenol 708 to provide the Chloropupukeananin D analogous 710 (Scheme 118, reaction b). The first and asymmetric total synthesis of the bioactive bufospirostenin A, an unusual spirostanol natural product, has been accomplished taking advantage of the intramolecular allenic Pauson-Khand reaction of an alkyne-tethered allenol for the construction of a tetracyclic skeleton.\n\n    Jogyamicin (712) is an aminocyclopentitol-based natural product recently isolated from Streptomyces culture broth. Its potent antiprotozoal activity along with its challenging structure has attracted the interest of diverse research groups. One recent approach to the five-membered core of Jogyamicin starts from enantioenriched beta-allenol 713, which after protection as allenic sulfamate 714, followed by oxidative allene amination under rhodium catalysis led to cyclic sulfamate 716 through aziridine-intermediate 715 (Scheme 119). A 15-step reaction sequence from sulfamate 716 provided the pentacyclic structure 717 in a 6% overall yield, a known key intermediate in the total synthesis of Jogyamicin.\n\n    Palladium-catalyzed additions and hydroborations of allenes has been applied to the preparation of different natural products. Yoshida's research group has described the synthesis of sesquiterpenes (-)-HM-3 and (-)-HM-4 based on the palladium-catalyzed addition of boronic acids to alpha-allenols, and the synthesis of enokipodins A and B, two sesquiterpenoids from the alpha-cuparenone family exhibiting antimicrobial activity through a similar strategy. Roulland and co-workers have reported the total synthesis of the antibiotic Tiacumicin B incorporating a palladium-mediated cross-coupling reaction of alkynes and allenols. Hong and collaborators have envisioned a total synthesis of Lasonolide A (718), a natural product from marine origin and promising activity in pancreatic cancer therapies. The proposed retrosynthesis disconnects the macrolide product in fragments 719 and 720, prepared from the hydroboration of both allenes (+)-721-Ac and (-)-721, after a 12- and 11-step sequence, respectively. Enantiopure allenes (+)-721-Ac and (-)-721 have been prepared taking advantage of the enzymatic resolution of racemic allenol 721. Julia-type olefination of fragments 719 and 720 followed by Yamaguchi macrolactonization and total desilylation provided the expected structure of the Lasonolide A polyketide (Scheme 120).\n\n    Recently, the ability of allenyl carbamates, readily available from the corresponding allenols, to generate dienes as reaction intermediates has been employed in the total synthesis of trachelanthamidine and supinidine through a (4 + 1) ring closing process. Thus, allenyl carbamates 725 reacted under phosphine-promoted conditions to yield pyrrolines 727, key reaction intermediates in the total synthesis of pyrrolizidine alkaloids 728 and 729 (Scheme 121).\n\n    Once considered chemical curiosities and extremely reactive compounds, allenes are currently found in more than 150 thermally and photochemically stable natural products. Despite the allenol system is infrequent in naturally occurring systems, and linear allenes commonly show chemical instability, some simple linear molecules bearing the allenol motif have exhibited important antibiotic activity, such as the diyonic compounds marasin (730), and 07F275 molecule (731), both described in the late 80s (Scheme 122).\n\n    During the past decade, some examples describing naturally occurring linear allenes have been reported. Ma's research group has applied their chiral amine enantioselective allenation of terminal alkynes for the one-step synthesis of (R)-8-hydroxyocta-5,6-dienoate (735), a potent antifungal and antibiotic molecule extracted from the Japanese tallow tree Sapium japonicum. Reaction of propargylic alcohol (732) and methyl-5-oxopentanoate 733 in the presence of (S)-diphenyl(pyrrolidin-2-yl)methanol 734 and CuBr2 as metal catalyst led to the expected 1,3-disubstituted allene moiety in compound 735 (Scheme 123). Efficient chirality transfer from optically pure secondary amine 734 allowed the obtention of allenol 735 in 94% ee.\n\n    Thomas and collaborators have reported the total synthesis of the allenol-based natural product Puna'auic acid (736), a fatty acid isolated from marine cyanobacterium. The allenol motif is generated in one of the latter steps of the reaction sequence, through a copper-catalyzed conjugated hydride addition to enantioenriched epoxy alkyne 737, following Krause's procedure. Although the allene biosynthethic origins are not yet fully understood, the discovery of minor alkyne metabolites related to structure 736 from the same natural sources point to a similar conjugated hydride addition as the most plausible biosynthethic route (Scheme 124).\n\n    (+)-Iso-A82775C natural product (739) has been isolated from the fermentation culture of fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, and it has been proposed as a biosynthethic intermediate of the previously mentioned chloropupukeananin family. Compound 739 is a polysubstituted cyclohexane ring bearing an exocyclic allene. Its structure and complex stereochemistry have attracted the interest of different research groups, reporting alternative synthethic strategies. Suzuki and Tanino and co-workers have proposed a Seyferth-Gilbert homologation of carbaldehyde 740 to generate ethynyl cyclohexane structure 742 (Scheme 125, reaction a). Epoxidation of the endocyclic olefin followed by Cu-mediated anti-SN2' reaction of the chloroalkyne with isopropenyl magnesium bromide provided adduct 743 exhibiting the allene moiety with the adequate stereochemistry. Natural product 739 was obtained after desilylation of protected alcohols with TBAF. Han et al. have envisioned a different approach to get access to the allene moiety in 739. Stille coupling of iodo vinyl derivative 744 and organostannane 745 led to the dienyne 746 (Scheme 125, reaction b). Selective endocyclic double bond reduction with K-selectride yielded cyclohexanone 747, which suffered enyne-enallene isomerization in the presence of catalytic amounts of triethylamine. Total synthesis of 739 was completed with further carbonyl reduction and desylylation steps.\n\n    Carotenoids represent the largest group of natural products exhibiting the allenol motif, being the Grasshopper ketone (749) one of the most commonly reported. First synthesis and isolation date to the late 60s, pointing to a dietary metabolism of larger carotenoids as the most plausible biological origin of compound 749. Eugster et al. described a total synthesis of allenol 749 based on a SN2' hydride addition onto propargylic oxirane precursor 750, followed by selective oxidation under MnO2 conditions (Scheme 126).\n\n    A related exocyclic allene unit is present in the wide family of xanthophyll norcarotenoids, naturally occurring compounds isolated from marine microalgae. Great effort has been made during the last years to provide an efficient synthethic route to some of these carotenoid molecules such as the most abundant Peridinin (752a), Fucoxanthin (752c), the biosynthetic intermediate Paracentrone (752d), and diverse natural and non-natural derivatives (Scheme 127).\n\n    Alvarez and de Lera et al. have proposed a retrosynthethic analysis for the total synthesis of Peridinin based on Julia-Kocienski olefinations, and a Stille coupling reaction to incorporate the allenic moiety from fragment 753 (Scheme 128, path a). Also, in depth investigations on the stereoselective oxidative addition or SN2' substitution of palladium reagents to iodoallene derivatives 753 were reported. Iodoallene 753 was prepared from the corresponding alkyne 755.- Burke's research group has devised a Suzuki coupling of iodoallene 753 and the corresponding boronic acids 756 to incorporate the allenic fragment utilizing the same disconnection strategy (Scheme 128, path b). A different retrosynthetic approach for the total synthesis of analogous deoxy-Peridinin (752b) has been proposed by Sakaguchi and Katsumara and collaborators. Despite this strategy being Suzuki-based, the novelty lays on a different disconnection, which results in allenic fragment 757 and boronic acids 758 (Scheme 128, path c). Wittig olefination from previously known enallenal 759 provided the dienallenyl iodide 757.\n\n    Katsumara's research group has proposed a total synthesis for both Fucoxanthin (752c) and Paracentrone (752d) natural products following similar strategies. Sonogashira coupling of ethynyl epoxide 760 and iodo triene 761 yielded trienynyl carboxylate 762 (Scheme 129). Next, treatment with DIBAL-H as hydride source smoothly rearranged the ethynyl epoxide moiety to generate the allenol motif and also reduced the carboxylate unit to the corresponding terminal alcohol building compound 763. Further Dess-Martin oxidation followed by Wittig olefination in the presence of phosphonium salt 765 provided the Paracentrone skeleton (752d) (Scheme 129, left). A Suzuki alternative for the Wittig olefination in the last steps of the synthesis has also been stated, also allowing the synthesis of related 19-hexanoyloxyparacentrone 3-acetate. Likewise, Fucoxanthin (752c) total synthesis has been achieved through a Julia-type olefination of the allenic fragment 764 with hydroxysulfone 766 (Scheme 129, right).\n\n    Besides the above-mentioned synthethic approaches to naturally occurring targets, the determination of both structure and absolute configuration of allenol-containing natural products have been reported. Thus, Maoka et al. have stated the absolute configuration of minor carotenoid 4-Ketodeepoxyneoxanthin (767) in basis of NMR investigations. Che's and Souto's research groups have respectively proposed the full structure and stereochemistry of Chloropestolide metabolite 768, and Marilzabicycloallene A (769), exhibiting an unusual bromoallene motif (Scheme 130).\n\n    The diverse and intriguing biological properties of naturally occurring allenols described so far, have paved the way to the synthesis of non-natural analogous and the examination of their pharmaceutical activities. Zemlicka has recently reported a critical comparison of the antiviral properties of a wide family of lipophilic nucleoside analogous and their phosphoramidates, including several examples of allenol-containing systems. For instance, adenosine- and cytosine-based compounds 770 and 771 have been prepared through basic equilibration from the corresponding alkynol precursors. Both molecules exhibit potent cytotoxic and antiviral activities. Interestingly, anti-HIV properties of 770 and 771 were found to be in close dependency of the absolute configuration of the allene moiety, being the (R)-isomer obtained through enzymatic resolution the active species (Scheme 131).\n\n    More non-natural pharmacologically attractive allenols were described and reviewed during the 80s and 90s decades such as allenol-based prostaglandin and carbacyclin systems, allenic amino acids bearing hydroxyl groups, and allenic steroids.",
        "Results": "",
        "Conclusion": "    Allenol chemistry remains to be a hot research topic, which includes two main areas, namely the development of new methods for their synthesis and the discovery of novel and fascinating reactivity, which converts the allenol moiety in a powerful building block in the modern synthetic arsenal. Allenes decorated with hydroxyl units, namely allenols, exhibit unique and particular reactivity compared to the nonsubstituted analogous. The allenol reactivity could be classified in three main categories: (i) Allenols reacting as pi-activated alcohols, where the hydroxyl group leaves the molecule or undergoes 1,3-migration rearrangement processes, leading to open-chained systems such as dienes or enynes, or to aromatic cyclic structures. (ii) Those reacting as bidentate nucleophiles-electrophiles, taking advantage of both the hydroxyl nucleophilicity as well as the allene electrophilicity when pi-metal activation takes place. Oxacyclic structures such as furans or pyrans are accessed. (iii) Those where the hydroxyl group assists any kind of allene transformation, frequently by metal intermediate coordination. Also, the frequent use of allenols as key intermediates for the total synthesis of natural product deserves to be mentioned.\n\n    The extensive use of allenols as synthetic intermediates is associated with the implementation of an increasing number of methodologies for their preparation, both in racemic and enantiopure manner. Particularly attractive is the use of modern catalytic methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched allenols, which can display astonishing axial and central chirality. Last but not least, despite that the allenol scaffold is not commonly encountered in Nature, several allenol-based natural products have been isolated, characterized and synthesized. All contributions together support the widespread use and importance of the allenol functionality in current organic chemistry.\n\n    The intriguing reactivity so far exhibited by the allenol functional group, and the wide range of structures accessible from allenol starting materials will certainly inspire organic chemist to pursuit new advances and results that will be shortly coming in this area. In one hand, allenol-containing molecules constitute an ideal playground to continue the development of modern synthetic methodologies, as it has been recently illustrated by the recent micellar catalysis or the gold-based supramolecular catalysis, both of them based on allenol oxycyclization reactions. The field is dominated by the use of catalysts derived from expensive transition metals such as gold and palladium, with punctual incorporation of other metals. It should be desirable the widespread use of inexpensive and more environmentally friendly metals such as iron, copper, etc. Besides, despite the appearance of several catalytic protocols in heterogeneous phase through the use of metal nanoparticles, the more of the reactions are performed in homogeneous conditions. On the other hand, covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable interest in recent years, but its application in allenol chemistry remains elusive. Consequently, more sustainable processes are desirable. In this context, the incorporation of recent progresses in photochemical methods and modern electrochemistry persist as a challenge. The application of photochemistry in allenol chemistry is restricted to a couple of isolated reports dealing with photoredox catalysis while there is absence of information concerning electrochemical methods. The use of enzymes in allenol chemistry is limited to the classical use for the resolution of racemic mixtures, but an efficient use of bioengineering advances should be taken into account. Besides, ongoing endeavors to discover competent asymmetric routes are largely based on designing and building new and exotic chiral nonracemic ligands or catalysts; however, the recognition of conveniently activated allenol precursors to enlarge catalytic effectiveness is critical too. On the other hand, the potential axial chirality of the allene motif is still unexploited, being the axial-to-central chirality transfer processes from axially enantioenriched 1,2-dienes one of the most notable challenges regarding the chemistry of allenes. Also, the inexhaustible search of new and more potent drugs, and the synthesis and characterization of yet unreported natural products often bearing oxacyclic moieties, will be certainly supported by the rich and efficient chemistry of the allenol system.\n\n    The authors declare no competing financial interest.",

        "Title": "    Clinical Phenotype of De Novo GNAO1 Mutation",
        "Abstract": "    Mutations in the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), alpha activating activity polypeptide O (GNAO1) gene have recently been described in 6 patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathies. In the present study, we report the phenotype and the clinical course of a 4-year-old female with an epileptic encephalopathy (Ohtahara syndrome) and profound intellectual disability due to a de novo GNAO1 mutation (c.692A>G; p.Tyr231Cys). Ohtahara syndrome is a devastating early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that can be caused by mutations in different genes, now also including GNAO1. The mutation was found using a targeted next generation sequencing gene panel and demonstrates targeted sequencing as a powerful tool for identifying mutations in genes where only a few de novo mutations have been identified.",
        "Introduction": "    Mutations in the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), alpha activating activity polypeptide O (GNAO1) gene have been identified in breast carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and in 6 patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathies. Epileptic encephalopathies are a group of disorders characterized by severe and progressive cognitive and behavioral impairments that most likely are caused or worsened by epileptic activity. Ohtahara syndrome is one of the most severe and earliest forms of epileptic encephalopathies and is characterized by tonic spasms in the neonatal period, seizure intractability, and a suppression-burst pattern on electroencephalography (EEG). Recently, de novo mutations in several other genes (ARX, SCN2A, STXBP1, KCNQ2, etc) have been reported in individuals with Ohtahara syndrome.\n\n    GNAO1 encodes the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). G proteins are a large family of signal-transducing molecules composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Members of the G protein family have been characterized most extensively on the basis of the alpha subunit, which binds the guanine nucleotide and is capable of hydrolyzing guanosine-5-triphosphate as well as interacting with specific receptor and effector molecules. The alpha subunits decoded by GNAO1 are extremely abundant in brain tissue, suggesting important roles in brain function. Mice lacking Galphao show multiple neurological abnormalities, including generalized tremor, occasional seizures, severe motor-control impairment, hyperalgesia, and behavioral abnormalities with early postnatal lethality.\n\n    In vitro functional expression studies showed that 3 of the previously published mutations in GNAO1 cause impaired protein localization to the plasma membrane, and electrophysiological analysis showed a decreased GNAO1-mediated inhibition of calcium currents by norepinephrine compared to the wild type. The findings suggest that aberrant GNAO1 signaling can cause multiple neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including epileptic encephalopathy and involuntary movements. In the present study, we report the phenotype and clinical course of a 4-year-old female with a de novo GNAO1 (c.692A>G; p.Tyr231Cys) mutation (OMIM 615473, EIEE17).",
        "Methods": "    We collected the DNA samples from the girl and her parents. Genomic DNA from the family was extracted from EDTA anticoagulated blood samples using standard methods. To identify the disease-causing gene, targeted next generation sequencing of 40 different genes associated with childhood epilepsy was performed. Targeted next generation sequencing libraries were prepared from 20 ng of template DNA using the Ion AmpliSeq library 2.0 kit and primers for the 40 genes (Life Technologies, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing adaptors with index sequences (barcodes) that enable sample multiplexing were ligated to the amplicons using the Ion Xpress barcode adaptor kit (Life Technologies). The library DNA was clonally amplified onto the IonSpheres (Life Technologies) by emulsion polymerase chain reaction following the manufacturer's protocol, and IonSpheres were isolated by breaking the emulsion using an Ion OneTouch system. Enrichment of IonSpheres was achieved using the IT OneTouch ES (Life Technologies) and the Ion OneTouch 200 template kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Enriched IonSpheres were sequenced on an Ion 314 Chip using the sequencing kit (Life Technologies) per the manufacturer's instructions. Segregation analysis was carried out using conventional Sanger sequencing.",
        "Results": "    Targeted next generation sequencing of 40 genes associated with early-onset epilepsy was performed. A heterozygous missense variation at c.692A>G; p.Tyr231Cys in exon 6 of GNAO1 was detected. The amino acid change was predicted to be pathogenic by PolyPhen-2 and Sift altering a highly evolutionary conserved amino acid. The mutation has not been observed in the 1000Genomes project, Exome Variant Server, or dbSNP (The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database), and segregation analysis revealed that the mutation occurred de novo in the girl.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In the present study, we describe a 4-year-old girl with an epileptic encephalopathy (Ohtahara syndrome), severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, and absence of speech (EIEE17). We have identified a likely damaging genetic variation in the GNAO1 gene using a targeted next generation sequencing gene panel. The role of GNAO1 in EIEE was recently identified by Nakamura et al who described de novo heterozygous missense GNAO1 mutations in 4 patients with severe intellectual disability and motor developmental delay. In addition, 2 patients with a de novo GNAO1 mutation were recently identified by exome sequencing of a cohort of patients with infantile spasms. The present patient is hence the seventh case described with an epileptic encephalopathy due to a mutation in GNAO1.\n\n    There are some similarities, as well as differences, between the present patient and the patients described previously (Table 1). Three of the published cases were diagnosed as having Ohtahara syndrome. In the present patient, Ohtahara syndrome was suspected at the age of 3 months. However, it is important to underline that at the age of 9 months, the burst-suppression pattern in the EEG disappeared in the presented case:being evaluated as one of the important symptoms of Ohtahara syndrome. During the course of the disease, the present patient had multiple seizure types including myoclonic seizures, focal seizures with secondary generalization, epileptic spasms, and generalized tonic and tonic-clonic seizures. In comparison, all 4 patients described by Nakamura et al and 1 girl from the EuroEPINOMICS cohort developed only tonic seizures. These observations underline that several diagnostic features are age dependent and/or disease course dependent. Furthermore, in addition to the alterations in the epileptic seizure type, other clinical symptoms have also changed during the 4 years of follow-up. Interestingly, the child has obtained some abilities, for example, short-term eye contact and the ability to push herself up for a moment. The patients described by Nakamura et al had additional movement disorders including dystonia and chorea and athetosis, while the patient of this study developed nonepileptic spasms-like movements in her legs at the age of 4 years, which could be of a subcortical origin. The patients described by the EuroEPINOMICS Consortium did not have any movement disorders but presented with profound hypotonia. Helbig underlined that this observation could indicate that Galphao is also involved in other systems and that the phenotype may well extend beyond an epileptic encephalopathy. Two of the patients described by Nakamura et al died from respiratory tract obstruction at the age of 3 and 11 months, respectively, while the present patient became oxygen dependent at the age of 2 years after several respiratory infections.\n\n    By identifying a de novo GNAO1 mutation in a patient with a severe epileptic encephalopathy, the present report demonstrates the ability of targeted sequencing as a powerful tool to identify mutations in genes where only a few de novo mutations have been identified. We recommend that targeted sequencing or whole-exome sequencing should be performed in children with early infantile epileptic encephalopathies, which may lead to the discovery of rare disease-causing genetic variations, as in the present case. Unfortunately, this is not always possible due to high costs of these investigations, but on the other hand, the early etiological diagnosis might reduce unnecessary investigations and might lead to a targeted treatment reducing side effects from the trial-and-error treatment approach. Taking into account the changing of the symptoms during course of the disease, the long-term follow-up will eventually benefit from knowing the basis of disease and its prognosis. Furthermore, it plays an important role in the process of informing the parents about the cause of the disease and is of utmost importance in genetic counseling.\n\n    Author Contribution: Patient referral and patient's clinical information were provided by IT, and TT; patient's MRI was reviewed by PI; electroencephalography by UV, sequencing was carried out and interpreted by RM, LL, and HD.

        "Title": "    A novel missense mutation in P4HB causes mild osteogenesis imperfecta",
        "Abstract": "    Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare heritable bone disorder characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), recurrent bone fractures, and progressive bone deformities. P4HB encodes protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and is identified as a novel candidate gene of OI. The purposes of the present study are to detect pathogenic mutation, to evaluate the phenotypes of a Chinese family with mild OI, and to investigate the effects of bisphosphonates on bone of the proband. We detected the pathogenic mutation by next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. Laboratory and radiological investigations were conducted to evaluate the phenotypes. The proband was a 12-year-old girl with low BMD, history of recurrent non-traumatic fractures, slight scoliosis, with bluish grey sclera and ligamentous laxity. Her father suffered from one fragility fracture and slight wedge changes of vertebras, with bluish grey sclera. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.692A>C, p.His231Pro) in P4HB in the proband and her father. This mutation was predicted to affect the combination of PDI with type I procollagen and lead to the disorder of its triple helix formation. Bisphosphonates were effective in reducing bone resorption and increasing BMD of the proband with well tolerance. In conclusion, we identified a novel mutation in P4HB in a Chinese family with mild OI, which expanded the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of OI. Bisphosphonates were effective to this extremely rare OI induced by P4HB mutation.",
        "Introduction": "    Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare heritable bone disorder with an incidence of 1:15,000-20,000 neonates, which is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), impaired bone strength, resulting in recurrent bone fractures and progressive bone deformities. Patients with OI also present with a series of extra-skeletal manifestations, including dentinogenesis imperfecta, blue sclera, hearing deficits, and ligamentous laxity. The phenotypes of OI widely vary from mild to perinatal death, so there are four main clinical categories of OI (types I-IV). With the development of molecular diagnosis, additional types of OI have been found. Up to now, at least 20 casuative genes of OI have been identified, including COL1A1, COL1A2, IFITM5, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PLOD2, PPIB, SERPINF1, SERPINH1, SP7, WNT1, BMP1, TMEM38B, PLS3, CREB3L1, SEC24D, SPARC, P4HB, and MBTPS2, which are involved in encoding or post-translational modification process of type I collagen or regulating osteoblasts function.\n\n    Recently, P4HB (OMIM 176790) is reported as a new candidate gene of a severe type of OI, Cole-Carpenter syndrome (CCS). CCS was first identified in 1987 by Cole and Carpenter, which was characterized by bone fragility, craniosynostosis, hydrocephalus, wide open fontanelle, ocular proptosis, blue sclera, small nose, flat nasal bridge, and other distinctive facial features. P4HB locates on chromosome 17q25.3 and spans 18 Kb of 11 exons, which encodes protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a key enzyme for protein folding by forming the correct disulfide bridges between polypeptide chains . PDI plays an important role in post-translational modification of type I procollagen as a chaperone to prevent aggregation of procollagen alpha chains. And it is also the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase that is responsible for hydroxylating proline residues on alpha chains of type I procollagen. As far as we know, only two types of mutations in P4HB are reported, both of them caused CCS.\n\n    In the present study, we aim to detect pathogenic mutation and to investigate the phenotypes of a Chinese family with mild OI. In addition, we also prospectively evaluate the effects of bisphosphonates on bone of the proband.",
        "Methods": "    A 12-year-old Chinese girl of Han origin from a non-consanguineous family went to endocrinology clinic, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in 2014 for 6 years history of recurrent fractures. She was diagnosed as OI in our clinic. The proband and her parents were included in the present study. The pedigree of this family was shown in Figure 1A.\n\n    The study protocol was approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of PUMCH. The patient's parents signed the informed consents before they participated in the present study.\n\n    Medical history was collected in detail, including fracture history, growth and development status, and family history. Meanwhile, physical examination was carefully performed, including bone, teeth, sclerae, and joints. Height and weight of the patient were measured with Harpenden stadiometer (Seritex Inc., East Rutherford, NJ, U.S.A.) and RGZ-120 weighing scale (Xiheng, Wuxi, China), which were calculated to age- and sex-specific Z scores on the basis of the reference data of Chinese children.\n\n    Serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP, a bone formation marker), aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (Cr) were measured using an automated analyzer (ADVIA1800, Siemens, Germany). Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), beta cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX, a bone resorption marker) and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was quantitated by an automated electrochemiluminescence system (E170; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). Vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency were defined as serum 25OHD level <20, 20-30, and >30 ng/ml, respectively. All biochemical parameters were measured in the central laboratory of PUMCH.\n\n    Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy Advance, GE Healthcare, U.S.A.) was used to measure BMD at lumbar spine and femoral neck. BMD Z scores were calculated according to the normal reference data from age and gender matched population. X-ray films of the skull, radius, ulna, hands, and thoracolumbar spine were examined.\n\n    Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes under the standard procedures (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, Qiagen, Germany). Genetic detection was performed through paired-end sequencing using a panel for next generation sequencing (NGS), which covered more than 700 candidate genes of genetic bone disorders, including 20 candidate genes of OI (COL1A1, COL1A2, IFITM5, SERPINF1, CRTAP, P3H1, PPIB, SERPINH1, FKBP10, BMP1, PLOD2, SP7, TMEM38B, WNT1, CREB3H1, SPARC, PLS3, P4HB, SEC24D, and MBTPS2). Protocol of the experimental procedures was as previously described. The genomic DNA was fragmented and ligated with end-repaired adaptors oligonucleotides. Then DNA fragments with adaptor molecules were purified and enriched by PCR. Each barcoded library product was pooled and subjected to enrichment of targetted genomic sequences, and sequenced on one lane of the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) with paired-end 100 bases read length. Illumina pipeline (version 1.3.4) was utilized to perform bioinformatic analysis of reads mapping, mutations detection (including polymorphisms, SNVs, and small indels) and annotation. All sequencing results were analyzed using nucleotide BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) software to compare with the standard sequences in the database. Mutations of an allele frequency >=1% in dbSNP, HapMap, 1000G ASN AF, ESP6500 AF, ExAC, Genome1000 and an internal control database from the Beijing Genomics Institute were filtered out. Blood samples were also drawn from 100 unrelated healthy subjects to confirm the mutation was not polymorphisms. We further analyzed the pathogenicity of the mutation using Muation Taster (http://www.mutationtaster.org/) and Uniprot software (http://uniprot.org/).\n\n    Mutation in exon 5 of P4HB was further confirmed by PCR. The web-based Primer 3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/) was used to design the primers for Sanger sequencing from the genomic sequence (NG_042033.1): forward 5 '-CTGCTGGCTGCTGTGACTT-3' and reverse 5'-CAATGGCCTCCAATGTCAG-3'. Following the conditions: initial denaturation at 95 C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95 C for 30 s, 60.5 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 60 s, PCR was conducted by TaqMix DNA polymerase (Biomed, China) with its standard buffer. PCR products were sequenced by an ABI 377DNA automated sequencer with dye terminator cycle sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    Swiss model software (https://www.swissmodel.expasy.org/) was used to build the 3D structure of the PDI. Subsequently, the protein change induced by the mutation was investigated by building the His231Pro mutant of PDI with mutagenesis module of PyMoL software (http://www.pymol.org/).\n\n    The proband received alendronate (FOSAMAX , Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd., U.K.) 70 mg/week for 1 year and switched to infusion of zoledronic acid (Aclasta , Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG, Switzerland) 5 mg/year for 2 years and then entered the drug holiday for 1 year. Calcium (500 mg/day) and calcitriol (0.25 ug/2 days) were prescribed during the treatment. To evaluate the effects of bisphosphonates, the change of bone turnover biomarkers and BMD were detected every 6-12 months. All adverse events of the proband were recorded in detail during the treatment.",
        "Results": "    The proband was a girl of a non-consanguineous family. She was born full-term with a birth weight of 3300 g. She had no skeletal deformities at birth, with normal cognitive and motor development. Since 6 years old, she was suffered from five non-traumatic fractures of bilateral humerus, left wrist, left ankle, and left calcaneus. At the age of 12, her height was 157 cm with a Z score of 0.72 and her weight was 36 kg with a Z score of -0.54. Physical examination revealed bluish gray sclera and ligamentous laxity, but without bone deformity and dentinogenesis imperfecta. Serum levels of Ca, P, ALP, and PTH were normal. We could not judge if her beta-CTX level was normal because the normal range of beta-CTX was unavailable in Chinese children. The serum 25OHD level was 10.2 ng/ml, which indicated vitamin D deficiency. BMD value was 0.780 g/cm2 (Z score: -0.31) at lumbar spine and 0.646 g/cm2 (Z score: -1.6) at femoral neck. X-ray films revealed slender long bone with thin cortices and slight scoliosis of the spine (Figure 2A-F). No wormian bone was observed.\n\n    The father was 43 years old with the height of 179 cm. He suffered from one fragility fracture at the fourth metacarpal of the right hand at 30 years old. Physical examination revealed bluish gray sclera without ligamentous laxity, bone deformity, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. BMD Z score was 0.5 at lumbar spine and 0.0 at the femoral neck. Vertebral morphometry revealed slight wedge changes of thoracic and lumbar vertebras (Figure 2G-J). The mother was 41 years old with BMD Z score both 0.2 at lumbar spine and femoral neck. She did not experience fracture. The phenotypes of the family were shown in Table 1.\n\n    A novel heterozygous missense mutation in exon 5 of P4HB (c.692A>C) was identified in the proband and her father (Figure 1B). This mutation led to histidine replaced by a proline at position 231 in PDI. There was no frequency record of the mutation in dbSNP, HapMap, 1000G ASN AF, ESP6500 AF, ExAC, genome1000, and an internal control database from the Beijing Genomics Institute. It was damaging in prediction of Mutation Taster. Moreover, the affected amino acid residue was highly conserved in PDI amongst different species (Figure 1C), which indicated the function of this residue was important throughout evolution. The change of amino acid of PDI in 3D structure induced by the mutation in P4HB was shown in Figure 1D.\n\n    The P4HB mutation identified in our patients was absent from the 100 healthy controls and did not match polymorphisms in any public database. No mutation was identified in other candidate genes of OI in our patients.\n\n    As shown in Figure 3, after 12 months of treatment with alendronate, serum beta-CTX level of the proband decreased by 8.3%. Then serum ALP and beta-CTX levels of the proband were significantly decreased by 43.5 and 53.7% after 24 months of zoledronic acid treatment and remained at a low level during the drug holiday. During 3 years treatment of BPs, the BMD of the proband significantly increased by 40.9% at lumbar spine and by 21.2% at femoral neck, with her BMD Z score increasing from -0.3 to 1.8 at lumbar spine and from -1.6 to -0.5 at femoral neck, respectively. Moreover, the height of the proband arrived 168 cm (Z score: 1.46) when she was 16 years old. During the treatment of bisphosphonates, no new fracture occurred. The proband did not present with upper abdominal discomfort and acid reflux, dizziness, and hepatic or renal function abnormity during taking alendronate. She had no fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and abnormal liver and kidney functions when she switched to treatment of zoledronic acid from alendronate.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We reported for the first time that a novel heterozygous missense mutation in P4HB gene (c.692A>C in exon 5) could lead to mild OI. The phenotypes of the proband with this mutation included recurrent fractures, slight scoliosis of spine, slender long bone with thin cortices, and bluish gray sclera, ligamentous laxity. Her father only suffered from one fragility fracture, slight wedge changes in thoracic and lumbar vertebras with bluish gray sclera. Bisphosphonates were effective in reducing bone resorption and increasing BMD of the proband.\n\n    The exact mechanism of mutations in P4HB causing OI had not been fully illuminated. PDI, encoded by P4HB, was a molecular chaperone locating in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the capacity to catalyze disulfide bond formation, breakage, and rearrangement in all non-native protein and peptide substrates including type I procollagen. PDI played roles as a chaperone with the ability of redox catalyst, which prevented type I procollagen aggregation in the ER. In fibroblasts of patients with P4HB mutation, the vesicular pattern of procollagen type I distribution was significantly increased compared with healthy control. In addition, P4HB mutation also increased the expression of heat shock protein 47 in fibroblasts, which indicated ER stress. ER stress could lead to osteoblast malfunction and result in defective bone formation and bone fragility, which had been proved in an OI mouse model. Moreover, PDI also offered supports for the prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit as the beta subunit. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase could aid alpha chains of type I procollagen forming the triple helix structure by hydroxylating proline residues on the alpha chains. P4HB mutations would disrupt the formation of type I collagen triple helix structure. Therefore, P4HB mutations might result in dysfunction of bone formation through multiple aspects.\n\n    As shown in Figure 4, including our study, only two heterozygous missense mutations of c.1178A>G in exon 9 and c.692A>C in exon 5 and 1 heterozygous large fragment deletion from exon 5 to 8 in P4HB were reported. PDI was currently recognized to have four thioredoxin-like domains (a, b, b', and a') with a beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure and one ER retention motif. The domains a and a' contained catalytic CXXC motifs with disulfide isomerase activity. Non-catalytic domains b and b' were involved in substrate recognition and combination. Previous studies revealed that c.1178A>G mutation caused p.Try393Cys of the C-terminal disulfide isomerase domain, which impaired the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI . Another study reported a large fragment deletion from exon 5 to 8, which also affected the disulfide isomerase domain. In the present study, we identified a novel heterozygous mutation (c.692A>C) in exon 5 of P4HB gene, which caused an amino acid substitution (p.His231Pro). Since the affected amino acid residue was highly conserved in the PDI amongst different species, we speculated that the change of this amino acid would impair the function of PDI. This change was located in the last alpha helixes of the domain b in PDI, which was responsible for the combination with substrate. It was predicted to cause OI by impairing the combination of PDI with type I procollagen and leading to type I procollagen aggregation in the ER and disorder of its triple helix formation. Due to the exact mechanisms of this mutation lead to OI was not completely clear, the functional experiment was still needed to be completed.\n\n    Up to now, including our patients, only seven patients were reported to carry mutations in P4HB. The phenotypes of our patients were obviously different from previously reported (Table 2). All of the other patients presented severe skeletal phenotypes, including a lower BMD, bowing extremities, popcorn epiphyses or wide epiphyses, craniosynostosis, distinctive facial features, ocular proptosis, and growth retardation, with earlier onset age. But the patients in our study only presented as mild OI, with fewer bone fracture and slight low BMD. The phenotype of patients with P4HB mutations exhibited obviously heterogeneous from mild OI to severe CCS. The reasons for the significant phenotypic heterogeneity of OI patients with P4HB mutations were unclear. We speculated that different mutation in P4HB would affect different domain of PDI, resulting in heterogeneous phenotype of patients. Further studies need to be carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of the heterogeneity in OI patients.\n\n    Bisphosphonates, synthetic analogs of inorganic pyrophosphate, had been turned out to be effective in OI patients. Pamidronate was revealed to be effective to increase BMD at lumbar spine, reduce bone fracture incidence, and remodel vertebral bodies in CCS patients caused by P4HB mutations. As the second-generation and third-generation bisphosphonates, alendronate and zoledronic acid could lead to increases in BMD and reductions in bone resorption biomarkers in OI patients. At present, the dosage, frequency, and course of bisphosphonates treatment in OI patients were still in controversy. Considering the pharmacoeconomic factors and the relatively low bioavailability of alendronate (<1%), we choose a higher dosages of alendronate and zoledronic acid to treat this patient. These dosages had been demonstrated to be safe in our previous study. In our patient, alendronate and zoledronic acid was also effective in decreasing bone turnover biomarkers levels, increasing BMD and with well tolerance. The patient entered the drug holiday after 3 years of bisphosphonates treatment because her BMDs had reached the normal level.\n\n    In conclusion, P4HB is a novel candidate gene for OI. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation of c.692A>C (p.His231Pro) in exon 5 of P4HB in a mild OI pedigree for the first time. This mutation might induce OI by impairing the ability of PDI to combine with type I procollagen and leading to disorder of the type I collagen triple helix formation. Bisphosphonates were effective in this extremely rare type OI. Our findings expanded the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of OI.",

        "Title": "    Overexpression of DNA Polymerase Zeta Reduces the Mitochondrial Mutability Caused by Pathological Mutations in DNA Polymerase Gamma in Yeast",
        "Abstract": "    In yeast, DNA polymerase zeta (Rev3 and Rev7) and Rev1, involved in the error-prone translesion synthesis during replication of nuclear DNA, localize also in mitochondria. We show that overexpression of Rev3 reduced the mtDNA extended mutability caused by a subclass of pathological mutations in Mip1, the yeast mitochondrial DNA polymerase orthologous to human Pol gamma. This beneficial effect was synergistic with the effect achieved by increasing the dNTPs pools. Since overexpression of Rev3 is detrimental for nuclear DNA mutability, we constructed a mutant Rev3 isoform unable to migrate into the nucleus: its overexpression reduced mtDNA mutability without increasing the nuclear one.",
        "Introduction": "    In yeast, DNA polymerase zeta (Pol zeta) and Rev1 are involved in the error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) during replication of nuclear DNA: mutations in any of these polymerases lead to a decrease of mutagenesis in nuclear genome either in normal conditions or in conditions known to increase DNA damage such as UV treatment. The yeast Pol zeta is composed by a catalytic subunit encoded by REV3 and an accessory subunit encoded by REV7. Biochemically, Pol zeta is a poorly processive enzyme, lacks of a 3'-5' exonucleolytic proofreading activity and is able to extend terminally mismatched primers. From these properties derives its propensity to generate mutations. On the contrary, Pol zeta is very inefficient in inserting nucleotides opposite lesions in vitro, suggesting that a distinct polymerase should act in this first step and that Pol zeta can efficiently extend from primer-terminal base pairs containing mismatches or lesions.\n\n    Rev1 encodes for a deoxycytidyl transferase that preferentially incorporates C opposite to an abasic site. Also, Rev1 interacts in vitro with Pol zeta through a Rev3-Rev1 binding and this interaction strongly stimulates the activity of Pol zeta and, probably, contributes to its targeting to the replication fork.\n\n    Recently, it was found that Pol zeta and Rev1 localize in mitochondria and that they participate in the mitochondrial DNA mutagenesis, since disruption of REV3, REV7 or REV1 resulted in a strongly decreased frequency of -1 frameshift mutations in mtDNA. On the contrary, it was shown that deletion of REV3, REV7 or REV1 resulted in increased frequencies of both spontaneous and UV-induced mitochondrial erythromycin resistance, due to base substitutions. On the basis of their results, these authors speculated that, in absence of the TLS by Rev1 and/or Pol zeta, the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Pol gamma), the mitochondrial replicase, could create mutations in efforts to bypass lesions that block the replication fork. As a consequence, Pol zeta and Rev1, which in the nucleus are responsible with other DNA polymerases for the error-prone bypass of DNA lesions, in the mitochondrial compartment function in a less mutagenic pathway.\n\n    Pol gamma is a protein conserved in fungi and animals. Structurally, human Pol gamma is a heterotrimer composed by one catalytic subunit, encoded by POLG, and two accessory subunits, encoded by POLG2 . The catalytic subunit contains an N-terminal 3'-5' exonuclease domain (residues 170-440), a C-terminal polymerase domain (residues 440-475 and 785-1239) and a spacer region encompassing residues 475-785. To date, more than 150 pathological mutations in POLG have been identified in severe mitochondrial disorders (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg/) and, among them, a few mutations have been recently described in stavudine induced toxicity, in valproate induced hepatotoxicity and in breast tumorigenesis. This places POLG as a major locus for mitochondrial diseases and disorders.\n\n    In yeast the DNA polymerase gamma, encoded by MIP1 gene, is composed by a sole catalytic subunit. Thanks to the similarity between human Pol gamma and Mip1 (approximately 43%), yeast has been used to validate the role of human putative pathological mutations, to understand the biochemical consequences associated to these mutations, to study the pharmacogenetics of drugs such as valproate and stavudine, and to find mechanisms able to rescue the detrimental effects of Mip1 mutations. Since a therapy has not been yet developed for mitochondrial diseases caused by POLG mutations, a major goal of the research involving yeast/animal models is to find new strategies to rescue the pathological phenotypes associated to these mutations.\n\n    Yeast is a suitable model organism to study the effects of nuclear mutations affecting mtDNA stability, thanks to its ability to survive in absence of a functional mitochondrial genome and to the possibility to easily analyze mtDNA mutability. Yeast cells containing deletions-carrying mtDNA, called rho-, or cells which have completely lost mtDNA, called rho0, are respiratory deficient and produce colony of small size, called petite. rho- cells, which arise more frequently than rho0 cells, retain only small fragments of wt mtDNA, from 30% to less than 1% (reviewed in). Although the mechanisms thanks to which rho- mutations arise are not fully know, analysis of the regions flanking the deleted regions suggest that mtDNA of some of these rho- cells derives from recombination between direct repeats flanking the deleted region with consequent excision. In addition, deletions do not occur randomly at all. As a matter of fact, some fragments, encompassing COB, COX2 and COX3 genes, are most frequently retained. These large deletions make mtDNA irreversibly unfunctional. In S. cerevisiae, petite mutants arise spontaneously with high frequency (approximately 10-2). The frequency of petite mutants is a measure of mtDNA extended mutability and is an index of mtDNA instability. Extended mutability is indeed a series of large deletions (generally >70%) that arise spontaneously, and partially randomly, in the mtDNA, without involvement of point mutations. Mutations in a large group of nuclear genes, encoding for proteins directly or indirectly involved in mtDNA replication, recombination, stability and maintenance (reviewed in) produce increase of petite mutability. mtDNA point mutations can be also easily measured as frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to erythromycin (EryR mutants), an antibiotic that inhibits mitochondrial but not cytoplasmic translation. In fact, resistance to erythromycin is acquired through specific transversions or transitions in the mitochondrial gene encoding the 21 S rRNA, in particular at 1950, 1951, 1952 and 3993 positions. EryR mutants arise spontaneously approximately at a frequency of 10-7-10-8. EryR mutability is influenced by replication fidelity of DNA polymerase gamma as well as by the activity of some enzymes involved in mtDNA repair and/or recombination.\n\n    In an attempt to investigate about genetic conditions that might reduce the damages caused by mutations in POLG, we analyzed the effect of deletion or overexpression of TLS polymerases that, together with DNA polymerase gamma, are present in mitochondria, Pol zeta (Rev3-Rev7) and Rev1. Genetic tests based on gene overexpression are widely used in yeast to assess a role of a gene function in a biological process. Several researches are reported where one or more proteins were overexpressed with this aim, among which a study showing that overexpression of Rev3 led to increasing UV-induced mutagenesis. In addition, gene overexpression is commonly used to rescue the phenotypic defects caused by mutations in another gene which is functionally associated. For example, in the case of MIP1, overexpression of RNR1, encoding the large subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase, lead to the discovery that increased levels of dNTP pools reduced the extended mutability caused by mutations in Mip1. This finding has had impacted also in studies on human DNA polymerase gamma pathological mutations, where, starting from analysis in yeast, it has been shown that human DNA polymerase gamma harboring the pathological mutation H932Y has a ~200-fold reduced affinity to the incoming dNTPs.\n\n    Here we found that increased expression of Pol zeta resulted in a significant reduction of extended mutability caused by mutations mapping in different domains of MIP1 and that overexpression of both Pol zeta and Rev1 led to a reduction in mtDNA point mutability.",

YP medium contained 1% yeast extract (Formedium) and 2% peptone (Formedium), and YPA medium was YP supplemented with 40 mg/ml adenine base (Formedium). Carbon sources were added as indicated in the text. YPAEG-Ery contained 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco), 40 mg/l adenine base, 25 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.5, 3% ethanol, 3% glycerol and 3 g/l erythromycin (Sigma). CAN plates was SD medium supplemented with 0.006% L-canavanine sulfate (Sigma), amino acids and bases necessary to complement the auxotrophy and 2% glucose.\n\n    The DNA constructions produced in this work were obtained using plasmids pFL38, which is centromeric and brings the URA3 marker, pFL39 (centromeric, TRP1 marker), YEplac195 (multicopy, URA3 marker), YEplac181 (multicopy, LEU2 marker), pUG35 (centromeric, URA3 marker, for EGFP fusion) (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/yeast/info/tools/hegemann/gfp.html), pTL85 (multicopy, KanMX4 marker, for EGFP fusion) and pAG32, an integrative plasmid used as template for gene disruption with the HphMX4 cassette.\n\n    Plasmids pFL38-MIP1 and pFL39 harboring wt or mutant mip1 alleles have been previously described. YEplac195-REV3 was obtained by PCR-amplification of REV3, including the upstream and the downstream regions, from genomic DNA of strain DWM-5A with primers REV3-Fw (gcgcgggtaccggatccaagaatccctgtgg) and REV3-Rv (gcgccgaattccttagaggatacgaagattcc), digestion with KpnI and EcoRI of both the PCR fragment and YEplac195 and ligation. YEplac195-REV7 was obtained by PCR-amplification of REV7 from genomic DNA of strain DWM-5A with primers REV7-Fw (gcgccgtcgacgatgaatgggaaaagaagtgc) and REV7-Rv (gcgcgggtacccatggaaccagacagaagacc), digestion of both the PCR fragment and YEplac195 with SalI and KpnI and ligation. YEplac195-REV3/REV7 was obtained by subcloning REV7 from YEplac195-REV7 to YEplac195-REV3 digested with SalI and KpnI. YEplac181-REV1 was obtained by PCR amplification of REV1 from genomic DNA of strain BY4742 with primers REV1-Fw (cggcgggtcgacgtgaagtgatcatgcacatcg) and REV1-Rv (cggccggtacccttacgcatttctactgttgg), digestion of both the PCR fragment and YEplac181 with SalI and KpnI and ligation. pUG35-REV3 was obtained by PCR amplification of REV3 ORF from genomic DNA of strain DWM-5A with primers REV3GFPFw (ccgccgaattcatgtcgagggagtcgaacgacac) and REV3GFPRv (ccgccgtcgacccaatcatttagagatattaatgc), digestion of both the PCR fragment and pUG35 with EcoRI and SalI and ligation in order to clone REV3 in frame with the EGFP gene. pTL85-REV3 was obtained by subcloning REV3 from pUG35-REV3 to pTL85 digested with XbaI and SalI. The REV3 DNA region corresponding to the amino acid stretch 1 to 534 was cloned in frame with the EGFP gene of pUG35 by amplification of the fragment from genomic DNA of strain BY4742 with primers REV3GFPFw and R3GFPRvS (ggcccgtcgaccagaatatcttgataaccg) and cloning it between the EcoRI and SalI sites. All the cloned fragments were sequenced to check for the absence of mutations.\n\n    505-508 RKRKK stretch of Rev3 was mutagenized to AAAAA through the overlap extension technique. In the first set of PCR reactions, the REV3 fragment encoding for the 1-534 Rev3 stretch was amplified with i) the primer REV3GFPFw and the mutagenic primer REV3NONSRV (cgtaatcccgcagccataaccGCcGCtGCgGCcGCagacagcaacgatgttttattagc), and ii) the mutagenic primer REV3NONSFW, complementary to REV3NONSRV, and the R3GFPRVS primer. The final mutagenized product was obtained by using the overlapping PCR fragments as template and REV3NONSFW and R3GFPRVS as external primers. The product was then digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned in EcoRI-SalI digested pUG35.\n\n    To mutagenize YEPlac195-REV3, a fragment of REV3 was amplified with the primer REV3MUTFW (cattgagacaccaaagatgtgc) and with the mutagenic primer REV3NONSRV, and with the mutagenic primer REV3NONSFW and the primer REV3MUTRV (cagaatggaaatctattcctatc). The final product was obtained as above and was cloned in NgoMIV-SacI digested YEplac195-REV3. The entire cloned fragment was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations.\n\n    REV3 was disrupted in strain DWM-5A by using the HphMX4 cassette amplified from plasmid pAG32 by using primers DELREV3FW (gttcataaaacgctggaagtaaaaattagggcatcctttaaaaggCCTTGACAGTCTTGACGTGC) and DELREV3RV (aagtaatcgaatacatttttcaataatcttctgctgggctgggatCGCACTTAACTTCGCATCTG), each of which contains a 5' stretch complementary to a sequence internal to REV3 ORF and a 3' stretch, in uppercase, complementary to the extremities of the HphMX4 cassette. Disruptants were as resistant to 250 microg/ml hygromycin B. Correct disruption was confirmed by PCR.\n\n    REV7 and REV1 were disrupted in strain DWM-5A9 by using the KanMX4 cassette. The disrupted rev7::KanR and rev1::KanR loci were amplified from strain BY4742 rev7Delta and BY4742 rev1Delta, respectively, by using primers external to the loci: REV7-Fw and REV7-Rv, or REV1-Fw and REV1-Rv. Disruptants were selected on YP supplemented with 200 microg/ml geneticin and disruption was confirmed by PCR.\n\n    Yeast strains were transformed by lithium acetate methods. We used the \"Quick and easy method\" (http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gietz/Quick.html) in case of transformation with centromeric or episomal (multicopy) plasmids, and the \"Best Method\" (http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gietz/method.html) in case of disruption cassettes.\n\n    Petite frequency was determined as previously reported. To determine the effect of antioxidant agents on the extended mtDNA mutability, wild-type and mutant strains, were grown on liquid SCD medium supplemented with 40 microM dihydrolipoic acid (Sigma) or 10 microM MitoQ (a kind gift from Luigi Palmieri, University of Bari, Italy) for two 24-hour growth cycles. Dihydrolipoic acid was supplemented from a 40 mM stock solution in ethanol, while MitoQ was supplemented from a 5 mM stock solution in DMSO. Control experiment in which equal amounts of ethanol (0.1%) or DMSO (0.2%) were added to untreated cells was done in parallel. For each strain/condition at least three independent experiments were performed on three independent clones. Statistical analysis of petite frequency was performed by a two-tailed t-test.\n\n    EryR mutant frequency was determined as previously reported. Briefly, 15 independent colonies, isolated on SC medium supplemented with 2% glucose, were inoculated into 2 ml of SC liquid medium supplemented with 2% ethanol and grown to saturation (approximately 48 h). Cultures were then plated on YPAEG-Ery medium and dilutions were plated nonselectively on YP medium supplemented with 3% glycerol (300-500 colonies) for a total cell count. After 7 days incubation, EryR mutant frequency was determined by the method of the median. Each experiment was repeated at least three times on two independent clones for each strain. Statistical analysis of EryR mutant frequency was performed by a one-tailed t-test.\n\n    Nuclear point mutability was evaluated by measuring the mutation rate of CanR mutants in strain W303-1A CANS, bearing the wt copy of CAN1, as previously reported, except that colonies were grown on SC medium supplemented with 2% glucose. Mutation rates were calculated using median values according to Lea and Coulson by using the program FALCOR. Rates are given as mean of four independent experiments in each of which 10 independent colonies for each clone were tested. Unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to evaluate the statistical significance.\n\n    In every test, frequencies or rates were considered significantly different when p<0.05.\n\n    Total RNA was extracted from 10 ml of culture at a concentration of 1 OD600/ml, according to. For Northern blot analysis, 25 microg of RNA were blotted according to. The probes for hybridization were obtained by purifying the 1 Kb EcoRV fragment of REV3 and by amplifying REV7 with primers REV7N-Fw (gggtagagaagtggctgagg) and REV7N-Rv (ctcgccctcttcatattgag). Probes were labeled using [alpha-32P]dCTP and the kit 'Rediprime II DNA Labelling System' (GE Healthcare). Signals were acquired after different time exposures with Kodak films or with PhosphorImager and quantified by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).\n\n    For RT-PCR, 1.5 microg of RNA were treated with DNase (Invitrogen), precipitated and converted to cDNA with ProtoScript  M-MuLV First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) by using oligod(T). Semiquantitative PCR was performed by amplifying a fragment of REV1 cDNA with primers REV1rtFW (gtatattccagccgatcaaattcc) and REV1rtRV (cgtttggaagcctgaatgatcc) and, as control, a fragment of TAF10 DNA with primers FWTAF10 (atattccaggatcaggtcttccgtagc) and RVTAF10 (gtagtcttctcattctgttgatgttgttgttg). PCR samples were taken after 20, 23, 26, 29, 32 and 35 cycles, and aliquots of equal volume was loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel. Images were acquired by Kodak Digital Science D120 zoom digital camera, converted to gray scale with Photoshop; signals were quantified through Multianalyst software (Molecular Dynamics). To avoid saturation, signals were considered only if the signal deriving from the PCR amplification with 3-cycle less was 6-8-fold lower. Both in the case of Northern analysis and in the case of RT-PCR, relative levels of mRNA were quantified by comparison with a house-keeping gene signal (ACT1 or TAF10). All experiments were performed three times.\n\n    Cells were grown in solid SC medium without methionine and supplemented with 2% glucose. After 24 hours, cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.5, incubated with 1 microg/ml DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 15 min on ice and observed with a 100x magnification using DAPI or FITC filters. Pictures were taken with constant parameters (100 ms exposure for DAPI and 250-500 ms exposure for GFP with Nikon ACT-1 acquisition software) and processed to optimize contrast and brightness with Adobe Photoshop 7.0.",
        "Results": "    We have previously constructed a set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mip1 mutant alleles, corresponding to POLG pathological mutations, and determined their effects on mtDNA extended and point mutability (Table 1). These mutant alleles localized in different Mip1 domains, displayed different in vivo and in vitro defects and behaved either as dominant or recessive (Table 1 and Figure 1).We analyzed the effect of overexpression and deletion of Pol zeta and Rev1 on the mtDNA mutability induced by these mip1 mutations, based on the recent finding that these polymerases were found in mitochondria, where Pol zeta and Mip1 belong to the same epistatic pathway.\n\n    REV3 and REV7 were cloned in the multicopy plasmid YEplac195 and introduced i) in the strain DWM-5A (mip1Delta) transformed with a number of recessive mip1 mutant alleles (haploid condition) and ii) in the strain W303-1B (MIP1) transformed with dominant mip1 mutant alleles (heteroallelic condition). Extended mtDNA mutability was first determined in these transformants by analyzing the frequency of spontaneous petite mutants.\n\n    In presence of overexpressed REV3, the level of petite mutants decreased; the rescue was mutation specific, being null for some mutations and significant for other ones (Figure 2). The strongest effect was observed for haploid strains bearing mutations G807R (50% reduction) and A692T (25% reduction). The REV7 overexpression, on the contrary, had slighter effects, which however were significant for mutations A692T and G807R (Figure 2A). In heteroallelic strains harboring wt MIP1 and dominant mip1E698G, mip1K749R or mip1Y757C mutant alleles (Figure 2B) no rescue was observed in the presence of either REV3 or REV7.\n\n    We also evaluated the combined effects of REV3 and REV7 overexpression by cloning the two genes together in the YEplac195 plasmid. Northern blot analysis indicated that REV3 and REV7 were expressed at high level (10-12 fold increase of mRNA levels) when cloned either alone or together, demonstrating that their concomitant presence in the plasmid did not affect the level of their expression (Figure 3A). Overexpression of whole Pol zeta had the same effect than overexpression of Rev3 (Figure 2), suggesting that Rev3 alone was responsible of the observed rescue or that the physiological levels of Rev7, which is more abundant than Rev3, were sufficient to ensure the highest level of rescue. However the slight decrease in petite frequency obtained overexpressing Rev7 alone suggests, as demonstrated below, that also Rev7 participates to the rescue and that the petite mutants' reduction observed is most likely due to a slight increase of the whole Pol zeta.\n\n    We next investigated the effect of REV3 deletion on mtDNA stability. No difference was observed between REV3 and rev3Delta regarding the frequency of petite mutants in strains harboring either wt MIP1 allele or mutant mip1 alleles, indicating that the REV3 deletion produced no effect on extended mutability (data not shown).\n\n    However, deletion of REV3 resulted in alteration of mtDNA point mutation, with 2.5 fold increase of EryR mutant frequency in the MIP1 wt strain, in agreement with results reported by Kalifa and Sia (Table 2). In addition, strains carrying mip1C261R, mip1A692T and mip1G807R mutant alleles showed a further increase of EryR mutation (an increase of 3.9-, 3.3- and 5.1-fold, respectively) (Table 2), indicating that mutations in MIP1 and deletion of REV3 have a synergistic effect in rising point mutability. Furthermore, the ratios of EryR mutant frequencies of rev3Delta strains to REV3 wt strains parallelized the mutator phenotype of the mip1 mutant allele, being the lowest in mip1A692 T strain showing a moderate increase of EryR frequency compared to wt MIP1 strain (approximately 3.4-fold), and being the highest in the strain mip1G807R showing an increase of 8.8 times the EryR frequency of MIP1 strain (Table 2). Therefore, Pol zeta is not physiologically involved in the maintenance of full mtDNA but is required for the fidelity of the mtDNA replication.\n\n    Rev3 subunit of Pol zeta binds to Rev1, and the complex Pol zeta-Rev1 increases the efficiency of translesion synthesis by Pol zeta. We tested whether overexpression of REV1, together with overexpression of Pol zeta, could further reduce the petite frequency due to mip1C261R, mip1A692T and mip1G807R mutant alleles. REV1 was cloned in the multicopy plasmid YEplac181 and introduced in strains overexpressing both REV3 and REV7 and carrying wt MIP1, mip1C261R, mip1A692T and mip1G807R mutant alleles. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that REV1 was 9-13-fold overexpressed in transformant cells (Figure 3B) and that REV3 and REV7 were overexpressed at the same levels (10-12 fold overexpression) as in strain not harboring YEplac181-REV1 (data not shown). Together with REV1, we overexpressed both REV3 and REV7, and not REV3 alone, because it is known that Rev1 can recruit Rev7 through a Rev3 independent Rev1-Rev7 binding thus depleting the levels of Rev7. REV1 overexpression did not alter the frequency of petite, both in presence and absence of overexpressed Pol zeta (Figure 4). This result indicates that either the physiological levels of REV1 are sufficient for the rescue by Pol zeta overexpressed or that Rev1 is not involved. Moreover, we observed that overexpression of both Pol zeta and Rev1, but not of either Pol zeta or Rev1 individually, resulted in a significant reduction of the EryR mutant frequency, in particular for the strain carrying the mutation G807R (Table 3). The results described here are symmetrical to those obtained previously by Kalifa and Sia, who showed an increase in EryR mutant frequency when REV1, REV3 or REV7 were disrupted\n\n    We tested whether the rescue by Rev3 overexpression was dependent on the physiological levels of Rev7 and Rev1. The deletion of REV1 or REV7 had no effect on petite mutability (data not shown). However, the rescue of petite mutability in MIP1 mutants, exerted by overexpressed Rev3, occurred only when Rev7 was present (Table 4), indicating that the whole Pol zeta participated in the rescue. We furthermore observed that overexpression of REV7 in a rev3Delta strain did not reduce petite frequency both in wt MIP1 and in mip1 mutant strains (data not shown), corroborating this hypothesis. Unlike Rev7, Rev1 was dispensable (Table 4), thus supporting the hypothesis reported in the previous paragraph that Rev1 did not participate in the rescue of the extended mutability.\n\n    We have shown previously that a decrease of reactive oxygen species and/or an increase of the mitochondrial dNTP pool reduced the mtDNA extended mutagenesis induced by pathological Pol gamma mutations in yeast. Several mutations in MIP1, but not all, were rescued, albeit at different extent, by treatment with dihydrolipoic acid or with the mitochondrial specific ROS scavenger MitoQ. To know whether this effect could be increased by REV3 overexpression the petite frequency was measured either in haploid (Figure 5A) or in heteroallelic strains (Figure 5B) treated with these molecules. We found that there was a negative correlation between the rescue exerted by ROS scavengers and the rescue caused by REV3 overexpression (Figure 2 and Figure 5).\n\n    In fact, in haploid strains harboring A692T and G807R mutations, whose effect was reduced by overexpression of Rev3, no rescue was exerted by dihydrolipoic acid or MitoQ. In contrast, ROS scavengers strongly mitigated the effect of mip1 mutations E698G, K749R, Y757C, that are insensitive to Rev3 overexpression.\n\n    The only exception was mutation C261R, whose effect was slightly rescued both by treatment with ROS scavengers and by Rev3 overexpression (Fig. 2A and Fig. 5A). In this case, the additive effect of Pol zeta overexpression and ROS scavengers (data not shown) suggested that two different mechanisms were involved in the reduction of petite mutability observed.\n\n    The second mechanism able to rescue the mip1 induced mtDNA extended mutability is the increase of the dNTP pools. In S. cerevisiae an increase of the dNTP pool was obtained either by overexpressing RNR1 gene, which encodes the large subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase or by deleting SML1 gene, which encodes an inhibitor of the latter activity. It has been shown that overexpression of RNR1 or deletion of SML1, reduced the petite frequency in strains harboring specific MIP1 mutations.\n\n    To evaluate the relationship between the rescue exerted by REV3 overexpression and the rescue exerted by increasing the dNTP pools, we deleted SML1 in strains harboring mip1C261R, mip1A692T and mip1G807R mutant alleles, in presence of overexpressed REV3. We observed that, for every mutation studied, the two processes act synergistically (Figure 6). For example, in strain carrying mip1A692T mutant allele the overexpression of REV3 reduced the petite frequency of approximately 1.3-fold, while deletion of SML1 reduced the petite frequency of 4.4 fold: together, the reduction was 9.1-fold. The synergistic effects were even stronger in the case of strain harboring mip1G807R mutation (1.9-fold when REV3 was overexpressed, 4.1-fold when SML1 was deleted, 15.7-fold together). It is likely that the observed synergy is due to an increase of dNTP pools, which are the substrate for both Mip1 and Pol zeta.\n\n    It was previously shown that in UV-treated cells, enhanced expression of REV3 led to increase of nuclear point mutability, measured as increase in the rate of arg4-17 reversion. Pol zeta mutagenic function is dependent on Rev1 protein. We measured nuclear mutability in cells transformed with REV3 and/or REV1 overexpressing plasmids to determine whether increased levels of Pol zeta/Rev1 exerted mutagenic effect as a consequence of a general mechanism associated to the translesion bypass. The overexpression of Rev3 or Rev1 caused an approximately two-fold increase of nuclear point mutability, measured as rate of CanR mutants. When both Pol zeta and Rev1 were overexpressed, the rate of CanR mutations increased approximately 3-fold (Figure 7). Thus, overexpression of Pol zeta is useful to reduce the mtDNA instability caused by specific mutations in MIP1 but is detrimental to spontaneous nuclear mutability.\n\n    A Rev3 mutant which could enter into mitochondria, but not in the nucleus is expected to reduce the mitochondrial mutability without increasing nuclear mutability. To this end, we thought of designing a REV3 gene whose product could not enter the nucleus. We searched inside Rev3 for the potential nuclear localization signal, by using the PredictNLS server (http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/services/predictNLS/). Rev3 protein is predicted to possess a unique bipartite nuclear localization signal encompassing amino acids 487-508 (Figure 8). Both upstream and downstream basic amino acid stretches composing the bipartite signal are critical for nuclear import.\n\n    To evaluate the localization of Rev3, we first cloned the whole coding sequence either in a centromeric plasmid or in a multicopy plasmid in frame with the EGFP gene. In both cases no GFP signal was detected in transformant cells, as it was found previously in high throughput analysis. To overcome this problem, a shorter Rev3 fragment encompassing residues 1-534, which include the bipartite signal, was cloned in frame with EGFP. In this case, in transformant cells we observed a fluorescent signal corresponding to Rev3, localized in the nucleus. This was confirmed by DAPI staining of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Figure 6). Both in rho+ strain, where DAPI stained both mtDNA and nuclear DNA, and in the rho0, where DAPI stained only nuclear DNA, the GFP signal co-localized with the nuclear DAPI signal.\n\n    To obtain a version of Rev3 unable to migrate in the nucleus, we changed the 504-508 RKRKK downstream stretch to AAAAA (Figure 8). When Rev3 fragment encompassing amino acid 1-534 and harboring the 504-508 AAAAA stretch was fused with EGFP, the fluorescent signal corresponding to the fusion protein localized in the cytoplasm only (Figure 9). The AAAAA mutation was then introduced in the full REV3 gene, cloned in the multicopy plasmid YEplac195 and its effect was evaluated in strains harboring mip1A692T or mip1G807R. In the presence of overexpressed mutant Rev3, the mtDNA extended mutability decreased at the same extent as achieved in the presence of overexpressed wild type Rev3, indicating that the alteration of the nuclear signal did not affect the ability of Rev3 of operating in mitochondria (Table 5). If the mutated version of the enzyme did not enter the nucleus, then it was expected that its overexpression did not cause an increase in nuclear mutability. Indeed, in the presence of overexpressed mutant Rev3 the nuclear point mutability, measured as rate of CanR mutants accumulation, did not increase (Figure 7).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this study we showed that increased levels of Rev3, encoding the catalytic subunit of Pol zeta, reduces both the mtDNA extended mutability and the point mutability caused by specific mutations in Mip1, the S. cerevisiae mtDNA polymerase. The rescue of mtDNA extended mutability requires overexpression of the catalytic subunit Rev3, but not that of the accessory subunit encoded by REV7. However, a basal level of Rev7, which is known to be expressed more than Rev3, is necessary, because in a rev7Delta strain the rescue does not occur.\n\n    Rev1, which interacts with Pol zeta for efficient bypass and extension past the DNA lesion, is not required to rescue mtDNA extended mutability, suggesting that Pol zeta can function independently of Rev1 in mitochondrion. In contrast, Rev1 overexpression is necessary for the rescue of point mutability mediated by Rev3. These observations suggest that the rescues mediated by Rev3 overexpression are driven by two different mechanisms: i. the rescue of mtDNA extended mutability involving only Pol zeta and ii. the rescue of mtDNA point mutability for which both Pol zeta and Rev1 are required. These results are consistent with previous findings which indicate that the instability of mitochondrial DNA in general is caused by mechanisms different from those producing single point mutations.\n\n    Deletion of REV3 did not influence the mtDNA extended mutability (petite frequency), both in the wt strain and in mip1 mutant strains. In contrast, REV3 deletion caused an increase of point mutability. Therefore Pol zeta, in mitochondria, functions in a pathway less mutagenic than Mip1, supporting the hypothesis of Kalifa and Sia. Moreover, strains carrying mip1 mutant alleles were themselves mutators, i.e. showed an EryR mutant frequency higher than that of the wt strain. The observation that the higher the mtDNA point mutability of the mutant strain, the higher the effect of REV3 deletion, indicates that mutator Mip1 isoforms are more sensitive to the absence of Rev3 than the wild type one and is coherent with that hypothesis.\n\n    Until now, it has not been yet elucidated the physiological role of Pol zeta in mitochondria. Rev3, that is expressed at basal levels during the whole vegetative cell cycle and only moderately (~2-fold) overexpressed when cells are treated with UV, is expressed at levels comparable or higher (~18-fold) than those obtained in this study during the late phase of sporulation. Interestingly, maintenance of a full non-mutated mtDNA genome is fundamental in meiosis, since respiratory-deficient diploid strains are unable to sporulate or show increased levels of dead spores. A possible interpretation is that increased levels of Pol zeta could have importance in the maintenance of wt mtDNA during sporulation.\n\n    Regarding extended mutability, some MIP1 mutations equivalent to human pathological mutations were rescued by overexpression of Rev3 while others were not. Y757C, E698G and K749R, dominant mutations located in the polymerase domain, together with the recessive mutation in the exonuclease domain G259R, belong to this second group. These mutations are rescued by treatment with antioxidant molecules such as dihydrolipoic acid and MitoQ. Biochemical properties are available only for human Y955C mutation, equivalent to yeast Y757C, that strongly reduces the polymerase activity (<0.03% compared to the wild type), the processivity and the nucleotide binding affinity, but does not affect the DNA binding affinity. It was previously reported also that human Pol gamma harboring the Y955C mutation increases the in vitro incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP, the most abundant oxidized nucleotide in mitochondria, and the translesion synthesis opposite to an 8-oxo-dG residue. The last observation suggests that, although most of the mtDNA extended mutability by Y757C mutation is caused by stalled replication due to strongly reduced polymerase activity, the mtDNA damage can be partially induced also by the accumulation of oxidized bases. In addition, for heteroallelic strains containing dominant mutations, it is possible that replication stalling by mutant Mip1 itself causes oxidative damage on mtDNA, which can partially block replication by wt Mip1. Independently of the mechanisms, it is known that there is a correlation between mtDNA extended mutability and oxidative stress: petite frequency is higher in strains with a reduced antioxidant potential, in strains treated with hydrogen peroxide and in strains deleted both in MSH1 and in OGG1, encoding the mitochondrial glycosylase/lyase that specifically excises 8-oxo-dG residues in mtDNA.\n\n    Differently from Y757C, E698G, K749R and G259R, mutations C261R, R467W, A692T and G807R are rescued by Rev3 overexpression. These mutations are known to reduce the polymerase activity and/or the processivity of Mip1. Yeast C261, equivalent to human S305, is part of a loop-helix orienter module (amino acids 304-316) that creates steric constraints leading to a destabilization of the template strand and a modification in the arrangement of the primer strand: this subdomain in the 3'-5' exonuclease plays a crucial role in the DNA polymerase function with no major effect on the exonucleolytic activity. yG807, equivalent to hG1051, is part of a partitioning loop (amino acids 1050-1095) that modulates the partitioning of the primer strand between the polymerase and the exonuclease active sites by forming stable contacts with correctly base-paired primer-template DNA and destabilizing primer-template DNA that contains mispairs This subdomain is adjacent to the orienter module, whose role is to position correctly the partitioning loop. Mutations in the orienter loop and in the partitioning loop both result in reduced DNA-binding affinity, reduced polymerase activity, increased point mutability and increased extended mutability. yA692T, equivalent to hA889, is part of a beta-sheet which surrounds the catalytic residues in the palm. Mutations in this beta-sheet are predicted to reduce polymerase activity, and this effect was observed for A692T mutation in yeast. yR467, equivalent to hR574, is part of a subdomain responsible for the intrinsic processivity of Pol gamma. As a matter of fact, mutation yR467W results in a decreased processivity.\n\n    We showed that these recessive mutations with reduced polymerase activity or processivity are insensitive to antioxidants treatment. Thus, we speculate that different Pol gamma mutations exert their negative effect according to two distinct ways. The first one, rescued by the treatment with antioxidants, can be related to the increased incorporation of 8-oxo-dG: in presence of antioxidant molecules the concentration of oxidized nucleotides and, as a consequence, their incorporation in the mtDNA is reduced. The inability of Pol zeta to rescue these Mip1 mutations may depend partially on the low efficiency (approximately 12%) of Pol zeta to incorporate nucleosides opposite to 8-oxo-dG. The second way, rescued by Rev3 overexpression, could be related to reduced polymerase activity, processivity and/or TLS synthesis of mutated mtDNA polymerase as in the case of C261R, R467W, A692T and G807R mutations. Two modes of action may account for ability of Rev3 to rescue this kind of mip1 mutations. i) Pol zeta could participate directly to the replication of undamaged mtDNA at the replicative fork partially playing the role of Mip1, as it was recently demonstrated in the case of defective nuclear replisome due to mutations in the replicative polymerases. Interestingly, the rescue is observed for mutations which cause reduced DNA binding affinity (C261R) or for which reduced DNA binding affinity is predicted (R467W and G807R). ii) Alternately, Pol zeta could partially substitute mutant Mip1 defective of TLS, either during the incorporation opposite to a lesion or the extension from mismatched terminally nucleotides. Reports of translesion synthesis by Pol gamma are limited. In vitro studies showed that Pol gamma from higher eukaryotes is an enzyme with a low TLS activity: it can bypass 8-oxo-dG incorporating dCMP (~73%) or dAMP (~27%), but stalls the majority of the time opposite abasic sites and opposite adducts containing benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[c]phenantrene. Moreover, it has been recently reported that human Pol gamma barely bypasses cyclobutane T-T dimers incorporating dAMP (~80%) or dCTP (~20%), whereas it extends very inefficiently past the dimer. These observations suggest that DNA polymerase gamma can promote mutagenesis during TLS.\n\n    It is worthwhile mentioning that the Rev3 rescue was observed only in the absence of wt Mip1. It could be possible that in heteroallelic strains wt Mip1 out-competes even a 10-fold overexpression of Pol zeta for the stalled replication that is caused by mutant Mip1. As a consequence, putative beneficial effects of overexpression of Pol zeta in heteroallelic strain could be hidden by the presence of wt Mip1.\n\n    It has been demonstrated previously that mtDNA instability caused by specific mutations in MIP1 is reduced by increasing the dNTPs in the cell, either by overexpressing the RNR1 gene, which encodes the large subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase, or by deleting the SML1 gene, which encodes an inhibitor of the latter activity. Increased concentration of dNTPs is beneficial since the basal levels of mitochondrial dNTP pools are a limiting factor to maintain mtDNA copy number in yeast.\n\n    Here we describe that overexpression of Rev3 and increased activity of ribonucleotide reductase have a synergistic effect on reducing the frequency of petites. The synergistic effect is probably due to the fact that the activity of Pol zeta but also of Mip1 have improved with the increase of the dNTP pools, which are the substrate of both DNA polymerases. In addition, the REV3 overexpressing sml1Delta strains harboring mip1 mutations A692T and G807R reached petite frequency values which are slightly higher or similar, respectively, to those of wt strain, thus indicating that through genetic modifications it is possible to erase completely the detrimental effects of such mip1 mutations on extended mutability.\n\n    It is worth mentioning that the human Pol zeta protein does not localize to the mitochondria. From the data here described, we suggest that in mammalian cells carrying mutant Pol gamma a beneficial effect could be obtained by overexpressing the yeast Rev3 mutant isoform unable to enter the nucleus but capable of rescuing mtDNA mutability, or as an alternative a mitochondrial localizing version of human Rev3. It has been reported that expression of a yeast mitochondrial repair/recombination enzyme, Cce1, the cruciform-cutting endonuclease, in human cells harboring partially duplicated mtDNA induced the appearance of wt mtDNA, thus demonstrating that expression of a yeast protein could be beneficial for mtDNA stability in mammalian cells. Such a genetic rescue could be associated to a treatment with dNTPs, which seems to be beneficial for the detrimental effects caused by specific mutations in human POLG: the processivity defect of human DNA polymerase gamma harboring Y955C mutation was overcome by increasing the dATP or dTTP concentration during in vitro synthesis of mtDNA fragments and the treatment with dAMP and dGMP leads to a slight increase in the levels of mtDNA in myoblasts deriving from an Alpers' patient harboring mutations A467T and K1191N in POLG .\n\n    Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\n    Funding: This work was supported by the Fondazione Telethon-Italy [GGP07019], http://www.telethon.it/.

This autosomal recessive disorder has a broad spectrum of clinical forms, ranging from severe or classical, which includes the salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms, to the mild late onset or nonclassical form. Most of the disease-causing mutations described are likely to be the consequence of nonhomologous recombination or gene conversion events between the active CYP21A2 gene and its homologous CYP21A1P pseudogene. Nevertheless, an increasing number of naturally occurring mutations have been found. The change p.H62L is one of the most frequent rare mutations of the CYP21A2 gene. It was suggested that the p.H62L represents a mild mutation that may be responsible for a more severe enzymatic impairment when presented with another mild mutation on the same allele. In this report, a 20-year-old woman carrying an isolated p.H62L mutation in compound heterozygosity with c.283-13A/C>G mutation is described. Although a mildly nonclassical phenotype was expected, clinical signs and hormonal profile of the patient are consistent with a more severe simple virilizing form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

        "Introduction": "    Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (OMIM 201910) accounts for 90%-95% of CAH cases. This autosomal recessive disorder, which is the most frequent inborn error of metabolism, has a broad spectrum of clinical forms, ranging from severe or classical, which includes the salt-wasting (SW) and simple virilizing (SV) forms, to the mild late onset or nonclassical form of CAH (NCCAH).\n\n    The affected enzyme, P450C21, is encoded by the CYP21A2 gene, located together with a 98% nucleotide sequence identity CYP21A1P pseudogene, on chromosome 6p21.3. Due to the high degree of identity between this gene and its pseudogene, most of the disease-causing mutations described are likely to be the consequence of nonhomologous recombination or gene conversion events. In addition, more than 130 rare point mutations that arise independently of the pseudogene and that were found specific to a population or a single family, have been described to date (for details visit http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk). Most of the patients are compound heterozygotes and their phenotype depends on the underlying combination of mutations they have.\n\n    The change p.H62L is one of the most frequent rare mutations of the CYP21A2 gene. Based on patients' phenotypes and functional studies, it has been proposed that the p.H62L allele represents a mild mutation, which may be responsible for a more severe phenotype only when associated with another mild mutation on the same allele. Moreover, by in silico analyses using as a template the crystallized bovine CYP21 that shares 79% sequence identity with the human CYP21A2 protein, Haider et al. (2013) associate this mutation to the mild form of the disease.\n\n    Herein we describe a recently genotyped patient from our cohort carrying an isolated p.H62L mutation in one allele and the severe c.283-13A/C>G mutation in the other one. Although a mild NCCAH phenotype was expected, the patient presents a classical SV form of the disease.",

        "Discussion": "    The adrenocortical 21-hydroxylase is one of the key enzymes in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid biosynthesis. Mutations in the CYP21A2 gene have been reported in individuals affected with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. To date, a great number of different mutations in the CYP21A2 gene have been described. Because CAH is a recessive disorder and most of the 21-hydroxylase deficient patients are compound heterozygotes with different mutations in both alleles, their phenotype depends on the underlying combination of mutations they have. Even though most patients carry CYP21A1P-derived mutations, an increasing number of naturally occurring mutations have been found in disease-causing alleles in the last years.\n\n    The change p.H62L is one of the most frequent rare mutations of the CYP21A2 gene. To date, thirty-one 21-hydroxylase deficient patients have been reported carrying the non-derived-pseudogene p.H62L mutation. Most of them presented a second mutation on the same allele, while only twelve patients (7 of the Taiwanese population) from among all the reported in bibliography showed no additional mutations in cis.\n\n    By in silico analyses, a recent report predicts that the substitution of histidine by hydrophobic leucine may disrupt hydrogen bonding between H62 and G35 to reduce, but not eliminate, enzyme activity. While functional assays also suggested that p.H62L is a mild mutation, presence of another mutation on the same allele disclosed a synergistic effect in reducing enzyme activity.\n\n    We herein report a classical patient who presents an isolated p.H62L in one allele and the c.283-13A/C>G mutations in the other one. Unlike the mild phenotype found in those patients previously described with the isolated p.H62L mutation in compound heterozygosity with a severe one, clinical manifestations and hormonal profile of the patient herein described are consistent with a SV form of the disease. More severe clinical manifestations of the disease were found, by contrast, in those patients carrying p.H62L with another mild mutation on the same allele. Though the entire gene and promoter regions were sequenced in the DNA sample from the patient from our cohort, no additional mutations were found. No variations were either found when we analyzed, by direct sequencing, two previously described regulatory regions. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the patient reported in 2009 in Japan, who presented an isolated p.H62L in one allele and the severe cluster E6 (p.I236 M, p.V237 E, p.M239 K) mutation in the other one, disclosed an intermediate phenotype. She presented clitoral size at the upper limit for normal and 17-OHP levels between the SV and NCCAH forms.\n\n    Discordances between genotype and phenotype in 21-hydroxylase deficiency have already been described in previous reports. Indeed, a recent work by New et al. found a direct genotype-phenotype correlation in less than 50% of the genotypes studied. All these observations as a whole may suggest that despite mildly impaired enzymatic activity of the isolated p.H62L variable suggested by in vitro functional studies, presence of other genetic or environmental factors may contribute to modulate the activity of the enzyme in vivo.\n\n    The study of genotype-phenotype correlation in additional patients presenting this mutation would help in defining the role of this variable in disease manifestation. In the meantime, the possibility that p.H62L mutation by itself may be associated with a more severe clinical form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency should be considered.",

        "Title": "    Variations in the WDR36 gene in German patients with normal tension glaucoma",
        "Abstract": "    To determine the prevalence of WDR36 sequence variants in a cohort of German patients with normal tension glaucoma.\n\n    All of the 23 coding exons and flanking introns of the WDR36 gene were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and subjected to denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. Samples with aberrant profiles were sequenced. In addition, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed in order to identify previously described nucleotide changes.\n\n    This study identified 11 nucleotide changes in the WDR36 gene that lead to predicted amino acid substitutions. Previously reported disease-causing mutations were found in 4% of patients (4/112) whereas sequence variants previously classified as disease-susceptibility mutations were found in 5% of patients (6/112). One nonsynonymous nucleotide change that has not been reported before was found in one patient. Mutation screening also identified several exonic and intronic polymorphisms.\n\n    The findings in the current study indicate that WDR36 gene variants may be only rare causes of normal tension glaucoma in the German population.",
        "Introduction": "    The term glaucoma describes a heterogeneous group of optic neuropathies that lead to optic nerve atrophy and permanent loss of vision, affecting over 67 million subjects worldwide. Since glaucoma rates rise exponentially with age, more glaucoma cases are expected in the future as the western population gets older. The disease is insidious. Affected patients frequently have no symptoms, especially in the initial stages. When detected early, most cases can be successfully treated with medications, laser treatment, or surgery.\n\n    The hereditary forms of glaucoma are genetically heterogeneous. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) of adult onset is the most common form of glaucoma, representing approximately half of all cases. Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is an important subtype of POAG, accounting for approximately 20-50% of all POAG cases. Patients with NTG show intraocular pressures that are within the statistical normal range of the population (10-20 mmHg).\n\n    Despite the rather high prevalence and heritable nature of POAG, identification of causative genes has proven to be difficult. Though at least 20 loci have been linked to POAG, only two disease-causing genes for POAG have been identified until lately. A number of studies confirmed that about 4% of POAG cases show mutations in the MYOC gene. Although mutations in the optineurin gene (OPTN) were initially reported in 16.7% of families with hereditary POAG, several other studies have indicated that OPTN sequence variants are only a rare cause of POAG or NTG. Recently, a new locus for POAG (GLC1G) and the disease-causing gene (WDR36) have been identified by Monemi and coworkers. In their study, mutation analysis of WDR36 in 130 unrelated affected individuals revealed a total of 25 allelic variants. The function of WDR36 and its role in the normal ocular physiology and glaucoma is still unclear, but WDR36 has been identified as being involved in T cell activation.\n\n    The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of WDR36 sequence variants in a cohort of unrelated German patients with NTG.",
        "Methods": "    The study population comprised a cohort of 112 unrelated white patients with NTG that included 67 women and 45 men. Their age range was 14-84 years with a mean age of 62.3+-15.3. All study patients were part of a group of 289 patients that had been previously clinically investigated at the University Eye Hospital in Wuerzburg. Selected from this group for molecular genetic analysis were 112 patients who had been followed long-term.This was to ensure diagnosis of NTG with a maximum of certainty. Patients have been screened for MYOC and OPTN mutations in a previous study. Glaucoma was defined by the following strict criteria: (1) the presence of typical glaucomatous optic neuropathy with compatible visual field loss (according to Aulhorn classification); (2) open drainage angles on gonioscopy; and (3) absence of a secondary cause for glaucomatous optic neuropathy, such as a previously elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) after trauma, a period of steroid administration, or uveitis. Patients also did not have evidence of high myopia or congenital ocular abnormality, and had no other cause than glaucoma for disk changes and visual field loss. A neurological examination was performed in order to exclude an intracerebral expansion. Sonography was used to rule out aortic stenosis. Patients with untreated NTG had IOP measurements that were consistently 21 mmHg or lower on diurnal testing and during follow-up (IOP readings were correlated with corneal thickness). Disk size and parameters were evaluated by means of confocal examination (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph). Control DNA samples were obtained from 50 unrelated subjects of German descent who did not have a family history of glaucoma. Control individuals were age matched (mean age 60.5+-18.7) and were collected from the same geographic region as the probands. A diagnosis of glaucoma was ruled out based on IOP measurements and ophthalmoscopy of the optic disk. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the ethics committees of the University Hospital Tuebingen and the University Hospital Wuerzburg. It was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.\n\n    Patient DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using a standard salting-out procedure. Individual exons of the WDR36 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using appropriate amplification protocols. Primer pairs used for amplification are listed in Table 1. All amplicons containing the coding exons and neighboring intronic regions of WDR36 were screened for nucleotide changes with the WAVE denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography system (Transgenomic, Inc., Elancourt, France). The PCR products to be tested were mixed with an equimolar amount of a known unmutated PCR product to form heteroduplexes. Temperatures used for analysis are given in Table 2. The resulting DHPLC trace profiles were examined with the NavigatorTM software (Transgenomic, Inc.). The chromatographs were compared with the profile of wild-type DNA fragments. Samples with aberrant profiles were sequenced.\n\n    PCR fragments were purified by ExoSAP-IT treatment (USB, Cleveland, OH), sequenced using Big Dye Termination chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) and products separated on a DNA capillary sequencer (ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer).\n\n    A 361 bp PCR product encompassing exon 8 of the WDR36 gene was digested with 1 U HpyCH4III restriction enzyme (NEB, Beverly, MA). The N355S missense change resulted in the gain of an HpyCH4III restriction site that, upon cleavage of the amplicon, produced two DNA fragments of 251 bp and 110 bp.\n\n    A 450 bp PCR product encompassing exon 11 of the WDR36 gene was digested with 1 U TseI restriction enzyme (NEB). The A449T missense change resulted in the loss of a TseI restriction site. Wild-type sequences were cleaved into two fragments of 229 bp and 221 bp.\n\n    A 450 bp PCR product encompassing exon 13 of the WDR36 gene was digested with 1 U TaqI restriction enzyme (NEB). The R529Q missense change resulted in the loss of a TaqI restriction site. Wild-type sequences were cleaved into two fragments of 232 bp and 218 bp.\n\n    A 282 bp PCR product encompassing exon 17 of the WDR36 gene was digested with 1 U BglI restriction enzyme (NEB). The D658G missense change resulted in the gain of a BglI restriction site that, upon cleavage of the amplicon, produced two DNA fragments of 233 bp and 49 bp. Restriction digests were analyzed on a 4% agarose gel.",
        "Results": "    We screened the complete coding sequences plus flanking intron/UTR sequences of the WDR36 gene by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and subsequent sequencing in 112 patients with NTG. In addition, we performed RFLP analysis for four known sequence alterations that were judged in a previous study to be disease-causing mutations. Of those four, we were able to identify three by RFLP analysis as well as with DHPLC and subsequent sequencing, namely A449T (found in two subjects), R529Q (found in one subject), and D658G (found in one subject), respectively (Figure 1 and Table 3). We were not able to detect any of these changes in 50 controls using DHPLC and RFLP analysis.\n\n    DHPLC analysis and subsequent sequencing also identified four additional nonsynonymous nucleotide changes, namely P31T, D33E, A163V, and H212P which were not present in 50 controls. The latter three have already been described, whereas this is the first report of P31T.\n\n    DHPLC screening and subsequent sequencing also revealed several synonymous polymorphisms (Q197Q, K564K, V714V, V727V) as well as 11 intronic alterations (Table 3). Neither a deletion/insertion nor a sequence alteration close to splice donor/acceptor sites change was found.\n\n    Four patients harbored a potentially causative mutation in the OPTN gene or MYOC gene as was found in a previous study. These patients did not show sequence variants in the WDR36 gene.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study describes mutational screening in the WDR36 gene in a large cohort of German patients with the NTG subtype of POAG. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of previously described mutations classified as disease causing. Therefore, two different mutation-screening techniques (DHPLC and RFLP) were used to make sure that all four mutations (N355S, A449T, R529Q, and D658G) were detected.\n\n    None of our patients had the N355S mutation described by Monemi and coworkers. Instead, we identified one patient who harbored the R529Q mutation that has already been described in two independent studies. According to the prediction program PolyPhen, this particular change lies in a highly conserved region and possibly has a damaging effect (Table 3 and Figure 2). In addition, we identified two patients with NTG who carried the A449T sequence variant. This mutation is not part of a known protein motif. It was not conserved and is therefore benign according to the PolyPhen prediction. The D658G mutation noted in 3 out of 272 sporadic cases in the Monemi study was observed in one patient in the NTG group. In the former study this change was shown to be not present in 238 controls, whereas a case-control study on this particular variant in Australian patients demonstrated an equal distribution in both patients and controls. Although this mutation leads to a conservative exchange of two polar and acidic residues, PolyPhen predicts this change to be probably damaging due to the high conservation between species (Figure 2).\n\n    In addition to the aforedescribed disease-causing mutations, we were able to identify sequence variants previously classified as disease-susceptibility mutations, namely D33E, A163V, and H212P. We also noted one nonsynonymous nucleotide change (P31E) that has not been reported before. It was found in one patient in the NTG group and was not present in the control population. As the proline residue is not conserved between species (data not shown) and is not located in any known protein motif of WDR36, this change is probably benign.\n\n    Although our patient and control cohort numbers were too small for a statistical analysis to determine whether the sequence variants we identified might be related to the disease, our results indicate that sequence variants of the WDR36 gene already described to be disease-causing are only rare causes of unrelated NTG in the German population.\n\n    Apart from the findings of our study concerning WDR36 sequence variants, we observed that the results of the DHPLC screening in those exons that harbored already described mutations were consistent with the results of RFLP analysis (Figure 1). In addition, we identified several exonic and intronic polymorphisms by using DHPLC and subsequent sequencing. Therefore we reason that screening of the WDR36 gene with DHPLC gives rather reliable results compared with the hands-on time. Direct sequencing still represents the gold standard in mutation screening, and other screening mechanisms, such as DHPLC, are not as sensitive. Nevertheless, we are convinced that our screening procedure using DHPLC and RFLP gave comparable good detection rates. From our study it seems likely that DHPLC gives false positive results rather than false negative ones. Yet, we have to consider that we may have missed some nucleotide changes that could be associated with the NTG phenotype in our patients. In addition, as we only screened for mutations in exonic and flanking intron sequences, it is possible that a proportion of our patients carry mutations in the promoter region or in other regulatory sequences of WDR36. Screening with either DHPLC or direct sequencing does not reveal gross insertions or deletions that may be responsible for the phenotype.\n\n    Our study indicates that WDR36 sequence variants are only rare causes of unrelated NTG in the German population. In a previous study, we showed this also holds true for the other two POAG-associated genes MYOC and OPTN. As early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment of glaucoma, defining the genetic basis of hereditary forms of glaucoma is an important step towards a presymptomatic screening of people at risk. However, a routine genetic testing for the three known POAG-associated genes seems to be of limited value due to the low prevalence of disease-causing mutations.\n\n    A considerable number of studies dealing with the genetics of glaucoma have shown that only a small proportion of glaucoma cases are due to monogenic forms. The vast majority of cases are inherited as a complex trait. Therefore, genome-wide association studies might be a better strategy to use in defining genetic profiles for those at risk for developing glaucoma.",

        "Title": "    Mutations in the EXT1 and EXT2 genes in Spanish patients with multiple osteochondromas",
        "Abstract": "    Multiple osteochondromas is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by the formation of multiple cartilage-capped tumours. Two causal genes have been identified, EXT1 and EXT2, which account for 65% and 30% of cases, respectively. We have undertaken a mutation analysis of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes in 39 unrelated Spanish patients, most of them with moderate phenotype, and looked for genotype-phenotype correlations. We found the mutant allele in 37 patients, 29 in EXT1 and 8 in EXT2. Five of the EXT1 mutations were deletions identified by MLPA. Two cases of mosaicism were documented. We detected a lower number of exostoses in patients with missense mutation versus other kinds of mutations. In conclusion, we found a mutation in EXT1 or in EXT2 in 95% of the Spanish patients. Eighteen of the mutations were novel.",
        "Introduction": "    Multiple osteochondromas (MO, MIM#133700, #133701), also known as multiple hereditary exostoses, is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by the formation of multiple cartilage-capped tumours (exostoses or osteochondromas). The prevalence of MO is estimated at 1/50,000 in the Western population. Osteochondromas are the result of excessive chondrocyte proliferation and bone growth at the juxtaepiphyseal regions of long bones and are the most common benign bone tumour. MO is characterized by an important inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability, including variations in the number and size of osteochondromas and in the number and location of bones involved. Secondary complications are heterogeneous too, and may consist of deformities, functional limitations, compression of nerves and blood vessels, pain caused by pressure on neighbouring tissues and short stature. The most serious secondary complication is the malignant transformation toward a secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, occurring in 0.5-5% of patients.\n\n    MO is a genetically heterogeneous disease. In almost 90% of MO patients, germline mutations in EXT1 (MIM #608177) or EXT2 (MIM #608210) are found. EXT1 maps to chromosome 8q24.11-q24.13, comprises 11 exons and spans approximately 350 kb, while EXT2, located at 11p11-p11.2, consists of 16 exons and spans almost 108 kb. Both genes act as tumour suppressors. Involvement of other genes has been suggested, since there are families with no mutation identified in either EXT1 or EXT2.\n\n    The EXT genes encode ubiquitous glycosyltransferases, catalyzing heparan sulfate (HS) polymerization at HS proteoglycans (HSPGs). These HSPGs play a major role in the diffusion of signalling molecules such as Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), which is an important regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the growth plate.\n\n    Approximately 10% of patients have a de novo mutation. Loss of the wild-type allele in hereditary cases indicates that inactivation of both EXT alleles is required for osteochondroma formation, confirming their tumour suppressor action that results in a loss of chondrocyte polarization. However, the inactivation of both alleles probably occurs only in some of the cells in the cartilaginous cap of osteochondromas.\n\n    Several studies have reported on MO causing mutations in different populations. These are being gathered in the Multiple Osteochondromas Mutation Database (MOdb) (http://medgen.ua.ac.be/LOVDv.2.0/), currently listing over 400 and 200 different mutations in EXT1 and EXT2, respectively. Most of the mutations (80%) are nonsense, frame-shift and splice-site mutations, resulting in a premature termination of translation, or involve partial or total deletion of the gene. Although it has been suggested that mutations in EXT1 are associated with a more severe phenotype than mutations in EXT2, many aspects of the phenotypic variability observed in patients have yet to be understood at the genetic level. As suggested by the Human Variome Project initiative, characterization of causative mutations in familial and sporadic cases in diverse populations is needed for full understanding of Mendelian diseases.\n\n    Here we present the mutational analysis of 39 unrelated Spanish MO patients and the clinical features of most of them. This is the first report of MO mutations in the Spanish population.",
        "Methods": "    In this study we investigated patients from 39 Spanish families with MO. Diagnosis, performed at 2 centres (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, n = 35 families, and Hospital Universitario \"La Paz\", Madrid, n = 4 families), was based on the presence of MO confirmed by physical and/or radiographic examinations. Blood samples were obtained from patients and available relatives for genomic DNA extraction, after informed consent. Samples from patients were obtained in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, as revised in 2000. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Sant Joan de Deu.\n\n    A clinical diagnosis of MO was achieved after obtaining an accurate medical history and physically examining the patient, including the evaluation of all palpable lesions, height, long bone and trunk deformities, and functional limitations.\n\n    Patients were classified in three clinical classes based on the presence of deformities and functional limitations (I: no deformities and no functional limitations; II: deformities and no functional limitations; and III: deformities and functional limitations), as reported elsewhere. The subcategories were defined by the number of osteochondromas (A: less than 20; B: more than 20).\n\n    Genomic DNA mutation screening of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes was performed for each patient. New primers were designed to amplify all exons and flanking intronic regions of both the EXT1 and the EXT2 genes, so that all fragments, except those corresponding to exon 1 of EXT1, could be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) simultaneously. Primers are listed in on-line Supplementary Table S1. Exon 1 of EXT1 and exon 4 of EXT2 were split into several overlapping fragments, to obtain amplification products that did not exceed 650 bp. PCR was performed in a 50 mul reaction volume, containing ~100 ng of genomic DNA, 1x PCR buffer, 1-2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.4 muM of each forward and reverse primer and 0.7 U of GoTag  Flexi polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). All PCR programs included an initial denaturation of 4 min at 95 C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec at 95 C, 30 sec at annealing temperature (Ta) and 10 sec at 72 C. Finally, an extension at 72 C was performed for 5 min. Annealing temperature was 60 C for all primer combinations, with the exception of primers for the amplification of overlapping regions of exon 1 of EXT1. For these primer combinations, Ta was set at 55 C for ex1.1 and 57 C for ex1.2 and ex1.3. After amplification, the PCR products were purified using a PCR purification kit (GE Healthcare) and then sequenced with BigDye 3.1 (Applied Biosystems; life technologies) in the following PCR programme: denaturation 1 min at 96 C, 25 cycles of 10 sec at 96 C, 5 sec at 55 C and 4 min at 60 C. The sequences were analyzed with an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems life technologies). The presence of all the mutations detected was confirmed by digestion of each PCR product with the corresponding enzyme. None of the novel mutations were found in 50 control samples. All chromatograms of EXT1 and EXT2 exons of negative cases were manually re-analyzed.\n\n    The mutations were given the official HGVS nomenclature (www.hgvs.org). As reference sequences, NM_000127.2 for EXT1 and NM_000401.3 for EXT2 were used.\n\n    The number of copies of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes present in genomic DNA samples was analyzed by the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique designed by MRC-Holland. We used the commercial kit #P215-B1 and followed the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were run on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA, USA). Peaks were analyzed by means of the Coffalyser v9.4 software. The proportion of each peak relative to the height of all peaks was calculated for each sample and then compared to proportions for the corresponding peak averaged for a set of at least ten normal DNA samples. Ratios of 1.0 were treated as normal copy number. Ratios below 0.6 were considered as deletions. Each positive result was confirmed in a second independent MLPA reaction.\n\n    Disease causing potential of missense mutations was evaluated using two different bioinformatic tools: SIFT and PolyPhen.\n\n    Normal distribution of the data and variance differences were assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and Lavenne tests, respectively. Assessment of mean differences was performed using ANOVA. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. The statistical analysis used the PASW 18.0 program.",
        "Results": "    The main clinical features of the patients are detailed in Table 1. Most of the patients (77%) had deformities (classes II and III). More than half the cases (51%) had more than 20 exostoses. Mean age of onset was 2 years and clinical evaluation was performed, on average, 12 years later. Only one of the 39 cases developed a malignant transformation.\n\n    On sequencing all exons and flanking regions of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes in the samples of 39 unrelated patients, 31 pathogenic point mutations were identified (Table 2). Twenty-four different mutations were found in the EXT1 gene, while 7 were found in EXT2. One of them (EXT2, c.544C > T) was found in two unrelated patients. Eighteen out of the 31 mutations were novel, two of them missense in EXT1: p.Asp231Val and p.Pro337Arg. Bioinformatic predictions suggested a pathogenic role for both of them [PolyPhen, probably_damaging (1); SIFT, deleterious (0)]. The mutation screening also detected two changes that were interpreted as non-pathogenic (EXT1, c.962+8_962+11delTCTG and EXT2, c.1178G > A), indicated in italics in Table 2. These two changes were found in patients BCN33 and BCN29, respectively, together with additional mutations, as indicated in Figure 1 and Table 2. In the case of BCN33, the patient inherited the EXT1, c.962+8_962+11delTCTG change from his unaffected mother, while the other mutation, EXT2, c.544C > T (p.Arg182*), was putatively inherited from his affected father (from whom a sample was not available). Patient BCN29 inherited the EXT2, c.1178G > A (p.Arg393Gln) change from her unaffected father, while she presented with a de novo, previously described mutation in the EXT1 gene: c.1019G > C (p.Arg340Pro). After sequencing and thorough manual checking of chromatograms, seven patients remained undiagnosed at the molecular level.\n\n    Exon dosage for EXT1 and EXT2 was assessed by MLPA analysis of the seven samples without identified point mutations. Five unrelated patients (BCN06, BCN07, BCN19, BCN20/25 and BCN22) were found to bear different EXT1 deletions (Figure 2 and Table 2). No large deletion was found in the EXT2 gene. The proband from family 20/25 was hemizygous for all EXT1 exons (i.e., he presented with half a dose), while probands BCN06 and BCN07 (the latter not shown in Figure 2) were hemizygous for exons 2 to 11, and patient BCN19 was hemizygous only for exon 8. In contrast, patient BCN22 showed a partial loss of dose for exons 2 to 11, consistent with a mosaic constitution (see Figure 2). Relatives of patient BCN06, including the affected father, were available for MLPA examination. As seen in Figure 2, the father had a partial loss of dose of exons 2 to 11, compared with the unaffected relatives (proband's mother and brother), consistent with a case of mosaicism for the deletion present in his son. For two cases (BCN21 and BCN28) no mutation was found after sequencing and MLPA analyses.\n\n    We examined the EXT1 and EXT2 mutations in relation to the various phenotypic aspects shown in Table 1. Gene distribution within the three clinical classes showed a higher proportion of EXT2 mutations in class III than in classes I and II (Figure 3A). No significant differences were found when comparing patients with EXT1 and EXT2 mutations for age of disease onset or number of osteochondromas. In EXT1 patients, we compared the group of 6 individuals bearing missense mutations with 18 patients carrying other type of mutations (nonsense and small or large insertions and deletions) in relation to the number of exostoses. As shown in Figure 3B, a significant difference was found (mean number of exostoses for missense = 14.33; SD = 8.24; mean for other = 26.50; SD = 12.66; p = 0.04). However, no significant difference in the age of onset of the disease was found between these two groups (not shown). Lumbar densitometry was performed in 18 patients: results showed impairment in 6 cases, which harboured non-missense mutations, 4 in EXT1 gene and 2 in EXT2 gene.\n\n    Details of the two unrelated patients (BCN21 and BCN28) with no identified EXT1 or EXT2 mutations are included in Table 1. Patient BCN21 was a son of an unaffected couple, while BCN28 inherited the disease from his father. Both presented with a number of exostoses and an onset age that are within the range of the rest of the patients.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Thirty-nine Spanish unrelated patients were analyzed and the mutant allele was identified in 37 of them. Twenty-nine patients (74%) had mutations in EXT1, while 8 (21%) had mutations in EXT2 (Figure 4A). Only two patients remained undiagnosed at the molecular level. Genotype-phenotype correlations were analysed. Patients bearing EXT1 missense mutations correlated with a lower number of exostoses.\n\n    The greater number of EXT1 mutations is in agreement with most other studies of different populations (Figure 4A). The proportion of missense mutation (15.4%) agrees with the large study by Pedrini et al.. All the missense mutations were in EXT1 and 5 out of the 6 clustered in residues 337-341, while the novel missense mutation (p.Asp231Val), lay outside this region. Five probands (14% of the cases) were found to carry partial or whole EXT1 deletions. This proportion is higher than that found by Jennes et al. and Signori et al. (Figure 4B). All these deletions had been previously described. However, whether the breakpoints in all cases are the same or not remains to be studied. Only one publication has addressed this issue and found that two cases with deletion of exons 2 to 11 of EXT1 (and two cases with an exon 8 deletion in EXT2) bore different breakpoints.\n\n    We found two cases of mosaicism for the exon 2-11 deletion, which deserve further discussion. In one case, the patient (BCN06) bore the deletion, while the father, from whom he had inherited the disease, was discovered to be a mosaic thanks to the previous finding of the son's mutation. The other case (BCN22) showed results that were consistent with a deletion, although the MLPA values for exons 2 to 11 were above the threshold for hemizygosity (see Figure 2). These cases are similar to those described by Szuhai et al.. Both mosaic cases (BCN06f and BCN22) had an early disease onset (2 years) and neither was affected less than the average (BCN22 belongs to class IIB). This suggests that mosaic mutations play a role in the pathology: it seems that the deletion of one allele (or of a large part of it) in a relatively small number of cells is enough to trigger the phenotype. However, mosaicism was observed in blood cells, while the actual status in bone remains to be studied.\n\n    Two patients bore two changes each, one in EXT1 and one in EXT2. In patient BCN33, the EXT2 nonsense mutation is undoubtedly pathogenic, has been previously described and was also found in another patient in our series (BCN18). On the other hand, the pathogenic effect of the donor splice site deletion in intron 1 of EXT1 is dubious. It was described as a pathogenic mutation by Signori et al., in an Italian MO patient, and was absent in 100 Spanish control chromosomes. However, the splice score was not affected by the change (data not shown). A novel putative donor site generated by the 4-bp deletion has a very low score, making its use unlikely. Moreover, the patient inherited the disease from his father (Figure 1B) and there are several affected relatives on the paternal side. However, the patient inherited the intron 1 4-bp deletion from his healthy mother (and there are no affected relatives on the mother's side). The best explanation with the available data is that the 4-bp deletion in intron 1 is a rare non-pathogenic variant. Patient BCN29 inherited the EXT2 c.1178G > A (p.Arg393Gln) from her unaffected father (Figure 1B). Additionally, she presented with a de novo EXT1 mutation: c.1019G > C (p.Arg340Pro). This mutation has been previously described by several authors and reviewed by Jennes et al.. That the father had the EXT2 p.Arg393Gln change and is unaffected and that the other mutation was shown to be pathogenic strongly suggest that the former is a non-pathogenic variant. Protein sequence alignments show that Drosophila melanogaster bears a Gln at this position (data not shown). Additionally, the p.Arg393Gln change was found in the Exome Variant Server, NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA (URL: http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) [June, 2012] with a frequency of 16/13,004 (0.12%).\n\n    At the genotype-phenotype level, our data showed that the class with more severe clinical presentations (class III) had a higher proportion of EXT2 mutations than the other classes. However, it must be noted that this may be due to a relatively small number of patients with EXT2 mutations in our study, all of whom bore truncating mutations. When the average number of exostoses in patients with different types of mutations was compared, a significant difference (p < 0.05) was detected between missense mutations and other types of mutation (nonsense and small or large insertions and deletions). Patients with missense mutations had fewer osteochondromas than the rest. A hypothesis to explain this is that some residual activity of the mutant protein may remain only in the case of mutations of amino acid change, which may be enough to produce a small amount of heparan sulfate. This is in agreement with the continuum model suggested by Berger et al. which states that protein function can be a continuum related to the level of expression or activity of the tumour suppressor genes rather than to discrete step-by-step changes in gene copy number. One patient out of 39 developed a malignant tumour (2.6%). This figure is within the range of 2-5% described by several authors (see, for example, Bovee; Pedrini et al.). There were two other patients in whom no disease-causing mutation could be identified (5.1%). This proportion is lower than that found in most studies, including the large one by Pedrini et al.. There are different explanations for the undetected mutations, including a possible third locus, the presence of mosaic point mutations gone undetected or the presence of mutations in unexplored regions such as the promoter, recently characterized by Jennes et al., or deep intronic.\n\n    Overall, our phenotype-genotype correlation results do not agree with those of Pedrini et al., which consisted of an association of a mild phenotype with female sex, EXT2 mutations and absence of EXT1/2 mutations. As stated above, the main limitation of our study was the small sample size. Comparisons between groups had not enough statistical power and we could not detect differences, for example, in the association between sex and the severity of the disease. The main challenge, therefore, will be to collect more cases to further investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation in Spanish patients.\n\n    To conclude, this is the first genetic study of MO performed in a Spanish cohort. We described a collection of mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 and it was possible to offer diagnosis and genetic counselling to the MO patients and their families. This is an essential first step, in order to gain insight into the bases of the disease and then to develop novel strategies in the search for possible therapies.",

        "Title": "    Genetic study of congenital bile-duct dilatation identifies de novo and inherited variants in functionally related genes",
        "Abstract": "    Congenital dilatation of the bile-duct (CDD) is a rare, mostly sporadic, disorder that results in bile retention with severe associated complications. CDD affects mainly Asians. To our knowledge, no genetic study has ever been conducted.\n\n    We aim to identify genetic risk factors by a \"trio-based\" exome-sequencing approach, whereby 31 CDD probands and their unaffected parents were exome-sequenced. Seven-hundred controls from the local population were used to detect gene-sets significantly enriched with rare variants in CDD patients.\n\n    Twenty-one predicted damaging de novo variants (DNVs; 4 protein truncating and 17 missense) were identified in several evolutionarily constrained genes (p < 0.01). Six genes carrying DNVs were associated with human developmental disorders involving epithelial, connective or bone morphologies (PXDN, RTEL1, ANKRD11, MAP2K1, CYLD, ACAN) and four linked with cholangio- and hepatocellular carcinomas (PIK3CA, TLN1 CYLD, MAP2K1). Importantly, CDD patients have an excess of DNVs in cancer-related genes (p < 0.025). Thirteen genes were recurrently mutated at different sites, forming compound heterozygotes or functionally related complexes within patients.\n\n    Our data supports a strong genetic basis for CDD and show that CDD is not only genetically heterogeneous but also non-monogenic, requiring mutations in more than one genes for the disease to develop. The data is consistent with the rarity and sporadic presentation of CDD.\n\n    The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12920-016-0236-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Introduction": "    Congenital dilatation of the bile ducts (choledochal cyst/CDD) result in bile retention, with cholangitis, pancreatitis and malignancies as associated complications. The main symptoms are cholestatic jaundice, abdominal pain and liver enlargement. If the obstruction is not relieved the liver can be permanently damaged. Surgery is the only available treatment. CDD is a rare, mostly sporadic, disorder whose incidence varies widely among populations (from 1 in 1,000 in Asians to 1 in 150,000 in Caucasians). CDD is anatomically classified in 5 major types (I-V). Types I and IV denote dilatation of the common biliary duct (CBD) without (type I) or with (type IV) dilated intrahepatic ducts and are the commonest, representing 50%-80% and 15%-35% of the CDD paediatric population, respectively. Type II CCDs appear as a diverticulum protruding from the wall of the CBD and Type III as a dilatation of the duodenal portion of the CBD. Type V or Caroli disease, refers to a congenital polycystic dilatation only affecting intra hepatic biliary ducts. Type V is considered as a distinct entity as, unlike the other types, is usually associated with both cystic renal disease and liver fibrosis (Caroli syndrome).\n\n    There are two main theories on the aetiology of Types I and IV CDD, the \"obstructing segment\" hypothesis and the \"pancreatic reflux\" hypothesis. The former suggests that a congenital stenosis of the distal bile duct increases the intralumenal pressure which, in turn, dilates the proximal part of the choledoch. The latter proposes that CDD is caused by reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the CBD as a result of an anomaly of the pancreaticobiliary junction. Mixing and activation of the pancreatic and biliary secretions deteriorate the CBD wall and lead to dilatation.\n\n    Both theories imply the presence of congenital structural anomalies that are likely to reflect a failure in the hepatobiliary-pancreatic development during embryonic stages. Although familial cases of CDD have been reported, the overall evidence for a classic genetic inheritance of the phenotype is scant. Nonetheless the, i) the female/male bias observed for Types I and IV CDD; ii) the marked difference in incidence among populations; iii) the rarity of the disorder together; iv) the presence of congenital structural anomalies; and the fact that CDD types I or V can be associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and autosomal recessive or dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) respectively, are strong indicators of a genetic contribution to CDD. Yet the scarcity of pedigrees segregating the disorder and the rarity of the disease make identification of genetic risk loci by traditional study designs difficult. Conceivably, DNA alterations in genes governing the embryonic development of the hepatobiliary-pancreatic system could underlie CDD.\n\n    Given all of the above, we set out to investigate the genetic basis of CDD under the hypothesis that rare de novo or recessive inherited damaging genetic variants could trigger the disorder and account the sporadic presentation of CDD, the scarcity of familial cases and the variability in its incidence across populations. For the identification of loci underlying \"sporadic\" (no family history) genetic disorders, the best strategy is the trio-based approach whereby the exome of unaffected parents and affected probans is scrutinized. Known DNA-variants are filtered out leaving researchers with DNA-variants/mutations unique to the trio (both de novo and inherited). Parents/child filtering is used to identify de novo mutations.",
        "Methods": "    We adopted the \"trio-based\" whole exome-sequencing approach by which the exomes of the patient and his/her unaffected parents are analysed.\n\n    Common DNA-variants were filtered out leaving only variants whose minor allele frequency (MAF) in the general population is < =1%. This is consistent with recessive transmission of the disorder and in line with its incidence in Asia (Additional file 1). Comparison of parental and offspring sequence was used to identify de novo variants.\n\n    The study was approved by the institutional review board of The University of Hong Kong together with the Hospital Authority (IRB: UW 07-321). Blood samples were drawn from all participants after obtaining informed consent (parental consent in new-borns and children below age 7) and experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.\n\n    A total of 33 CDD ethnic Chinese patients (1 male and 32 females) with dilatation of the common biliary duct and their parents were included in the study. Patients from Hong Kong (N = 25 trios; 1 male and 24 females) were recruited through our specialist clinic to which all patients in the territory are referred. Eight additional ethnic Chinese trios (8 females) were recruited through the National Hospital of Pediatrics in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\n    Patients were diagnosed antenatally, by ultrasound, or postnatally by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Clinical characteristics of the patients are detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1.\n\n    For association tests and quality assessment, data from 700 local Chinese participating in a degenerative disc disease (DDD) in-house exome sequencing project were added to the calling set (Additional file 1).\n\n    Additional file 1.\n\n    A recent study has summarized significantly mutated regions (SMRs) in 21 types of cancer. These mutated regions overlap among different type of cancers and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. To identify susceptibility genes shared by cancer and CDD, we tested our samples for enrichment of de novo mutated SMR genes. A total of 610 SMR genes listed on the paper were retrieved and the test was performed by hypergeometric test.\n\n    We hypothesised monogenic and digenic recessive inheritance models for the disease. We considered the following i) homozygous variations; ii) compound heterozygous (CH), and iii) variants in two different but interacting genes (PPIs). For each scenario, we only considered variants inherited from different parents, that is, we required both maternal and paternal rare alleles, which would fit the mostly sporadic presentation of CDD. Since rare variants are more likely to cause disease, allele frequency was restricted to < =1% MAF giving an incidence for any such combination in an individual of < =0.01%.\n\n    However gene length would affect how many of these rare mutations might be seen in the parents in a given gene, as would population specific linkage disequilibrium. To account for these two issues and to calculate the genetic burden of each CH or PPI event in patients we performed case-control association tests whereby the co-occurrence of two variants per individual were compared.\n\n    For CH and homozygous events, we tested the burden of genes containing > =2 damaging variants on each single individual using Fisher exact test. CH and homozygous events with p-values >0.01 were removed.\n\n    For PPI interacting pairs with a rare variant each, we filtered out those PPI pairs with p-values >0.01 in their respective set-based analysis (described above). To further narrow down our results, only recurrent PPI events were included in these tests.\n\n    Enrichment tests on rare damaging variants were performed at gene level. A Kernel style association test, the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) was chosen for the purpose. The test was carried out by the program RVTEST (rare variant test software for next generation sequencing data), which implements the SKAT test and accepts gene-based as well as set based tests (PPI -protein-protein interactions- and pathways) as options. Only SNVs with MAF < = 1% in the 1000 Genome project, ESP6500 and dbSNP137 databases were included. The same criterion was applied to SNVs of our in-house exome dataset (exomes of 700 Chinese individuals).\n\n    To check the association results for batch bias, controls (N = 700) were compared with pseudo-controls (N = 52) derived from other trio-based in-house sequencing study. These pseudocontrols had been sequenced in the same batch and processed using the same analysis pipeline as our cases. Since the pseudocontrols also represent the normal population, SNVs overrepresented in any of the groups being compared (controls vs. pseudocontrol) were indicative of batch bias and were therefore removed from the call set.\n\n    For gene-based association tests, genes carrying 3 or fewer variants were excluded from the analysis. The removal of genes with insufficient markers can increase power by reducing the number of multiple testing corrections.\n\n    For set-based association tests, we considered groups of genes with similar biological functions as the unit of testing. In these tests, we used multiple sources of biological knowledge including protein-protein interactions (PPI) and curated pathways. Gene-sets linked by PPI were retrieved from STRING v9.5 database. Only PPI pairs with medium experimental evidence or above (threshold of 0.4 according to STRINGDB website) were used. Genes carrying filtered SNVs were used to produce these PPI pairs, we included only PPI-sets with 5 or more markers in the tested sets.\n\n    Pathway sets for testing were retrieved from MSigDB, KEGG, Biocarta and REACTOME. Similar to the PPI based analyses, we included only gene-sets with 5 or more markers in each test. In total there were ~9000 PPI pairs and 1056 pathways being tested by SKAT, resulting p-values were corrected by the number of PPI/Pathway sets tested.",
        "Results": "    We conducted a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis of 33 CDD trios to identify causal genetic variations within coding regions. All patients had a normal karyotype.\n\n    There is a remarkable difference of sex ratio in our sample set (female:male = 32:1). This ratio does not reflect that of our population but the selection process of the patients included in the study which was dependent on the availability of parental DNA (trios) and willingness to participate.\n\n    Two trios were excluded from the analysis due to DNA contamination and non-maternity relationship, respectively. Thus, 31 trios were analysed.\n\n    As pathological mechanisms we considered the effect of damaging de novo germ-line mutations and rare recessive inherited variants in i) homozygosis; ii) compound heterozygosis (CH; different mutations in the same gene, one paternally and one maternally inherited and iii) a \"di-genic model\" assuming that variants in different genes of related pathways coexist in the patient through maternal and paternal inheritance. The combined effect of several variants (either de novo + inherited or inherited) was also considered.\n\n    We also performed case-control association tests to capture the possible enrichment of rare variants in a given gene in the patients. Gene-based and, the more powerful, gene-set/pathway-based tests were carried out to identify genes with damaging alleles that, alone or together with their interacting partners, are associated with CDD.\n\n    In total, predicted damaging variants were found in 34 genes, and these were distributed among 23 trios. In the remaining 8 trios no damaging variants were identified (Additional file 1: Table S2).\n\n    We have identified 27 non-synonymous de novo variants among 31 trios through our pipeline, 24 of them were validated by Sanger sequencing, achieving an 89% validation rate. Among the validated de novo variants, 21 were predicted damaging (4 protein truncating and 17 missense mutations) and mapped to the coding sequences (CDS) of 21 genes of 19 CDD patients (Table 1). The de novo damaging CDS variant rate is 0.6 per patient and that of the overall de novo CDS mutations (damaging and not damaging) is 1.1 per patient. The non-synonymous to synonymous ratio (NS:S) of de novo variants is 3:1 which is comparable to a reported random model (NS:S = 2.85:1) and slightly higher than the ratio reported by 1000 Genomes Project (NS:S = 1.14:1).\n\n    Non-synonymous de novo variants were annotated (Table 1) and their Constraint Scores (Additional file 1: Table S2) calculated (Fig. 1). The plot shows that the gene constraint scores deviate from the empirical normal distribution to a bimodal distribution with a set of 4 genes being evolutionary constrained (constrain score cut-off = 3.09, corresponding to P < 0.001). The average constraint score of 21 damaging de novo variants is significantly higher than that obtained randomly (empirical p < 0.01 using random sampling without replacement). This means that changes on those genes are less tolerated hence, more likely to cause disease.\n\n    We then queried the Clinical Variation (ClinVar) database to assess the involvement of the 21 CDD genes carrying de novo variants in other human disorders. Six out the 21 genes are involved in human genetic diseases -mostly developmental-(PXDN, RTEL1, ANKRD11, MAP2K1, CYLD and ACAN) where epithelial, connective or bone morphologies being a common denominator (Additional file 1: Table S2). Protein truncating variants were detected for PXDN, RTEL1, ANKRD11 and PPP2R2B. Importantly a damaging inherited mutation was also detected in the de novo mutated TXLNB gene.\n\n    CDD patients with mutations in genes known to be involved in other congenital human disorders were clinically re-assessed. Except for patient CC4C (MAP2K1 damaging variant), in whom some developmental delay features had already been observed, none of the CDD patients showed signs of the disorders attributed to the genes in which they had damaging de novo variants. Importantly, the finding of a MAP2K1 (Noonan's syndrome) damaging variant (c. 308 T > G, p.I103S) in patient CC4D helped confirm the diagnosis of the patient with Noonan's syndrome. CDD and keratosis pilaris (skin disorder) have also been reported in several Noonan's syndrome patients.\n\n    Five genes with de novo damaging alleles PIK3CA, TLN1 CYLD, and MAP2K1, are linked with cholangio- and hepatocellular carcinomas in addition to congenital syndromes and conditions related to tissue overgrowth. It is worth remarking that people affected with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome or familial cylindromatosis are born with one damaging allele in CYLD but a second damaging variant (somatic) needs to occur in the epithelial tissues for the disease to manifest, a process reminiscent of cancer development.\n\n    A recent study has summarized significantly mutated regions (SMRs) in 21 types of cancer. In total, these regions comprise 610 genes thought to carry the \"driver\" mutations in different types of cancers. We found that de novo variants in SMR genes were in excess in our dataset (enrichment test p < 0.0249). This enrichment was due to the de novo variants in PIK3CA, C6 and PPP2R2B. PIK3CA was highlighted by its very high density of mutations affecting 9 types of cancers, suggesting its key role in cancer development.\n\n    We then assessed the patients for inherited damaging variants acting in a recessive manner. To identify compound heterozygotes (CH) we performed a gene burden test whereby those CH with p < 0.01 present in more than one patient (recurrently mutated) were considered.\n\n    CH recurrent events with at least one damaging allele were identified for 4 genes (DCHS1, C5orf42, TXLNB and, PRRC2A) and distributed among 7 families (Additional file 1: Table S2). As above, we queried the ClinVar database. DCHS1 was found to have 4 different alleles forming two different CH in two different families (CC205 and VC84). In spite of DCHS1 being linked to Van Maldergem Wetzburger Verloes syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intellectual disability, typical craniofacial features, auditory malformations resulting in hearing loss, and skeletal and limb malformations, neither patient had any sign of that syndrome. DCHS1 is a key member of the planar cell polarity pathway which is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton that shapes the cells during mammalian development. Similarly, C5orf42 was also found to have 4 different alleles forming two different CH in two different families (CC35 and CC9). This gene is associated with several developmental delay disorders including some forms of the autosomal recessive Joubert syndrome, global developmental delay and with the autosomal recessive orofaciodigital syndrome VI (polydactyly, cleft lip/palate or lingual lump, and psychomotor retardation). Neither TXLNB nor PRRC2A is linked to any human disease. TXLNB was also de novo mutated in patient VC10 and a homozygous PRRC2A mutation was identified in patient CC98.\n\n    Similar to the filtering strategy adopted for CH events, both recurrence and burden were considered for PPI pairs. After filtering, a total of 5 PPI combinations (KRT18 + BYSL, THBS1 + COL7A1, TP53 + SETD8, EPS15 + DNM1, and POU2F2 + PGR) distributed among 10 families were detected. All these genes are known to play pivotal roles in development.\n\n    KRT18 encodes a protein for making structural keratin in hepatocytes. KRT18 mutations cause infantile liver cirrhosis. Krt18 mutant mice develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association with disruption of hepatocyte keratin filaments mouse models. BYSL, together with keratin 18 are thought to be involved in teratocarcinoma.\n\n    THBS1 encodes a protein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and interacts with several proteins including the structural proteins encoded by COL7A1. THBS1 has been shown to play roles in platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis and linked to auto immune disorders (Sjogren Syndrome). Mutant mice show abnormal cystic duct morphology, dilated gall bladder, abnormal pancreas morphology and pancreas inflammation. COL7A1 mutations are linked to two skin disorders, epidermolysis bullosa and keratosis palmoplantaris.\n\n    TP53 germline mutations are linked to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder that increases the risk of developing several types of cancer, particularly in children and young adults. SETD8 regulates TP53 and is involved in cell cycle progression and developmental processes.\n\n    No human disorders have been ascribed to the epidermal growth factor receptor EPS15. Dynamin (DNM1) encodes a microtubule-binding protein and been associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Little is known about the remaining complexes.\n\n    The identification of a gene with different damaging variants in different individuals (recurrently mutated gene) also evidences pathogenicity. In total, we identified 13 genes recurrently mutated, forming either PPI or CH and as well as de novo or in homozygosis. Importantly, the alleles of recurrently mutated genes are not necessarily the same (gene mutated at different sites). Eight of the 13 recurrently mutated genes are present in different allelic forms (marked by * in Additional file 1: Table S2).\n\n    As to the phenotype caused by these mutated genes in mice, there are 9 genes (4 with de novo ACAN, CYLD, PIK3CA, PPP1R15B, and 5 with inherited variants DCHS1, KRT18, PGR, THBS1, and TP53) whose mouse mutants display abnormal liver or pancreas (including abnormal cystic duct and pancreas inflammation among others; Additional file 1: Table S2).\n\n    Gene-based association tests were performed on the genes carrying rare and damaging variants (refer to Additional file 1: Figure S2). The p-values appear to be well estimated (as indicated by a qq-plot; Additional file 1: Figure S1), the good agreement with null distribution indicates no major biases due population stratification or technical issues. No signal reached the significance threshold of <10-6 for 20,000 genes tested although TRIM28 achieved a significance level of 3.9 x 10-5, suggestive of enrichment in rare damaging variants (Additional file 1: Table S3).\n\n    To boost power for association analysis, we attempted to account for biological or functional relatedness by resorting to PPI (STRINGDB) and pathway (MsigDB) databases to group rare variants for association test. Pathway enrichment testing yielded no significant results.\n\n    Interestingly, PPI analyses revealed that the PPI pair TRIM28 and ZNF382 were overrepresented in the patient group when compared to controls (p < =3.60x10-6, Bonferroni corrected p < =0.042; Table 2). There are 3 individuals carrying rare damaging variants on TRIM28 and 2 individuals with rare damaging variants on ZNF382 (Additional file 1: Table S1). This indicates the role of TRIM28 as a putative significant player in CDD. TRIM28 is known to regulate endoderm differentiation including liver and pancreas structures during early embryogenesis. Trim28 knockout mice are embryonic lethal and show abnormal development of the digestive system and neural tube. Until recently, studies revealed the role of TRIM28 on genomic imprinting during embryo development, it has provided sights on its role in the developmental process.\n\n    TRIM28 is also listed among 610 SMR genes in cancer.\n\n    In order to fully understand how this myriad of mutated genes identified in our patients could contribute to the CDD phenotype and to consider whether our findings fit into any pathological process, we performed gene/pathway-set enrichment analyses and a careful examination of the genetic profile or mutational load of each patient. No enriched geneset was found using DAVID. However, GeneMANIA identified 12 genes being part of the same network as indicated by their pathway and physical interactions (Fig. 2). Among these, 5 had de novo variants and 7 were recurrently mutated (forming CH or PPIs) at different sites.\n\n    Additional file 1: Table S2 presents the genetic profile of each of the 23 CDD patients with damaging alleles, the involvement of the mutated gene in other human disorders and the phenotype displayed by mutant mice. Several patients had more than one de novo variants and/or more than one damaging allele advocating the idea of CDD being an oligogenic and genetically heterogeneous disorder and as such, the phenotype will be variable and result from gene interactions. Hence the challenge in disentangling such disorders.\n\n    Seven patients had no damaging variants (in bold in Additional file 1: Table S1). Among these, patients CC221C and CC232C had concomitant developmental disorders. Not finding damaging alleles indicates i) we missed them; ii) those patients may have small chromosomal anomalies or copy number variations (CNV) or, (iii) non-genetic disease cause. Patient CC7, had a de novo frameshift in PPP2R2B, a gene linked to spinocerebral ataxia, and inherited damaging alleles in the PPI pair THBS1 + COL7A1. Whether PPP2R2B will eventually confer the spinocerebral ataxia phenotype (late onset) to that patient and the CDD is caused by the variants in PPI is not known. The patient is being monitored.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our data supports a strong genetic basis for CDD and show that CDD is not only genetically heterogeneous but also non-monogenic, requiring mutations in more than one genes for the disease to develop. The data is consistent with the rarity and sporadic presentation of CDD.",
        "Discussion": "    The two current theories for the aetiology of CDD, \"obstructing segment\" hypothesis and the \"pancreatic reflux\" hypothesis are not mutually exclusive. Both imply that CDD results from a failure in the hepatobiliary-pancreatic development. Given the multitude of molecular and cellular events that take place during the development of the hepatobiliary system, it is conceivable that DNA alterations in genes governing such processes could underlie CDD. As the number of interacting molecules during development is large, CDD may result from the accumulation of mutations in several genes. Variants in different genes of related pathways may lead to the same disorder, the same gene may have different severe variants in unrelated patients or, a given variant may lead to different clinical manifestations in different individuals. Hence, the marked genetic heterogeneity that characterizes human diseases.\n\n    The genetic profile of these CDD patients indicates the disorder is not only genetically heterogeneous but also oligogenic, comprising di-genic models, and is consistent with the sporadic presentation of the disease and the scarcity of familial cases. Although some of the genes with de novo pathogenic mutations appear to be functionally or biologically linked with developmental processes of the hepatobiliary tract, it would appear that CDD obeys a \"two or multi-hit hypotheses\" where the effect of de novo variants may be \"enhanced\" by the presence of damaging alleles of genes other than those with the de novo variant. These damaging alleles may form compound heterozygotes and/or be PPI-related. As CDD is more common in Asians, the frequencies of alleles conferring risk to the disorder in that population are likely to be higher than in other ethnicities. The presence of an underlying genetic risk factor seems to be corroborated by our gene-enrichment test whereby we evaluated the contribution of rare damaging variants by a gene-based case-control association analysis. These rare variants could modify the manifestation of the disease by enhancing or reducing the effect of other co-existing alleles and provide the extra stimulus that drives those susceptible individuals to disease. Thus, it would appear that carriers of TRIM28 or ZNF382 rare damaging variants might have a higher risk of developing CDD. Replication of this finding in independent Chinese patients is needed. Similar studies should be conducted in non-Asian CDD patients to assess whether the TRIM28 association is population specific.\n\n    Interestingly, multiple CDD genes coincided with SMR cancer genes as suggested by the enrichment of SMR genes with de novo variants and the existence of our top associated gene-pair (TRIM28-ZNF382) among the SMR list in our CDD samples. Our data is in line with the established link between cholangiocarcinoma and CDD. Importantly, our literature review showed that CDD is not only linked to cholangiocarcinoma but also to other types of malignancies, including adenocarcinomas, primary squamous carcinoma of the liver, benign squamous metaplasia and adenosquamous carcinoma.\n\n    We then investigated if of those genes with damaging variants (either de novo or inherited) were biologically and/or functionally related and the phenotypes that these genes originate, when mutated, in human and mice. Twelve genes with damaging alleles were found to physically or functionally interact (Fig. 2). As for the phenotypic effect in human or mice, 6 genes carrying de novo have been associated with human developmental disorders that involve overgrowth of the epithelial and/or connective tissues, bone morphologies (Additional file 1: Table S2). Those genes not reported implicated in human disorders (N = 15) are all involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and in maintaining the structural integrity of the epithelial cells.\n\n    Except for one patient with Noonan's syndrome, none of the patients displayed any phenotype other than CDD at the time of diagnosis. We can only speculate that, allegedly, unrelated disorders may also be genetically connected as indicated by the human disease network map (or diseasome).\n\n    The excess of damaging alleles in genes mainly involved in soft tissues disorders and conditions related to overgrowth of tissues (benign or cancerogenous) is in line with i) the clinical observation regarding the higher incidence of cholangiocarcinomas among CDD patients; ii) the notion that CDD is caused by tissue overgrowth which would fit with the \"obstructing segment\" and the \"pancreatic reflux\" hypotheses on the CDD aetiology. Moreover, the cholangiocyte function is likely to be affected and so, the bile composition which in turn may cause further damage to the epithelium. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Either stenosis or pancreatico-biliary junction defect can underlie CDD and which of them triggers the disease would depend on the genetic background of the patient.\n\n    Despite the array of databases and prediction tools available, very little is known about the intricate ways in which genes interact, the development of the hepato-biliary structures, or the function of many genes. For example, one de novo and two inherited damaging alleles in an evolutionarily constrained gene, TXLNB, were identified in two patients. Yet, very little is known about this gene. However, finding genes with rare damaging variants at different sites in different individuals (gene recurrently mutated) can be used as a \"pathogenicity criteria\" to ascribe the involvement of a gene in a disorder. For rare, genetically heterogeneous diseases such as CDD, the involvement of a mutated gene in the disease may only be consolidated by the identification of new or recurrent mutations of the same gene in independent patients.\n\n    Ours is the first genetic study ever conducted on CDD patients. The study is not without limitations, small sample size being the most obvious. Yet, genes functionally linked and recurrently mutated have been identified providing a glimpse into the genetic factors that may be underlying CDD. For such a rare and genetically heterogeneous disorder, replication of our findings implies unattainable sample size. Also, our data indicates that the phenotype results from interactions between more of one mutated gene (digenic/oligogenic) which hampers the possibility of a clean functional study.",

        "Title": "    Effect of CETP Polymorphism on Atorvastatin Lipid-Regulating Effect and Clinical Prognosis of Patients with Coronary Heart Disease",
        "Abstract": "    The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of genetic polymorphism of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene polymorphism -629C/A on the therapeutic effect of atorvastatin and clinical outcome in Han Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n    From October 2011 to December 2012, 348 patients with angiographically confirmed CHD were recruited. CETP gene polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum level of CETP was determined with enzyme-1inked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lipid 1evel in all patients was determined at baseline and after 12 months of treatment with 20 mg/d of atorvastatin. All the patients were followed-up at least 12 months. Major adverse cardiac events, including death, non-fatal infarction, revascularization, and stroke (MACE), were recorded.\n\n    The frequency of the -629A allele was 0.412. Compared with CC or CA genotypes, individuals with AA genotype had lower CETP levels (P=0.026) and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (P=0.035). After 12 months of atorvastatin therapy, carriers with CC genotype had greater reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P<0.001), reduced LP (a) (P=0.005), and elevated HDL-C (P=0.045) compared with CA or AA genotypes. The incidence of MACE after a mean follow-up of 17.3+-5.2 months was 8.8%. The cumulative MACE-free survival rates were 90.1%, 85.2%, and 71.1% for CC, CA, and AA genotypes, respectively.\n\n    Our results suggest that the AA variant of the -629A allele of CETP gene had higher HDL-C levels and reduced CETP levels, but patients with CC genotype appeared to have benefited more from statin therapy with reduction in LDL-C and LP (a) levels. Long-term clinical prognosis was, however, not affected by the 3 genotypes.",
        "Introduction": "    The discovery of statins has promoted significant advances in serum cholesterol research and been invaluable in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). In addition, the actions of statins can effectively decrease total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), as well as increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); therefore, significantly reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. However, individuals react differently to statins, with individual reactions to this drug treatment resulting from the combined effect of genetic and environmental factors. Studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of enzymes, transport proteins, and receptors involved in statin metabolism and lipid metabolism have important effects on the effectiveness of statin therapy. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is an important protein involved in CHD pathogenesis, and its major physiological functions are the coordination of lipid exchange and transport among different lipoproteins and mediation of HDL cholesterol ester transfer to ApoB-rich very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL), while simultaneously mediating the TG transfer in the opposite direction, regulation of plasma HDL concentrations, components and particle sizes, and reduction of HDL particle size. In addition, CETP plays important roles in completing and promoting cholesterol reverse transport processes.\n\n    The human CETP gene is located in the 16q12-21 area, close to lecithin, and the cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene has a total length of 25 kb, including 16 exons. Its variations could affect serum CETP levels and eventually affect lipid metabolism. The -629C/A polymorphism was first discovered by Dachet et al. in 2000. It is located in the CETP gene promoter area and can affect promoter activity. The nuclear transcriptional factor Spl/Sp3 can specifically bind the -629A allele and inhibit its transcription activity. The -629A allele carriers have decreased serum CETP activities and significantly increased HDL-C levels. Wang et al. found that the CC genotypes had higher CETP levels but significantly lower levels of HDL-C than the AA genotypes in the Chinese population. Wu et al. reported that the CETP-629C/A polymorphic loci in the Chinese Han population did not significantly affect the serum HDL-C levels; however, it did affect serum LDL-C and ApoAII levels. The effect of CETP-629C/A polymorphic loci on the effectiveness of statins and long-term prognosis of CHD patients is not clear. We studied the CETP gene -629C/A polymorphism and analyzed its effect on the lipid regulating effect of statins and the long-term prognosis in a Chinese population.",
        "Methods": "    The present study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Study Board of Fudan University. Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects or from their guardian before enrollment. The study subjects were CHD patients from October 2011 to December 2012. All of the patients are of Han descent. There were 348 cases, including 266 male patients and 82 female patients treated for acute coronary symptoms and stable angina, with an average age of 58.9+-7.4 years. The inclusion criteria were: coronary angiography results showed that among the left anterior descending arteries, left circumflex arteries, and right coronary arteries, and there was at least 1 artery stenosis with a diameter >=50%. The patients had no liver, kidney, or endocrine diseases that would affect lipid metabolism, and there was no consanguinity among the subjects. Patients with history of lipid-regulating medications or long-term use of hormone drugs were excluded. The clinical characteristics of the study subjects were collected and analyzed, including information on their height, weight, waistline, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum cholesterol, and history of coronary artery disease.\n\n    After signing the consent form, fasting venous blood samples were collected from the patients after 12 h of fasting. Serum was isolated from the blood samples, and the serum cholesterol levels were quantified. The patients were given 20 mg of atorvastatin (Pfizer Inc. NY, USA) orally once every night. After treatment for a year, the enzymatic method was performed using a Toshiba 120FR automated chemistry analyzer to check the serum cholesterol levels. Throughout the period in which the patients were medicated, the ingestion of other lipid-regulating drugs or drugs metabolized by cytochrome P4503A4 was avoided.\n\n    Two milliliters of fasting peripheral venous blood was collected, and serum was isolated from the blood samples and stored at -80 C. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the CETP levels. The kits were purchased from the Shanghai R&D Company, and the manufacturer's recommendations were strictly followed. The samples were analyzed with a Thermo (USA) automated microplate reader.\n\n    Five milliliters of fasting venous blood was collected. After ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulation, the leukocytes were isolated. A kit from Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd. was used to extract the DNA. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was used to study the CETP-629 C/A polymorphism. The PCR-amplified target fragment length was 222 bp with the forward primer 5'-LTTCTTGGCCCCAGCTGTAGG-3' and reverse primer 5'-GAAACAGTCCTCTATGTAGACTTTCCTTGATATGCATAAAAT ACCACTGG-3' (synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.). The amplified product was digested with endonuclease Van91I (Fermentas Canada) and then analyzed for the genotypes by 3.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The mutation on -629C/A can produce the endonuclease Van91I enzyme site. Two fragments at sizes of 175 bp and 47 bp were produced after the digestion. There are 3 genotypes of CETP-629C/A: CC genotype (222 bp wild-type), CA genotype (222 bp, 175 bp, and 47 bp heterozygous mutations), and AA genotype (175 bp and 47 bp homozygous mutations).\n\n    All the follow-ups were performed by our group and were conducted by telephone to determine the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), such as death, nonfatal myocardial infraction (MI), revascularization and stroke. Deaths were considered cardiac unless an unequivocal noncardiac cause was established. MI was defined as new Q waves and an increase in the creatine kinase MB concentration to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, if occurring within 48 h after the procedure, or as new Q waves or an increase in creatine kinase MB concentration to greater than the upper limit of the normal range, plus ischemic symptoms or signs, if occurring more than 48 h after the procedure. Stroke was defined as a sudden onset of vertigo, numbness, aphasia, or dysarthria resulting from vascular lesions of the brain, including hemorrhage, embolism, thrombosis, or rupturing aneurysm, and persisting for 24 h. Ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization was defined as any repeat revascularization in the treated vessel in which there was stenosis of at least 50% of the diameter in the presence of ischemic signs or symptoms, or at least 70% stenosis in the absence of ischemic signs or symptoms. All events were adjudicated by an event adjudication committee blinded to patient groups.\n\n    The data are expressed as the means +- standard deviation. A comparison among the different genotype variables was analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Qualitative data are expressed as a rate or ratio. The alleles were confirmed to be in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A comparison among the different genotype variables was performed using the Pearson chi2 test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The relationship between CETP concentrations and serum cholesterol levels was examined using Pearson correlation analysis. A comparison between the serum cholesterol levels at baseline and after medication among the different genotypes was analyzed using ANOVA. A comparison between the 2 groups was made using the least significant difference test or Dunnett's t test (heterogeneity of variance). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve log-rank test was used to study the effects of different genotypes on the survival rate. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 software, and the statistical tests were based on 2-tailed tests, with P<0.05 indicating significant differences.",
        "Results": "    The difference between the CC, CA, and AA genotype distribution frequencies and expected frequencies was not significant, which is in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and suggests that the samples represented the population. The mutated gene frequency was 0.412, and the C allele frequency was 0.578\n\n    The differences in the age, sex, level of hypertension, number of diabetic patients, number of smoking patients, BMI, serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), and left ventricular ejection fraction, as well as the CETP levels among the 3 genotypes of CETP-629C/A were not significant (P>0.05). A comparison of the CC, CA, and AA genotypes and serum HDL-C levels showed an increasing trend, and the CETP and LDL-C concentrations showed a decreasing trend (Table 1).\n\n    The differences in serum cholesterol among the different genotypes of the patients after lipid-regulating treatment for 12 months were recorded and are shown in Table 2. (1) The serum LDL-C level change rates among the 3 different genotypes were significantly different (P<0.001). A pairwise comparison showed that among the CA, AA, and CC genotypes, the CC genotype showed the most significant decrease in LDL-C levels, the CA genotype showed less of a decrease than the CC genotype, and the AA genotype showed the smallest decrease of the 3. (2) The differences in the serum lipoprotein (a) level change rates among the 3 different genotypes were significant (P=0.021). A pairwise comparison showed that among the CA, AA, and CC genotypes, the CC genotype had the most significant decrease in LP (a) level, the CA genotype showed a smaller decrease than the CC genotype, and the AA genotype showed the smallest decrease of the 3. (3) The CC genotype showed the most significant increase in HDL-C levels, the CA genotype showed less of an increase than the CC genotype, and the AA genotype had the smallest increase of the 3. However, none of the differences were significant. (4) Among the 3 genotypes, the levels of TC, TG, VI.DL-C, ApoAI, and ApoB showed no significant differences.\n\n    During the follow-up period, there were 30 cases (8.62%) with MACE. Among these cases, there were 4 deaths (1.15%), 8 nonfatal myocardial infarctions (2.3%), 14 revascularizations (4.02%), and 4 strokes (1.15%). The MACE-free survival rates among the 3 genotypes were 92.4% for the CC genotype, 85.3% for the CA genotype, and 65.0% for the AA genotype. Although there were gradient change trends, such as the CC genotype having a better prognosis than the CA and AA genotypes, the difference was not significant (P=0.243), as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Conclusion": "    Carriers with the -629A allele of CETP gene had higher HDL-C levels and reduced CETP levels and patients with CC genotype appeared to have benefited more from statin therapy with reduction in LDL-C and LP (a) levels. Long-term clinical prognosis was, however, not affected by the CETP polymorphism.\n\n    Competing interests\n\n    The authors declare no competing interests exist.\n\n    Source of support: Departmental sources",
        "Discussion": "    Our results suggest that among the Chinese Han population, the CETP-692A/C polymorphism was correlated to serum cholesterol levels and atorvastatin lipid-regulating effects, but not to a clinical prognosis. The CETP-629C A mutation can lead to decreased CETP levels and less activity and may eventually lead to a blockage of cholesteryl ester transfer from HDL to VLDL and LDL, accumulation of cholesteryl ester in the HDL particles, increase in HDL particle size, and increase in HDL levels in plasma. A partial explanation for the increased HDL-C is the increase in large particles of HDL-C.\n\n    Statins can become clinical first-line treatments because they decrease LDL-C and significantly decrease cardiovascular risks. Different individual reactions to statins among patients are caused by a combined effect of genetic and environmental factors. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the genes involved in statin and lipid metabolism, such as ApoAl, ApoE, CETP, LDL receptor, HMGCR, and lipoprotein lipase, could be the major genetic factor affecting the individual lipid-regulating effects. Currently, studies on the effect of the CETP polymorphism on the effectiveness of statins are still in the initial stages and lack consistent conclusions. van Venrooij et al. found that after adjusting for the effects of confounding factors, such as alcohol consumption and smoking, the -629C/A polymorphism CC genotype carriers (80 mg/d group) can benefit more from statins. Poduri et al. provided 265 CHD patients with 20 mg/d atorvastatin daily and performed follow-up investigations for 1 year. They found that patients with the -629 AA genotype had higher baseline LDI-C level; however, patients with the -629CC genotype had more significantly increased HDL-C levels (P<0.05). Blankenberg et al. performed a study of 1211 CHD patients and performed a follow-up for 4.1 years. They found that 411 patients (34%) had received treatment with statins, and the results showed that the patients with the -629 AA genotype had higher HDL-C levels and lower CETP activity. The cardiovascular mortality of the CC, CA, and AA genotypes were 10.8%, 4.6%, and 4.0% (P<0.0001), respectively. In addition, patients with the -629 AA genotype showed better lipid-regulating effects.\n\n    We found that in the study population, the CETP-629C/A polymorphism is correlated to atorvastatin lipid-regulating effects in CHD patients. After treatment for 12 months, the CC genotype patients had the most decreased LDL-C levels, whereas the serum lipoprotein level was the most significant in the CC genotype. The regulating effects of TC, TG, VLDL, ApoAI, and ApoB were not affected by the CETP polymorphism. During the follow-up period, the MACE-free survival rates of the 3 genotypes were 92.4% for the CC genotype, 85.3% for the CA genotype, and 65.0% for the AA genotype. Although there were gradient change trends, such as the CC genotype having a better prognosis than the CA and AA genotypes, the difference was not significant. In addition, the lipid-regulating effects of statins on the CHD patients were also affected by age, sex, body weight, and height, as well as lifestyle habits such as smoking. Our study compared age, sex, level of hypertension, number of diabetic patients, number of smoking patients, BMI, serum glucose, and CETP levels among the 3 CETP-629C/A polymorphism genotypes. The differences were not significant (all P>0.05); therefore, we did not adjust for confounding factors in the analysis. We have shown from the serum cholesterol levels that genetic factors can affect an individual's lipid-regulating effect of statins. The -629C/A polymorphism was correlated to decreased LDL-C and LP (a) levels caused by atorvastatin lipid-regulating treatment. Patients with the CC genotype showed better lipid-regulating effects. However, multi-center clinical trials with larger sample sizes are required to determine whether this gene polymorphism can become a predicting factor in the long-term prognosis of atorvastatin lipid-regulating treatment.",

        "Title": "    Therapy of Fabry disease with pharmacological chaperones: from in silico predictions to in vitro tests",
        "Abstract": "    Fabry disease is a rare disorder caused by a large variety of mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal alpha-galactosidase. Many of these mutations are unique to individual families. Fabry disease can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy, but a promising novel strategy relies on small molecules, so called \"pharmacological chaperones\", which can be administered orally. Unfortunately only 42% of genotypes respond to pharmacological chaperones.\n\n    A procedure to predict which genotypes responsive to pharmacological chaperones in Fabry disease has been recently proposed. The method uses a position-specific substitution matrix to score the mutations. Using this method, we have screened public databases for predictable responsive cases and selected nine representative mutations as yet untested with pharmacological chaperones. Mutant lysosomal alpha galactosidases were produced by site directed mutagenesis and expressed in mammalian cells. Seven out of nine mutations responded to pharmacological chaperones. Nineteen other mutations that were tested with pharmacological chaperones, but were not included in the training of the predictive method, were gathered from literature and analyzed in silico. In this set all five mutations predicted to be positive were responsive to pharmacological chaperones, bringing the percentage of responsive mutations among those predicted to be positive and not used to train the classifier to 86% (12/14). This figure differs significantly from the percentage of responsive cases observed among all the Fabry mutants tested so far.\n\n    In this paper we provide experimental support to an \"in silico\" method designed to predict missense mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal alpha galactosidase responsive to pharmacological chaperones. We demonstrated that responsive mutations can be predicted with a low percentage of false positive cases. Most of the mutations tested to validate the method were described in the literature as associated to classic or mild classic phenotype. The analysis can provide a guideline for the therapy with pharmacological chaperones supported by experimental results obtained in vitro. We are aware that our results were obtained in vitro and cannot be translated straightforwardly into benefit for patients, but need to be validated by clinical trials.",
        "Introduction": "    Fabry Disease (FD) [ORPHANET: orpha324, OMIM: 30150] is a pan-ethnic disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal alpha galactosidase [HGNC:GLA; UNIPROT: AGAL_HUMAN,] (for a review). The classic form of the disease is characterized by angiokeratomas, acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, corneal opacity in childhood or adolescence, and progressive vascular disease of the heart, kidneys and central nervous system. Although FD follows X-linked inheritance, heterozygous females can be symptomatic. The reported incidence of FD in the general population ranges from 1 in 476,000 to 1 in 117,000; however this may well underestimate the true proportion of affected people. Indeed, in a large screening of Italian male newborns revealed an occurrence of mutations in the gene encoding AGAL as high as 1 in 3100. FD may be under-diagnosed because its phenotypic manifestations are heterogeneous and partially coincident with those of common diseases, and because many patients develop symptoms in adolescence or even later. An indication of the multiplicity of mutations is given by the fact that 344 missense/non sense mutations of the AGAL gene have been recorded in the public version of HGMD and even more in the professional version of the same database. Most of these mutations are \"private\", that is observed in only one family.\n\n    This heterogeneity of genotypes explains only part of the heterogeneity observed in phenotypes because clinical phenotype, age of onset and course of Fabry disease are highly variable, even within the same family. At present the treatments of Fabry disease are symptomatic and life-long. Enzyme replacement (ERT) has already been introduced into medical practice and is considered \" the clinical gold standard\". This therapy requires intravenous infusions of purified AGAL produced by genetically engineered cell lines every 2 weeks. Treatment with pharmacological chaperones (PCs), in particular 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin is in phase three clinical trials. 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin, also known as DGJ, migalastat hydrochloride or AT1001 is an imino sugar that resembles galactose. The therapeutical approach with PCs relies on competitive inhibitors of AGAL that bind and stabilize the enzyme, increasing its total cellular levels, as shown in cultured cells and in vivo. In theory PCs represent a useful alternative to ERT because they do not cause adverse immunological reactions and can be administered orally. In practice therapy with PCs is limited because only some mutations can be rescued by these drugs. It has been observed that usually, but not necessarily, late-onset forms, as well as mutations that do not occur in the catalytic domain of AGAL, respond to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin.\n\n    We have recently proposed a method to predict which mutations in AGAL are responsive to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin. We have trained a classifier using published data concerning responsive and non responsive mutations and evaluated 87% accuracy by cross validation. In this paper we extended this study by testing the method on mutations not included in the classifier training.",
        "Methods": "    We collected 13 homologous AGAL sequences from Uniprot/Swissprot; these had E-value <10-50 and sequence identity ranging from 95% to 30%. A Position Specific Substitution Matrix (PSSM) was built from this set of sequences running BLASTPGP (BLASTP2.2.18) in PSI-BLAST mode flagging on the output of a checkpoint file. The PSSM was exploited in a second round of BLASTPGP to calculate net scores for human AGAL mutants obtained by HGMD. Nine mutations were selected among those obtaining score 0 and -1 that had not been previously tested experimentally with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin.\n\n    The clone SC319065, which contains the full length cDNA for wild type AGAL_HUMAN inserted into the expression vector pCMV6-AC, was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA). Mutations were introduced with two consecutive PCR reactions. In the first round of amplifications, two reactions were set up, one contained the outmost forward oligo (ECOR1_FORWARD) and the specific reverse mutant oligo (table 3) and the other contained the outmost reverse oligo (XHO1_REVERSE) and the forward specific mutant oligo (table 3). In the second round of amplifications, the purified products of the first PCR reactions were used as templates and the outmost forward and reverse oligos were used as primers. The amplifications were performed for 28 cycles using the following conditions: 95 C for 10 min, 94 C for 30 sec, 60 C for 30 sec, 72 C 30 sec, and 72 C for 5 min with 0.6 muM of each primer. After the second round, amplified fragments were purified, digested with ECORI and XHOI and inserted into pCMV6-AC. Mutant constructs were verified by sequencing.\n\n    COS-7 were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37 C and 5% CO2. The cells were transfected with individual pCMV6-AC plasmids containing wild type or mutant AGAL-encoding ORF using the LipofectAMINE2000 cationic lipid reagent.\n\n    Four micrograms of plasmid DNA in 0.5 ml Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) were mixed with 18 microliters LipofectAMINE2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 0.5 ml Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. During this time, COS-7 cells were harvested by trypsin treatment and resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS.\n\n    COS-7 in suspension (4 ml) were added to transfection mix solution, distributed into two wells of a six-well plate at 60% confluency and allowed to adhere overnight. The efficiency of transfection was increased by treatment with cloroquine 100 micromolar (SIGMA, Milan, Italy). The efficiency of the transfection was calculated by cotrasfecting an equal amount of pMIR vector (AppliedBiosystem/Ambion, Italy) containing the luciferase gene and assaying the reporter gene activity under standard conditions using ONE-Glo  Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Italy). A 3-fold increase in efficiency was measured in the presence of cloroquine.\n\n    The medium was substituted by fresh DMEM, 10% FBS (3 ml) and in one well 20 micromolar 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin was added whereas in the other was not. After a 48 hr incubation, the cells were washed in PBS (5 times), scraped and harvested by centrifugation. Dry pellets were resuspended in 200 microliters of water and lysed by freeze-thawing. Four independent transfections were carried out.\n\n    Water-soluble extracts were used for enzyme assays or western blot.\n\n    Cell lysates (2 microliters) were added to 38 microliters of AGAL assay buffer (sodium citrate 27 mM-sodium phosphate dibasic 46 mM, 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside 5 mM and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 100 mM, pH 4.5) and incubated for 1 h at 37 C. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The reaction was stopped by adding 360 microliters of 1 M sodium carbonate buffer. Fluorescence was detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclypse-Varian) at 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission.\n\n    A 4-methylumbelliferone standard curve ranging from 5 nM to 25 micromolar was run in parallel for conversion of fluorescence data to AGAL activity expressed as nmol/mg protein per min.\n\n    Standard deviations and p values in figure 1 (paired two-tailed Student 's t-test) were obtained using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office professional 2010).\n\n    Western blot analysis for the detection of AGAL was performed by using polyclonal antibody produced in rabbit (Abcam 70520) and HRP-coniugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody produced in goat (Bio-Rad 1706515).\n\n    After SDS-PAGE (4-20% acrylamide), proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk in blot solution at 4 C overnight, then treated with the primary antibody diluted in a blot solution 1:500 for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with an excess of blot solution, the membrane was treated with the secondary antibody diluted in the blot solution 1:2000 for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, the detection was performed by using the Immun-Star WesternC chemiluminescence detection kit (Bio-Rad). GAPDH was revealed using with mouse monoclonal anti lapine GAPDH (AbD seroTec (cat:4699-9555) 1:20000. Fabrazyme  (agalsidase-beta; Genzyme Europe B. V., NL). All other chemicals were from Bio-Rad.\n\n    Models of all AGAL mutants are constructed using PDB file 3GXT as template. Side chains were substituted with the program ANDANTE, which predicts side-chain conformations by use of environment-specific substitution probabilities and a high-quality rotamer library.\n\n    SDM uses a set of conformationally constrained environment-specific substitution tables and calculates the difference in the stability scores for the folded and unfolded state of each mutant and the wild-type protein. It uses as inputs the mutants generated with ANDANTE and the structure of the wild type enzyme.\n\n    Residue percent accessibility in AGAL dimer structure (3GXT) was calculated with PSA v2.0 which uses the rolling probe algorithm. We assigned each residue in the wild type AGAL structure 3GTX to alpha helices, beta sheets, poly-proline helix or other with the program SEGNO.\n\n    MUPRO1.1 was run locally, using as inputs only AGAL sequence, the position affected by the mutation, the original and the mutant amino-acid.\n\n    The programs SDM, ANDANTE and PSA were kindly provided by T. Blundell and collaborators. MUPRO1.1 was kindly provided by Dr J. Cheng.",
        "Results": "    Three-hundred AGAL mutant sequences from Uniprot/Swissprot and HGMD were analyzed with the method described previously. This method relies on a Position Specific Substitution Matrix (PSSM) calculated from sequences homologous to AGAL. It assigns a score to a mutation taking into account the degree of conservation of the wild type amino acid in homologous sequences and the specific substitution that is introduced: if the new amino-acid is present in homologous species, a less negative score is obtained. The method was benchmarked and a threshold was set: scores equal or higher than -1 were associated with mutations responsive to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin with 87% accuracy (correctly predicted responsive mutations plus correctly predicted non responsive mutations divided by total number per 100).\n\n    Among the AGAL mutations present in HGMD and as yet untested for their responsiveness to PC, we found 35 mutations scoring 0 or -1. We selected 4 representative mutations with score 0, and 5 representative mutations with score = -1 for further analysis.\n\n    This is a minimal set, but it is a good representation of the different types of mutations that can be encountered in AGAL. The set includes mutations occurring in different structural domains of the protein (TIM or beta), in different elements of secondary structure (alpha helix, beta strand, coil, polyproline II), at solvent exposed or non exposed sites. We also included mutations with different thermodynamic stability (assessed with MUPRO or SDM) and the rare case of a mutation affecting a non conserved residue of the active site (table 1). Mutant enzymes were produced by site directed mutagenesis and expressed transiently in COS-7 cells.\n\n    Consistent with the clinical phenotype (classic FD) associated with mutations A230T, R301P, L310F, E341D and V269M, the activity of the enzymes carrying these mutations was very close to the background i.e. the activity of COS-7 cells transfected with the void vector (figure 1). Four cases of hemizygotes affected with variable symptoms, ranging from severe to mild and with low to intermediate residual AGAL activity, were described for T410A. This mutation, had a residual activity just above background when expressed in COS-7 cells. For L300F we also measured residual activity above background, but no information is given on whether the associated phenotype of the patient was classic or mild. We measured residual activity above background for D244H which was identified in a heterozygous female whose affected sons had the classic phenotype and for Q280K.\n\n    Most mutations associated to Fabry disease have been observed in single families and for this reason both the classification based on symptoms and the correlation with residual activity can be difficult.\n\n    The comparison of enzymatic activity of mutants with that of wild type expressed in COS-7 is summarized in figure 1; red bars indicate results obtained without the treatment with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin and blue bars indicate results obtained culturing the cells with 20 micromolar 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin for 48 hours.\n\n    It is unsurprising that exposure to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin enhances alpha-galactosidase activity, even in the cells transfected with the wild type AGAL construct, since it was demonstrated, using scanning calorimetry, that wild type AGAL is stabilized by 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin at both neutral and acidic pH. Conditions that stabilize proteins, such as the presence of PCs, can increase the fraction of newly folded enzyme exported from the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n    Seven out of nine mutations recovered 15% of wild type activity or more (figure 1), the exceptions being A230T and E341D. Although severity of Fabry disease correlates with the level of residual activity, it is difficult to determine the minimum level necessary to prevent the classic phenotype.\n\n    In order to set such a level we collected two groups of data from literature. The first group comprises 72 mutations whose residual activity has been assayed in fibroblasts derived from male patients, the second group comprises 21 mutations produced by site directed mutagenesis and assayed in COS cells. The authors of the original papers provided the phenotype associated with each mutation. In both groups, mutations with a residual activity higher than 12% were associated with atypical/late phenotype, the only exception being E59K with 19 +- 3% residual activity. This mutant has an abnormally high Km; hence it might have a high residual activity at the saturating conditions which are generally used to assay enzymes in vitro, but not at the physiological concentrations of substrate present in the cell.\n\n    In consideration of the error associated with residual activity measures, we rounded by excess the minimum level sufficient to prevent classic phenotype to 15%. Our threshold was set quite cautiously, but does not differ significantly from that estimated by Fan and Ishii who stated \"one would assume that residual enzyme activity greater than 10% of normal in hemizygote patients might be sufficient at reducing the majority of clinical symptoms\".\n\n    In women, the residual enzymatic activity differs from cell to cell due to X-inactivation and so values measured in serum might not correlate with the severity of the disease; nonetheless, raising residual activity above a minimal level in cells expressing the mutant allele, can still be beneficial for female patients.\n\n    The strongest response in terms of ratio between cellular activity obtained with or without treatment with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin was observed with L300F (table 1). Unfortunately in this case we were not able to deduce from the original paper the phenotype of the affected patients, but we learned from literature that a mutation affecting the same site, L300P, is associated with classic phenotype and is responsive to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin with an even higher increase of activity.\n\n    Human alpha-galactosidase is synthesized as a precursor of 50 kDa, but it is converted into a mature form of 46 kDa. A detailed analysis of Ishii and coworkers demonstrated that when AGAL mutants are correctly processed into a 46 kDa form, they are also transferred into lysosomes. We first compared the migration of wild-type AGAL expressed in COS-7 cells, with and without treatment with PCs, to that of the precursor form (Fabrazyme ). In order to have bands of similar intensity, we loaded 20 micrograms of COS-7 extracts non treated with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin, 15 micrograms of COS-7 extract treated with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin (48 hours 20 micromolar), 20 micrograms of COS-7 extracts from cells transfected with void vector to which we added 20 nanograms of Fabrazyme ). and 20 nanograms of Fabrazyme ). AGAL bands were revealed by Western blot. As predicted, AGAL expressed in COS-7 migrated as 46 kDa band while the precursor migrated as 50 kDa band (figure 2 panel A). We then tested the migration of the mutants.\n\n    D244H, V269M, Q280K, L300F, R301P, L310F,T410 migrated as the wild type enzyme (figure 2 panel B and C) and upon treatment of cells with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin (48 hours 20 micromolar), the same protein band was observed with enhanced intensity. In figure 2 panel D the bands produced by those mutants displaying a low relative increase of activity upon treatment with the drug (fold increase <3 in table 1) were detected with longer acquisition time. A230T shows a faint band corresponding to the precursor form of AGAL which is not induced by the treatment with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin, V269M and E341D on the other hand, show bands corresponding to that of the mature form upon induction although the intensity of the band of the latter mutant is very weak.\n\n    The results of Western blot analysis demonstrates that treatment with the drug enhances the quantity of AGAL in the cell possibly stabilizing it and preventing its degradation.\n\n    We measured the ratio of the cellular activity of AGAL mutants treated or not treated with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin and expressed it as fold increase (table 1). We calculated structural and functional characteristics and PSSM score for each mutant and reported them together with the clinical phenotype obtained from literature (table 1). As previously explained, the mutations were chosen among those present in HDMG as representative cases with a relatively high score (0 or -1) obtained with the method based on PSSM construction.\n\n    :AGAL is a dimeric protein, each subunit being formed by a TIM barrel catalytic domain (res 32-325) and a small 8 stranded beta domain (res 326-429) whose function is not known. We showed that occurrence in the TIM barrel catalytic domain does not prevent responsiveness to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin. This does not contradict the observation reported in literature that mutations in the beta domain are mainly responsive, but reinforces the idea that mutations responsive to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin are widespread in the enzyme structure.\n\n    We listed structural features such as main chain and side chain accessibility of the affected site, type and length of the secondary structure where mutation occurs, the effect of the mutation on thermodynamic stability assessed with a method which rely on 3D-structure, such as SDM, or with a method which relies only on the sequence of the affected protein and the nature of the mutation, such as MUPRO.\n\n    All the mutants respond to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin in terms of fold increase (table 1), but if we consider the percentage of activity in the presence of 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin compared to that of wild type, E341D and A230T might not recover enough activity to revert classic phenotype (figure 1). E341D is not conserved in homologous sequences and hence gets a high score by the PSSM, nonetheless it has a small response. An explanation exists for this since E341 occurs in a completely buried site and its mutation to aspartate is negatively scored by SDM, with a medium/severe adverse effect on thermodynamic stability (table 1). As demonstrated in our previous paper, SDM scores and solvent accessibility correlate with responsiveness; therefore co-occurrence of a low SDM score and low solvent accessibility explains the low response of E341D to the drug.\n\n    In contrast, A230 is exposed to solvent and its mutation to Threonine is mildly destabilizing.\n\n    Analysis of the enzyme active site explains why A230T responds very little to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin. A230 is not directly implicated in catalysis, but it is flanking D231, a proton donor that is essential for the hydrolysis of the substrate.\n\n    In addition, A230 belongs to a stretch of amino acids (229-232) that adopts a poly-proline II helix structure: this kind of secondary structure is quite rare in proteins and is often associated to special functions. Figure 3 shows the active site of AGAL and the side chain of residues binding 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin like D231, the backbone of aminoacids 229-232 and the side chain of A230 are shown. The characteristic three fold symmetry of the polyproline-helix can be seen from the spatial disposition of the carbonyl bonds. Although a direct proof could come only solving the X-ray structure of A230T, we can tentatively suggest that this secondary structure is affected by the mutation.\n\n    Close proximity to an essential residue and occurrence in a poly-proline helix explains why the mutation to Threonine results in a non responsive enzyme: mutations affecting the active site should be unable to bind the chaperone.\n\n    In this study we tested our method on mutations that had not been included into the training set and in particular on cases which our method predicted as responsive to the pharmacological therapy. Given that a therapy of general applicability (ERT) is already available, it is very important to prove that the percentage of false positive cases is low. We found that of nine AGAL mutants getting a PSSM score of 0 or -1 and expressed in cultured cells, seven responded to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin. In order to further validate the precision of our method, we looked in the literature for additional mutations which had been tested with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin, but not used in the training set of our method. We gathered 11 responsive and 8 non responsive cases and calculated their PSSM scores (table 2). In this set, the five mutations scoring -1 or 0 were all responsive, those scoring -2 were mostly (4/6) responsive, those scoring less than -2 were mostly (6/8) non responsive.\n\n    We calculated structural and functional characteristics and the PSSM score for each mutant (table 2) together with the responsiveness to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin \"in vitro\" obtained from literature. As A230T (table 1), three mutations in this set affect the active site and are, invariably, non responsive to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin.\n\n    This result reinforces the caveat which should always be born in mind when considering PCs for clinical applications: the function of a chaperone is to stabilize the conformational structure of the enzyme, prevent its degradation before it reaches the operative location, but in no case PCs can restore the activity of an enzyme whose active site has been affected by a mutation.",
        "Conclusion": "    A surprising high percentage of missense mutations is found in a relatively small protein such as lysosomal alpha galactosidase for reasons that are still unclear. A survey of the list of human proteins associated with diseases provided by Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humpvar release 8_2_2011) provides a flavour of the peculiarity of AGAL_HUMAN and reveals that, excluding tumour suppressors, this protein has the fifth highest ratio between reported missense mutations and chain length; only chain A and B of haemoglobin, Gap junction beta-1 protein (associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), Transthyretin (associated with amyloidosis type 1) and Phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (associated with phenylketonuria) have higher rates. The number of missense mutations is likely to increase, since an average of 20-25 novel mutations per year have been identified in the last decade in Fabry disease cases and others are expected from the AGAL mutation screening of the general population.\n\n    After genotyping Fabry disease cases, clinicians will face a multitude of different molecular defects and will have to counsel patients about the best therapy to adopt. Enzyme replacement therapy has general applicability, but pharmacological chaperones offer several advantages. This is especially true in the late on-set forms of the disease, when a therapy to prevent the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and hence to delay organ damage, has to be suggested to patients who still have little or no symptoms.\n\n    In order to counsel Fabry patients clinicians need to know conditions that are sufficient to make mutations responsive to PC. Regrettably only conditions that are sufficient, but not necessary, to make mutations non responsive to PC are clearly identifiable.\n\n    By analyzing in silico 96 mutations, we previously proposed a method that calculates a score based on the construction of PSSM. We have now tested this method on 14 new mutations scoring >-2 and found that 12 (86%) of them were responsive to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin. These values differ significantly (Fisher two tailed p value <0.01) from the percentage of mutations (42%) recovering activity (>15% of wild type) in screenings carried out by independent laboratories on randomly collected mutations.\n\n    In figure 4, panel A, we summarize the results obtained on all AGAL mutants tested \"in vitro\" so far which were responsive to 20 micromolar 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin(or had an EC50 <20 micromolar). The responsive cases are 86% among the mutations scoring >-2 and only 20% among the mutations scoring <-2 and no responsive cases were observed so far below -3. The correlation between percentage of responsive mutations and PSSM scores in the range +1/-4, is very high and statistically significant, (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.96 with two-tailed p-value 0.003) figure 4 panel B.\n\n    Our guideline for clinicians is the following: if a new or as-yet untested AGAL mutation has a PSSM score >-2 it is likely to be responsive to 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin; if it gets a PSSM <-2 it is likely to be non responsive; if it gets PSSM scores -2 it is in a twilight zone where a case by case judgment is necessary. We are aware that a bioassay on cells derived from patients carrying a specific mutation represents a more convincing proof of the efficacy of the treatment with 1-deoxy-galactonojirimycin in any given case. However, we feel that the simplicity and low cost of our method means that it should be considered favorably by clinicians.",

        "Title": "    Genome-Wide Association Study of Treatment Refractory Schizophrenia in Han Chinese",
        "Abstract": "    We report the first genome-wide association study of a joint analysis using 795 Han Chinese individuals with treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS) and 806 controls. Three loci showed suggestive significant association with TRS were identified. These loci include: rs10218843 (P = 3.04x10-7) and rs11265461 (P = 1.94x10-7) are adjacent to signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1); rs4699030 (P = 1.94x10-6) and rs230529 (P = 1.74x10-7) are located in the gene nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1); and rs13049286 (P = 3.05x10-5) and rs3827219 (P = 1.66x10-5) fall in receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (RIPK4). One isolated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs739617 (P = 3.87x10-5) was also identified to be associated with TRS. The -94delATTG allele (rs28362691) located in the promoter region of NFKB1 was identified by resequencing and was found to associate with TRS (P = 4.85x10-6). The promoter assay demonstrated that the -94delATTG allele had a significant lower promoter activity than the -94insATTG allele in the SH-SY5Y cells. This study suggests that rs28362691 in NFKB1 might be involved in the development of TRS.",
        "Introduction": "    Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a prevalence estimated to be approximately 1% in the world and 0.6% in Taiwan. It is the third-leading cause of disability among individuals age between 15 and 44. Its clinical manifestations are characterized by distortion of reality, delusions, hallucinations, altered emotional reactivity, disorganized behavior, social isolation and cognitive impairment. The etiology of schizophrenia is not well understood but it has been postulated as a complex disease with an estimated heritability as high as 80%  .\n\n    Genetic studies based on linkage and positional candidate genes approaches have suggested multiple candidate molecules in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, including the receptors of antipsychotics (DRD2 , HTR2A , CHRNA7 , TAAR6 ); the enzymes affecting neurotransmitter metabolisms (COMT , DAOA ), factors involved in microtubules function (DISC1 ), neuronal differentiation (NRG1 ), signal transduction (RGS4 ) and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase (PPP3CC ). However, most of these genes lack of replicable support across populations.\n\n    Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a hypothesis-free approach to comprehensively identify disease susceptibility loci. It has identified several susceptible genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, such as SNPs located on or near genes involved in transcriptional regulations (ZNF804A  and ZNF184 ); neuronal functioning (NRGN , and ANK3 ); cytokine activities (CSF2RA  and IL3RA ), inflammatory responses (PLAA ), immune function (MHC region and TCF4 ); brain development (RPGRIP1L , PLXNA2 , RELN ); endocrine function (ACSM1 ); and chromatin remodeling (SMARCA2 ). However, these studies have not replicated the candidate genes or linkage studies in schizophrenia and most of the findings from GWAS are still inconsistent. The discordant results were likely due to the phenotypic variability associated with schizophrenia since schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder as well as the lack of statistical power due to find common variants of susceptibility.\n\n    Antipsychotic medication is the major treatment for schizophrenia. However, one fifth to one third of schizophrenic patients do not respond to antipsychotic treatments. These patients with treatment refractory schizophrenia (TRS) have persistent psychotic symptoms combining with poor social/work function in spite of administering at least two trials of sufficient antipsychotic doses and adequate treatment duration. Comparing with those patients with adequate responses to antipsychotic treatments, patients with TRS had significantly lower levels of catecholamine in cerebrospinal fluid or plasma, increased cortical atrophy, and a lower level of plasma tryptophan concentrations. Therefore, TRS may be a distinct and homogenous subgroup of schizophrenia.\n\n    To identify the genetic variants susceptible for schizophrenia, this study performed the first GWAS focusing on TRS in a Han-Chinese population. We identified several novel genetic loci which were not associated with schizophrenia. Our findings may pave a new way to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of schizophrenia and to improve the treatment for TRS.",
        "Methods": "    This study was approved by the Institute Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital Kaohsiung, Kai-Suan Psychiatric Hospital, Jianan Mental Hospital, Bali Psychiatric Center, Tsyr-Huey Mental Hospital, Yuli Veterans Hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital and Academia Sinica. Written informed consent was obtained from all the study participants.\n\n    A total of 522 unrelated patients with TRS, including 289 males (55.4%) and 233 females (44.6%), were recruited from Yuli Veterans Hospital, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung Kai-Suan Psychiatric Hospital, Tsyr-Huey Mental Hospital, Jianan Mental Hospital, and Bali Psychiatric Center. DNA samples from additional 273 TRS patients were obtained from National Taiwan University Hospital and were used in joint analysis. In addition, DNA samples from 1982 schizophrenic patients were obtained from Yuli Veterans Hospital, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and National Health Research Institutes. However, the responses to antipsychotic treatments for 1982 schizophrenic patients were not determined.\n\n    All patients were diagnosed according to the criteria of DSM-IV for schizophrenia. TRS was defined using a modified Conley and Kelly's protocol. Briefly, schizophrenic patients with the following criteria were identified as TRS: No improvement in clinical impression (defined as 3 or more in the global improvement subscale of clinical global impression (CGI-I)) after at least two six-week trials of antipsychotic therapy at a dose equal to or higher than the equivalent daily dose of 600 mg of chlorpromazine for typical antipsychotics, or for second-generation antipsychotics (risperidone: 6 mg/day; olanzapine: 20 mg/day; quetiapine: 800 mg/day; ziprasidone: 160 mg/day; amisulpride: 800 mg/day; zotepine: 300 mg/day), as well as for patients who were administered the last-line antipsychotic pharmacotherapy, clozapine (50-300 mg/day). All patients with TRS showed more than 5 years of persistent illness (defined as 4 or more in the severity of illness subscale of clinical global impression (CGI-S)). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Only the Han-Chinese population, which accounts for 98% of the population in Taiwan, was recruited for this study.\n\n    The control (N = 2806) was randomly selected from the Han-Chinese Cell and Genome Bank in Taiwan described previously, in which more than 3,300 controls were collected and randomly selected through registry.\n\n    Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using PUREGENE DNA purification system (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Whole-genome scan was conducted using Affymetrix  Genome-wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) on 522 TRS patients and 806 controls and genotyping was performed by National Genotyping Center at Academia Sinica. Genotype calling was determined by Affymetrix Power Tool 1.10.2 (Affymetrix) using default parameters.\n\n    Quality control of genotype data was performed by examining several summary statistics. First, individual's gender was double checked by calculating the ratio of loci with heterozygous calls on the X chromosome; After calculating total successful call rate and the minor allele frequency (MAF) of cases and controls for each SNP, SNPs were excluded if one of the following conditions applied: (1) only one allele appeared in both cases and controls; (2) the total call rate was less than 98%; (3) the total MAF was less than 5% and the total call rate was less than 99%; (4) significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group (P<10-4).\n\n    Detection of possible population stratification that might influence association analysis was carried out using principal component analysis (supplementary Methods S1, Supplementary Table S7) with genotype data for 100,000 SNPs located at equally spacing across the human genome. Plink (Supplementary Methods S2) was performed to examine if the subjects were related with each other. Variance inflation factor for genomic control was estimated based on all qualified SNPs (Supplementary Methods S3).\n\n    Genotyping data analysis was carried out by comparing the frequencies of allele and genotype between cases and controls using the following single-point methods: genotype, allele-type, trend test (Cochran-Armitage test), dominant, and recessive models. Empirical P-values were also obtained with 108 simulations. SNPs with P-values less than alpha = 10-8, a cut-off for the multiple-comparison adjusted by Bonferroni correction, were considered to be significantly associated with the traits. SNPs with P-values between 10-8 and 10-5 were considered to have suggestive significant association. Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots were then used to examine P-value distributions (Supplementary Figure S6).\n\n    Multi-point/haplotype analysis was performed using the Haplotype Score Test implemented in haplo.stat, a suite of S-PLUS/R routines for the analysis of indirectly measured haplotypes, for regions with more than two SNPs having genetic evidences (P-value<10-5). Regions were tested with independent 106 simulations.\n\n    Autosomal SNPs with P-value<10-5 from GWAS in 522 TRS cases and 806 controls were further validated using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (SEQUENOM MassARRAY, Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). The SNPs retained after cross-platform validation were then genotyped in the additional 273 TRS cases. Joint analysis was then carried out with all the 795 TRS cases and 806 control.\n\n    Selected candidate genes were re-sequenced in a discovery cohort consisted of 94 TRS patients and 94 controls. Exons, 200 bp of exon/intron junctions, and a 2-kb region covering the promoter of the selected genes were sequenced using Applied Biosystems 3730 (CA, USA). Contig assembly and SNP identification were determined using Sequencher 4.5 Demo (Gene Codes Cooperation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). All PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced.\n\n    To assay for the NFKB1 promoter activity, the NFKB1 promoter encompassing the -94ATTG polymorphism (from -1000 to -1) from patients with homozygous -94ATTGATTG (W) or -94ATTG (D) were first cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with the forward primer: 5'-CCCGGGCCTGATTACTGATGTTTTAAAGCT-3' and the reverse primer: 5'-CTCGAGTTCCTGGCTGGAAATTCCCACTGA-3'. Both the W and D fragments were then released from the pGEM-T Easy vector and subcloned into the upstream region of the firefly luciferase gene of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). All constructs were subjected to sequencing to confirm the orientation and integrity.\n\n    A total of 1x105 SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate and transfected with 450 ng of each reporter construct along with 50 ng of pRL-TK vector (Promega) containing the Renilla luciferase gene as an indicator for normalization of transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed by using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 24 hours and analyzed for luciferase activity with the Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Firefly luminescence was normalized to Renilla luminescence and reported as relative luciferase activity. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.",
        "Results": "    Demographic data from 522 TRS patients and 806 controls is listed in Table 1. The mean age was 44.12+-9.06 years in cases and 67.64+-9.36 years in controls. The male made up approximately 55% in cases and 48% in controls. Of these patients, 121 patients (23.2%) had a family history of psychiatric disorders; 264 patients (50.6%) displayed psychotic symptoms before age 20; 289 patients (55.4%) had shown violent or homicidal behavior; and 197 patients (37.7%) had attempted suicide. All of the patients showed persistence of their illness for more than 5 years, with a persistent CGI-S score of 4 or higher under antipsychotic treatments.\n\n    The average call rate was 99.8+-0.3% for each subject genotyped in this study. Gender determined from the GWAS result for all the subjects were consistent with recorded data. 694,436 (79.99%) of the 868,114 SNP in the autosomes passed the quality control filter and had an average call rate of 99.8+-0.4% (Supplementary Table S1). The results of principal component analysis showed no significance for population stratification between TRS patients and controls, (P>0.05, and Fst statistics between populations <0.001) (Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, genomic control with a variance inflation factor lambda = 1.042 (trend test), estimated posterior to the regular GWAS, also indicated no substantial population stratification. These SNPs were then taken for further GWAS analysis.\n\n    Data analysis was first performed for the 522 TRS patients and 806 controls (Figure 1). Preliminary results revealed 19 SNPs with suggestive significant associations with TRS (Supplementary Table S2, 10-8<P<10-5). Fourteen markers were retained after cross platform validation with the Sequenom platform and showed a concordance rate of over 98% (Supplementary Table S2).\n\n    Four major clusters with more than one SNPs located within 500 kb of each other were identified from the 14 validated SNPs (Table 2, Figure 2). The first locus, comprising rs10218843 (P = 6.73x10-6) and rs11265461 (P = 5.90x10-6), and is located approximately 10 kb downstream of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF1) on chromosome 1; the second locus contains two SNPs, rs4699030 (P = 8.41x10-7) and rs230529 (P = 1.07x10-6), is located in the introns of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1) on chromosome 4; three SNPs, rs739617 (P = 1.46x10-5), rs17158926 (P = 3.99x10-5) and rs17158930 (P = 3.08x10-5) are clustered in the introns of dedicator of cytokinesis 4 (DOCK4) on chromosome 7; and the last locus which consists of two SNPs, rs13049286 (P = 1.23x10-5) and rs3827219 (P = 1.23x10-5), is located in receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (RIPK4) on chromosome 21. These loci are located in the regions with high LD (except for chromosome 21) (Supplementary Figure S2). Multipoint/Haplotype analysis also showed that these clusters were associated with TRS, the cluster on chromosome 4 had the highest P value with global score P = 2x10-5 (Supplementary Table S3).\n\n    In addition to the above SNPs in clusters, five other SNPs also showed suggestive significant association with TRS. These SNPs are: rs461409 (P = 2.63x10-6) which is located 175 kb downstream of RGM domain family, member B (RGMB) on chromosome 5; rs123533497 (P = 1.04x10-5) in intron 14 of A-kinase anchor protein 9 (AKAP9) on chromosome 7; rs9314462 (P = 5.30x10-5) in the downstream of CUB and sushi domain-containing protein 1 (CSMD1) on chromosome 8; rs9646303 (P = 1.15x10-5) in intron 3 of zinc finger, CCHC domain containing 14 (ZCCHC14) on chromosome 16; and rs11673496 (P = 1.75x10-5), 60 kb upstream of zinc finger protein 492 (ZNF492) on chromosome 19 (Table 2, Supplementary Figure S3).\n\n    Except for rs13049286 and rs3827219 with odds ratio (OR) of approximately 3, all other SNPs identified in this study showed modest effects with OR between 1.06-1.81 (Table 2).\n\n    The 14 SNPs showing suggestive significance were then genotyped in an independent cohort of 273 TRS patients. An average call rate of 99.37+-0.21% was achieved for each subject. Joint analysis was then carried out in the 795 cases and 806 controls. Of the 14 SNPs showing suggestive association in the initial analysis, 7SNPs remain suggestively associated with TRS after joint analysis (Table 2). These SNPs are: rs10218843 (P joint = 3.04x10-7) and rs11265461 (P joint = 1.94x10-7), which both are located in SLAMF1; rs230529 (P joint = 1.47x10-7) and rs4699030 (P joint = 1.94x10-6) are located in NFKB1; rs739617 (P joint = 3.87x10-5) is in DOCK4; rs13049268 (P joint = 3.05x10-5) and rs3827219 (P joint = 1.66x10-5) which are located in RIPK4.\n\n    The top SNPs showing suggestive significance were then tested in an independent cohort of 1982 schizophrenic patients whose responses to antipsychotic treatments were not determined and additional 2000 controls. An average call rate of 99.37+-0.21% was achieved for each subject. However, none of these SNPs were significantly associated with this group of patients (Supplementary Table S4), suggesting that these SNPs were specifically associated with TRS and not a broad phenotype of schizophrenia.\n\n    Because the lowest P values in both single and multi-point analysis were observed for the SNPs located on NFKB1 on chromosome 4, we next aimed to identify variants with functional consequence in NFKB1. Re-sequencing was performed on the exons, intron-exon boundaries, and a 2-kb region covering the promoter of NFKB1 in a discovery cohort of 94 TRS patients and 94 controls. Twenty-three genetic polymorphisms including 11 novel variants and 2 non-synonymous changes (R231L and R534H) were identified in NFKB1 (Table 3). The rs28362491 SNP with an ATTG deletion in the promoter region of NFKB1 (94delATTG) was reported to affect nuclear protein binding and gene transcription in colonic epithelial cells. In a test with 520 TRS cases and 806 controls, rs28362491 was associated with TRS (P = 6.69x10-5). rs28362491 is in linkage disequilibrium with rs230529 and rs4699030 (r2 = 0.741 and 0.714, respectively) (Figure 3).\n\n    Since rs28362491 has been reported to affect nuclear protein binding and gene transcription in colonic epithelial cells, it is possible that the deletion also alters the efficiency of transcription in neuronal cells. The promoter assay showed that the construct containing the -94delATTG promoter displayed significantly reduced luciferase activity (2.07+-0.13) as compared with the wild type construct (2.59+-0.07) (P = 0.003) (Figure 4).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study presented the data of the first GWAS on TRS in a Han-Chinese population. Therefore, the use of genomic control did not substantially change the results of this GWAS (Supplementary Table S5). The sample size is comparatively smaller than in previous GWAS for schizophrenia due to the smaller number of TRS patients available Since schizophrenia is an etiologically heterogeneous disorder, narrowing schizophrenia down to TRS may represent a more discrete and genetically homogeneous group to identify genes involved in the etiology of schizophrenia.\n\n    Among the genetic loci with suggestive significance identified by this study, three regions with more than one significant SNP in each region stood out after joint analysis. rs4699030 and rs230529 are located in the introns of NFKB1. This gene encodes for two functional different proteins, one for the 105 kD (p105) protein, and the other for a 50 kD (p50) protein. P105 contains seven copies of ankyrin-like sequence in the carboxyl terminal region which is similar to those in I-kappa B kinase (IkappaB), therefore, p105 may also have functions similar to IkappaB. P105 could associate with either c-Rel or RelA in the cytoplasm to inhibit Rel protein-specific transcription. P50 is one subunit of NF-kappa B with repression activity. NF-kappa B is well distributed and a highly conserved dimeric transcriptional factor which regulates more than 200 genes. Different dimeric combinations of NF-kappa B are found in different tissues and respond differently to regulate gene expressions. P50 assembles either with other NF-kappa B subunits, such as RelA, RelB, c-Rel, or with itself as a homodimer to repress NF-kappa B-dependent gene transcriptions. The heterodimer of p50 and RelA subunit is the most abundant form of NF-kappa B.\n\n    Both rs10218843 and rs11265461 are located near SLAMF1 (also known as CD150), which is a signaling lymphocyte activation molecule and a member of the CD2 family belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors. SLAM is a co-stimulatory molecule involving T cell activation and also as a receptor for measles virus, a bacterial sensor, and responsible for the NKT lineage development.The activation of SLAM has been shown to associate with numerous distinct downstream activities, including augmenting T cell mediated cytotoxicity through a sequence of signaling transduction, including NF-kappa B activation, Stat1 phosphorylation and T-bet induction; increasing recruitment of protein kinase C (PKC)-theta and the activation of NF-kappa B p50, both of which are involved in enhancing T helper 2 cytokines production and natural killer T cell development.\n\n    Two SNPs, rs13049286 and rs3827219 are both located in RIPK4. The expression of RIPK4 is well distributed, including the brain, and found to interact with PKC-delta. This gene is important in sensing cellular stress, such as infection, inflammation, cellular differentiation programs and DNA damage. It also mediates downstream signaling, in particular the activation of NF-kappa B and the induction of apoptosis.\n\n    The identification of NFKB1, RIPK4, and SLAMF1 in this study suggests that the NF-kappa B pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TRS. NF-kappa is also found to be related with schizophrenia since the genetic variants in RELA gene, which encoded the protein RelA as one subunit of NF-kappa B, were reported to be associated with schizophrenia and the patients startle responses in a Japanese population. NF-kappa B is a key transcriptional factor in the regulation of the expression of many inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Several studies have demonstrated that schizophrenic patients' cerebrospinal fluid and plasma had abnormal levels of cytokines, the aberrations were especially more pronounced in TRS. Song et al. found the elevated level of cytokine in first-episode schizophrenic patients was associated with the activation of NF-kappa B. Thus, these suggest abnormal inflammatory response could lead to TRS. One common variant rs28362691 (-94ins/delATTG) identified from resequencing NFKB1 was found to associate with TRS. This SNP is located in 19 base pairs upstream of a functional kappaB binding site. The promoter assay showed that the NFKB1 promoter with the -94delATTG allele had a lower promoter activity in SH-SY5Y cells in comparison with the -94insATTG allele. This implies that the -94delATTG allele may result in lower expression of NFKB1. Changes in NFKB1 expression could alter the level of p105 and induce divergent dimeric combinations of NF-kappa B, which might cause disturbances in cytokine regulations, and lead to a failure of antipsychotic treatment. However, the association between the abnormal levels of cytokines and NF-kappa B in patients with TRS remains to be established. Two novel non-synonymous polymorphisms (R231L and R534H) were also identified from resequencing. However, these polymorphisms have extremely low frequency in the Han population and their effects on NFKB1 function remain to be elucidated.\n\n    Other genetic loci identified in association with TRS in this study suggests genes involved in neuronal development (DOCK4 ). A recent study conducted in the Jewish population also identified a SNP (rs2074127) in DOCK4 associated with schizophrenia however, this SNP is not in LD with the DOCK4 SNPs reported in this study (Supplementary Figure S4). Its role in the development of TRS remains to be elucidated.\n\n    We also compared our results with previous genetic studies showing associations with TRS (such as variants in CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , DRD3 , HTR2A , HTR3A ), none of the variants or their nearby SNPs had a P value lower than 10-5 in this study. It implicated that these above genes involving in metabolic enzymes and receptors of antipsychotics were not associated with TRS. Furthermore, we also compared our data with previous GWAS on schizophrenia. We examined the P values of the loci previously reported to be associated with schizophrenia in our data. We also checked the vicinity (200 kb) of the reported loci in our data. Only rs1602565 on chromosome 11 showed nominal association (P = 3.17x10-4) in this study (Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Figure S5). These data suggested that the genetic loci identified in this study were specifically associated with TRS.\n\n    None of the loci identified in this study reached genome-wide significance, this could due to tour sample size lack the statistical power to detect common variants of susceptibility. However, we focused on TRS within schizophrenia, which may represent a more homogeneous group. An independent TRS group was also not available for replication study. Future replication studies in additional population of TRS are required.\n\n    In conclusion, we report the first GWAS on TRS in the Han Chinese population. Our data suggest that the NF-kappa B pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of TRS. We have also provided the functional effect of the -94delATTG allele showing the possible mechanism of NFKB1 in TRS. Further studies are required to confirm the association of the risk alleles identified in this study across different populations, to identify the causative genetic variants, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, which may help to improve treatments for refractory schizophrenia.",

        "Title": "    GNAO1 encephalopathy: further delineation of a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome affecting females",
        "Abstract": "    De novo heterozygous mutations in the GNAO1 gene, encoding the Galpha o subunit of G-proteins, are the cause of a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, featuring early infantile seizures, profound cognitive dysfunction and, occasionally, movement disorder (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-17).\n\n    We report a further case of this association in a 20 month-old Spanish girl with neonatal-onset refractory seizures, progressive microcephaly, oral-lingual dyskinesia and nearly absent psychomotor development. We performed whole-exome sequencing, a computational structural analysis of the novel gene variant identified and reviewed the previously reported cases.\n\n    Trio whole-exome-sequencing uncovered a de novo p.Leu199Pro GNAO1 mutation. Computational structural analysis indicates this novel variant adversely affects the stability of the G-protein heterotrimeric complex as a whole. Of note, our patient showed a sustained seizure reduction while on a ketogenic diet.\n\n    With this observation, a total of twelve patients with GNAO1 encephalopathy have been reported. Oral-lingual dyskinesia and responsiveness of seizures to ketogenic diet are novel features. The distorted sex ratio (12/12 females) of the condition remains unexplained; a differential gender effect of the disruption of G-protein- mediated signal transduction on the developing brain can be hypothesized.\n\n    The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13023-016-0416-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Introduction": "    Epileptic encephalopathy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by severe and progressive cognitive and behavioral impairments, which are most probably caused or worsened by epileptic activity. Heterozygous mutations in the GNAO1 gene (MIM*139311), encoding the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), were first described as a cause of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) in 2013. Subsequent reports have broadened the spectrum of clinical presentation which includes prominent dyskinesia and intellectual disability with few or no seizures (4) and the condition is currently classified as EIEE17 (MIM #615473). Interestingly, all the cases reported to date involve female subjects despite the disease-causing gene maps to chromosome 16q13.\n\n    The GNAO1 gene product is the alpha subunit of Go, a member of the G-protein family, involved in cellular signal transduction. Three functional G-protein subtypes are defined, namely inhibitory G-proteins (Gi), stimulatory G-proteins (Gs) and \"other\" (Go) the latter being abundantly expressed in the brain. Typically, G-proteins are characterized by their alpha subunit, which binds and hydrolyzes GTP and interacts with specific GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors) or effector molecules, such as adenylate cyclase. Relevant to neuronal excitability, Go proteins modulate neurotransmitter release by mediating the presynaptic auto-inhibitory effect of several neurotransmitters on their receptors, including M2/M4 muscarinic, alpha(2) adrenergic, mu/delta opioid and GABA-B receptors.\n\n    We here report the first Spanish girl with this disorder carrying a de novo GNAO1 heterozygous mutation. State-of-the-art computational analyses suggest that this novel variant causes significant defects in protein structural stability.",
        "Methods": "    The patient is a 21 month-old girl with a severe encephalopathy presenting with neonatal seizures. She is the second child of unrelated, healthy parents. A 4 year-old sister is healthy. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Neonatal physical examination was reportedly normal, with head circumference of 34 cm (35th percentile). Seizures appeared on the third day of life and were tonic generalized or manifested as facial congestion, drooling, or motor phenomena such as sucking, grimacing or winking. They lasted from seconds to a few minutes, recurred up to 40 times per day and were refractory to treatment, including a pyridoxal phosphate-containing vitamin cocktail.\n\n    She was referred for study at the age of 3 months. The physical examination revealed a head growth deceleration (head circumference at 38,8 cm, 3rd percentile), low-set ears without other dysmorphic features, drowsiness with lack of visual fixation when awake, decreased muscle tone, reduced spontaneous movements and occasional startle. Interictal EEG recordings showed diffuse background slowing, and multifocal high-voltaged sharp waves and spike and slow-wave complexes, with predominance over both central-parietal areas. An extensive metabolic workup, including CSF lactate, amino acids and neurotransmitter metabolites, array CGH, fundoscopic examination and visual evoked potentials were normal. A previous brain MRI study, performed at 18 days of life, showed signs consistent with mild cerebral atrophy, thin corpus callosum and delayed myelination (Fig. 1).\n\n    On follow-up, EEG's continued to show a slowed and high-voltaged background activity with poor differentiation and absent sleep elements plus very abundant, almost constant, bilateral sharp wave elements, consistent with severe epileptic encephalopathy. Seizures persisted unchanged despite the use of multiple antiepileptic drugs, including phenobarbital, valproate, levetiracetam, vigabatrin, carbamazepine, zonisamide, clobazam, topiramate and lacosamide in different combinations as well as a short trial with hydroaltesone. Although a slight improvement in seizure frequency was eventually obtained with a carbamazepine, topiramate and clobazam at age 11 months she was still suffering 15-20 seizures per day, mostly tonic generalized with upgaze deviation. With the institution of a 1:3 ketogenic diet (KD) seizure frequency progressively diminished and she remained seizure-free for almost two months. However, non-compliance with the KD resulted in recurrence of seizures. She currently averages 1-4 seizures per day. At age 19 months an EEG performed during sleep captured two seizures with, respectively, right and left mesial frontal origin. At age 21 months, the patient is severely disabled; she has not attained cephalic control or visual fixation and does not respond to any social cues. On examination, head circumference is 43 cm (<-3SD), height 86 cm (33th percentile) and weight 14 Kg (96th percentile). There is severe axial hypotonia, spastic tetraparesis, brisk deep tendon reflexes and paucity of voluntary movements. She has recently begun to display dyskinetic buccolingual movements, but without evidence of adventitious movements involving the trunk or limbs.\n\n    Peripheral blood samples were collected from the trio (patient and both progenitors). Genomic DNA was isolated using a standard salting-out method. The study was approved by the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents according to the Helsinki declaration.\n\n    Exome sequencing of DNA samples from the trio was performed at the Centre Nacional d'Analisi Genomica (CNAG) in Barcelona. 1 mug of genomic DNA was fragmented with an ultra sound device (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA), denatured and hybridized with capture oligos (NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome v3.0 exome enrichment kit, Roche, Madison, WI, USA) which enriches for ~44 Mb of the human exonic regions. Captured sequences were enriched with streptavidin-conjugated paramagnetic beads. End repair, A-tailing, Illumina adapter ligation and post-capture amplification were done with TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3, Illumina Corp, La Jolla, CA). Each captured exome was sequenced in one HiSeq2000 lane using version 3 chemistry. Coverage over 30X -was achieved for more than 80 % of the target. Alignment and variant calling were carried out following the GATK best practices for whole-exome sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to b37-decoy reference using BWA (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), then we marked duplicates, performed local realignment around indels, recalibrated the base quality scores, called variants with HaplotypeCaller and filtered them using Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) and hard filters. Refinement was done considering the pedigree, the population frequencies from Exome aggregation consortium (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/), NHLBI Exome Sequencig Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), 1000 genomes project (http://www.1000genomes.org/) and dbsnp (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) and finally, the functional annotation (SnpEff, SnpSift) and the disease. In a first tier analysis (diagnostic exome sequencing) we investigated any variants within genes previously associated with epilepsy. This was followed by consideration of variants in any other gene covered by WES (research exome sequencing). Both, de novo mutations and transmitted alleles were analyzed. All candidate selected de novo mutations were absent in ExAC, and passed visual inspection of alignment quality using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).\n\n    Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the GNAO1 de novo missense variant identified through whole-exome sequencing. To that end, exon six from the proband and progenitors was amplified by Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (PCR), purified and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit v3.1 and an automated sequencer ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) (primer sequences and PCR conditions available upon request).\n\n    The human WT Galphao protein was homology modeled from the crystal structure of mouse Galphao (PDB id: 3C7K) with MODELLER (residues 22-346, see Additional file 1: Table S1 for sequence alignment). The sequence identity between mouse and human protein is 98 %. During homology modeling, conserved residues were maintained in their original crystal structure rotameric orientation. The co-crystallized ligands GDP and MG were directly transferred from the crystal structure into the homology model. The WT homology model was energy-minimized in the AMBER14SB force-field with 1000 steps of steepest descent and 100 steps of conjugate gradients in CHIMERA. The p.Leu199Pro mutation was inserted into the WT homology model with CHIMERA by applying the most appropriate side-chain rotamer and then energy-minimizing the mutant protein as performed previously in the AMBER14SB force-field.\n\n    The predicted free-energy change (ddG) of the p.Leu199Pro mutation in human Galphao was made using ROSETTA with a conversion factor of 0.73 employed to convert Rosetta Energy Units to kcal/mol. The program was executed in \"high-resolution mode\" with full protein flexibility in side-chains and backbone (without bound GDP) and with the following flags: \"iterations\" set to 50, \"local_opt_only\" set to false, \"sc_min_only\" set to false, \"opt_radius\" set to 12.0, and \"fa_max_dis\" set to 9.0.\n\n    Both Galphao WT and Galphao Leu199Pro molecular dynamics (MD) systems were built using Amber LEap from AmberTools14. Ions were added to neutralize both systems and salt was added at a concentration of 0.2 M in each. Each system was then equilibrated with MD using ACEMD (Accelerating Biomolecular Dynamics in the Microsecond Time Scale) at 300  and a pressure of 1 atm (NPT) in the AMBER14SB force-field for a total of 7.0 ns with harmonic restraints on the protein progressively relaxed from 10 kcal mol-1 A-2 to 0 kcal mol-1 A-2. Production run MD simulations of 1000 ns were then performed for both WT and mutant Leu199Pro proteins at 300  (NVT) in the AMBER14SB force-field using ACEMD. VMD 1.9.2 was used for RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) analyses of MD simulations, including heat-map generation.",
        "Results": "    Whole exome sequencing from the patient and her parents (trio-based variant analysis) identified a single de novo variant within the epilepsy candidate genes, a heterozygous mutation GRCh37/hg19:chr16:56370645, NM_020988.2: c.596 T > C in GNAO1, producing the amino acid change p.Leu199Pro (NP_066268.1) in the proband. Read depth at the variant position was 38X, 42X and 50X for the proband and progenitors, respectively. The mutation was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2). This variant has not been previously described as related to the phenotype and is not present in any of the public genomic databases listed above. In silico prediction sofwares (SIFT, Mutation Taster andPolyPhen-2) classified the novel variant as damaging. Despite the location of the variant in close proximity to a splice junction, the ESEfinder and Netgene2 scores did not indicate an effect on splicing (data not shown).\n\n    The human WT Galphao protein with bound GDP was homology modeled from the crystal structure of mouse Galphao (PDB id: 3C7K) using MODELLER. As these proteins share 98 % sequence identity, homology modeling accuracy can be considered very high (see Methods for details and Supplementary Information). The Leu199Pro mutation was introduced with CHIMERA. The Leu199Pro mutation site is located in the GTPase domain of Galphao, specifically residing in the interior of a beta-sheet that is packed between the N- and C-termini and interacting with adjacent alpha-helices. According to the homology model of human Galphao, Leu199 is not involved in GDP/GTP binding so its mutation to proline is not predicted to directly affect ligand binding or hydrolysis (see Fig. 3a).\n\n    The WT and mutant forms of human Galphao were analysed with ROSETTA to calculate the predicted free-energy change (ddG) of the mutation. Using a conversion factor of 0.73 to convert from Rosetta Energy Units to kcal/mol, the predicted ddG of Leu199Pro is +6.1 kcal/mol. This suggests the mutation has a destabilizing effect on the protein and could possibly cause defects in its folding. To investigate this effect in more detail, both the WT protein and Leu199Pro mutant were subjected to a 1 mu-second MD simulation using ACEMD. During these simulations, the WT protein remains stable in terms of both its secondary and tertiary structure with an RMSD that fluctuates between 1.0 and 2.0 A (Fig. 3d). However the Leu199Pro mutant displays significant structural change in its GTPase domain, with multiple H-bonding in its central B-sheet broken, causing the creation of a large flexible loop region and increased positional fluctuation (Fig. 3c), with a protein RMSD of 1.5-3.0 A across the simulation (Fig. 3d). In addition, the mutation also affects other areas of the domain, in particular alpha-helices: 208-217 and 257-262, both which lose their structural integrity and experience greater positional fluctuation during the simulation (Fig. 3c).\n\n    In the context of the protein as a whole, heat-map representations of positional fluctuation reveal structural disturbances across both domains, GTPase and helical, in the mutant Leu199Pro protein (see Fig. 4). These disturbances occur in areas already described in the GTPase domain but also in several loop regions throughout the protein.",
        "Conclusion": "    We describe a further female patient with GNAO1-associated neonatal-onset epilepsy and a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Seizures were amenable to treatment with KD. Structural analysis of the novel mutation suggests it introduces significant structural instability into both the Galphao subunit and the whole G-protein heterotrimeric complex. The resulting defective cellular signal transduction is in all probability deleterious during brain development and putatively fatal in the male embryo.",
        "Discussion": "    Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-17 is a severe neurological disorder characterized by onset of intractable seizures in the first weeks or months of life, usually associated with EEG abnormalities, caused by heterozygous mutations in GNAO1. Neurological outcome is uniformly poor in all the infants described thus far. Imaging may disclose indistinct brain abnormalities, such as cerebral atrophy, delayed myelination, and/or or thin corpus callosum.\n\n    Including the present report, twelve patients with GNAO1 encephalopathy have been described (Table 1). Early-onset epileptic encephalopathy has been the most frequent presentation (n = 9), but two out of the eight described Japanese patients, showed either few, late-onset seizures or none at all. Clinical-EEG patterns are variable, and patients are referred to as suffering from Ohtahara, malignant migrating partial epilepsy of infancy, West syndrome or other forms of early epileptic encephalopathy phenotype. Some patients show involuntary movements, including chorea, dystonia, athetosis or stereotypies.\n\n    Refractoriness to antiepileptic drugs appears a common feature in all patients displaying the EIEE phenotype. In our patient a complete cessation of seizures was noted one month after the institution of a ketogenic diet and the patient remains seizure-free five months into the diet. Considering the widely admitted deleterious effect of seizures on the developing brain, institution of this therapeutic modality early in the evolution of GNAO1 encephalopathy seems advisable. Based on the loss of calcium-current inhibition found in vitro in GNAO1 mutants, resulting from altered Galphao -mediated signaling induced by norepinephrine, Nakamura et al. suggested the use of selective calcium-channel blockers or the use of the high-voltage activated calcium channels modulator topiramate to alleviate epilepsy in patients with GNAO1 mutations. Our patient, at variance with previous cases where treatment was specified, did receive topiramate since the age of 8 months, but without noticeable improvement in seizures or changes in her developmental profile.\n\n    All twelve patients described carried heterozygous de novo missense mutations. Indeed, the p.Leu199Pro is predicted to cause protein dysfunction in both of the described GNAO1 isoforms, according to the used in silico prediction tools. Furthermore, the application of the recently published ACMG guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants to the p.Leu199Pro variant classified it as pathogenic by virtue of fulfilling one strong (PS2) plus two moderate (PM1, PM2) and two supporting (PP2,PP3) pathogenic criteria.\n\n    In vitro functional studies showed that three out of four analyzed missense GNAO1 mutations resulted in abnormal, cytoplasmic localization of the protein, while electrophysiological studies proved that all four variants produced impaired N-type calcium channel current inhibition after norepinephrine application. Interestingly, a mouse model harboring a heterozygous (p.Gly184Ser) Gnao1 missense mutation displayed a severe and lethal epileptic phenotype that was absent in the Gnao1 hemizygous knock-out mouse, suggesting that pathogenic GNAO1 mutations may act through a gain-of-function, dominant effect.\n\n    In our present work, we investigated the effect of the novel p. Leu199Pro mutation in the structure of the human Galphao protein using state-of-the-art computational tools. These provide evidence that the mutation causes significant defects in protein stability. The observed disturbances occur locally in the GTPase domain where the mutation is situated but also in several loop regions throughout the protein. This suggests the p.Leu199Pro mutation decreases overall structural stability and perhaps folding of the Galphao protein. From a functional point of view, the location of the p.Leu199Pro mutation may be particularly significant in terms of interactions Galphao makes with its binding partner GbetaUpsilon and others. With respect to the crystal structure of the complete heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding protein Gi (PDB id: 1GG2), when the Galphao subunit is superimposed, the mutation p.Leu199Pro is in direct contact with GbetaUpsilon (see Fig. 1b). Therefore any introduced structural instability in this interface would likely adversely affect the stability of the GalphabetaUpsilon complex as a whole. From the observed results, it is certainly conceivable that the p.Leu199Pro mutation could generate this level of instability. The issue of a female gender bias in this disorder deserves special consideration. A distorted sex ratio can be found in many complex disorders, for instance autism spectrum disorder and a male-biased effect has been described for 16p13.11 copy number variants as predisposing factor to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Possible causes include hormonal factors, sexual dimorphic brain differences, imprinting or genetic modifiers, with a net effect of greater protection of the female brain. It is conceivable that the penetrance of GNAO1 mutation is higher in the less resilient male brain thus producing a more severe phenotype. While female bias in EIEE-17 remains unexplained, it could be posited that disruption of G-protein signal transduction may lead to prenatal lethality in males.",

        "Title": "    AC and AG dinucleotide repeats in the PAX6 P1 promoter are associated with high myopia",
        "Abstract": "    The PAX6 gene, located at the reported myopia locus MYP7 on chromosome 11p13, was postulated to be associated with myopia development. This study investigated the association of PAX6 with high myopia in 379 high myopia patients and 349 controls.\n\n    High myopia patients had refractive errors of -6.00 diopters or greater and axial length longer than 26 mm. Control subjects had refractive errors less than -1.00 diopter and axial length shorter than 24 mm. The P1 promoter, all coding sequences, and adjacent splice-site regions of the PAX6 gene were screened in all study subjects by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. PAX6 P1 promoter-luciferase constructs with variable AC and AG repeat lengths were prepared and transfected into human ARPE-19 cells prior to assaying for their transcriptional activities.\n\n    No sequence alterations in the coding or splicing regions showed an association with high myopia. Two dinucleotide repeats, (AC)m and (AG)n, in the P1 promoter region were found to be highly polymorphic and significantly associated with high myopia. Higher repeat numbers were observed in high myopia patients for both (AC)m (empirical p = 0.013) and (AG)n (empirical p = 0.012) dinucleotide polymorphisms, with a 1.327-fold increased risk associated with the (AG)n repeat (empirical p = 0.016; 95% confidence interval: 1.059-1.663). Luciferase-reporter analysis showed elevated transcription activity with increasing individual (AC)m and (AG)n and combined (AC)m(AG)n repeat lengths.\n\n    Our results revealed an association between high myopia and AC and AG dinucleotide repeat lengths in the PAX6 P1 promoter, indicating the involvement of PAX6 in the pathogenesis of high myopia.",
        "Introduction": "    Myopia, one of the most common refractive errors of the eye worldwide, is an important public health issue, especially in Asia, because of its higher prevalence in Asians than in other populations. The progression of myopia in Chinese children in Hong Kong and Singapore is also much higher than in Caucasians. In Hong Kong, the prevalence of myopia in Chinese schoolchildren aged 11-16 was 36.7%, according to a 2004 report, which is several times higher than among Caucasian children of similar ages. The prevalence of high myopia, defined as a refractive error equal to or greater than -6.00 diopters (D), is also higher in Chinese than in Caucasians. Individuals with high myopia are more prone to develop serious ocular complications, such as retinal detachment, glaucoma, premature cataracts, and macular degeneration, which may lead to visual impairment or even blindness.\n\n    Myopia is a complex disorder. Multiple interacting environmental and genetic causes are implicated. Myopia development in schoolchildren has been attributed to environmental factors, such as near work, reading habits, and school achievement. In addition, high heritability of refractive errors has been observed in dizygotic and monozygotic twin studies. Family and sibling studies have shown that children of myopic parents have greater chances of developing myopia than those with nonmyopic parents. Twenty-four chromosomal loci have been identified for myopia: Xq28 (MYP1), 18p11.31 (MYP2), 12q21-31 (MYP3), 7q36 (MYP4), 17q21-22 (MYP5), 22q37.1 (MYP6), 11p13 (MYP7), 3q26 (MYP8), 4q12 (MYP9), 8p23 (MYP10), 4q22-q27 (MYP11), 2q37.1 (MYP12), Xq23 (MYP13), 1p36 (MYP14), 10q21.2 (MYP15), 5p15.33-p15.2 (MYP16), 7p15 (MYP17), 14q22.1-q24.2 (MYP18), 15q12-13, 21q22.3, 12q24, 4q21, 9q34.11 and 2q37. Among them,  MYP1-5, 11-13, 16, and 18 are linked to high myopia, and MYP2, 11, 13, 16, and 18 are found in the Chinese population. Some candidate genes have been postulated for myopia, such as TGIF, HGF, MMP3, MMP9, COL1A1, COL2A1, TGFB1, TGFB2, LUM, and CMET.\n\n    A genome-wide scan in dizygotic twins revealed a susceptibility locus for myopia on chromosome 11p13. The PAX6 gene at this locus, a member of the paired-domain PAX family, has been postulated as a candidate gene for myopia. PAX6 is expressed in the human eye and plays an evolutionarily conserved role in ocular development. PAX6 mutations are associated with ocular disorders, such as aniridia (OMIM 106210), cataracts (OMIM 604219), Peters anomaly (OMIM 604229), and optic nerve hypoplasia (OMIM 16550). PAX6 encodes a transcriptional regulator containing the DNA-binding paired domain, paired-type homeodomain, and COOH-terminal transactivation domain. The Pax6 protein regulates cell adhesion molecules, cell-to-cell signaling molecules, hormones, and structural proteins through interactions with transcription factors such as Mitf and Sox2. Transcription of PAX6 is regulated by at least two promoters, P0 and P1. Within the P1 promoter (promoter B in Okladnova et al.), two dinucleotide repeats, (AC)m and (AG)n, are located about 1 kb from the transcription start site and are highly polymorphic in Caucasians. The poly AC and poly AG repeats are independently polymorphic. Luciferase analysis in Cos-7 cells has shown that the longer the combined length of the AC and AG repeats, the higher the transcriptional activity, implying that the length of this dinucleotide repeat might influence the transcriptional activity of promoter B, or P1, and subsequently the transcription of PAX6.\n\n    Pax6 levels are tightly controlled. Both overexpression and haploinsufficiency lead to abnormal phenotypes. Polymorphisms or mutations in the PAX6 promoter could influence PAX6 expressions that ultimately lead to a disease phenotype. However, although PAX6 has been postulated to be a candidate gene for myopia, several studies in Caucasian populations could not find an association between PAX6 and myopia. Still, an Australian study suggested PAX6 mutations might be associated with high myopia. Intronic sequence alterations (SNPs) in PAX6 have been reported to associate with high myopia in Han Chinese nuclear families and with extreme myopia in a Taiwan Chinese population, but not in Caucasians. To attest the association between PAX6 and high myopia, we should look for mutations that may affect PAX6 expressions. We therefore screened for sequence alterations in the P1 promoter, coding exons, and adjacent splice-site regions of PAX6 in unrelated high myopia patients and control subjects. We also examined transcriptional effects of dinucleotide repeats within the P1 promoter in cultured human APRE-19 cells by a luciferase-reporter assay and predicted the presence of transcription factor binding sites within the repeats.",
        "Methods": "    We recruited 379 unrelated Han Chinese patients with high myopia at the Hong Kong Eye Hospital. They were given complete ophthalmoscopic examinations. None of them had known diseases predisposing them to myopia, such as Stickler or Marfan syndromes. Their refractive errors were equal to or greater than -6.00 D, and their axial length was longer than 26 mm. We also recruited 349 unrelated Chinese control subjects who visited the hospital for ophthalmic examinations. They had no eye diseases except senile cataracts and slight floaters. All of them had refractive errors of less than -1.00 D and axial length shorter than 24 mm. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and was in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from the study subjects after explanation of the nature and possible consequences of the study.\n\n    The whole blood specimens (5 ml) from all the patients and controls were collected in EDTA tube and stored at -80  C for fewer than two months. Genomic DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA kit; Qiagen, Hiden, Germeny) according to the supplier's instructions. All samples were screened for sequence alterations in the P1 promoter region flanking -3,433 to -118, coding exons, and intron-exon boundaries of PAX6 (ENSG00000007372 and ENST00000241001; Ensembl genome browser) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer sets. PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 mul containing 1X PCR buffer (Invitrogen  Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of dNTP (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 0.2 mM of each primers, 0.5 U of Platinum  Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). After the initial denaturation at 95  C for 2 min, 40 PCR cycles were conducted: 95  C for 45 s, 57  C for 45 s and 72  C for 45 s. The final extension lasted for 5 min at 72  C. Direct sequencing was performed using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit (v3.1, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI 3130XL capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).\n\n    A 1,851 bp genomic fragment (from -1278 to +573) containing the PAX6 P1 promoter was cloned into an empty pGL3-Basic vector, pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) between the SacI and BglII sites (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD). Constructs with different repeat lengths were generated. Genomic DNA from the study subjects was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5'-ACA CAC AGA TGA CCG GTG G-3'; reverse primer 5'-AAG CCT AGG CCG AGA GGA-3'). AgeI and AvrII digested products were ligated into a linearized pGL3-Basic vector containing the P1 promoter (pGL3-Pax6p). A positive control construct was made by cloning a pCMV5 promoter into the pGL3-Basic vector (pGL3-pCMV). All constructs were verified by direct sequencing.\n\n    The human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD). Cells were plated in 60 mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 2-3x105 cells/dish one day before transfection. At 60-80% confluence, cells were transfected with 2 mug luciferase constructs in 6 mul FuGene HD (Roche) transfection reagent per dish. Empty pGL3 and pGL3-pCMV were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. At 36 h after transfection, cell lysates were extracted using Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) for immunoblotting.\n\n    The denatured cell lysates of the transfected cells were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for probing with a rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against firefly luciferase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and a secondary antibody against rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immuno Res., West Grove, PA). The chemiluminescence was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia, Cleveland, OH) and quantified by ChemiDoc (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Normalized luciferase intensities were calculated by dividing the quantified luciferase intensities by the housekeeping beta-actin intensities. Triplicates were performed.\n\n    The chi2 test or Fisher exact test was used to compare the allele and genotype frequencies of SNPs in patients and control subjects. For the comparison of (AC)m and (AG)n repeat alleles and genotypes between high myopia patients and control subjects, the chi2 test was performed using the CLUMP program (version 2.3). For multiple testing corrections, 10,000 Monte Carlo permutations were chosen to simulate the empirical significance levels of the statistics produced by the program, resulting in an empirical p-value. Due to low frequencies of some alleles, and in order to determine whether the transcriptional activities were affected by the thresholds, (AC)m and (AG)n repeats were collapsed into groups for association study and immunoblotting analysis. The risk of high myopia was also determined by odds ratio using the chi2 test. Activity of each allelic construct was expressed relative to (AC)20(AG)6. One-way ANOVA and independent T-testing were used to compare the means among (AC)m groups and between (AG)n repeats, respectively. SNP-trait association, odds ratio calculation, and immunoblotting analysis were performed on SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Significance was defined as p < 0.05.\n\n    The DNA sequence of the cloned PAX6 P1 promoter was used to predict transcription factor binding sites. The Transcription Element Search System (TESS: University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) was used to predict the transcription factors that would bind to the region of the dinucleotide repeats in the PAX6 P1 promoter. Predictions for different lengths of dinucleotide repeats were also performed. As in the statistical analysis for immunoblotting, (AC)20(AG)6 was set as a reference.",
        "Results": "    In our study cohort, high myopia patients had a mean age of 39.52+-14.96 years and a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1. Refractive errors ranged from -6.00 to -30.00 D. For the controls, the mean age was 64.85+-14.85 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1. There was no significant difference in the sex ratio between high myopia patients and controls.\n\n    Two sequence changes were identified in coding exons with the intron-exon boundary of PAX6. One novel heterozygous silent variant, 678A>G (R67R), was found in one high myopia patient, and a noncoding sequence change, rs667773, was found in both patients and controls. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of both polymorphisms showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) between patients and controls (data not shown). Within the P1 promoter region, 20 polymorphisms were identified, with no significant difference in frequencies between patients and controls: -186C>T, -215G>A, -242G>A, -263A>G, -292A>G, -331A>G, -337A>T, -354A>G, -382G>A, -407G>A, -409G>A, -692A>G, -758C>T, -782A>G, -933C>G, -3050C>A, -3070C>A, -3078A>G, -3090C>T, and -3282T>C (data not shown). For -186C>T, -292A>G, -331A>G, -933C>G, and -3282T>C, each SNP was only found in 1 high myopia patient. Therefore, they were statistically not significant under Pearson's chi2 test (p > 0.05).\n\n    Within the PAX6 P1 promoter, two dinucleotide repeats, (AC)m and (AG)n, were observed about 1 kb from the transcription start site, both highly polymorphic (Table 1). The AC repeats ranged from 16 to 26 in high myopia patients and from 7 to 26 in control subjects, while 5 to 8 AG repeats were observed in patients and 4 to 8 in controls. The median numbers of AC and AG repeats were 20 and 6, respectively, in both patients and controls. Distribution of the allele frequencies was slightly skewed in patients for both AC and AG repeats. Allele frequencies of the AC and AG repeats were significantly different between patients and controls (empirical p = 0.013 and 0.012, respectively; Table 1). Because the frequencies of some of the alleles were low, the AC and AG repeats were collapsed into groups. The grouped repeat lengths were longer in patients than in controls (empirical p = 0.016 for (AC)m and empirical p = 0.016 for (AG)n; Table 2). In terms of risk analysis, individuals with (AG)7-8 repeats had a 1.327-fold increased risk of developing high myopia compared with the those with (AG)4-6 repeats (empirical p = 0.016; 95% confidence interval = 1.059-1.663). Both grouped AC and grouped AG genotypes were significantly different between high myopia patients and control (empirical p = 0.004 and 0.039, respectively; Table 3).\n\n    We found that the dinucleotide repeats affected the transcriptional activity of the PAX6 P1 promoter (Figure 1). For a given (AG)n repeat length, elevated transcriptional activity was observed with increasing length of (AC)m repeats (p = 0.004, one-way ANOVA; post-hoc tests adjusted by Tukey HSD: (AC)Below20-22 versus (AC)20-22, p = 0.033; and (AC)Below20-22 versus (AC)Above20-22, p = 0.004; Figure 1A,B). Similarly, at a given (AC)m repeat length, transcriptional activity of (AG)8 was increased when compared with (AG)6, although the increase was not significant, likely due to the substantial standard deviation (p = 0.205, independent T-test; Figure 1C,D). For combined repeats of the same length, transcriptional activity of (AC)23(AG)6 was similar to that of (AC)21(AG)8 (p = 0.627, independent T-test; Figure 1E,F). Thus, both AC and AG repeats contributed to the transcriptional activity of the PAX6 P1 promoter.\n\n    Our luciferase-reporter analysis showed that transcription activity increased with AC and AG repeat length. This phenomenon may be due to influences of transcription factor binding sites within this region. Thus, we used (AC)20(AG)6 as a reference and predicted one binding site for T-cell factor/Lymphoid enhancer factor family transcription factors, one glucocorticoid receptor binding site, and four transcription factor (TF) II-I binding sites (Figure 2B). With decreasing AG repeat lengths, the T-cell factor/Lymphoid enhancer factor and glucocorticoid receptor sites were unchanged, but the TFII-I sites were reduced. Only two predicted TFII-I sites were observed in (AC)15(AG)4 (Figure 2A). No alteration was observed with a decrease in AC repeat lengths. Accordingly, more TFII-I sites were predicted with increasing AG repeat lengths. Multiple sites for Wilms' tumor transcription factor without lysine-threonine-serine [Wt1(-KTS)] were observed with an increase in AC repeat length, and one GAGA factor binding site appeared with an increase in AG repeat length. In (AC)26(AG)8, six TFII-I sites, six Wt1(-KTS) sites, and one GAGA factor site were predicted (Figure 2C).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We found no myopia mutations in the coding regions and splice sites in PAX6 in our cohort of Chinese high myopia patients. Some SNPs were detected in the P1 promoter, exon 7, and intron 10, but these were not statistically significant (data not shown). In a recent report, two intronic SNPs (rs3026390 and rs3026393, located in introns 12 and 13, respectively) have been shown to be associated with high myopia in Han Chinese nuclear families. SNP rs667773, located in intron 10, is in the same linkage disequilibrium block with rs3026390 and rs3026393. However, in our study, no significant association was found for rs667773 between high myopia patients and controls, which was consistent with a previous case-control association study in a Taiwan Chinese population. The discrepancy might be due to the much lower minor allele frequency of rs667773 (0.137) than of rs3026390 and rs3026393 (0.472 and 0.493, respectively). Other studies have suggested that rs667773, as a neural polymorphism, is an unlikely cause of overt phenotypes such as aniridia.\n\n    The (AC)m(AG)n dinucleotide repeat sequence, located about 1 kb from the transcription start site of the PAX6 P1 promoter, is highly polymorphic. The AC dinucleotide polymorphism ranged from 18 to 31 repeats and AG ranged from 5 to 7 repeats in a Caucasian population. In our Chinese cohort, the AC repeats ranged from 7 to 26 and the AG repeats from 4 to 8 (Table 1). The allele size of the AG repeats was similar in Caucasians and Chinese, but the AC repeat length was longer in Caucasians. Notably, one (AC)7 allele was found in a control subject, far from the common range of repeats between 15 and 26. In addition, many of the dinucleotide repeats were heterozygous in both poly AC and poly AG repeats (AC: 55.3% in controls and 75.9% in patients; AG: 42.9% in controls and 53.4% in patients). The observed heterozygosity rate was 65% in a Caucasian population. Although the allele number in that study was defined as combined units of AC and AG repeats instead of independent AC and AG alleles, the trend of heterozygosity was similar to that in our work. These two dinucleotide repeats are, therefore, highly polymorphic both in Caucasians and in Chinese.\n\n    The PAX6 P1, containing CCAAT boxes and a TATA-like box, is likely a real promoter. We evaluated the influence of (AC)m(AG)n dinucleotide repeats on PAX6 P1 promoter activity by a luciferase-reporter assay and examined the effects of repeat lengths as obtained from our high myopia patients and controls. Since retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been shown to have PAX6 P1 promoter activity, we used an RPE cell line, ARPE-19, for transfection. Immunoblotting showed that longer lengths of (AC)m have a significant trend of increasing luciferase expression compared with shorter lengths (Figure 1A,B), although this was not observed for (AG)n, likely due to the substantial standard deviation (Figure 1C,D).\n\n    We confirmed that transcriptional activity of (AC)23(AG)6 was similar to that of (AC)21(AG)8 (Figure 1E,F), suggesting that both (AC)m and (AG)n dinucleotide repeats within the PAX6 P1 promoter contribute to transcriptional activity and might work cooperatively as an unit. Previous studies on luciferase-reporter assays assessed the promoter activity invisibly by a luminometer. In our study, we monitored the luciferase-reporter assay by immunoblotting using a commercially available antibody against firefly luciferase and luciferase overexpression by pGL3-pCMV as a positive control. There are technical advantages to this method. The promoter activity could be visualized, and co-transfection with another normalizing vector was not required, as the luciferase intensity could be directly normalized with the housekeeping protein, assuming the same transfection efficiency among the constructs. The limitation of the luciferase-reporter assay is that the effect of the dinucleotide repeats on the transcriptional activity was performed using RPE cells from normal controls, which might not truly reflect the situation in high myopia unless the experiment were performed using cells from a highly myopic individual.\n\n    Since levels of Pax6 are tightly controlled, small and seemingly insignificant changes in the levels of Pax6 may lead to significant phenotypic consequences. Moreover, the Pax6 protein could upregulate PAX6 P1 promoter activity. Results of our genotyping and promoter activity analyses indicate that longer lengths of dinucleotide repeats increase the expression of PAX6, which increases the risk of high myopia. This postulation may be supported by several assertions: (1) PAX6 gene expression has been shown to be significantly higher in the retinas of optical defocused eyes than in contralateral eyes in the rhesus monkey, and expression of PAX6 was also increased in posthatch chicken eyes with form-deprivation myopia. (2) In another study, the number of dividing retinal progenitor cells, of which PAX6 is a marker, was highly correlated with axial elongation of the eye, resulting in myopic refractive errors in primates with form-deprivation myopia. (3) Pax6 has been shown to transactivate insulin promoters and promote proinsulin processing. As insulin is a strong stimulator of axial myopia in chicks, elevated PAX6 expression may increase the risk of developing myopia through increased expression of insulin. Chronic hyperinsulinemia has been proposed as a key player in the pathogenesis of juvenile-onset myopia. Although Pax6 also transactivates the glucagon promoter, which is a \"stop\" for myopia, insulin might overcome the effects of glucagon in the development of myopia.\n\n    The transcription factor binding site prediction (Figure 2) showed that an increase in AC repeat length created additional Wt1(-KTS) binding sites, while an increase in AG repeat length created TFII-I and GAGA factor binding sites. If the AG repeat length was reduced, TFII-I sites were also reduced. Wt1(-KTS) is necessary for normal retina formation in mice, while TFII-I is a signal-induced multifunctional transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation. Moreover, the GAGA factor, a transcription activator, is activated by epidermal growth factors, platelet-derived growth factors, and insulin. These growth factors could regulate PAX6 transcription through the GAGA factor binding site.\n\n    In summary, we found no association between polymorphisms in the PAX6 coding region and high myopia in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Two dinucleotide repeats, AC and AG, in the PAX6 P1 promoter were associated with high myopia. These two repeats were also associated with the elevation of PAX6 P1 promoter activity, and hence an increase in the transcriptional activity of PAX6. Our results provide evidence for the role of PAX6 in the pathogenesis of high myopia.",

        "Title": "    A single natural nucleotide mutation alters bacterial pathogen host-tropism",
        "Abstract": "    The capacity of microbial pathogens to alter their host-tropism leading to epidemics in distinct host-species populations is a global public and veterinary health concern. In order to investigate the molecular basis of a bacterial host-switching event in a tractable host-species, we traced the evolutionary trajectory of the common rabbit clone of Staphylococcus aureus. We report that it evolved through a likely human-to-rabbit host jump over 40 years ago, and that only a single natural nucleotide mutation was required and sufficient to convert a human-specific S. aureus strain into one which could infect rabbits. Related mutations were identified at the same locus in other rabbit strains of distinct clonal origin, consistent with convergent evolution. This first report of a single mutation that was sufficient to alter the host-tropism of a micro-organism during its evolution highlights the capacity of some pathogens to readily expand into novel host-species populations.",
        "Introduction": "    The capacity for pathogens to switch host-species leading to epidemic spread in new host populations is a major veterinary and public health concern, but our understanding of the genetic basis of host-adaptation is very limited. Many animal- and plant-associated microorganisms co-evolve with a single host species leading to complex mutualistic, commensal or pathogenic relationships, and switches between host-species must overcome innate host-specific barriers to colonization and subsequent transmission. However, successful host jumps provide an opportunity to expand into novel ecological niches, and anthropogenic events such as domestication, industrialization of agriculture, and globalization have provided increased opportunities for the transmission of bacteria between humans and animals and their subsequent dissemination. Recent studies have established that the host-shift and onward transmission of influenza virus requires several multi-gene mutations, but the precise primary mechanisms have not been completely deciphered. The mechanisms underlying successful bacterial host-switching events are even less well understood but it is generally assumed that more complex genetic adaptations affecting multiple pathways would underlie adaptation to distantly related members of the animal kingdom.\n\n    Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that is also associated with economically important infections of livestock including dairy cows, sheep, poultry and rabbits. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the major clones of S. aureus associated with ruminant and poultry infections evolved as the result of human to animal host jumps, leading to host-specialized endemic clones responsible for disease. Several studies have demonstrated an association of specific mobile genetic elements (MGEs) with strains infecting particular host species suggestive of a role for MGE in host-specificity. However, the molecular basis for S. aureus host-adaptation and the underlying genetic events involved is unclear.",
        "Methods": "    Bacterial strains used are listed in Tables S1 and S4. S. aureus strains were grown at 37 C on TSA agar medium, supplemented with antibiotics as appropriate. Broth cultures were grown at 37 C in TSB broth with shaking (240 r.p.m.). LB agar and LB medium were used for E. coli strains, supplemented with antibiotics as appropriate. Procedures for transduction and transformation in S. aureus were performed as described previously.\n\n    General DNA manipulations were performed by standard procedures. To introduce specific mutations into S. aureus strains, we used plasmid pMAD for allelic exchange as previously described. Plasmid constructs (listed in Table S5) were prepared by cloning PCR products obtained with oligonucleotide primers as listed in Table S6, and all clones were sequenced by the Institute Core Sequencing Lab.\n\n    Isolates were sequenced using a combination of single and paired end technologies on the Roche 454 platform and assembled using the Roche GS De Novo Assembler v2.6, or alternatively using the Illumina HiSeq with reads assembled using Velvet v1.2.08. Contigs were aligned using the progressiveMauve algorithm, filtered for locally colinear blocks over 1000 nucleotides in length, and gap positions were removed. The alignment was assessed for recombination using BRATNextGen, with predicted recombinant regions excluded from further phylogenetic analyses. Genes specific to rabbit ST121 isolates were identified by comparing the sequenced rabbit isolate genome sequences to the human ST121 sequences using the print_novel_contigs function of cortex_var v1.0.5.20.\n\n    Based on the core genome Mauve alignment (6208 variable sites), the phylogeny of ST121 was reconstructed using BEAST v1.6.1 under the GTR model of nucleotide substitution with a gamma correction for rate heterogeneity and a skyline coalescent tree prior. Simultaneously we used an uncorrelated lognormal distribution to model the rate of evolution and constrained the tips of the phylogeny to their dates of isolation to calibrate the rate. Posterior probabilities were estimated from 3 independent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples from 3 independent analyses each run for 1 x 108 iterations, with sampling at every 1000 generations and 10% discarded as burnin.\n\n    Single end 454 sequence reads were aligned to the ED133 genome (accession number NC_017337.1), and an annotated draft version of the DL190 genome using the BWA long read aligner. Point mutation and insertion/deletion variants were called at sites with average mapping and base quality scores greater than 30. Mutations predicted to result in pseudogenes were further inspected manually using the Integrative Genomics Viewer. Variation in gene content between strains was examined using the GeneFamily method of the Pangenome Analysis Pipeline with default parameters. Presence or absence of virulence factors was confirmed through manual inspection of the output of BLAST searches.\n\n    Two-month old albino hybrid rabbits of either sex were used for the skin infection model. Rabbits were sedated with a combination of ketamine and xylazine and were shaved on their back and inoculated by intradermal injection (usually with 300 cfu of S. aureus in 100 mul of PBS). Each rabbit was inoculated in duplicate with 2 strains (generally wild type and mutant), and each strain was tested in groups of at least 20 rabbits. After 7 d, rabbits were euthanized by intravenous injection of barbiturate (Dolethal, Vetoquinol SA). In each experiment, an additional group of animals was inoculated with vehicle (PBS) and served as a negative control. In addition, to exclude the possibility of contamination, bacteria recovered at the end of the experimental period were analysed by sequencing of strain-specific gene alleles. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera and by the Conselleria d 'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio, Generalitat Valenciana (permit number 2011/010).\n\n    Rabbits were examined daily and development of infection was followed visually and by palpation of lesion tissue. Length and width values were measured to calculate the area of lesions. Addition of lesion size, skins were also examined to evaluate presence or absence of epidermal necrosis. After post-mortem examination, skin abscesses were routinely processed for histological examination and stained with haematoxylin and eosin and by Gram's method. Previously fixation, swab samples were taken from lesion and cultivated on blood-agar (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) to confirmed presence of S. aureus.\n\n    Cell walls were isolated, wall teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids were purified and D-alanine content measured as previously described. The peptidoglycan composition and structure in the different strains was analysed by Cecolabs (Tuebingen, Germany), as described before.",
        "Results": "    A common cause of human skin and soft tissue infections such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and life-threatening infections such as necrotizing pneumonia is the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)-defined clone ST121. Recently, the industrialization of rabbit farming in the developed world has coincided with the emergence of a highly-virulent epidemic clone of S. aureus, also ST121, which is associated with skin abscess and mastitis infections of rabbits in commercial rabbitries. However, the basis for the multiple host species association is unknown. We hypothesized that the multiple host association of ST121 strains could be explained either by the existence of host-specific subtypes of ST121, or an innate capacity of ST121 strains to infect both human and rabbit hosts. In order to address this question, we carried out experimental intradermal infections of rabbits with representative ST121 isolates of rabbit (n=3) and human (n=3) clinical origin. The rabbit ST121 strains caused infections resulting in skin abscesses which are characteristic of clinical symptoms seen in natural rabbit skin infections at doses as low as 300 cfu (Fig. 1a, b and c). In remarkable contrast, human ST121 strains failed to cause clinical infections with overt symptoms even at an inoculum of 105 cfu (Fig. 1a and b). These data indicate that in contrast to human ST121 isolates, rabbit ST121 strains have the capacity to cause disease in experimental infection of rabbits at very low inocula.\n\n    Given the existence of a subset of ST121 strains with the capacity to cause clinical disease in rabbits, we investigated their evolutionary history. Accordingly, we compared the whole genome sequences from a total of 23 different ST121 strains which broadly represented the breadth of spatial and temporal diversity of the ST121 lineage including 14 newly-sequenced S. aureus ST121 isolates obtained from humans (n=8) and rabbits (n=6) in 8 countries (from 3 continents) over a 50 year period (Supplementary Table 1), in addition to 11 diverse publicly available genome sequences for human ST121 strains. Of note, one of the rabbit strains (DL190) was sequenced to completion resulting in a whole genome sequence which could be used as a reference for comparison to all other ST121 sequences. We then applied a Bayesian coalescent method in the program Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) employing a relaxed molecular clock model to reconstruct the phylogeny of the ST121 human and rabbit strains and estimate the rate of evolution of the ST121 clone. The resulting phylogenetic tree indicates a high level of diversity of human strains represented by long branches in the ST121 phylogenetic tree in contrast to a single clade comprised of all rabbit strains which were isolated 20 years apart in 4 different countries (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Using the calculated rate of molecular evolution for the ST121 sequences examined (1.83 x 10-6 substitutions per site per year (95% HPDs 9.84 x10-7 - 2.26 x10-6), we estimated the date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the rabbit clade to be 1976 (1942-1990), and the MRCA of the rabbit clade with the most closely-related human strain F as 1909 (1804-1958). Taking into account the topology of the ST121 tree and the previously inferred human ancestry of the S. aureus species, the most likely explanation for the existence of the ST121 rabbit clade is a single human-to-rabbit host jump which occurred more than 38 years ago leading to the emergence of a new clone associated with epidemics of rabbit farms (Fig. 2).\n\n    Considering previous studies which have suggested an important role for MGEs in adaptation to human, ruminant and avian hosts, we hypothesised that the ST121 clone had adapted to infect rabbits using a similar strategy. Comparative analysis of the accessory genome of ST121 strains revealed that the majority of human strains contained MGEs which encode potent toxins involved in human disease pathogenesis such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and exfoliative toxins (ET), and all bar one contained a beta-converting phage encoding the human-specific immune evasion cluster (IEC). None of the rabbit strains contained PVL- or ET-encoding MGEs indicating their dispensability for S. aureus infections of rabbits (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, the rabbit strains did not contain any MGE which are unique to rabbit S. aureus (Fig. 2) implying that the host tropism of the rabbit ST121 clade is not mediated by a niche-specific accessory gene pool as previously reported for S. aureus clones associated with poultry and ruminants. Accordingly, we concluded that the capacity of ST121 to infect rabbits must have evolved through mutational events in the core genome of an ST121 progenitor of the rabbit clade. Core genome analysis revealed mutations common to all rabbit strains and absent from human strains including a total of 9 predicted pseudogenes resulting from non-sense mutations leading to premature stop codons or indels leading to frameshifts (Supplementary Table 2), and 254 non-synonymous (NS) mutations in a variety of gene loci (Supplementary Table 3). Of the genes associated with loss-of-function mutations, 4 had previously been implicated in S. aureus virulence including genes that would encode urease, lipase, EssB, and the global gene regulator rot (repressor of toxins). In addition, a single pseudogene caused by the insertion of a prophage into the beta-toxin gene (hlb) was identified in all human ST121 strains but was intact in the rabbit strains examined. Further, a SNP in the dltB gene encoding the D-alanine lipoteichoic acid and wall teichoic acid esterification protein resulted in the conversion of the stop codon into a tyrosine and extended the length of the predicted protein by a single amino acid residue. In addition, there were 2 further NS SNPs in the DltB coding sequence (Supplementary Fig. 1). Finally, an additional single 717 bp gene (splE) encoding a predicted serine protease was identified in each of the rabbits strains in the vSabeta genomic island (Supplementary Table 2).\n\n    In order to distinguish host-adaptive mutational events among neutral or mildly deleterious mutations associated with genetic drift, mutations which were associated with encoded proteins of different size in all rabbit strains (ie resulting from frameshift, nonsense or length extension mutations) were restored in representative rabbit strains (strains I and J) and introduced into the human ST121 strain F by allele replacement. In addition, the single gene splE found in the rabbit strains was deleted in strains I and J. The infectivity and severity of experimental infection by wild type and derived mutant strains were then compared in a rabbit skin abscess infection model. For mutations in 10 of the 12 genes examined, reversion to the human ancestral gene state in the rabbit strains and their introduction to the human ST121 strain F had no effect on infectivity or severity (Supplementary Table 2). However, reversion of the 3 identified dltB SNPs (dltBh) in the rabbit strains J and I resulted in complete loss of infectivity, even at an infectious dose of 105 cfu (equivalent to a wild type human strain; Fig. 3a). In addition, reversion of the nonsense mutation in the global virulence regulator rot (rot+) significantly reduced the severity and infectivity of the rabbit strains (Fig. 3a).\n\n    In order to examine the role of specific dltB mutations in rabbit infectivity, each of the 3 dltB mutations, in addition to the rot nonsense mutation, were individually introduced to the human ST121 strain F. Remarkably, introduction of the most 5' NS SNP of the dltB locus in the rabbit strains (T113K) to human ST121 strain F, conferred the capacity to infect the rabbit host at an inoculum of 300 cfu (Fig. 3b), causing lesions that were highly similar to that caused by the wt rabbit strain J (Fig. 3c and d). To confirm that the infective phenotype of the ST121 strain F DltB T113K was not due to unrelated mutations which had occurred elsewhere in the genome during the synthesis of the mutant, we restored the dltB gene to its original wt state in strain F and observed the expected loss of infectivity. In contrast, neither of the other 2 SNPs in the dltB gene (Y250H and 405Y) nor the rot mutation (rot-) increased the infectivity of the human clone F when introduced individually. Of note, the introduction of DltB T113K resulted in lesions in 40% of inoculated animals but bacteria were recovered from only about 20%. However, the introduction of all 3 dltB mutations resulted in infected lesions with 100% recovery, with an infectivity which is equivalent to the rabbit strain with a functional rot gene (human ancestral state) (Fig 3 b). These data suggest that additional dltB mutations promote persistence of S. aureus ST121 in infected lesions. Importantly, a combination of the rot nonsense mutation with the 3 dltB SNPs in the human F strain resulted in a strain whose infectivity was indistinguishable from the wt rabbit strains resulting in lesions with highly similar gross and microscopic histopathology (Fig. 3b). Finally, we also verified that the rabbit strain J with a deleted rot gene demonstrated no further attenuation for infectivity, suggesting that loss of rot gene function rather than allelic diversification of the rot gene is responsible for the attenuation. Taken together, the data indicate that a single natural nucleotide mutation of dltB was sufficient to confer the capacity of S. aureus ST121 to cause intradermal infections of rabbits, and that 2 additional NS mutations of dltB and loss of function of rot elevated the infectivity and bacterial recovery to that of wild type S. aureus rabbit strains.\n\n    DltB is an integral membrane protein encoded by the dltABCD operon which is likely responsible for the translocation and incorporation of D-alanine into teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids of S. aureus. While our understanding of the function of teichoic acids is incomplete, the addition of D-alanine (D-Ala) residues confers a positive charge which is essential for resistance to cationic peptides and for virulence. In view of this, we speculated that the activity of the mutated form of DltB may be enhanced leading to increased D-Ala substitution. Importantly, we confirmed that the variant DltB protein from rabbit strain J is fully functional, as a dltB deletion mutant was incapable of infecting the rabbit at a dose of 105 cfu. Although D-alanylation of wall teichoic acids as well as resistance to the cationic peptide-mediated killing were increased in the rabbit strain compared to the human clone, this phenotype was not dependent on the dltB mutations (Supplementary Fig. 2a and 2b). In addition, there was no difference in D-Ala levels associated with lipoteichoic acids from strains with the different dltb alleles (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Considering the finding that D-Ala content does not have a central impact on rabbit infectivity, we analysed if the DltB mutations affected the bacterial cell wall composition. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3a and 3b, there were no differences in the structure or amino acid composition of the peptidoglycan obtained from the different strains. Next, considering that the DltB mutations present in the rabbit clone are predicted to have an extracellular or proximal extracellular location (Supplementary Fig. 4), we analysed if they could be involved in interacting with the innate immune system of the host or with other components of the bacterial surface. This was addressed by measuring survival in a whole blood killing assay, and by analysing the protein profile of the proteins bound to the bacterial surface. As shown in Supplementary Figure 5 and 6, although there were phenotypic differences between the human and the rabbit clones, they were not attributable to the DltB mutations. Of note is the data from the killing assays showing an increased resistance of the F dltBr clone to killing compared to the wild-type F clone (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, since the mutated rabbit clone J dltBh which is uninfective for rabbits did not demonstrate reduced resistance to killing compared to that observed with the J wild-type, and the survival of the J dltBh clone in blood was higher to that observed with the F dltBr clone, it was concluded that the ability to infect rabbits does not likely depend on the resistance observed in the killing assay. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that although we detected phenotypic differences between the human and the rabbit clones, they are not dependent on the DltB mutations. This implies that the effect of the mutated DltB on rabbit infectivity is due to alternative functions of DltB during infection. In support of this, it has been recently proposed that DltB is a member of a new superfamily of proteins, named MBOAT (for membrane-bound O-acyl transferases), that transfer organic acids, typically fatty acids, onto hydroxyl groups, performing a role in signalling. However, to date, O-acyl transferase enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated experimentally for DltB, and the mechanism underlying the role of the dltB mutations in adaptation to rabbits is unclear.\n\n    Finally, we hypothesized that if a single nucleotide mutation of dltB was essential to change the host tropism of ST121, that similar mutations will have occurred in other S. aureus strains infecting rabbits and perhaps other bacterial species. Phylogenetic analysis of rabbit S. aureus strains based on concatenated MLST sequences indicates that the capacity to infect rabbits has occurred on numerous occasions, presumably through human-to-rabbit host jump events (Fig. 4). In order to investigate the possibility that the adaptive mutation associated with the dltB locus in ST121 rabbit strains is a widespread S. aureus rabbit host-adaptive mechanism, we sequenced the dltB gene of representative rabbit isolates from S. aureus ST1, ST8, ST9, ST45, ST96, ST133 and ST398, lineages which each include isolates of both human and rabbit clinical origin (table 1 and Fig. 4), and compared them to dltB sequences from diverse human and animal isolates. DltB was highly conserved among the great majority of human, ruminant and poultry strains of S. aureus with only 8 of 445 strains examined (1.8%) containing one or more NS mutations (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, 39 of 39 (100%) rabbit strains examined from diverse clonal lineages contained one or more NS SNPs in dltB, suggestive of convergent evolution (Table 1 and Fig. 4). Of note, the majority of the mutations are also predicted to be extracellularly exposed or proximal to the outer surface of the membrane (Supplementary Fig. 4). In order to further examine the convergent host-adaptive evolution of rabbit S. aureus clones, we tested the role in virulence of the distinct dltB allele associated with the S. aureus ST96 rabbit clone (differing at 2 amino acid residues, Table 1). Introduction of the ST96 rabbit dltB allele to rabbit ST121 conferred a similar level of infectivity to the ST121 rabbit dltB allele (10 out 15 animals infected with the ST121 allele vs 7 out 15 animals infected with the ST96 allele; p=0.46, Yates' chi-squared test). Taken together, these data support the conclusion that distinct dltB mutations occurring in different S. aureus strain backgrounds underpinned independent host-jump events from humans to rabbits. In contrast to the allelic diversity of dltB identified among rabbit strains, all rabbit strains except ST121 contained an intact rot gene, and the majority contained the beta-converting phage, resulting in a non-functional beta-toxin, indicating that mutations affecting those determinants in ST121 are not essential for rabbit host-adaptation. Taken together, the data are consistent with the critical role for mutations of DltB in S. aureus rabbit host adaptation.\n\n    Finally, we identified strains of other bacterial species which had non-synonymous dltB mutations and predicted extended DltB proteins. These included a soil-adapted subtype of the plant bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens which has several predicted non-synonymous mutations and an additional histidine residue at the DltB C-terminus, that were absent in the plant root-adapted strain (Supplementary Fig. 7a). In addition, analysis of publicly available Streptococcus pneumoniae genome sequences from a study examining resistance to vaccine and therapeutic pressures in humans, revealed additional predicted residues of DltB proteins in several unrelated strains (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Taken together, these data suggest a potential general role for allelic variants of DltB proteins in adaptation to specific environmental or host-specific niches.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The molecular basis of the host-adaptation of viral pathogens such as influenza and HIV has been intensively investigated. Several key mutations such as influenza PB2-627 and HIV Gag-30 have been identified as sites of critical adaptive mutations. However, the adaptation to mammalian hosts by both influenza and HIV appears to involve multi-gene mutations. For bacterial host adaptation, horizontal acquisition of a single gene regulator in the bacterial squid symbiont Vibrio fischeri was demonstrated to be an essential step in adaptation to its host. In addition, previous seminal work demonstrated that in a mouse model of Listeria monocytogenes infection, a single amino acid change in the mouse E-cadherin receptor increased L. monocytogenes cell internalisation in vitro, and conversely, 2 amino acid changes in the listerial invasion protein InlA increased in vivo infectivity by enhancing bacterial affinity to the murine E-cadherin. However, very high inoculum doses were still required for infectivity, suggesting that for natural L. monocytogenes infections to occur additional adaptations would be required to facilitate a host shift.\n\n    To date, the fundamental biological question of how animal-bacteria partnerships are established has been difficult to dissect via established animal models of infection. In the current study, the fact that the bacterial host jump being examined involved rabbits, an experimentally-tractable host-species, facilitated for the first time, a dissection of the evolutionary genetic trajectory of a natural host-species switch by a bacterial pathogen. Using this approach, we traced the evolutionary genetic events which led to the emergence of a major animal clone of S. aureus responsible for disease epidemics of farmed rabbits on a global scale. In contrast to all characterized human and animal clones of S. aureus, adaptation to the rabbit host did not involve acquisition of MGE from a host-specific accessory gene-pool. Remarkably, we report that a single nucleotide mutation, which occurred naturally, was sufficient to allow a radical change in bacterial host-tropism. The mutation, affecting the dltB gene was sufficient and required to convert a human S. aureus strain, which was incapable of causing infections in rabbits, to one that had the capacity to cause epidemics in farmed rabbit populations. An additional 2 mutations of the same locus enhanced infectivity and bacterial proliferation within rabbit skin lesions. In spite of apparently numerous host jump events into rabbits, ST121 is by far the dominant clone in the countries sampled. As such, we suggest that in addition to the initial adaptations required for survival in the new host species, additional mutations likely contribute to the transmissibility and successful spread of the infectious clone.\n\n    In summary, our results reporting a single natural nucleotide mutation associated with a bacterial host switch event represent a paradigm shift in understanding of the minimal adaptations required for a bacterium to overcome species-barriers and establish in new host populations. The discovery has important public and veterinary health implications which will require a re-examination of the future threat posed by bacterial pathogen host switching events.",

        "Title": "    The solution plasma process for heteroatom-carbon nanosheets: the role of precursors",
        "Abstract": "    The solution plasma process (SPP), known as non-equilibrium cold plasma at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, was used to investigate the synthesis of nitrogen-carbon nasnosheets (NCNs). To verify the effect of elementary composition and structure of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), various precursors were used in the SPP to synthesize NCNs via the bottom-up synthesis method for the first time. The NCNs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Among the various precursors, SPP of 2-pyrrolidone was demonstrated to facilitate the formation of highly ordered NCNs. On the other hand, the SPP with cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and pyrrole did not lead to the formation of carbon nanosheets. The results of this study would uncover new parameter fields for the growth of heteroatom-carbon nanosheets using this synthesis system. In addition, the study is expected to contribute toward research in improving the large-area growth and quality of two-dimensional nanostructures, such as heteroatom-carbon nanosheets or graphene, for various applications in other synthesis methods.",
        "Introduction": "    Among various carbon nanomaterials, two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes such as carbon nanosheets (CNs), which are composed of few- to multi-layer graphene sheets, have emerged as a promising material for the development of lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, organic solar cells, sensitive gas-detection materials, field emission materials, carbon dioxide adsorbents, and fuel cells.\n\n    The introduction of heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen or boron) into CNs, which do not exhibit a band gap by themselves, has been important for tailoring their electronic properties and chemical reactivity by opening the band gap and modulating conducting types. In particular, nitrogen has attracted much attention as the most common dopant element because it is similar in size to carbon and contains five valence bonds with carbon atoms. Therefore, it can potentially be used for various applications.\n\n    Recently, the solution plasma process (SPP), known as non-equilibrium cold plasma at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, was used to synthesize CNs via the bottom-up synthesis method for the first time. Nitrogen-carbon nasnosheets (NCNs), composed of multi-layer graphene (MLG) with turbostratic stacking, were synthesized by the SPP at a high-repetition frequency with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The findings demonstrated the advantages of the SPP, such as a short synthesis time, simple experimental apparatus, no impurity issues, and the ability to operate at room temperature, when compared with nanosheets prepared by conventional methods. Before the synthesis of NCNs, various organic precursor solutions have been used in the SPP to produce carbon nanomaterials for use in carbon nanomaterial-based electrocatalysts such as fuel cells and lithium-air batteries. Although these syntheses were under the same or similar synthesis conditions as NCNs, they lead only to one type of carbon nanomaterial structure such as a carbon nanoball. The formation mechanism of nanosheets only from the SPP of NMP remains unclear.\n\n    In this study, various precursors that have a similar structure to NMP, such as 2-pyrrolidone, 1-methylpyrrolidine, pyrrolidine, pyrrole, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone, were used to investigate and reveal the effects of the NMP precursor and its elementary composition. They were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results demonstrated the most distinct differences in the carbon structure based on the presence of oxygen or nitrogen as well as the structural differences between each precursor.\n\n    The results of this study would uncover new parameter fields for the growth of heteroatom-CNs using this synthesis system. In addition, this study is expected to contribute toward improving the quality and the large-area growth of 2D nanostructures, such as nanosheets or graphene, in other synthesis methods.",
        "Methods": "    The chemicals, 2-pyrrolidone (C4H7NO, 99.0%), pyrrolidine (C4H9N, 99.0%), 1-methylpyrrolidine (C5H11N, 99.0%), pyrrole (C4H5N, 99.0%), cyclopentanone (C5H8O, 99.0%), and cyclohexanone (C6H10O, 99.0%), were purchased from a commercial supplier, Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI, Japan).\n\n    Figure 7 shows the experimental setup of the SPP used to synthesize carbon nanomaterials. The setup consisted of two tungsten electrodes (diameter: 1 mm) that were located at a distance of 1.5 mm between each other in a glass reactor. The glass reactor was filled with 200 mL volume of various aqueous precursors as carbon or nitrogen source. A bipolar pulsed power supply (Kurita, Japan) was used to generate the plasma in the corresponding solution at atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions. The repetition pulse width, frequency, and voltage applied to the electrodes for 5 min were fixed at 1.0 mus, 200 kHz, and 2.0 kV, respectively. After the discharge, the black carbon particles were separated by vacuum filtration through a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter (pore size of 100 nm). The as-synthesized carbon nanomaterials were then dried in an oven at 200  C for 1 h. Figure 8 depicts the various precursors, which have a similar molecule structure to NMP, as carbon or nitrogen source for the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials in this study. As mentioned above, the precursors were used to determine whether the nature of a precursor determines the shape of obtained carbon nanomaterials. 2-pyrrolidone is a precursor without a CH3 bond. 1-methylpyrrolidine is a precursor without an oxygen bond. Pyrrolidine is a precursor without both CH3 and oxygen bonds. Pyrrole is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound. Cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone are carbocyclic compounds that have a 5- and 6-membered ring with a double bonded oxygen, respectively.\n\n    TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained from a JEOL-2500SE microscope using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Raman spectra were collected by a JASCO NRS-100 spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 532.5 nm. XPS measurements were performed with a ULVAC PHI 5000 VersaProbe II using a Mg Kalpha X- ray source.",
        "Results": "    Typical TEM images were used to confirm the morphology of the carbon nanomaterials synthesized from 2-pyrrolidone, pyrrolidine, 1-methylpyrrolidine, pyrrole, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone by the SPP, as shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, the SPP of 2-pyrrolidone resulted in the formation of homogeneous NCNs as shown in Fig. 1(a). The material consisted of planar thin and crumpled nanosheets on a carbon grid. No other carbon nanostructures were found in this material. The size of the NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone ranged from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers, as approximated from scanning electron microscopy images (see Fig. S1). The structures of NCNs in the carbon nanomaterials prepared from pyrrolidine and 1-methylpyrrolidine were assessed as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively. The materials were found to consist of randomly aggregated, dense, and thick nanosheets with irregular shapes. The carbon nanomaterials prepared from pyrrole exhibited a substantially different shape by forming a three-dimensional structure of carbon nanoballs as shown in Fig. 1(d). Figure 1(e) and (f), corresponding to the TEM images of the carbon nanomaterials prepared from cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, respectively, also presented an irregular shape. Partial domains of CNs (marked with arrows) were also found. These results indicated that the morphologies of the carbon nanomaterials prepared by the SPP were strongly dependent on the different precursors.\n\n    Figure 2(a) shows a low-magnification TEM image of the NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone, and the inset is the SAED pattern. The transparent NCNs were found on the carbon grid, as it was very thin. The SAED pattern suggested that the multiple diffraction spots were caused by the back-folding of edges, intrinsic rotational stacking faults, or overlapping domains of graphene layers. The dispersed bright spots indicated that the NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone mainly consisted of MLG. In order to confirm the graphene layer number, high-magnification TEM images were also obtained. The layer number of graphene can be distinguished from the folded regions of the sheets. Figure 2(b) and (c) reveal the folded edge of the NCNs consisting of graphene sheets with layer numbers of 2-5. In general, the NCNs of this material mainly consisted of MLG as shown in Fig. 2(d).\n\n    Typical Raman spectra of the carbon nanomaterials obtained from 2-pyrrolidone, pyrrolidine, 1-methylpyrrolidine, pyrrole, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone are presented in Fig. 3. Two fundamental peaks of a D-band and G-band appeared at 1350 cm-1 and 1580 cm-1, respectively. The G-band corresponds to the E2g mode of sp2 bonded carbon atoms in a graphitized structure, whereas the D-band is usually activated by the presence of structural defects and disorder-induced phonon mode in a structure. The relative intensity ratio of the D-band to G-band (ID/IG) is measured to analyze the graphitizing degree or defect density of carbon nanomaterials. The ID/IG ratio is usually used to calculate the in-plane crystalline size (La) by the following equation:where lambda l is the laser line wavelength in nm. The corresponding L a values were determined to be 33.3, 24.7, 25.1, 18.7, 20.1, and 18.2 for the carbon nanomaterials prepared from 2-pyrrolidone, pyrrolidine, 1-methylpyrrolidine, pyrrole, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone, respectively (Table 1). Previous studies have revealed that the L a of NCNs prepared from NMP was 32.2 nm, lower than that of nanosheets prepared from 2-pyrrolidone. In this study, the conjugated CH3 in the NMP molecular structure was assumed to disrupt the large-area growth of NCNs, whereas both the presence of conjugated oxygen and nitrogen could lead to a more facile formation of nanosheets. A 2D-band in the range of 2600-2800 cm-1, which is associated with the second-order of the D-band and corresponds to the presence of a highly ordered carbon lattice, was also observed, as shown in Fig. 3. Figure 4(a) clearly shows that there was a significant difference in the intensity of the 2D-band by comparing the NCNs from 2-pyrrolidone with the carbon nanomaterials from pyrrole. Furthermore, the NCNs from 2-pyrrolidone had the highest I 2D /I G ratio, which indicated graphene quality, whereas the carbon nanomaterials from pyrrole did not have any significant 2D-band signature (Table 1).\n\n    The position and intensity of the 2D-band can also be used to identify the number of layers in graphene-related materials. The NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone had a 2D-band, which presented a single symmetrical peak that was a signature of graphene with a full width at half maximum (FWHM, omega2D) of approximately 66.7 cm-1 as shown in Fig. 4(b). These results indicate that the NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone may be composed of MLG with turbostratic stacking. This turbostratic disorder was also apparent from the results of the X-ray diffraction (XRD), which found an interlayer spacing of 0.346 nm (bulk graphite: 0.335 nm) in the (002) diffraction peak (Fig. S2). The surface area, total pore volume, and pore diameter of the NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone were 321 m2 g-1, 0.9 cm3 g-1, and 19 nm, respectively (see Fig. S3 and Table S1).\n\n    The surface elemental composition and bonding configuration of carbon nanomaterials were probed by XPS. The XPS survey spectra of the carbon nanomaterials showed predominant narrow peaks of carbon (C 1s) at 284.5 eV, along with nitrogen (N 1s) at 399.5 eV and oxygen (O 1s) at 532.5 eV without any other impurities (Fig. S4). The total N content (at%) of the carbon nanomaterials prepared from 2-pyrrolidone, pyrrolidine, 1-methylpyrrolidine, and pyrrole was 3.0%, 0.9%, 7.8%, and 2.4%, respectively. However, in the case of cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, nitrogen was not detected (Table 1).\n\n    Figure 5 presents the synthesis rates of carbon nanomaterials obtained from 2-pyrrolidone, pyrrolidine, 1-methylpyrrolidine, pyrrole, cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone (0.0083, 0.0133, 0.0290, 0.1853, 0.0590, and 0.0623 g min-1, respectively). Morishita et al. reported a difference in synthesis rates depending on the mechanism of nanocarbon formation via SPP with different starting precursors, as analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). They mentioned that the synthesis rate for nanocarbons prepared from ring molecules was substantially greater than that for nanocarbons prepared from linear molecules as a result of different nanocarbon formation routes. This study also found a similar trend: The synthesis rate of carbon nanomaterials from pyrrole was noticeably higher than that of carbon nanomaterials from other starting precursors. The reason for this may have been that the excitation of the pi-bonds in saturated ring molecules resulted in the formation of cation radicals, leading to direct polymerization. The lower synthesis rates of carbon nanomaterials from 2-pyrrolidone, pyrrolidine and 1-methylpyrrolidine may be a result of the C-N bonds (293 kJ mol-1) in these precursors being easily broken in the solution plasma, leading to the formation of linear molecules. However, a slightly different synthesis route is possible; Panomsuwan et al. used acrylonitrile, which consists of linear molecules, as a starting precursor and they could not synthesize carbon nanosheets. Therefore, a modified carbonization mechanism for carbon nanosheets is required.\n\n    The electrical resistivity of the NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone was measured with a device consisting of two probes (model 692A, Metronix Corp.). Carbon powder was placed in a hollow Teflon cylinder with an inner diameter of 5 mm and the electrical resistivity measured while the sample was compressed with a force of 0.6 MPa. The resistivity of the NCNs prepared from 2-pyrrolidone was 0.053 ohm cm, which is of the same order of magnitude as that of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as shown in Table 2 . This resistivity also represented an improvement in comparison to NCNs prepared from NMP.\n\n    The relationships between the results outlined above can be explained as follows. The main reason for the formation of carbon nanosheets was breakage of the C-N bond. The dissociation energy (293 kJ mol-1) of the C-N bond is lower than that of the C-C bond (348 kJ mol-1). Therefore, the C-N bond in organic precursors such as 2-pyrrolidone was easily broken in solution plasma, as shown in Fig. 6. Further, the precursors were ionized and reacted with each other as highly active radicals in the plasma and plasma/gas interface. During these steps, the carbon residue, formed through the cleavage of the C-N bond, presumably led to the formation of H2O, NH2 or NH3, resulting in long carbon chains. The chains then underwent changes to form a graphite-like structure by intermolecular crosslinking of adjacent chains by dehydrogenation reactions, as shown in Fig. 6. Hence, the SPP with 2-pyrrolidone, pyrrolidine and 1-methylpyrrolidine led to the formation of carbon nanosheets. In addition, when comparing the precursors, the oxygen bond plays a beneficial role in the growth of large-scale and high-quality NCNs. Lee et al. found an inverse relationship between the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (H/C) and sp2 domain size. The reason for the growth of large-scale and high-quality NCNs may be that the amount of hydrogen was further reduced by the elimination of the H2O that was generated in the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, as shown in Table S2. This is why the NCNs prepared from pyrrolidine and 1-methylpyrrolidine, which have greater H/C ratios, produced randomly aggregated, dense, and thick nanosheets of irregular shapes.\n\n    On the other hand, the SPP with cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and pyrrole did not lead to the formation of carbon nanosheets owing to the greater dissociation energy of the C-C bond than of the C-N bond, resulting in a reaction without bond breakage. Kroto et al. demonstrated that the presence of pentagon carbon rings in the nucleation process results in the growth of spiral shells, which can be considered a mechanism for carbon anion formation. In the same vein, Kang et al. reported that the mechanism behind the formation of carbon spheres prepared from benzene using SPP was confirmed by the identification of evidence of compounds which can be used as precursors for the growth of quasi-icosahedral shells. Hence, the formation mechanism of carbon nanoballs from cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, and pyrrole, which are ring molecules like benzene, was also proposed in a similar manner.",

        "Title": "    Enhancement of nitrogen self-doped nanocarbons electrocatalyst via tune-up solution plasma synthesis",
        "Abstract": "    The development of a metal-free carbon based electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an essential issue for energy conversion systems. Herein, we suggest a tune-up solution plasma (SP) synthesis based on a simple one-step and cost-effective method to fabricate nitrogen self-doped graphitic carbon nanosheets (NGS) as an electrocatalyst. This novel strategy using a low-pass filter circuit provides plasma stability and energy control during discharge in pyridine, determining the graphitic structure of nanocarbons doped with nitrogen. Notably, NGS have a relatively high surface area (621 m2 g-1), and high contents of nitrogen bonded as pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N of 55.5 and 21.3%, respectively. As an efficient metal-free electrocatalyst, NGS exhibit a high onset potential (-0.18 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and a 3.8 transferred electron pathway for ORR in alkaline solution, as well as better long-term durability (4% current decrease after 10 000 s of operation) than commercial Pt/C (22% current drop). From this point of view, the nitrogen self-doped graphitic carbon nanosheet material synthesized using the tune-up SP system is a promising catalyst for the ORR, as an alternative to a Pt catalyst for application in energy conversion devices.\n\n    The synthesized nitrogen self-doped graphitic carbon nanosheets material using the tune-up SP system is a promising catalyst for the ORR, as an alternative to Pt catalyst for energy conversion device application.",
        "Introduction": "    Efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have attracted widespread attention for achieving optimal performance for application in energy storage and conversion devices, such as fuel cells (FC) and metal-air batteries (MABs). However, catalysts on the cathode suffer from several critical obstacles, and the possible commercialization of FC and MABs is difficult due to their inherently sluggish kinetics and high overpotential in the ORR. Currently, platinum (Pt) and platinum supported on carbon materials (Pt/C) are regarded as the best solutions to these problems because of a four-electron reduction pathway in the ORR process, but their prohibitive cost, low reserves, and poor methanol tolerance have interrupted the development of their large-scale commercialization. In this regard, ongoing research efforts have been devoted to searching to replace Pt with a Pt-free catalyst with highly efficient performance, selectivity, and durability, such as a non-precious metal supported on nanocarbons, or metal-free heterogeneous nanocarbons. Among these, metal-free heterogeneous nanocarbons have been regarded as one of the most prominent alternatives for an ORR electrocatalyst when heteroatoms (e.g. N, B, P, S, and I) are incorporated into the carbonaceous skeleton. In particular, N-functionalized nanocarbons represent the most investigated catalyst for efficient ORR activity, because of their comparable catalytic efficiency, low cost, and stability in an alkaline medium. In detail, N-functionalized nanocarbons can play a crucial role in the ORR by imparting higher positive charge density to neighboring carbon atoms and facilitating the dissociation of the O-O bond on the neighboring C atoms.\n\n    A two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanosheet, which is a sheet with few to multi-layers, exhibits intrinsic characteristics such as a large surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and high mechanical/chemical stability. Moreover, a number of catalytic sites with an efficient pathway for the ORR can be created by the planar structure of a 2D carbon nanosheet. In particular, carbon nanosheets containing heteroatoms, especially nitrogen, have been demonstrated using practical experiments and theoretical calculations to effectively improve the ORR activity in an alkaline electrolyte. However, the synthesis procedure and conditions are relatively complicated and strict, resulting in a high fabrication cost.\n\n    Solution Plasma (SP), a non-equilibrium discharge in liquids at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, has emerged as a useful synthetic method for various nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, nanocarbons, heterogeneous nanocarbons, and transition metal-carbon composites. Among these nanomaterials, the most interesting achievement is the formation of heterogeneous nanocarbons. The SP synthesis approach has not only provided new insight into the fabrication and design of nanocarbons but has also been further extended to a series with heteroatom doping simply by selecting organic precursors containing the desired heteroatoms. However, the conventional SP synthesis is still at an early stage in the field of carbon fabrication and, in particular, it is difficult to control the morphology, structure, and bonding configuration between carbon and the doped heteroatoms. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a tune-up SP system which is composed of a low-pass filter circuit to improve the discharge stability by controlling the current oscillations (Fig. S1 ).\n\n    Herein, we propose a new synthetic approach for nitrogen self-doped nanocarbons by the tune-up SP system. Notably, our synthesis strategy has the advantage of producing milligrams of material within ten minutes without any pre or post treatment, and it is a one-step process, unlike other processes. Nitrogen doped graphitic carbon nanosheets (NGS) were synthesized by this new tune-up SP approach and nitrogen doped amorphous carbon nanoparticles (NAP) were synthesized by conventional SP. As-prepared NGS exhibit a graphitic structure with a high surface area and mesoporous structure, as well as an ORR activity that is comparable with that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, and show excellent stability.",

All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.\n\n    To generate the plasma in pyridine for the synthesis of NGS, a tune-up SP system was set up, as shown in Fig. 1. The nanocarbons synthesized using the conventional SP system were denoted as NAP. Two tungsten electrodes shielded with an insulating ceramic tube were fixed at the center of a Teflon  reactor with a gap distance of 1.0 mm. The plasma was generated between these electrodes using a bipolar pulsed power supply (MPS-R06K01C-WP1-6CH, Kurita) used in two cases with or without a low-pass filter circuit made in our laboratory. The low-pass filter circuit consists of a parallel capacitor of 2 nF, a variable resistor series from 50 to 150 Omega, and a variable inductor set at 100 muH to adjust the plasma stability. Using the tune-up SP system, the stability of the plasma was considerably improved by eliminating the energy fluctuations which determine the structure of the synthesized nanocarbons. Fig. S1  shows a characterization of the plasma by its electrical energy according to a current-voltage (I-V) curve. The optimum pulse duration and pulse repetition frequency were 0.5 mus and 30 kHz, respectively. The discharge was generated in a volume of 200 mL of pyridine under stirring. After discharging for 30 min, the obtained black powdered material was separated from the unreactive pyridine using a membrane filter paper (0.1 mum, PTFE) and a suction pump, and it was washed several times with ethanol until the remaining solvent after washing was colorless. The acquired nanocarbon material was dried at 60  C in an oven for 12 h.\n\n    Transmission Electron Microscopy, Selected Area Electron Diffraction, and Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy (TEM, SAED, and EDS, JEOL JEM-2500SE at 200 kV) observations were conducted for the study the microstructure, shape and size, and the elemental composition of the synthesized nanocarbon material. An image obtained from Nanoscope IIIa Multimode Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, Veeco) was used to measure the thickness of an NGS sample prepared by dropping the dispersed nanocarbon material in ethanol on an Si/SiO2 substrate. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were performed using Cu Kalpha (0.154 nm) X-rays source in the range from 15  to 60  with 0.02  step and 2  min-1 scan speed. Raman spectra were recorded with a Raman spectrometer (JASCO NRS-100) equipped with a laser with a wavelength of 532.5 nm. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on a Belsorp-mini II sorption analyzer (MicrotracBEL Corp.) to investigate the specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of all samples. The specific surface area was measured by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at a relative pressure between 0.05 and 0.30 and liquid nitrogen temperature. The pore volume and pore size distribution were determined by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The chemical bond structures were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Ulvac-PHI 5000 versaprobe II) using Al Kalpha radiation (1486.6 eV) as an X-ray source. The emission current and the anode voltage of the source were set at 0.1 mA and 15 kV, respectively. The binding energy (BE) was calibrated using the containment carbon (C 1s = 284.5 eV). Each binding energy was referenced from the NIST XPS Database. The elemental analysis (EA) of C, H, and N was performed using an elemental analyzer (PerkinElmer 2400 Series). The electrical conductivity was measured with a device based on a four probe method with a resistivity meter (2001 multimeter, TFT Corp., Keithley Instruments) and DC constant power supply (model 692A, Metronix Corp.). The samples were inserted into a Teflon cylinder with 0.5 cm diameter. The prepared samples were compressed at 0.6 MPa between two brass electrodes.\n\n    The electrochemical measurements were carried out on an HZ-5000 electrochemical analyzer (Hokudo Denko Inc.) equipped with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode filled with saturated KCl solution were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All the samples for the electrochemical measurements were coated onto a glassy carbon (GC) electrode with 3 mm diameter and prepared as follows: 50 muL of Nafion solution was added to 0.5 mL of ethanol, and then 5 mg of finely ground catalyst was dispersed in the as-prepared solution by at least 30 min sonication to form a homogeneous suspension. Then a volume of 5 muL from the suspension was loaded onto the GC electrode and dried at room temperature. Before measurements, N2 or O2 gasses were purged into 0.1 M KOH electrolyte for at least 1 hour. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1 from -1.0 to 0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 from -1.0 to 0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The rotation speed was varied from 100 to 3600 rpm. Commercial 20% Pt/C was selected as the performance benchmark. The electrochemical stability was measured by the chronoamperometric response in 0.1 M KOH saturated with oxygen for 10 000 s at -0.4 V. All the polarization curves were corrected for background currents, which were determined in the N2-saturated electrolyte.",
        "Results": "    The morphological structures of NGS and NAP were investigated by TEM. As shown in Fig. 2(a), NGS show typical sheet-like morphology. The corresponding SAED pattern shown in the inset in Fig. 2(a) reveals well-defined diffraction spots which mean that the NGS are crystallized. The HR-TEM image further indicates that the NGS are composed of multi-layer graphitic nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Well-contoured edges originating from the graphitic layer clearly appear with a d space of the 002 crystal plane of approximately 0.350 nm, which is close to that of single-crystal graphite with d = 0.335 nm.\n\n    The phase identification of the samples was performed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 3. The NGS present two prominent peaks, near 2theta   25.4  and 42.9  which indicate 002 and 100/101 diffraction planes of graphite, respectively. Using Bragg's law, the interlayer distance of NGS was calculated to be approximately 0.351 nm from the 002 diffraction peak, which is slightly larger than that of single-crystal graphite 0.335 nm. This result also agrees with the TEM results. The AFM image (Fig. S2 ) demonstrates that the thickness of most NGS samples is 2.97 +- 0.94 nm, corresponding to 10 layers according to the theoretical thickness of single-layer graphene (0.34 nm). The EDS mapping images of NGS correspond to the elemental composition (Fig. 1(c)). Carbon and nitrogen atoms are distributed throughout the carbon frame, indicating the homogenous incorporation of nitrogen into the graphitic carbon nanosheets. Water impurities in pyridine and slight oxidation while drying the samples might explain the presence of oxygen in the composition of the synthesized materials.\n\n    In contrast, NAP samples reveal the formation of aggregates of small carbon particles with a diameter of approximately 10-30 nm, as shown in Fig. S3(a).  The corresponding SAED pattern (the inset of Fig. S3(a) ) presents a bright center and diffuse ring pattern without any diffraction spots, confirming its amorphous nature. The two major peaks in the XRD pattern are also broad, which means amorphous and disordered carbon. From these results, we can conclude that NAP synthesized by conventional SP is an amorphous form of carbon nanoparticles in accordance with many other works.\n\n    Raman spectroscopy has been used to conduct further structural investigation. Raman spectra of both NGS and NAP show two bands, at approximately ~1595 cm-1 for the G band and ~1349 cm-1 for the D band, as shown in Fig. 4. The G band is attributed to one of the two E2g modes of the stretching vibrations in the sp2 domains of perfect graphite. The D band refers to the disorder and imperfection of sp2 hybridized carbon The second-order D band (2D) at ~2712 cm-1 is a typical feature of graphitic carbon. The integrated intensities ratio between the G band and D band (IG/ID) depends linearly on the crystallite size (La) of the nanocarbons, which was calculated from the equation: La (nm) = (2.4 x 10-10)lambdal4(ID/IG)-1, where lambdal is the laser wavelength in nanometer units. The IG/ID of NGS is 1.05 which is much higher than the value for NAP (0.55), so that the crystallite size of NGS (95.9 nm) is bigger than that of NAP (50.6 nm), implying that the carbon nanosheets have long-range order and a high degree of graphitization. This result correlates with the SAED above and HR-TEM data that show that NGS have a graphitic structure while NAP contain an amorphous carbon structure. In the Raman spectrum of NGS, the intensity of the D band is still high compared with a few layers of graphene, which means that NGS have more defect sites which can influence the electrocatalytic activity for ORR because of the enhanced charge density on carbon atoms.\n\n    Moreover, the ratio of WD and ID/(ID + IG) was correlated to the better-ordered parameter for the disordered carbon materials. The ratios of ID/(ID + IG) for NGS and NAP were about 49.9 and 48.3, respectively. These values indicate that the graphitization of NGS and NAP were almost the same, and were less than for activated carbons and more than for conventional graphite. The values of WD for NGS and NGA were 64 cm-1 and 127 cm-1. The values of WD for NGS and NGA were closer to those of conventional graphite and activated carbons. Thus, the structure of NGS has become microcrystalline compared to that of conventional graphite and was similar to that of microcrystalline graphite. The structure of NGA was more disordered and had lower graphitization than activated carbons.\n\n    Specific surface area (SSA) and porosity, which are necessary for understanding ORR activity, were investigated by N2 sorption analysis. The BET surface area of NAP was measured to be 48 m2 g-1. The BET surface area of NGS synthesized using the tune-up SP system was greatly increased and reached as high as 621 m2 g-1, as shown in Fig. 5. All samples exhibit a type IV adsorption/desorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop at relative pressures ranging from 0.4 to 0.9, suggesting the characteristic of a mesoporous structure. The corresponding pore size distributions of all samples derived by the BJH method indicate a broad distribution on the meso-macro length scale (the inset of Fig. 5).\n\n    Although the active sites for ORR on nitrogen-doped carbon materials are still an open question, there is no doubt that the nitrogen containing functional groups facilitate the electron transfer to enhance ORR kinetics in a carbon matrix. XPS measurements were used to demonstrate that the ORR activity is dependent on the bonding configuration of nitrogen in the nanocarbon structure. The incorporation of nitrogen atoms in the carbon structure was confirmed by XPS and EA measurements. The survey XPS spectra of the NGS and NAP clearly show a peak at 400.0 eV for N 1s in addition to the dominant graphitic C 1s peak at 284.5 eV, which indicates the presence of nitrogen in the carbon structure (Fig. S4 ). Importantly, no peak of the tungsten electrode was found in the spectra. The atomic contents of C, O, and N for NGS and NAP derived from the XPS analysis are summarized in Table S2.  The XPS data show that the nitrogen content of NGS (6.0 at%) was around twice as high as that of NAP (2.9 at%), which was almost the same as the results acquired from EA analysis (Table S3 ).\n\n    High-resolution XPS measurements examined in more detail the chemical bonding configuration of the NGS and NAP on C 1s and N 1s peaks (Fig. 6(a)-(d)). The high-resolution asymmetric peak in the C 1s region presented in Fig. 6(a) and (c) indicates the presence of different types of carbon bonding: CC bond (284.5 eV), C-C bond (285.0 eV), C-N bond (285.9 eV), C-O bond (286.5 eV), and CO bond (287.0 eV), proving the graphitic carbon and the successful incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon structure. To clarify the effect of nitrogen incorporation, we analyzed the high-resolution N 1s peak, as shown in Fig. 6(b) and (d). The XPS N 1s peak can be deconvoluted into four components corresponding to pyridinic-N (398.9 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.4 eV), graphitic-N (400.9 eV), and pyridinic N-oxide (403.2 eV). The XPS results for NGS show higher relative contents of nitrogen bonded as pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N at 55.5 and 21.3%, respectively, compared to NAP (47.2 and 8.5, respectively), as represented in Fig. 6(f). Also, the calculated atomic percentages of types of nitrogen bonding in the prepared samples are given in Table S4.  A significant increase in pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N bonds is clearly confirmed, while there was no considerable change in graphitic-N and pyridinic oxide-N bonds in the material synthesized by the tune-up SP system. Pyridinic-N refers to nitrogen atoms possibly attached at the edges of the graphite planes, where each N atom is bonded to two carbon atoms and donates one of the lone pair electrons to the aromatic pi conjugation. The pyrrolic-N atom is incorporated into the five-membered heterocyclic ring, which is bonded to two carbon atoms and contributes two p-electrons to the pi system. The pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N can be located at the graphite edge (Fig. S5 ). According to many references, the formation of the edge-N, which is composed of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, can reduce the adsorption energy of O2. NGS possess a higher content of edge-N than NAP, implying that the ORR performance might be enhanced.\n\n    To verify the catalytic activity, the ORR of all the synthesized nanocarbons was measured by CV, as shown in Fig. 7(a). All samples show a well-defined characteristic ORR peak in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The peak potential of the ORR of the NGS sample at -0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode significantly shifts to a positive value in comparison with the NAP sample with its peak potential at -0.52 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Also, the NGS catalyst presents a higher cathodic current density than NAP, suggesting a considerably enhanced ORR activity due to the increased electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity results are shown in Table S5.  Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements on the rotating disk electrode (RDE) were further performed to verify the electrocatalytic kinetics toward ORR. For comparison, a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C as reference catalyst was measured with the same mass loading on a GC electrode as the samples. Fig. 7(b) exhibits LSV curves obtained from a rotation rate of 1600 rpm, which obviously exhibit the differences in the ORR activity. A more positive onset potential (Eonset = -0.18 V), half-wave potential (E1/2 = -0.28 V) and higher limiting current density (LCD = 2.7 mA cm-2) are revealed for NGS than for NAP (Eonset = -0.21 V, E1/2 = 0.24 V and LCD = 1.8 mA cm-2). Although NGS are inefficient compared with commercial Pt/C for which Eonset = -0.03 V, E1/2 = -0.14 V, and LCD = 3.8 mA cm-2, they still show a possible use as a metal-free catalyst in ORR. To further understand the ORR mechanism of this catalyst, ORR polarization curves of NAP and NGS at various rotations from 100 to 3600 rpm were carried out (Fig. S6 ). The Koutechy-Levich (K-L, see ESI ) formula was employed to calculate the average electron number (na) in the reduction reaction, deduced from the fact that the ORR current density is a function of the electrode rotation rate. According to the slope of the K-L plots (inset Fig. S6 ), the na of NAP was found to be 2.9, which represents poor ORR activity, while the na of NGS was calculated to be 3.8, which is close to the 4 electron transfer number on a Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 7(c)). The value of 3.8 may suggest that NGS were mainly dominated by a four electron reaction pathway similar to that of Pt/C. On the other hand, the na = 2.9 of NAP may proceed predominantly with a pathway of two-electron and four-electron reactions simultaneously. The higher current density and the four electron process indicate that NGS is a kind of highly efficient ORR catalyst. Also, the ORR activity of NGS is closer to the highest values in previous reports, shown in Table S6,  from the number of electrons transferred, although these NGS can be synthesized compared to the other N-doped carbons. This high performance is due to the improved crystallinity of the carbon region, where electrons are transferred.\n\n    Consequently, based on the above characterization of the catalyst, the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of NGS can be attributed to the good electric conductivity, high surface area, porous structure, and a high content of edge-N species. The better electric conductivity of NGS results from the sheet-like morphology and graphitic structure compared with NAP, consequently determining a higher current density during ORR and assuring a good electron transfer to and from the catalytic site. The relatively high surface area (621.48 m2 g-1) and the mesoporous structure of the NGS catalyst mean a lot of active sites and have a direct influence on ORR activity and the mass transfer of O2. The analysis of N active sites was carried out by representing the onset potential together with the N species concentration, as in Fig. S7.  Importantly, the onset potential shifts more positively according to the increase in the edge-N contents, implying an enhanced ORR activity. DFT calculation and experimental results indicate that pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, which possess one lone pair of electrons in addition to one electron donated to the conjugated pi bond, facilitate the high spin density and large atomic charge density on the adjacent carbon atoms on which O2 adsorption is enhanced compared to graphitic-N and pyridinic N-oxide. In conclusion, the high content of edge-N of NGS determines good ORR activity.\n\n    The stability of the NAP, NGS, and Pt/C catalysts was acquired by the i-t chronoamperometric response in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the current density of NGS decreases to 96% after 10 000 s, which is higher than that of NAP (94%), due to the high content of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic N, as well as the graphitic carbon structure in the NGS (Fig. 6(f)). Although the electrocatalytic activity of NAP and NGS is not yet comparable to that of Pt/C, the ORR stability presents a better performance in alkaline media. The poor durability of Pt/C (78%) can be caused by migration, aggregation of Pt particles and dissolution, and detachment from the carbon support under the continuous potential. These problems can be solved by metal-free carbon based materials with their covalent bonding of a catalytically active heteroatom in the carbon framework.",
        "Conclusion": "    In summary, we suggest a novel route to synthesize nitrogen doped graphitic carbon nanosheets (NGS), using a tune-up solution plasma system. The strongest potential of SP for the N-doped carbon synthesis is to control the higher concentration of nitrogen, although the SP process has advantages over conventional thermal processes. The proposed method gives several advantages over the assembly of nanocarbons: (a) a one-step process, (b) an ambient reaction environment, (c) a straightforward and easy setup, (d) cost-effective production, (e) possible large-scale synthesis quantities, and (f) eco-friendly fabrication. In particular, the tune-up SP synthesis provides stability during the discharge in liquid, influencing the synthesized nanocarbon characteristics. The NGS material not only has a large surface area, high nitrogen content, and good electrical conductivity, but also has the appropriate active N species of a catalyst to enhance the ORR activity. In detail, the electrochemical measurements demonstrate that NGS show comparable catalytic activity and superior stability to Pt/C in alkaline medium, so that low-cost and large-scale nitrogen self-doped nanocarbon is a promising candidate for the next generation of electrocatalyst in metal-air batteries.",
        "Discussion": "    To elucidate the differences in material characteristics between the NGS and NAP according to plasma stability during the synthesis, we performed plasma diagnostics using the OES method, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The emission spectra present the degree of dissociation of pyridine in the two types of SP and the presence of the active species as radicals in the plasma. From the emission intensities, only the relative radical number density can be discussed. The Swan bands of the C2 molecule emission have much higher intensity in the case of plasma during the synthesis of NAP that of NGS, exhibiting a higher electron excitation energy of NAP (5000 K, 0.43 eV), as shown in Table S6,  which produces a higher degree of dissociation of pyridine, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The excitation temperature of C2 molecules in plasma was calculated to be 5000 K, which means that the organic compound was highly decomposed, so that the amorphous carbon structure was synthesized by carbonization. On the other hand, the decomposition of C2 molecules from the pyridine decreased when the SP system was tuned-up by the low-pass filter circuit. The C2 molecules were mainly produced at the interface between the plasma and the liquid since a large gradient of temperature from the plasma to the interface was relatively lower than that without the tune-up condition (conventional SP), as shown in Fig. 8(b) and S8.  These C2 molecules, which might exist as C2H2 and C2H4, lead the reaction, and subsequently, C2 molecules are mainly assembled at the interface, which can provide the graphitic structure.\n\n    N species can also be explained in the same way as above. The high dissociation of pyridine leads to nitrogen species as CN and N radicals in the conventional SP system. However, the formed nitrogen leaves the plasma as a gas, resulting in a low content of nitrogen in the NAP samples (Tables S2 and S3 ). In contrast, the low degree of dissociation of nitrogen in the tune-up SP system favors the preservation of the pyridine structure rather than breaking the aromatic ring. This reaction might create not only more nitrogen content in the graphitic carbon structure by aromatic ring assembly, but also create active sites with edge-N, such as pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, which are useful in the ORR (Fig. 6).",

        "Title": "    Genetic and Immunological Factors Involved in Natural Resistance to HIV-1 Infection",
        "Abstract": "    Infection with Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) induces severe alterations of the immune system leading to an increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies. However, exposure to the virus does not always results in infection. Indeed, there exist individuals who have been repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 but do not exhibit clinical or serological evidence of infection, known as exposed seronegative individuals. Many studies have focused on the different mechanisms involved in natural resistance to HIV-1 infection, and have reported several factors associated with this phenomenon, including the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the viral coreceptors, innate and adaptive immune cells with particular phenotypic and functional features, and molecules such as antibodies and soluble factors that play an important role in defense against infection by HIV-1. The study of these factors could be the key for controlling this viral infection. This review summarizes the main mechanisms involved in resistance to HIV-1 infection.",
        "Introduction": "    Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection remains one of the main public health problems in the world for which a vaccine is not yet available. In 2008 around 33.4 million persons were infected with HIV-1 throughout the world, with an annual incidence of 2.7 million infections, of which approximately 50% correspond to infections in women.\n\n    The natural history and development of HIV-1 infection is heterogeneous, if one considers the variability in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-free period exhibited by infected individuals; the median time of appearance of AIDS clinical symptoms is between 8 and 10 years after infection. However, cohort studies have identified a small fraction of seropositive (SPs) individuals, about 5-10%, who despite infection for more than 10 years, remain symptomless and maintain a relatively high CD4+ cell count (>500 CD4+ cells/microl) without antiviral therapy; they are known as long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). In addition, there are two new phenotypes of SP individuals who exhibit a spontaneous and sustained control of viral replication at least for one year in the absence of antiretroviral therapy; the first group is known as elite controllers since they maintain undetectable HIV RNA levels (< 50 copies/mL), and the second group known as viremic controllers maintains detectable viral loads although < 2000 copies/mL. Likewise, individuals have been reported, who are frequently exposed to the virus by sexual, parenteral or vertical routes, but do not exhibit serological evidence of infection, or any signs or symptoms of immunodeficiency; they are known as high-risk exposed HIV-seronegative or exposed uninfected (ESNs) individuals. These groups have revealed the existence of natural resistance mechanisms against HIV. Several studies have been aimed at determining the various mechanisms involved in natural resistance to HIV infection, and so far it has been associated with immunological factors, host genetic variants as well as soluble factors that prevent or limit viral infection (Fig. (1) and Table1). Among the genetic factors, the CCR5-delta 32 (CCR5- 32) mutation has been the most widely investigated and is associated with natural resistance to HIV infection, because it efficiently inhibits entry of R5 strains; some treatments against HIV infection have even been developed based on these findings. In addition, other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HIV coreceptors and their natural ligands are involved in this process.\n\n    Several investigators have demonstrated the presence of immunological mechanisms that can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection or limit its progression. Certain reports indicate that apoptosis of target cells, increased production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) by natural killer (NK) cells and positive regulation of costimulatory molecules are factors associated with resistance. The humoral response contributes significantly to resistance to HIV infection through the production of anti- HIV IgA in mucosal and finally, several soluble factors such as RNases, chemokines, cytokines and cationic proteins are involved in blocking HIV infection in ESNs or in decreasing the time required to disease progression in LTNPs individuals.\n\n    In this review, we describe the main factors involved in natural resistance to HIV-1 infection associated with ESN individuals, including some findings of our research group.\n\n    The differences in the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection are due partly to genetic characteristics, and many studies are aimed at identifying and establishing the relationship between the presentation of different polymorphisms and the lack of infection or delay in AIDS progression. The main genetic conditions are described.\n\n    The most important genetic factor related to natural resistance to HIV-1 infection is the presence of the  32 mutation in the CCR5 gene. This mutation occurs in approximately 10% of Caucasian individuals and represents a deletion of 32 bp resulting in the synthesis of a truncated protein with only 4 of the 7 transmembrane domains required for protein expression at the cell surface. Homozygote individuals for this mutation ( 32/ 32) are highly resistant to HIV-1 infection, mainly to R5 strains, whereas the heterozygotes are susceptible to infection, but exhibit slow progression to AIDS. Nevertheless, this mutation only explains 3.6% of ESNs, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in natural resistance to infection.\n\n    Different polymorphisms in the CCR5 promoter region have been reported and associated with different rates of AIDS progression and natural resistance to HIV infection. Many mutations have been described in this gene, which can produce amino acid substitutions and alter the function of the coreceptor. The polymorphism -2459 (A/G) in the CCR5 promoter has been associated with delayed progression to AIDS, and seropositive individuals with the G/G genotype display slower progression to AIDS than those with the A/A genotype. The CCR5- 32 allele together with the CCR5 -2459G SNP have been associated with a negative effect on the expression of CCR5 in both T-helper cells and monocytes from ESNs, indicating the relationship of these genotypes with natural resistance to HIV infection.\n\n    Previously, Mummidi et al. reported high genetic variation in the sequence of the CCR5 regulatory region in humans and these CCR5 haplotypes were classified in seven evolutionarily distinct human haplogroups (HH): HH-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -G; thus, each haplogroup included the combination of a unique SNP in the CCR5 regulatory region, and the presence of either the CCR2 I64V SNP or CCR5- 32 mutation. The HH-G2 which includes the CCR5- 32 mutation was reported to be protective in children exposed to HIV during prgnancy. The HH-A and HH-F2 haplotypes are significantly more frequent in African Americans than in Caucasians, and their presence is associated with disease retardation in SP individuals; in addition, the genotype HH-C/HH-G2 is related with the strongest protective effects in the same population. Recently, it was observed that the frequency of the HH-C/HH-G1 and HH-C/HH-F2 genotypes is higher in ESNs compared to SPs, indicating that these haplogroups could be associated to HIV resistance (J. Vega, unpublished observations, 2009).\n\n    In HIV-1-exposed but seronegative intravascular drug users (IDUs) of southeast Asia but not in HIV-1 infected individuals, a guanine to adenine substitution in the 316 position of the CCR5 gene (CCR5 G316A) has been reported; it affects the cellular expression of the coreceptor, suggesting its association with natural resistance to infection.\n\n    In vitro studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 can use alternative coreceptors, which can exhibit allelic variations that have been associated with resistance to infection and delay in AIDS progression. Among the polymorphisms described in these coreceptors, a genetic variant in the coding region of the CCR2 (CCR2-V64I) produces a change from valine to isoleucine in position 64 of the protein. Some studies have suggested that the CCR2-V64I polymorphism induces negative expression of the CCR5 and CXCR4 molecules at the cell surface, decreasing the availability of susceptible cells to HIV-1 infection.\n\n    It is known that CCR2 and CCR5 loci are in close proximity, about 10 kb, on chromosome 3, opening the possibility to find non-random association of their alleles. Smith et al., have shown that the mutant allele CCR2-64I is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the CCR5- 32 allele in Afro-Americans, Hispanics and Asian individuals. In addition, several reports indicate that the CCR2-64I allele and the polymorphism CCR5-59653T in the CCR5 promoter are in linkage disequilibrium. The demonstration that these mutant alleles are protective against HIV-1 infection and AIDS progression has important implications for therapy, since these receptors are required for viral entry.\n\n    The macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1alpha/CCL3) and beta (MIP-1beta/CCL4) and the regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5) are CCR5 ligands; several studies have demonstrated the antiviral activity of these proteins. The MIP-1alpha and MIP-1( monokines have two genetic variants, CCL3L1 and CCL4L1, respectively; they encode proteins that also bind to CCR5, increasing ligand availability, competing with the virus for the coreceptor and inhibiting HIV-1 infection. These genetic variants decrease the probability of acquiring HIV-1 infection and promote recovery of the CD4+ cells after initiation of Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), particularly in individuals with high copy numbers of these alleles, suggesting that lower availability of CCR5 on the cell surface could reduce HIV binding, affecting HIV infection. Recently, a C459T SNP in the intron 1 of MIP-1alpha was described whose frequency was higher in ESNs compared to SPs, suggesting that it could increase the efficiency of mRNA processing, thus increasing protein expression (J. Vega, unpublished observations, 2009).\n\n    Some polymorphisms in RANTES are associated to resistance. Liu et al. reported that -28G and -403G/A SNPs in the upstream non-coding region are associated with increased transcription of the RANTES gene, leading to reduced CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HAART naive HIV-1-infected individuals.\n\n    Polymorphisms in human beta defensins (HBD) have been associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection. We reported that the homozygosity for the A692G polymorphism in DEFB1 was significantly more frequent in ESNs than in SPs.\n\n    Alleles of the MHC involved in slow progression to AIDS and resistance to HIV infection have been reported. HLA-B57-restricted CTLs target several gag epitopes that induce much better HIV immune responses through cytolytic destruction of infected cells. HLA-B27 has been associated with delayed HIV-1 escape due to broad reactivity against gag epitopes. Both alleles occur at a higher frequency in LTNPs compared to healthy controls (HCs), suggesting that these molecules have an important antiviral role.\n\n    The role of the HLA in HIV-1 vertical transmission had been also explored. An increasing class I HLA concordance between mother/neonate was associated to a higher risk for HIV-1 transmission, that was gene-dose related, suggesting that mother-child MHC discordance could be a protective factor through-out the allogenic immune response. As will be discussed later, and consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that mother/neonate HLA discordance is associated with high mRNA expression of RNase 1 and with the production of an alloantigen-stimulated factor (ASF), a soluble protein with strong anti-HIV-1 activity.\n\n    Several investigations have centered on the characteristics of the innate immune response in ESNs, considering that innate immunity is very active on mucosal surfaces that are primary sites of HIV-1 entry.\n\n    Apoptosis has been reported not only as a pathogenic mechanism, but also as a mechanism of resistance and control of a variety of infections. We recently determined the role of apoptosis in natural resistance to HIV infection. We found that peripheral blood monocytes in the ESNs group had a greater predisposition to undergo spontaneous apoptosis as well as apoptosis induced by HIV infection in vitro, compared to monocytes from HCs at low risk of HIV infection. This suggests that monocytes could play an important role in the control of HIV infection by undergoing apoptosis.\n\n    During HIV-1 infection the function and number of NK cells is altered; however, NK cells secrete soluble factors that inhibit HIV infection in vitro. We reported that the expression of IFN-gamma by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)/Ionomycin-activated CD56bright NK cells and CD3+/CD56+ cells was significantly higher in ESNs compared to HCs. Since anti-viral effects of IFN-gamma are well established, our results suggest that IFN-gamma production by innate immune cells might be one of the multiple factors involved in controlling the establishment of sexually transmitted HIV-1 infection. Scott-Algara et al. evaluated the lytic activity of NK cells in IDUs, who remained HIV-1 uninfected despite high-risk exposure: there was a higher lytic activity in ESNs than in controls or seroconverters. In addition, NK cells producing IFN-gamma, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the chemokines CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 were also higher among ESNs. Boulet et al. demonstrated an increased proportion of KIR (Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor)-3DS1 homozygotes in ESNs compared to HIV-1 infected individuals. This finding was associated to an increase in NK cell activation, induction of a strong anti-HIV-1 response and inhibition of the establishment of infection, supporting the anti-HIV-1 activity of NK cells.\n\n    Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role by providing the signals required to induce immune responses. We therefore evaluated the number, phenotype and function of DCs during intrauterine exposure to HIV-1 in uninfected babies born to HIV-1 positive mothers. Intrauterine exposure of the DCs to HIV-1 induces qualitative and quantitative changes in these cells, such as positive regulation of CD80 and CD86 in response to several stimuli, suggesting that these cells could be involved in increasing T lymphocyte activation in these children and could be responsible for the protective immune response observed.\n\n    A significant number of soluble factors produced by several cell types have been reported with the capacity to inhibit HIV-1 replication at different steps of the virus life cycle, without eliminating infected cells and through enhancement of specific anti-HIV-1 cellular mechanisms. Among the soluble factors described, those with high levels of anti-HIV-1 activity are the beta-chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1alpha and MIP-beta), alpha-chemokines such as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), the CD8+ cell antiviral factor (CAF), IFN, ribonucleases (RNases) associated with human chorionic gonadotropin, ASF, the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), the recently studied apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), and the alpha and beta human defensins.\n\n    The RANTES (CCL5), MIP-1alpha (CCL3), and MIP-1( (CCL4) chemokines are produced by macrophages, NK cells, gammadelta T lymphocyte and T CD8+ lymphocytes. The antiviral role of these chemokines is exerted by competition with the virus for cell adhesion, because they are natural CCR5 ligands, and their affinity also induces coreceptor internalization in early endosomes. The levels of RANTES and MIP-1beta are elevated in cultures of HIV-1 env-specific CD4+ T cells from ESNs compared to HCs; in addition, these chemokines were capable of inhibiting replication of macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains. Additionally, Paxton et al. reported that CD4+ T cells of ESNs are less susceptible to infection and this was associated with the activity of RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta in these cells.\n\n    The alpha-chemokine SDF-1 is the natural ligand for CXCR4, which is the X4 HIV-1 strain coreceptor. This factor is secreted by bone marrow stromal cells, epithelial cells, monocytes and naive T lymphocytes. Studies performed in vitro have demonstrated that SDF-1 binds CXCR4 and down-regulates its expression on cell membranes by inducing internalization and lysosomal degradation, decreasing cell susceptibility to infection by X4 HIV-1 strains.\n\n    Type I IFN inhibits HIV-1 cell adhesion and induces expression of anti-HIV-1 proteins, such as RNase-L. Moreover, IFN-alpha induces apoptosis of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes and inhibits viral replication, diminishing the production of infectious viral particles. In addition, a higher expression of IFN-alpha was reported in uninfected commercial sex workers with high risk of HIV infection compared to controls, supporting the role of this cytokine in the protection of sexual HIV-1 transmission.\n\n    ESN NK cells produce greater amounts of IFN-gamma compared to cells from HCs and the mRNA levels of this cytokine are higher in PBMCs and genital mucosa biopsies of ESNs compared to HCs, suggesting its association to resistance considering that IFN-gamma inhibits HIV-1 transcription. In addition, Kuhn et al. reported that in sanguineous umbilical cord cells of uninfected children born to HIV-1 positive mothers, the IFN-gamma concentration is increased, suggesting that this cytokine plays an important role in protection from vertical transmission of HIV.\n\n    RNases are regulatory enzymes that control several cell processes from alternative RNA splicing to organogenesis, and their therapeutic potential has been suggested and investigated in infectious diseases and cancer. We previously reported that the functional activity of ASF is resistant to high temperature (>90oC), decreased by RNase inhibitors and inhibited by an antibody against eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), suggesting that the majority of the anti-HIV-1 activity of ASF is due to EDN or a closely related RNase. We recently reported that recombinant RNase A, EDN and angiogenin inhibit primary HIV-1 infection of T cell blasts, suggesting that naturally-occurring RNases play a role in host resistance to HIV-1 and other viral infections. Additionally, we evaluated if maternal-fetal alloantigen stimulation is associated with ASF production and/or placental mRNA expression of three RNases: EDN, RNase 1 and angiogenin. We found that mother/neonate HLA discordance at the A and B loci associates with mRNA expression of placental RNases, particularly RNase 1, and with the production of ASF in vitro; these results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal-fetal HLA differences are important in preventing vertical transmission of certain infectious pathogens, including HIV-1.\n\n    Defensins are cysteine-rich cationic peptides with antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms; they are divided into three groups based on their structure: alpha, beta and theta (the latter only found in nonhuman primates). Human beta defensins (HBD) are found primarily in mucosa, the main ports of HIV entry. In humans, six HBDs have been reported; HBD-1 is constitutively expressed, whereas HBD-2 and -3 are induced by viral or bacterial products and by cytokines such as IL-1-beta and TNF-alpha. HBD-2 and -3 mRNAs are induced by HIV-1 in human oral epithelial cells, without infecting the cells. HBD-2 and -3, but not HBD-1, exhibit strong dose dependent anti-HIV-1 activity, mainly on X4 strains; the inhibition occurs through binding to virions with permanent effect on viral infectivity and downregulation of the HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4 in PBMCs and T lymphocytes. In addition, Sun et al. showed that both HBD-2 and -3 inhibit infections by R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains in PBMCs. This study also demonstrated that HBD-2 had a direct effect on viral particles in a dose-dependent manner at doses similar to those found in the oral cavity (100 microg/ml) and these defensins inhibited accumulation of early products of reverse transcription.\n\n    Recently, we observed an increased number of copies of HBD-1, -2 and -3 mRNA in vaginal and endocervical mucosa from ESNs compared to HCs, although these differences were not statistically significant. In addition, a significantly higher expression of HBD-2 and -3 mRNAs was observed in oral mucosa from ESNs compared to the levels in HCs, supporting the role of HBDs during oral exposure to HIV-1. Thus, the increased HBD expression exhibited by ESNs compared to HCs might reflect a genetic trait associated with resistance to HIV-1 infection.\n\n    So far, six human alpha-defensins have been described (HD-1 to -6), playing an important role in innate immunity. HNP-1 to -4 are abundant in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, while HD-5 and -6 are produced predominantly by intestinal Paneth cells. HNP-1 to -3 inhibit replication of R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains, including several primary isolates. Chang et al. showed that recombinant HNP-1 inhibited HIV-1 infection in the absence of serum by direct effect on the viral particle. In contrast, in presence of serum the effect is on the cell, affecting steps prior to transcription and nuclear import; likewise, interference with protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in primary CD4+ T cells by HNP-1 appears to be associated with its inhibitory effect, considering that PKC upregulates HIV transcription through NF-kappaB activation and MAPK signaling pathways.\n\n    It has been reported that CD8+ T cells and cervical-vaginal mononuclear cells from ESNs produced 10-fold higher amounts of HNP compared to HCs, and the levels of HNP mRNA and HNP-expressing cells were increased in cervical biopsies of ESNs compared to HCs, suggesting the role of these components in the protective immune response that characterizes ESNs. Supporting their role in natural resistance to HIV infection, Kuhn et al., reported increased levels of HNP-1 to -3 in maternal milk from HIV-1 positive mothers who did not transmit the virus to their infants, compared to transmitting women, suggesting that these proteins are important in inhibiting viral postnatal transmission, probably inactivating viral particles. In addition, immature monocyte-derived DCs from elite and viremic controllers produced higher amounts of HNP-1 to -3 compared to HCs; thus high production of HD-1 to -3 by immature DCs appears to be also a host factor limiting HIV-1 replication.\n\n    It is a soluble factor produced by CD8+ T cells with non-cytotoxic anti-HIV activity by blocking viral transcription. To date, no CD8 T cell-secreted cytokine, chemokine, or inflammatory molecule has been shown to identify with the hallmarks that defines the suppressing HIV-1 activity of CAF. Stranford et al. reported that CD8+ T cells inhibit HIV replication in acutely infected CD4+ T cells of ESNs and this response efficiently inhibited HIV infection in PBMCs, suggesting that antiviral soluble factors with non-cytotoxic activity could be contributing to HIV resistance in this population. In addition, Mackewitz et al., reported that HIV-1 asymptomatic individuals exhibited the highest CAF activity compared to symptomatic and AIDS patients suggesting that CAF could be influencing AIDS progression.\n\n    it is a soluble component of saliva, which is secreted primarily by epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces and skin, neutrophils, and by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Higher salivary SLPI levels were associated with a decreased risk of HIV-1 infection among infants who were exposed to HIV-1 via breast-feeding after the first month. In agreement with this, in a study carried out by Pillay et al., the SLPI levels in vaginal fluid samples of HIV-1 positive women whose babies became infected were lower than in samples from non-transmitting women, implying that SLPI could protect against vertical transmission of HIV-1.\n\n    Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins constitute a family of proteins that share a conserved tripartite architecture. TRIM5alpha is the only member of these intracellular factors involved in the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. The rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha (TRIM5alpharh) recognizes the incoming HIV-1 core and promotes its premature disassembly or degradation before reverse transcription. Human TRIM5alpha has a weak capsid-binding capability compared to TRIM5alpharh, exhibiting reduced anti-HIV activity; however, it has been postulated that a single amino acid substitution could increase its ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication. Therefore, polymorphisms within TRIM5a might affect susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Javanbakht et al., reported a higher frequency of the allele TRIM5alpha 136Q in ESN compared to HIV-1 infected individuals, suggesting a possible protective role of this variant. In fact, TRIM5alpha 136Q protein showed higher anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro than TRIM5alpha R136 protein supporting its protective effect.\n\n    This factor is a protease inhibitor produced at mucosal surfaces by epithelial cells and possibly macrophages, in secreted and active forms known as elafin. Elafin is an antimicrobial and antiinflammatory molecule, which inhibits neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3. Gosh et al., demonstrated that recombinant Trappin-2/Elafin inhibits both X4/T-tropic IIIB and R5/M-tropic BaL HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Iqbal et al., using proteomics approach identified high levels of elafin in genital secretions from HIV-resistant women, suggesting its protective role during HIV-1 exposure.\n\n    this enzyme is a protein with cytidine deaminase activity that limits HIV-1 replication. The mechanism involved in this activity is excessive deamination of cytidine to uridine in minus strand reverse transcripts, a process resulting in guanosine to adenosine hypermutation of plus strand DNAs and in the impairment of proviral integration into the host genome. In ESNs, an increasing level of APOBEC3G mRNA in PBMCs was observed compared to HCs; interestingly, the mRNA levels of APOBEC3G decreased a year after termination of exposure. These findings were associated with low susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in vitro.\n\n    The humoral response is one of the most important mechanisms in HIV-1 resistance. Indeed, in some ESN individuals, resistance to infection has been associated to HIV-1 specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) production in cervicovaginal secretions, saliva, serum, maternal milk and urethral swabs. Although the mechanisms involved in the production of these antibodies with high specificity and neutralizing capacity is not yet clearly defined, it has been postulated that during HIV-1 exposure some viral particles are processed and presented to T cells, enhancing specific humoral responses. Clerici et al. demonstrated that ESNs IgA binds to a single epitope in the extracellular portion of gp41 (amino acidic residues 581-599: QARILAV). This epitope is involved in the gp41 - gp120 interaction and becomes accessible to specific IgA only after gp120 has bound the CD4 molecule in the target cell; most likely once the antibody binds gp41 the fusion of membranes is blocked. In contrast, IgA from SPs recognizes different epitopes in the gp120 and gp41 transmembrane region, suggesting that recognition of the QARILAV residues is important for resistance to HIV infection, and confirms that qualitative rather than quantitative differences between IgAs produced by ESNs and SPs are more relevant. Supporting the protective role of humoral responses in HIV infection, Hirbord et al., demonstrated an independent association between reduced HIV acquisition and the prior detection of both genital HIV-neutralizing IgA and HIV-specific cellular proliferation.\n\n    Additionally, higher levels of specific HIV-1 gp160 IgA were found in saliva of HIV-1 negative children, born to HIV-1 positive mothers, who received maternal breast-feeding, compared to HCs, suggesting that a specific IgA response in oral mucosa is important for inhibiting vertical transmission. Considering that oral sex could be a risk factor for HIV-1 infection, Hasselrot et al. evaluated the IgA production in saliva of uninfected men that have oral sex without protection with SP individuals, and reported that this exposure is sufficient to induce IgA1-mediated HIV-neutralizing response that can reduce the risk of infection. CCL28 (also called mucosae-associated epithelial chemokine) is a recently described CC chemokine that binds CCR10 as well as CCR3 receptors, which are expressed by IgA-expressing plasma blasts and plasma cells. CCL28 is detected in trachea, colon, rectum, and exocrine glands such as salivary and mammary glands. Thus, CCL28 is implicated in recruitment of these cells to the mucosal effectors sites. Castelletti et al., evaluated the CCL28 circuit in the context of HIV-1 infection, finding that CCL28 was augmented in breast milk, plasma and saliva of SP and ESN women. Likewise, they showed that CCR3+ and CCR10+ B lymphocytes were increased in these individuals. This suggests a role of CCL28 in the modulation of mucosal immunity in HIV exposure and infection.\n\n    Despite of all the evidence supporting the role of humoral responses, particularly of IgA in blocking HIV-1 infection, several reports, using various cohorts of ESN failed to show this association. In fact, Alexander et al., discussed the possibility that issues such as differences among the ESN cohorts evaluated, variation in processing samples, differences in the prevalence and frequency of unprotected HIV exposure and difficulties to obtain accurate measurements of specific antibody levels, among others, are responsible for the contradictory results. The recommendations to avoid bias in the investigations about IgA include the use of proper control groups and proper sample preparation in order to ensure that the intrinsic properties of the samples do not influence the results.\n\n    Quantitative and qualitative differences in several effector mechanisms have been described in ESNs, suggesting that some of these parameters might be influenced by virus exposure and could be associated to resistance exhibited by these individuals.\n\n    HIV-1 specific CD4+ T cells and PBMCs from ESNs produce high levels of RANTES and MIP-1beta and mainly a Th1 cytokine pattern in response to viral peptides, compared to SP individuals. Additionally, Biasin et al. reported significantly higher levels of mRNA for IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha and beta in cervical samples and PBMCs of ESNs compared to HCs. Taken together, these results suggest that a Th1 response characterized by the high production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and low levels of IL-10 could protect against HIV-1 infection.\n\n    Immune activation is essential to maintain effective immune responses against pathogens including HIV; however, activation of infected cells induces viral replication. The involvement of immune activation in both, during a protective immune response against HIV and in promoting viral pathogenesis has been suggested by several studies in ESNs. In a Central African cohort, the number of HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells were found lower in ESNs than in HCs; in addition, in vitro infection of unstimulated PBMC was decreased in ESNs compared to HCs, indicating that low activation and susceptibility may contribute to HIV-1 resistance.\n\n    In contrast, most reports suggest that ESNs exhibit an immune activation profile. Biasin et al., reported that PBMC from ESNs express higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and -beta mRNA; likewise CCR5 and CXCR4 mRNA in cervical mucosa biopsy specimens and HIV-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD8+ T lymphocytes in cervical vaginal washes were augmented in ESNs compared to HCs. In addition, they found that CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD38+ T lymphocytes were significantly augmented in ESNs, compared to HCs. Interestingly, the level of memory and activation was directly correlated to the viral load of their HIV-1-infected partners, whereas the level of naive and CD28+ T cells was inversely correlated. All together, these data indicate that immune activation characterizes ESN individuals, suggesting that immunophenotypic profiles were a consequence of HIV-1 exposure or antigenic level.\n\n    Several reports indicate that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play an important role in preventing HIV infection. The first demonstration of HIV-1-specific CD8+ lymphocyte responses in the cervix of ESNs was showed by Kaul et al; they demonstrated that CD8+ lymphocytes produced IFN-gamma in response to HIV-1. As previously mentioned, the immune activation phenotype and the ability to produce IFN-gamma-appears to be important characteristics of CTLs from ESNs, suggesting that exposure to HIV-1 influences the maturation profile of subsets of T lymphocytes that could be associated to HIV resistance.\n\n    In addition to the cytotoxic activity of CTLs, CD8+ T cells from ESNs have also shown strong noncytotoxic anti-HIV responses, mediated by other soluble factors different than beta-chemokines. Additionally, Pallikkuth et al. reported higher intracellular levels of perforin and granzyme B expression in CD8+T cells after stimulation with gag p24 antigen in ESNs compared to HCs.",

        "Conclusion": "    CCR5 Delta32 polymorphism remains the main genetic factor that confers resistance to HIV-1. However, phenotypic and functional characteristics of immune cells and the antiviral activity of soluble factors have become the aim of several studies trying to determine their association with protection against HIV infection. As described in this review, although some of these cells and molecules have been clearly associated with the phenomenon of natural resistance to HIV-1 infection, the mechanisms responsible for viral inhibition are not fully understood. A better understanding of this phenomenon is essential for the development of effective vaccines to prevent viral infection. In this sense, the groups of ESNs, ellite controllers and LTNPs will continue to be the main target populations to address the variety of mechanisms which allow controlling HIV infection.",

        "Title": "    Histaminergic transmission slows progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
        "Abstract": "    Histamine is an immune modulator, neuroprotective, and remyelinating agent, beneficially acting on skeletal muscles and promoting anti-inflammatory features in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) microglia. Drugs potentiating the endogenous release of histamine are in trial for neurological diseases, with a role not systematically investigated in ALS. Here, we examine histamine pathway associations in ALS patients and the efficacy of a histamine-mediated therapeutic strategy in ALS mice.\n\n    We adopted an integrative multi-omics approach combining gene expression profiles, copy number variants, and single nucleotide polymorphisms of ALS patients. We treated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-G93A mice that recapitulate key ALS features, with the brain-permeable histamine precursor histidine in the symptomatic phase of the disease and analysed the rescue from disease pathological signs. We examined the action of histamine in cultured SOD1-G93A motor neuron-like cells.\n\n    We identified 13 histamine-related genes deregulated in the spinal cord of two ALS patient subgroups, among which genes involved in histamine metabolism, receptors, transport, and secretion. Some histamine-related genes overlapped with genomic regions disrupted by DNA copy number and with ALS-linked pathogenic variants. Histidine treatment in SOD1-G93A mice proved broad efficacy in ameliorating ALS features, among which most importantly lifespan, motor performance, microgliosis, muscle atrophy, and motor neurons survival in vivo and in vitro.\n\n    Our gene set/pathway enrichment analyses and preclinical studies started at the onset of symptoms establish that histamine-related genes are modifiers in ALS, supporting their role as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We disclose a novel important role for histamine in the characterization of the multi-gene network responsible for ALS and, furthermore, in the drug development process.",
        "Introduction": "    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor neurons especially in the spinal cord and evolves in progressive muscular paralysis leading to death within 2-5 years of diagnosis. About 90% of ALS cases are classified as sporadic (sALS), while the remaining 10% have a familial origin. Among the familial ALS cases, about 20% possess at least 100 different mutations in the gene coding for the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) enzyme,1 recognized to promote a gain of neurotoxic function when mutated. Although the SOD1-G93A mutation represents only 2% of all ALS cases, the SOD1-G93A mouse resembling human pathological features is the most widely used model to test new mechanisms and drugs. A number of different genes, aberrant cellular pathways, and molecular mechanisms are involved in ALS, and strong evidence points to the impairment of the neuro-immune axis in causing motor neuron death and muscular wasting in both animal models and patients. However, ALS appears as a composite disease, and we still have much to learn concerning the potential therapeutic strategies to be used to halt its progression.\n\n    Among a vast range of constitutively bioactive molecules with pleiotropic regulatory roles in neurotransmission and immune responses, histamine is produced exclusively by decarboxylation of histidine by histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and is catabolized by histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) or by diamine oxidase 1 (DAO1). These enzymes, together with the four G-protein-coupled receptors H1R-H4R, are ubiquitous in the CNS and mediate histaminergic signalling. In the central nervous system (CNS), histamine regulates motor circuits and neuro-immune functions, acts as a neuroprotective agent,2 and exerts beneficial effects on microglia under in vitro/in vivo inflammatory conditions.3, 4 In support of this, a condition of impaired histamine production as that occurring in HDC knockout mice decreases M2-like markers and the neuroprotective role of microglia in vivo.5 Histamine signalling also promotes remyelination,6 protects skeletal muscles against exercise-induced fatigue,7 and reduces muscle injury by improving motor performance in Duchenne dystrophic mice.8 Additionally, drugs enhancing histamine transmission, such as histidine or H3R antagonists, exhibit beneficial effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders, schizophrenia, dementia, and depression2 and are under scrutiny in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Their efficacy in affecting ALS disease progression has still to be proven.\n\n    The aim of this study is to establish if histamine is a disease modifier in ALS and a novel target for therapy. We adopted an integrative multi-omics approach, combining copy number variants (CNVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and gene expression profiles of ALS patients, to identify histamine markers in ALS pathogenesis. We evaluated the preclinical efficacy of histamine on disease progression in SOD1-G93A mice, by a sustained treatment with the brain-penetrant histamine precursor histidine provided from the onset of disease symptoms. We investigated the biological actions of histamine in cultured motor neuron cells expressing the SOD1-G93A mutation.\n\n    Our work discloses a novel important role for histamine in characterizing the complex multi-gene interactions responsible for the disease and, further, in developing future effective therapeutics.",
        "Methods": "    For this study, we referred to our CNV profile data set (available at NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus through GEO Series accession number 107375) and transcriptomic analyses4, 9 performed in the post-mortem motor cortex (Brodmann areas 4) and spinal cord (lumbar tract L1) from 31 patients with clear sALS diagnosis and 10 control individuals collected as previously described.9 Control samples (mean subject age of 55 years) were obtained from individuals who died from a non-neurological disease (causes of death: myocardial infarction, renal failure, and pulmonary embolism). Informed consent and approval from the relevant local ethical committees for medical research were obtained for the use of brain and spinal tissues and for access to medical records for research purposes. Detailed information related to the origin, source code, age, gender, race, disease state, survival time from diagnosis date, and post-mortem interval of patient samples is given in Supporting Information, Table S1.\n\n    In previous works, we used an unsupervised hierarchical algorithm to cluster 41 motor cortex samples from control and sALS patients on the basis of their similarities measured over the most 'hypervariable genes' (9.646 genes with a standard deviation > 1.5). The transcriptome profiles enabled to differentiate controls from sALS patients and clearly distinguished two sALS subgroups (termed sALS1 and sALS2), each associated with specific genomic aberrations, differentially expressed genes and biological pathways.9, 10, 11 In this work, we referred to this molecular-based classification for the subsequent analysis. We thus filtered out our genome-wide 'omics' data sets by focusing only on genes implicated in histamine cascades, by using histamine metabolism/signalling query keywords in Gene Ontology database (http://www.geneontology.org/). To better investigate the contribution of altered histamine signalling in the complex genetic structure of ALS and identify new histamine-related loci associated with disease susceptibility, we also collected genome-wide association studies data sets from the ALSOD and ALSGene databases (http://www.alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk; http://www.alsgene.org). Only SNP/indel variants previously reported as 'pathogenic' or 'likely pathogenic' and with a minor allele frequency >= 0.1% in the 1000 Genomes Project were selected for further analysis. Benign intronic and synonymous variants were filtered out.\n\n    Gene expression data from isolated motor neuron and spinal cord of wild-type (WT) littermates and SOD1-G93A mice at various disease stages (pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and terminal stage) were downloaded from the public data repositories NCBI GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), using the following search terms and/or their combinations: 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'motor neuron disease', 'SOD1 mouse model', 'SOD1-G93A transgenic mouse', and 'expression profiling'. Data sets included in the analysis had to meet the following criteria: (i) data were acquired using a genome-wide gene expression microarray platform with accessible and clear probe-to-gene mapping annotations and (ii) there were >=3 replicates for each experimental condition. For each mouse data set, raw intensity values were thresholded to 1, log2-transformed, normalized, and baselined to the median of all samples by using GeneSpring GX v13.1 software package (Agilent Technologies). Affymetrix gene expression data were Robust Multichip Average processed using quantile normalization, while Agilent and Illumina data were normalized to the 75th percentile.12, 13 Finally, data were integrated by using homemade functions implemented in PostgreSQL database system environment (version 9.4.5; http://www. postgresql.org/). We performed statistical analysis by using GeneSpring GX v13.1 software package (Agilent Technologies). Genes with a corrected P value <0.05 (one-way analysis of variance followed by the Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate and the Tukey's post hoc test) were deemed to be statistically significant and subsequently filtered for genes implicated in histamine cascades.\n\n    To obtain a comprehensive mapping of functional associations of histamine-related gene products, we incorporated our multi-omic data and gene-pathway associations from the Metacore  database (Clarivate Analytics, http://clarivate.com/life-sciences/discovery-and-preclinicalresearch/ metacore/). This is a manually curated repository of molecular interactions of different types, pathways, network models, and functional ontologies covering human, mouse, and rat genes.\n\n    Animal procedures performed according to European Guidelines (2010/63/EU) and Italian law requirements (D.L. 26/2014) were approved by Animal Welfare Office, Department of Public Health and Veterinary, Nutrition and Food Safety, General Management of Animal Care, and Veterinary Drugs of Italian Ministry of Health and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and number of animals necessary to produce reliable results. Adult B6.Cg-Tg (SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J mice expressing high copy number of mutant hSOD1 with a G93A substitution (SOD1-G93A) and originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (USA) were bred in our animal facility and housed as described.14 Transgenic hemizygous SOD1-G93A males were crossbred with C57BL/6 females, both maintained on C57BL/6 genetic background. Transgenic progeny was genotyped as described.15 To overcome sex-mixed results with low reproducibility, we used a single gender because of differences reported in male/female mice under pharmacological treatments. Female mice were randomly grouped into vehicle (0.9% NaCl) and histidine treatment groups at different doses (50, 100, and 250 mg/kg), based on previous results.4, 16, 17, 18 Mice were injected i.p. every 48 h from disease onset (110 days,15, 19) until 150 days of age or terminal stage.\n\n    Behavioural scores and body weights were assessed starting at 60 days of age, in order to monitor disease progression. Behavioural score adopted a rating scale from 5 (healthy without symptoms of paralysis) to 1 (full paralysis of hind limbs, animals not able to straighten up within 30 s after being turned on the back).15 After reaching a score of 1, animals were euthanized according to guidelines for preclinical testing.20 Motor performance was tested on rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile 7650 model).15\n\n    Reagents were purchased from Sigma (Italy). Antibodies raised in rabbit: anti-arginase 1 (ARG1) (1:100, Abcam, UK); anti-CD163 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA); anti-choline acetyltransferase (1:500, AbCam); anti-DAO1 (1:200, Bioss, USA); anti-H1R (1:200, Alomone, Israel); anti-H2R (1:200, MyBioSource, USA); anti-H3R (1:200, Alomone); anti-H4R (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-HDC (1:20, AbCam); anti-HNMT (1:200, Sigma); anti-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (1:1000, CST, USA); anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) (1:1000 CST); anti-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 (1:500, CST); anti-phospho-AKT (1:500, CST); anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (1:1000, CST); and anti-phospho-NF-kappaB p65 (Ser536) (1:500, CST).

Antibodies raised in rat: anti-CD11b (1:200, AbD Serotec, UK).\n\n    Superoxide dismutase 1-G93A mice were sacrificed at 2 h after an acute i.p. histidine treatment (100 mg/kg), spinal cords were isolated, homogenized with 3% perchloric solution, and centrifuged at 12 000 g, 4  C for 20 min. Supernatants were collected and analysed for histamine content by HPLC, according to a previous study.17\n\n    Protein lysates were obtained by homogenization of mice lumbar spinal cords or sciatic nerves.14 Cells undergoing pharmacological treatments were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and lysed in RIPA buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, IT). Blots were probed overnight at 4  C with the specified antibody and signals detected using ECL Advance western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative analysis was performed by Kodak Image Station.\n\n    Mice spinal cords perfused with PBS were processed as described.14 Serial 20 mum sections (one every 10 sections) from lumbar spinal cord segments (L3-L5) were stained with 1% cresyl violet to detect the Nissl substance of neuronal cells. A minimum of six sections per mouse were photographed at x20 magnification using Axioskop 2 (Zeiss, Germany) microscope and analysed with Neurolucida software (MBF Bioscience, USA). Motor neurons count was performed as described.15\n\n    Motor neuron-enriched primary cultures from embryonic spinal cords were prepared as described.21, 22 Briefly, SOD1-G93A mice (embryonic day 14) were sacrificed and, after removing the meninges, spinal cords were minced and digested with 0.01% trypsin. After dissociation, cells were cultured in Neurobasal media (Gibco, UK), plus B-27 on poly-D-lysine-coated plates. The medium was replaced every 3 days. Mixed primary motor neuron cultures (~55% motor neurons/total neurons) were used after 6-7 days in culture. NSC-34 motor neurons are a mouse hybrid cell line produced by fusion of motor neuron-enriched embryonic mouse spinal-cord neurons with mouse neuroblastoma cells, and resemble motor neurons in many ways.23 These immortalized cells have been widely used as a motor neuron-like model of ALS. NSC-34 cells stably transfected with WT or mutant hSOD1-G93A DNA24 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were differentiated in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% modified Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids. For cell viability, differentiated NSC-34 cells were plated into 24-well and cultured under serum deprivation conditions for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by counting intact nuclei.25\n\n    Cells in culture were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100, then incubated overnight with the specified antibody at 4  C in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, and stained with secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 and cells mounted with gel/mount antifading (Biomeda, USA). Spinal cord tissues were processed as described.4 Immunofluorescence analysis was performed by confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Brightness and contrast were adjusted with Zen software, after background subtraction. Quantification of CD11b immunoreactivity was performed on lumbar spinal cord sections (at least six sections for each animal in each group were analysed), using the ImageJ software (version 1.47, National Institutes of Health, USA), after background subtraction. Data are expressed as arbitrary units with respect to WT mice.\n\n    Total RNA from Tibialis Anterior (TA) skeletal muscle tissue was extracted with Trizol using a standard protocol. RNA was retro-transcribed with Taqman reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's indication. qRT-PCR was performed using PrecisionPLUS qPCR Master Mix (Primerdesign, UK) following manufacturer indications. Relative expression values were normalized to the housekeeping gene ActB. The primer used was ActB_FW: CACTGTCGAGTCGCGTCC, ActB_RV: TCATCCATGGCGAACTGGTG; Hrh1_FW: ACGAGTGAAACCCGATGCTT, Hrh1_RV: CTCCCTCCCTCGGTCTCTG; Hrh2_FW: GCAGCACCAGCTCCTATGAC, Hrh2_RV: AGGCTGTCATGTCCTTTTCCA; Hrh3_FW: CTTCCTCGTGGGTGCCTTC, Hrh3_RV: TCTACCACCAGCCACAGCTT; Hnmt_FW: ACTAAGATACTAAGGCAGCGAACT, Hnmt_RV: TGCCATATTGGGTTCTCAGCA; Dao_FW: GCTGAACTGGGCTGCTGT, Dao_RV: TCTTCATGTGCAGTGGCTGT; and Hdc_FW: GGAGGAGCAATCCAAGGGAG, Hdc_RV: CATCTCTTTCCCTCTAGCTCGG.\n\n    Tibialis anterior muscles were dissected out and snap-frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Serial transverse 8 mum cryosections were fixed and permeabilized with 100% acetone for 1 min at RT. Sections were blocked for 1 h with a solution containing 4% BSA in PBS, stained using the anti-laminin (Sigma, 1:400), and antibody binding specificity was revealed using secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488. For nuclear staining, sections were incubated with DAPI in PBS for 5 min, washed in PBS, and mounted with glycerol 3:1 in PBS.\n\n    For haematoxylin/eosin staining, serial transverse cryosections were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, washed in PBS, and then stained in haematoxylin for 8 min and eosin for 1 min, as described.26 All sections were visualized on a Zeiss confocal microscope. Myofibers cross-sectional area was quantified using ImageJ  software. The entire muscle section was analysed.\n\n    For neuromuscular innervation analysis, longitudinal sections were stained with mouse anti-synaptic vesicle protein (SV2; 1:100, DSHB) and anti-neurofilament (2H3; 1:50, DSHB), with alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX; 1:500, Invitrogen), and occupied endplates were quantified as described.27\n\n    Evaluation of mitochondrial bioenergetics was performed by Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience-Agilent, USA). Multiple parameters of mitochondrial function were measured with Stimulus XF Stress Test Kit (Seahorse Bioscience).28 Briefly, differentiated NSC-34 cells were seeded (7 x 104 cells/well) into micro-lysine-coated XF96 microplates and incubated overnight in 5% CO2, 37  C. To perform Cell Mito Stress Test, medium was replaced with XF Base supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM glucose, and cells were incubated at 37  C for 45 min in a CO2-free incubator, prior to oxygen consumption ratio analysis by Seahorse XF96. ATP production was measured by injection of oligomycin, while maximal respiration and spare respiration capacity were tested in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone.\n\n    Data are presented as mean +- standard error of the mean. Kaplan-Meier analysis, one-way analysis of variance, Student's t-test, or Mann-Whitney test was performed using MedCalc (Medcalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium) followed by individual post hoc comparisons (Fisher's PLSD). *P < 0.05 was considered significant.",
        "Results": "    To explore the potential involvement of the histaminergic system in ALS patients, we examined expression changes of genes implicated in histamine signalling and metabolism occurring in post-mortem spinal cord samples from two transcriptome-based subgroups of sALS patients (sALS1 and sALS2). Our analysis revealed a total of 13 histamine-related genes differentially deregulated in sALS1 and sALS2, compared with control individuals. We identified genes encoding histamine receptors (HRH1 and HRH3), proteins involved in histamine metabolism (HNMT and PRG3), histamine transport and secretion (ADCYAP1, BTK, CCKBR, EDN1, SLC22A2, SNX4, SNX6, VAMP8, and YWHAZ), as well as multiple proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction cascades (i.e. MAPKs, p38MAPK, NF-kappaB, and AKT) (Table 1). Interestingly, some of these genes were previously identified as differentially deregulated also in the motor cortex of the same sALS patient cohorts, supporting their role as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.4, 9\n\n    To obtain a genome-wide view of multiple histamine-related genomic aberrations in ALS and determine their effects on gene expression, we integrated data from different genomic levels (CNVs and SNPs), mainly focusing on genes associated with histamine metabolism, receptors, transport, and secretion. A complete overview of CNVs, SNPs/indels, and the combination of these events in ALS patients is investigated. Based on ongoing studies performed in our laboratories, we first analysed histamine-related DNA copy number alterations occurring in previously characterized transcriptome-based sALS patient subgroups9 (Morello et al., in press), in order to identify CNV-associated differentially expressed genes. Our analysis revealed that some histamine-related genes overlapped with genomic regions disrupted by a CNV, some of which in a subgroup-patient specific manner (Figure 1). In particular, we observed the selective amplification of ADCYAP1 in sALS1 patients, the selective amplification of DAO1 and HRH2 in sALS2 patients, as well as duplication of HRH3 and CCKBR in both sALS subgroups (Figure 1). Interestingly among these, ADCYAP1, CCKBR, and HRH3 showed a significant, positive correlation with gene expression changes, supporting the idea that genes displaying the same tendencies between CNV status and gene expression levels may represent candidate driver genes in ALS etiopathogenesis (Table 1).\n\n    To provide a comprehensive multi-omics view of the histamine-related events occurring in ALS pathology, we then studied the pairwise overlap between the top histamine-related genes identified from the transcriptome and CNV analyses and the corresponding ALS-linked pathogenic variants from ALSdb, a database of exome sequencing data from mostly sALS patients. Our results demonstrated that there is a clear homogeneity between the histamine-related genes driven by gene expression data, CNV, and SNP, supporting their role as candidate biomarkers and target genes in ALS (Figure 1, Table 2).\n\n    To obtain a clearer picture of the transcriptomic changes associated with the dysregulation of the histamine signalling during ALS progression and evaluate whether these changes were cause or consequence of motor neuron degeneration, we analysed histamine-associated genes in SOD1-G93A mice at pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and terminal stages (Table 3). Remarkably, our results showed that in the majority of cases, the deregulation of histamine-related genes (e.g. Hnmt, Hrh1, and Hrh3) had already started in ALS mice long before symptom onset. This suggests their possible role as target genes for ALS diagnosis and treatment in the early stages of the disease. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the overwhelming majority of histamine-related genes that emerged as deregulated in terminal stages of SOD1-G93A mice were also found deregulated in at least one of sALS patient subgroups (e.g. Hrh1 and Hrh3), thus offering a rationale for the selection and prioritization of histamine genes as potential biomarkers and targets for patient-oriented ALS care (Tables 1 and 3).\n\n    Because histamine cannot penetrate the brain, we tested the efficacy of a histaminergic strategy in SOD1-G93A mice, by using the histamine precursor histidine that is able to increase the central histamine levels17 by crossing the blood-brain barrier and being rapidly converted into histamine.29 Histidine (50-100-250 mg/kg) was injected in mice from the onset of clinical symptoms. At 100 and 250 mg/kg, histidine improved behavioural scores (Figure 2A) and motor performance (Figure 2B) and delayed disease progression, as assessed by the time taken to reach the clinical score 3 (Figure 2C), and the 10%, 50%, and 100% of rotarod impairment (Figure 2D and 2F). The dose of 50 mg/kg resulted ineffective in ameliorating mice general conditions and motor performance (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2G, histidine 100 mg/kg increased median survival of SOD1-G93A mice (158 saline, 171 His100), whereas the dose of 250 mg/kg showed only a trend in increasing survival. Furthermore, while both histidine 100 and 250 mg/kg statistically delayed disease duration to terminal endpoint in SOD1-G93A mice, as assessed by age at terminal endpoint (158.8 +- 1.7 saline; 171.7 +- 2.1 His100, 172.6 +- 6.4 His250), only histidine 100 mg/kg increased disease duration after the onset of first symptoms (48.8 +- 1.3 saline; 62 +- 4.8 His100, Figure 2I).\n\n    At these doses, histidine showed no evidence of toxic effects in mice, as evaluated by body weight measurement, and histidine-treated mice presented no gross pathology on necropsy compared with saline-treated mice.\n\n    Guided by the earlier results, we then adopted the most effective dose of histidine 100 mg/kg for further evaluations. HPLC analysis revealed that histamine content in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice was 45.8 +- 6.4 ng/g (n = 6), which increased to 93.6 +- 14.7 ng/g (n = 6) (P = 0.014) after histidine treatment. In SOD1-G93A spinal cord at terminal phase of disease with respect to the saline group, histidine partially protected motor neurons from death, as observed by Nissl staining (Figure 3A). Likewise, choline acetyltransferase protein was significantly decreased in SOD1-G93A with respect to WT mice (Supporting Information, Figure S1A) and histidine preserved its expression (Figure 3B). Moreover, in SOD1-G93A with respect to WT mice, we observed a strong reduction in SMI32 expression (Supporting Information, Figure S1A). In histidine-treated mice, we observed statistically significant preservation of SMI32-positive fibres in the ventral horns of spinal cord sections (Figure 3C), and this result was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 3D). Because oligodendrocytes losing their myelinating and metabolic functions participate to the degeneration of ALS motor neurons,30 we examined MBP expression in SOD1-G93A mice, where it was shown to be significantly decreased compared with WT mice (Supporting Information, Figure S1A). As indicated in Figure 3E, MBP immunoreactivity was increased in ventral grey and white horns of histidine-treated compared with the saline spinal cord. The preservation of MBP expression was also confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 3F).\n\n    To investigate if histidine treatment in SOD1-G93A mice can modify ALS affected pathways in spinal cord, we analysed tissues at symptomatic 150 days of age. We first evaluated the extent of microgliosis and the expression of microglia-related markers. Immunofluorescence analysis of lumbar spinal cord demonstrated a remarkable increase of CD11b positive microglia in SOD1-G93A with respect to WT mice, which was partially reverted by histidine treatment (100 mg/kg) (Figure 4A and 4B). Next, we measured the protein levels of microglial M2-like markers ARG1 and CD163 and microglial M1-like marker iNOS, demonstrating that in SOD1-G93A mice, ARG1 and CD163 expressions were decreased and iNOS increased, compared with WT mice (Supporting Information, Figure S1B). Histidine was able to significantly increase ARG1 and CD163 and decrease iNOS protein expression in SOD1-G93A mice with respect to saline-treated mice (Figure 4C and 4D).\n\n    We finally measured the expression of NF-kappaB and gp91phox, key inflammatory mediators that are deregulated in ALS and were previously shown to be down-regulated by histamine in SOD1-G93A microglia.4 SOD1-G93A mice showed up-regulated levels of both NF-kappaB and gp91phox compared with WT mice (Supporting Information, Figure S1C). In histidine-treated (100 mg/kg) mice respect to the saline-treated group, we observed a statistically significant reduction of phosphorylated NF-kappaB and gp91phox proteins (Figure 4E).\n\n    When we next analysed SOD1-G93A spinal cord tissue at the end stage of disease, we observed no statistical changes in ARG1 (saline = 1 +- 0.2 vs. histidine = 1.2 +- 0.1) and gp91phox (saline = 1 +- 0.2 vs. histidine = 0.7 +- 0.1), but a significant down-regulation of phosphorylated NF-kappaB (saline = 1 +- 0.2 vs. histidine = 0.3 +- 0.06; P < 0.05), in histidine-treated mice compared with saline-treated mice.\n\n    Because deviation from the strict control of MAPK signalling pathways particularly in SOD1-G93A mice is implicated in ALS disease progression, we next analysed ERK1/2 and AKT pro-survival kinases after histidine treatment. Compared with WT mice, SOD1-G93A mice expressed similar levels of both phosphorylated ERK1/2 and AKT in the spinal cord (Supporting Information, Figure S1D) and robust down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT in the sciatic nerves (Supporting Information, Figure S1E). As shown in Figure 5A, in the lumbar spinal cord, the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and AKT were statistically increased in the histidine group, with respect to the saline-treated group. Up-regulation of pERK1/2 in SOD1-G93A motor neurons was confirmed also by immunofluorescence (Figure 5B). We moreover observed activation of the AKT pro-survival pathway also in sciatic nerves of histidine-treated SOD1-G93A mice compared with saline-treated mice, as shown in Figure 5C. To establish if the effects in the spinal cord were accompanied by an improvement in the muscle phenotype, TA muscles were analysed. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated the expression of Hrh1, Hrh2, and Hrh3 (Hrh4 was undetectable) receptors and Hdc, Hnmt, and Dao1 histaminergic enzymes transcripts in SOD1-G93A TA muscle. No statistically significant differences were found compared with WT tissues in the expression of receptors. A down-regulation of Hnmt expression (Supporting Information, Figure S2A-F) was observed in SOD1-G93A compared with WT muscle. Moreover, Hdc was the only transcript to be up-regulated by histidine treatment, suggesting that histidine might cause an increase of histamine content also in the periphery of treated SOD1-G93A mice (Supporting Information, Figure S2D).\n\n    Moreover, neuromuscular junctions in the TA muscles showed less marked denervation in histidine-treated mice with respect to saline-treated mice (Figure 5D). Cross-sectional area of muscle fibres was also measured, revealing a partial prevention of muscle atrophy in histidine-treated mice. In particular, the number of smaller fibres (less than 100 mum2) was reduced while an increase in intermediate fibres (>500 and <1000 mum2) was observed (Figure 5E).\n\n    In order to dissect the motor neuron response to histaminergic signalling, we first evaluated the expression of histamine receptors and metabolic enzymes in mixed motor neuron primary cultures from the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice and in differentiated NSC-34 motor neuron-like cells expressing the SOD1-G93A mutation (NSC-G93A). Primary (Figure 6A and 6C, left panels) and differentiated NSC-G93A cells (Figure 6A and 6C, right panels) immunostained with the neuronal marker SMI32, both expressed histamine receptors H1R, H2R, and H3R and metabolic enzymes HDC, HNMT, and DAO1. Next, in order to evaluate differences in the regulation of histamine receptors and enzymes in NSC-34 motor neuron cells expressing WT (NSC-WT) or mutant SOD1, we analysed H1-H4R and HDC, HNMT, and DAO1 by western blotting. Similarly to what previously observed in the lumbar spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice during disease progression compared with WT mice,4 we demonstrated decreased levels of H1R and H3R (Figure 6B) and increased levels of all histamine enzymes (Figure 6D) in NSC-G93A with respect to NSC-WT cells.\n\n    We next investigated if histamine directly targets the AKT/ERK1/2 pro-survival pathway after serum starvation as neuronal stressor inducing cell death. Differentiated NSC-G93A compared with NSC-WT showed a significant down-regulation of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylations, which were instead significantly increased by histamine in a dose-dependent manner in NSC-G93A (Figure 6E and 6F).\n\n    We next examined the effects of histamine on bioenergetic capacity of NSC-G93A cells under serum starvation, using the Seahorse XF96 Bioanalyser. Our results clearly showed mitochondrial damages and massive levels of energy deficit induced by expressing mutant SOD1-G93A, as observed by a decline in basal respiration, ATP production, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity (Figure 6G). The failure in maximal respiration indicated alterations in the electron transport chain, while the decrease of spare respiratory capacity suggested that mutant SOD1 inhibits the rapid adaptation of NSC-G93A motor neurons to metabolic changes. Importantly, under serum deprivation conditions in NSC-G93A cells, histamine with a maximal effect at 100 muMu reverted the impaired mitochondrial metabolism (Figure 6G).\n\n    We finally evaluated the NSC-G93A cell death induced by serum starvation for 24 h. In a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 muM), histamine totally rescued about 35% death induced in NSC-G93A cells by serum starvation (Figure 6H). The histamine effect was abolished by antagonists selective for H1R, H2R, and H3R and, most importantly, by PD98059 and wortmannin, inhibitors respectively of ERK1/2 and AKT (Figure 6I), thus ascribing this neuroprotective effect to AKT/ERK axis.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In terms of disease-modifying treatment options, several drugs have been tested in large multicentre trials for ALS,31 but albeit encouraging results, only riluzole and edaravone are FDA-approved therapeutics available to patients.32 The present study establishes that the administration of histidine during the symptomatic phase enhancing histaminergic transmission in the SOD1-G93A transgenic mouse model mitigates a broad range of disease phenotypes associated with ALS. This builds on our recent work showing that histamine drives an anti-inflammatory phenotype in SOD1-G93A microglia and that the histaminergic system is dysregulated in ALS mice and patients.4 Previous transcriptome analysis from two subgroups of sALS patients has indeed highlighted a differential expression of several histamine-related genes in post-mortem cortex samples. Here, we adopted an integrative multi-omics approach combining gene expression profiles, CNVs, and SNPs of ALS patients for capturing histamine pathway associations in ALS and providing a comprehensive understanding of histamine-related molecular mechanism that might contribute to the disease. Our genome-wide analysis of multiple genomic aberrations occurring in sALS patients identified CNV-affected histamine-related genes that were differentially expressed in one or both sALS patient subgroups, among which for instance HRH3, CCKBR, and ADCYAP1 showed a positive correlation with transcriptomic changes. By integrating our transcriptomic and genomic data with the ALS-linked pathogenic variants from ALSdb database, we also identified multiple coding variants in these genes, supporting those as candidate driver genes in ALS etiopathogenesis and thus establishing histamine as a gene modifier in ALS and a candidate therapeutic target.\n\n    The meta-analysis approach that we have next adopted to compare gene expression profiles in spinal cord samples from sALS patients with those obtained in SOD1-G93A mice demonstrated that many histamine-related genes were deregulated in both patients and mice, confirming those as promising biomarkers/therapeutic targets and indicating that histaminergic molecular mechanisms are shared by both species. Despite the fact that transcriptome analysis of human tissues is generally considered as a consequence of disease progression (because most CNS specimen refer to post-mortem tissues), the deregulation for instance of Hnmt, Hrh1, and Hrh3 genes occurred in mice long before symptom onset, suggesting these as potential early stage biomarkers and targets for treating ALS.\n\n    Enhancement of endogenous histaminergic transmission can be achieved in mice by either intracerebroventricular administration of histamine16 that has however only a limited translational value or by intraperitoneal administration of the histamine precursor histidine able to increase the histamine levels in the spinal cord,17 as we have confirmed here in SOD1-G93A mice. We proved here that according to our pharmacological regimen, a sustained administration of histidine after symptoms insurgence ameliorated a wide range of molecular, neuropathological, and behavioural disease-associated features. Most importantly, histidine delayed disease progression, increased life span, improved motor performance, while reduced microgliosis and denervation muscle atrophy, and attenuated motor neuron and axonal loss, moreover demyelination and neuroinflammation in the spinal cord. Remarkably, the high dose (250 mg/kg) of histidine was not as effective as the lower dose (100 mg/kg) with regard to overall survival, while it ameliorated rotarod performance and behavioural scores. Although histidine is well tolerated in human and rodents, its high intake is known to induce hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia, and copper deficiency in plasma and liver.33 Thus, we cannot exclude that high-dosage and prolonged treatment with histidine up to the terminal stage of the disease might produce metabolic side effects that might, in turn, reduce the efficacy of the treatment itself. Moreover, it is reported that histamine at high doses down-regulates in the brain its own synthesis by a feedback inhibition of HDC activity mediated by H3R.34 Therefore, the 250 mg/kg treatment might have likely produced lower levels of histamine in the spinal cord with respect to the 100 mg/kg treatment, and this might contribute to explain the reduced efficacy of the higher histidine dose. Further experiments will surely shed light on this issue.\n\n    Several studies now describe that not only motor neuron loss but also non-neuronal cell dysfunctions act as major contributors to the progressive symptoms of ALS.1 The result that histidine can target several key cell phenotypes of ALS, that is, motor neurons, glial cells, and skeletal muscles as shown here, might thus explain why histidine exerted beneficial effects in SOD1-G93A mice. The histidine treatment is particularly encouraging in symptomatic mice and makes the approach potentially more valuable for later translation, as most patients suffering from sporadic forms are diagnosed only at the symptomatic stage of the disease. In a different way, our recent studies exploring the actions of another histaminergic compound, clemastine, proved that also an anti-histaminergic strategy reversing the inflammatory phenotype of microglia can exert positive outcomes in extending survival of ALS mice, but only when provided before the insurgence of symptoms.14 This may suggest that the therapeutic potential of central histamine in ALS mice shows a dual time window, as also demonstrated in a model of neuropathic pain.17 This is in line with the recognized dual role that histamine plays for instance in microglia, that is, detrimental under healthy conditions and beneficial within inflammatory environments.3 It might also be explained by histaminergic drugs acting on cell types that per se possess dual roles in ALS pathogenesis, for instance microglia and immune cells preventing disease progression at early stages while inducing pathogenic responses at later stages.35, 36, 37\n\n    Among the pathways involved in the protective effects of histidine in SOD1-G93A mice, here, we demonstrated a decreased level of some key pro-inflammatory gene modifiers of ALS, that is, gp91phox, NF-kappaB,38, 39 and M1-like microglia marker iNOS, parallel to an increase in M2-like microglia markers ARG1 and CD163, which we previously demonstrated to be downstream pathways of histamine in SOD1-G93A microglia.4 Interestingly, NF-kappaB that was recognized to be a histamine-related gene complex by our multi-omics pathway analysis was also found dysregulated in our cohort of sALS patients, thus making it a likely target of histamine intervention. Because activation of NF-kappaB during the early phases of ALS is sufficient to prolong survival in mice, whereas activation in glia in the late phases decreases survival,40 a therapy able to inhibit NF-kappaB at symptomatic phase is predicted to be beneficial, as indeed we obtained here with histidine. The levels of phosphorylated AKT in motor neurons are decreased in ALS patients and SOD1-G93A mice.41, 42 Known to exert a protective action on ALS neuronal cells,43 the up-regulation of pAKT and pERK in the spinal cord of histidine-treated SOD1-G93A mice would thus suggest that the pro-survival response sustained by histidine proceeds through activation of ERK and PI3K/AKT signalling. In agreement with this hypothesis, the neuroprotection of ALS motor neuron cells in vitro by histamine was dependent on AKT/ERK1/2 pathway activation, thus confirming previous results about the AKT/ERK1/2 pro-survival axis in ALS motor neuron.44, 45, 46\n\n    The presence of mutant SOD1 in motor neurons causes mitochondrial dysfunction,24 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is crucial in motor neuron death and ALS pathogenesis.47 Here, we demonstrated a role for histamine in rescuing mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production in motor neuron cells. The beneficial effects observed on mitochondrial metabolism and integrity that are critical in regulating cellular health reinforce the hypothesis that histamine treatment could be helpful in ALS.\n\n    While previous pharmacological approaches showing promise against ALS have not always reached sufficient efficacy to support translation into therapy, histamine drugs display a clear value in several animal models of neurological diseases. Furthermore, H3R antagonists increasing histamine neuronal release are in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis and are already approved in Europe for narcolepsy.2 Our results now add ALS disease to the growing promise of histaminergic strategies. By proposing the histamine modulation as a candidate mechanism to be further challenged in ALS, we trust not only that histamine will answer to the many questions still unsolved about ALS but also that a viable histamine-related therapy might be proven to work for patients. Our further trials will validate H3 antagonists against ALS progression.",

        "Abstract": "    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered a complex disease, and thus the majority of the genetic susceptibility is thought to lie in the form of low-penetrance variants following a polygenic model of inheritance. Candidate-gene studies have so far been one of the basic approaches taken to identify these susceptibility variants. The consistent involvement of some signaling routes in carcinogenesis provided support for pathway-based studies as a natural strategy to select genes that could potentially harbour new susceptibility loci.\n\n    We selected two main carcinogenesis-related pathways: Wnt and BMP, in order to screen the implicated genes for new risk variants. We then conducted a case-control association study in 933 CRC cases and 969 controls based on coding and regulatory SNPs. We also included rs4444235 and rs9929218, which did not fulfill our selection criteria but belonged to two genes in the BMP pathway and had consistently been linked to CRC in previous studies. Neither allelic, nor genotypic or haplotypic analyses showed any signs of association between the 37 screened variants and CRC risk. Adjustments for sex and age, and stratified analysis between sporadic and control groups did not yield any positive results either.\n\n    Despite the relevance of both pathways in the pathogenesis of the disease, and the fact that this is indeed the first study that considers these pathways as a candidate-gene selection approach, our study does not present any evidence of the presence of low-penetrance variants for the selected markers in any of the considered genes in our cohort.",
        "Introduction": "    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the main forms of cancer, being the second most frequent neoplasm in both sexes and one of the most important morbidity causes in the western world. The genetic contribution to CRC has been estimated to be around 35% by extensive twin studies. However, highly penetrant variants, that cause mendelian predisposition syndromes, account only for, at most, 5% of the disease cases. The remaining genetic susceptibility is thought to follow a polygenic model, with an interplay of multiple low-penetrance allelic variants appearing in high frequency in the general population, and each conferring a modest effect on disease risk.\n\n    Candidate-gene studies have been one of the most commonly used tools in the screening for new variants affecting CRC risk. Gene selection in these studies is mainly based on the functional implications of a possible association, and thus genes selected have either been chosen because of the previous presence of other high/low risk alleles, or their participation in a pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Candidate-gene studies can be performed by either direct approaches, where the variants genotyped are presumed to be the underlying cause of the disease because of their location (variants in exonic or regulatory regions), or by indirect approaches, where tag SNPs take advantage of the linkage disequilibrium properties of the human genome to try and screen the most of the variability in a given gene.\n\n    This latter approach has also allowed, together with the development of high-throughput technologies, the implementation of new hypothesis-free approaches (in opposition with hypothesis-based candidate-gene approaches), covering the majority of the genome (genome-wide association studies or GWAS). This implementation has successfully led to the identification of some new susceptibility loci, including rs4444235 and rs9929218, that fall within reach of two genes belonging to the BMP pathway. Nevertheless, these have been found to predict only a small proportion of the disease susceptibility, with the remaining yet to be discovered.\n\n    We hence aimed to find such susceptibility variants through a candidate-gene approach screening a selected number of variants within two cellular pathways that have consistently been linked to CRC tumorogenesis: the Wnt and the BMP signaling pathways.\n\n    The Wnt pathway contains genes that have for long been known to be responsible of some hereditary CRC syndromes, such as APC and familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, somatic alterations in APC are found in almost 80% of the sporadic colorectal cancers, and Wnt signaling activation is involved in the best part of sporadic colorectal carcinomas. On the other hand, the BMP pathway acts as positive regulator of some of the Wnt proteins, and the tumor suppressive role of this signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of CRC and other cancers is well established. Besides, mutations in two of its genes, SMAD4 and BMPR1A, are responsible for juvenile polyposis syndrome, another hereditary CRC condition. Considering all this information, we thought it would be interesting to screen some of the genetic variability within these pathways for any evidence of new CRC related variants that could explain at least part of the missing heritability. Our approach was mainly functional, for only SNPs within exonic or cis-regulatory sequences (5' and 3' unstranslated regions) were selected to analyse their relationship with CRC susceptibility.",
        "Methods": "    Subjects were 933 CRC patients and 969 controls that belonged to the EPICOLON project, a prospective, multicentre, population-based epidemiology survey studying the incidence and features of familial and sporadic CRC in the Spanish population. Cases were selected across 11 hospitals in Spain as all patients with a de-novo histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma and who attended 11 community hospitals across Spain between November 2006 and December 2007. Patients in whom CRC developed in the context of familial adenomatous polyposis or inflammatory bowel disease, and cases where patients or family refused to participate in the study were excluded. Demographic, clinical and tumour-related characteristics of probands, as well as a detailed family history were obtained using a pre-established questionnaire, and registered in a single database. Of these, 592 (63%) were male and 341 (37%) female. Median age for cases was 73 (range 26-95), whereas mean was 71(SD+-10.7). Hospital-based controls were recruited together with cases and were confirmed to have no cancer or prior history of neoplasm, and no family history of CRC. All controls were randomly selected and matched with cases for sex and age (+-5 years) in a 1:1 ratio. Both cases and controls were of European ancestry and from Spain.\n\n    The study was approved by the \"Comite Etico de Investigacion Clinica de Galicia\", and each of the institutional review boards of the hospitals where samples were collected (\"Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic-Barcelona\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital del Mar-Barcelona\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital German Trias i Pujol-Barcelona\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital Sant Pau-Barcelona,\" \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitari Arnau de Vilanova-Lleida\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital General-Alicante\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital de Donosti\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital General de Asturias-Oviedo\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinico-Zaragoza\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital de Calahorra-La Rioja\", \"Ethics Committee of the Hospital Meixoeiro-Vigo\"). All samples were obtained with written informed consent reviewed by the ethical board of the corresponding hospital.\n\n    DNA was obtained from frozen peripheral blood; extraction was performed in a CHEMAGEN robot (Chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG, Baesweiler, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, at the Galician Public Fundation of Genomic Medicine in Santiago de Compostela. Cases and controls were extracted in mixed batches to avoid any kind of bias.\n\n    Both Wnt and BMP pathways were initially selected after the findings of Nishanian et al., who demonstrated the interaction between these two pathways. Both pathways were thoroughly investigated through the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project site, but we failed to find any information regarding the BMP pathway in either this or other web browsers. For that reason, Wnt genes were selected by browsing the pathway through Biocarta, whereas BMP genes had to be strictly selected from previous literature. Forty-one genes were finally selected to be included in the analysis.\n\n    SNP selection criteria only considered functional markers with minor allele frequencies above 0.05 and at least two independent validation criteria as established in dbSNP. This included all exonic variants selected with Pupasuite and gene-regulatory regions in cis (5'or 3' UTR ends), as defined by the FESD web browser. 5'UTR variants were only included when they complied to the abovementioned criteria and were presumed to be in the potential binding site of a known transctiptional binding factor. 3' UTR variants were included because of their potential relationship with miRNA binding regions. Because some of the selected genes had no SNPs of such these kinds in any of the three browsers at the time of SNP selection, they ultimately had to be dropped out of the study. Finally, 43 SNPs were chosen within 21 genes to be screened as potential direct modifiers of CRC susceptibility (Table 3).\n\n    rs4444235 and rs9929218 are two variants lying in the near-by and intronic regions of BMP4 and CDH1, respectively, that have been recently reported to be associated with the disease. Considering that the SNPs that we had chosen within these two genes were not good taggers for these two variants (r-squared values were 0.6 for the SNPs in BMP4, and 0.02 for those in CHD1) (Figure 1), we decided to include them in our study as well, although they did not fulfill our selection criteria, making the total number of interrogated SNPs rise to 45.\n\n    Genotyping was performed with the MassARRAY (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, USA) technology at the Santiago de Compostela node of the Spanish Genotyping Center. Calling of genotypes was done with Sequenom Typer v4.0 software using all the data from the study simultaneously.\n\n    Quality control was performed, first by excluding both SNPs and samples with genotype success rates below 95%, with the help of the Genotyping Data Filter (GDF). Genotypic distributions for all SNPs in controls were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as assessed using a X2 test (1df). All p-values obtained were >=0.05, thereby excluding the possibility of genotyping artifacts (data not shown). Population stratification was assessed with Structure v2.2. Briefly, the posibility of different scenarios was tested assuming a different number of underlying populations (k ranging from 1 to 4), allowing for a large number of iterations (25 K in the burn-in period followed by 500 K repetitions). The mean log likelihood was estimated for the data for a given k (referred to as L(K)) in each run. We as well performed multiple runs for each value of k computing the overall mean L(K) and its standard deviation. All results seemed to be concordant with the original assumption of a single existing population. Moreover, additional procedures for better confounding variable visualization were undertaken by means of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the EIGENSOFT tool smartpca , although number of markers was very low. No differences were found of population stratification between cases and controls for either STRUCTURE or the first 10 components of the PCA analysis (Figure S2). After quality control 1746 samples (854 cases and 892 controls) and 37 SNPs remained for further analyses.\n\n    Association tests were performed by chi-squared tests for every single SNP and haplotypes where possible with both Haploview v4.0 and Unphased. In short, LD patterns across genes for which more than one SNP was genotyped were checked in Haploview and tested for association using Unphased (to check in any of the haplotypes was associated) and Haploview (to see which of the haplotypes was associated). Genotypic association tests, logistic regression analysis for sex and age adjustment, and stratified analysis between sporadic and familial groups were estimated with PLINK v1.03. OR and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each statistic, and to address the issue of multiple-testing, permutation tests and the Bonferroni correction were used. Study power was estimated with CATS software.",
        "Results": "    Following our pathway-based candidate-gene selection method, we performed our study in a total of 45 SNPs that were in either exonic or regulatory regions, in an overall of 21 genes from both the Wnt and BMP pathways. Details of SNP features and association values for the 37 SNPs that successfully passed quality control criteria are shown on Table 1. None of the screened SNPs were significantly associated with an altered risk of CRC, considering odds-ratios and related p values for allelic and genotypic tests (trend, dominant and recessive). Logistic regression for age and sex adjustment was performed, although it did not improve p value results. Haplotype analysis results were consistent in both Unphased and Haploview, and did not show any signs of positive associations either for any of the 8 genes for which this analysis was performed (AXIN1, HDAC9, BMP4, DACT1, CDH3, CDH1, BTRC, and APC), (Figure S1). Stratification analysis comparing sporadic and familial cases was also implemented, but it did not provide any evidence of differences in susceptibilities between the groups that could be a sign of any specific associations within either of the groups (Table 2).\n\n    Thus, our strategy has not managed to detect any new susceptibility loci for CRC risk.\n\n    Pathway-based expectations have proved to be quite discouraging in the literature as well, for strong candidate pathways, such as DNA-repair ones, surprisingly failed too in identifying any new risk variants. In addition to this, most of the genetic variants that have been found to be associated with disease are located in intergenic regions, with potential functions that are yet unknown.\n\n    Still, in light of the recent discoveries that followed up the analysis of genome-wide data, both Wnt and BMP have earned a renewed fame. The susceptibility locus found on 8q24 (rs6983267) has been linked to an enhanced Wnt signaling through its interaction with TCF4, and a meta-analysis conducted on a series of GWAS data succeeded in associating two variants in the BMP4 and CDH1 gene regions with the disease (rs4444235 and rs9929218, respectively).\n\n    Even though this is actually the first association study that considers the pathways as a whole for gene selection, some of the genes included in our analysis (i.e APC, CCND1, CDH1 and TCF7) had already been screened for risk alleles. It is quite remarkable that there has been a growing debate over some of these loci, specially the p.V1822D variant in APC (rs459552). This missense change is widely documented in the literature, with some studies defending it as neutral (this study and others), and some conferring its minor allele a protective effect. Lack of appropriate study power, resultant from insufficient number of samples has been a major problem in many of these studies and thus most of them have not provided very convincing results.\n\n    Although our study had over 80% power to detect OR as low as 1.21 with minor allele frequencies of 0.30 (57% of our SNPs), and 1.24 for MAFs down to 0.2 (78% of the SNPs), assuming a log-additive model and alpha = 0.05, we were unable to detect any positive associations suggesting the presence of any new CRC susceptibility variants. Nevertheless, it is quite remarkable that, albeit our failure to replicate the associations for the BMP4 and CDH1 SNPs, this is the first study that investigates any of the so-called 10 new GWAS-discovered susceptibility loci in a Southern-European population.\n\n    Despite our negative results, we must consider that we did not whatsoever comprehensively cover all possible low-penetrance variants within the selected genes. This is mainly due to the fact that our strategy was purely functional, selecting the variants that were a priori good candidates to be directly associated with the disease. This indeed may constitute a limitation in the study, for most of the genetic variation within the loci was not investigated. Thus, we believe further efforts should be made to screen a wider variety of loci within these pathways, specially considering the previous positive associations described so far for both Wnt and BMP-related genes.\n\n    Pondering the potential odds ratios of the variants described so far (1.11, CI 1.08-1.15 and 0.91, CI 0.89-0.94 for rs4444235 and rs9929218, respectively), we assume larger cohorts may be required to detect such subtle effects. On the other hand, when considering candidate-gene approaches, it would also be useful to meta-analyse previous studies and pull the information across of them altogether in the search of evidences of potential new pathways linked to the pathogenesis of the disease.",

        "Title": "    The Response of Macro- and Micronutrient Nutrient Status and Biochemical Processes in Rats Fed on a Diet with Selenium-Enriched Defatted Rapeseed and/or Vitamin E Supplementation",
        "Abstract": "    The response of nutrient status and biochemical processes in (i) Wistar and (ii) spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats upon dietary intake of selenium- (Se-) enriched defatted rapeseed (DRS) and/or vitamin E fortification was examined to assess the health benefit of DRS in animal nutrition. Twenty-four individuals of each type of rat were used: The control group was fed with an untreated diet (Diet A). In Diets B and C, soybean meal was replaced with defatted DRS, which comprised 14% of the total diet. The selenized DRS application resulted in ~3-fold increase of Se content in the diet. Diet C was also fortified with the addition of vitamin E, increasing the natural content by 30%. The Se content of the blood and kidneys tended to increase in the DRS groups, where the changes were significant (P < 0.05) only in the case of SHR rats. The iodine (I) content and the proportion of iodide in rat livers indicated a lower transformation rate of iodide into organoiodine compounds compared to the control. Slight and ambiguous alterations in the antioxidative response of the rat were observed in the DRS groups, but the addition of vitamin E to the diet helped to moderate these effects.",
        "Introduction": "    Selenium (Se) is a component of more than 30 selenoproteins, which play a significant role in humans and other animals. Selenoproteins protect cells from damage inflicted by free radicals, participate in the metabolism of thyroid hormones, control reproductive functions, and stimulate the immune system. Lukas et al. reported a high and increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the Czech Republic. Among the factors affecting this incidence is insufficient dietary intake of iodine (I) and, to a lesser extent, selenium. Selenium and iodine are essential for thyroid hormone synthesis and function. Thus, synthesis of thyroid hormones and their activation and inactivation by deiodinase enzymes require Se. Wu et al. confirmed that low selenium status is associated with an increased risk of thyroid disease, and, therefore, increased selenium intake may reduce the risk in areas where selenium uptake is low. In Europe, Wimmer et al. reported slightly higher (but not significant) serum selenium levels in normal people than in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis in Lower Austria. A negative correlation between the thyroid volume and Se and I content of hair of goitrous children in Morocco was observed by El-Fadeli et al..\n\n    As reviewed by Loyke and Mozaffarian, selenium is involved in defense against cardiovascular diseases in animals. Selenium belongs to a group of trace elements that includes iron, copper, zinc, and manganese. They are essential components of enzymatic systems that can affect arterial hypertension and myocardial infarction. Other nutritional factors that affect blood pressure and cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, vitamins A, C, and E, and essential fatty acids. Antioxidant defenses that are affected by selenium may reduce vascular and tissue injury resulting from the formation of reactive oxygen species due to stress, hypoxia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Selenium-related systems may also decrease the oxidation of lipids and protect the vascular endothelium from damage. Conversely, extremely high selenium status can lead to increased blood pressure. In a review of previously published work, it was found that the relationship between Se status and hypertension is still ambiguous.\n\n    The role of selenium in animals is supported by vitamin E. Thakur and Srivastava extensively reviewed the roles of vitamin E in humans, which included acting as an antioxidant, supporting the metabolism of nucleic acids, protein, and lipids, and helping to protect against heart disease. Moreover, vitamin E is involved in the protection of thyroid functions. Yu et al. showed that excess iodine in the diet leads to thyroid damage in rats and vitamin E supplementation can partly ameliorate iodine-induced thyroid cytotoxicity.\n\n    Selenium concentration in cattle whole blood samples collected from 494 animals within the Czech Republic ranged between 0.004 and 0.212 mg/L. Selenium deficiency was found in 50% of the tested animals and on 54% of the farms. Fortification of nutritional resources can lead to an improved Se status in humans and other animals. Banuelos and Mayland showed that selenized rapeseed (Brassica napus) plants (not including seeds) could be safely fed to lambs and cows to help meet normal Se intake requirements. However, rapeseed is characterized by a high content of glucosinolates. Glucosinolate intake has been found to decrease the utilization of iodine in the thyroid gland, resulting in low levels of triiodothyronine and thyroxine. In our previous experiments, Tvrda et al. found that the substitution of soybean (Glycine max) meal with 00-quality DRS (representing 14% of the total diet) in rat diets did not result in any harmful effects on the biochemical or hematological response of the rats. Thus, the potential antinutritional characteristics of DRS did not affect the main parameters of the biochemical response in rats. Myska et al. tested the effect of an increased selenized DRS rate (up to 14% of the total diet) on the uptake of Se and other essential elements by male Wistar rats. They showed that the Se content in the blood and liver of the animals remained unchanged; increased Se levels were observed only in the kidneys of the selenized DRS group compared to the controls. However, Se addition seems to help in the utilization of essential elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, and zinc, compared to the DRS-containing diet without Se fortification.\n\n    All the mentioned findings document interrelationships of the selenium, iodine, and vitamin E in both animal and human organism. Therefore, the Se supplementation of the animal diet can lead to both improvement of the Se status of the organism and/or of the physiological functions connected with iodine and vitamin E roles in the organism. Moreover, the potential increase of the Se content in farm animals (for instance pigs) can also improve the human Se status with all the other connections. In this study, the potential role of vitamin E addition in the uptake and utilization of Se, I, and other macro- and micronutrients by rats was investigated. The main objectives of the study were (i) to assess the potential mutual effect of Se and vitamin E on the utilization of macro- and micronutrients within DRS groups, (ii) to assess the potential effect of the selenized DRS on iodine utilization, and (iii) to verify the potential effect of Se and/or vitamin E dietary intake on hypertensive rats compared to normotensive rats.",
        "Methods": "    Male Wistar Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were obtained from a breeder (Velaz, Prague, Czech Republic) at 30 days of age and housed in cages (one animal per cage) in a room with a controlled temperature (varying from 23 to 25 C) under natural light conditions. Twenty-four animals of each strain, divided into three groups of eight, were used; the animals were fed on the semisynthetic diet according to the experimental design for 60 days. Feed and water were supplied to the animals ad libitum. Feed consumption and body weight of the animals were monitored weekly. The control group was fed with the untreated semisynthetic diet (Diet A). In the case of DRS-treated groups (Diets B and C), the complete portion (14% of the whole diet) of soybean meal was replaced with Se-enriched DRS. The DRS was prepared from oilseed rape of the 00-quality variety, NK Oktans, where the elemental composition of the seeds was as follows: 9159 +- 1837 mg/kg of Ca, 2.63 +- 0.3 mg/kg of Cu, 73.0 +- 13.1 mg/kg of Fe, 11054 +- 2688 mg/kg of K, 1273 +- 195 mg/kg of Mg, 20.4 +- 4.5 mg/kg of Mn, 3067 +- 341 mg/kg of P, 2533 +- 765 mg/kg of S, and 15.7 +- 2.1 mg/kg of Zn. The Se enrichment of the oilseed rape plants was provided by the foliar application of selenate (Na2SeO4) solution at the rate 50g Se/ha at the beginning of stem elongation in a microscale field experiment. The seeds were processed by milling and defatting the seeds using a Soxhlet apparatus and using hexane as the extraction agent for four hours. Subsequently, the meal was dried at 105 C for two hours and homogenized. The nutritional characteristics of the final DRS were as follows: 30.5% protein, 2.5% lipid, 18.4% metabolizable saccharides, 35.4% dietary fiber, 6.7% ash, 6.5% water, and 938 kJ/100g metabolizable energy. Additionally, Diet C was fortified with vitamin E where the useable content was increased by 30% to enhance the vitamin E uptake within the physiological requirements of the animals. The composition and nutritional values are summarized in Table 1. At the end of the study period, the animals were euthanised by exsanguination after being anesthetized with Xylapan (xylazine) and Narketan (ketamine), and whole blood, liver, kidney, and testes were sampled. The sampled tissues were kept at -18 C and subsequently freeze-dried and homogenized; aliquots of blood samples were stored in heparinized tubes.\n\n    In order to determine the quantity of elements in the freeze-dried and homogenized animal tissues and diets, an aliquot (~500 mg of dry matter) of the sample was weighed in a digestion vessel. In the case of blood, 500 muL of whole blood was measured out into the digestion vessel. Concentrated nitric acid (8.0 mL, Analytika Ltd., Czech Republic) and 30% H2O2 (2.0 mL, Analytika Ltd., Czech Republic) were added. The mixture was heated in an Ethos 1 (MLS GmbH, Germany) microwave-assisted wet digestion system for 30 min at 220 C. After cooling, the digest was transferred to a 25 ml glass tube, topped up with deionized water, and kept at laboratory temperature until measurements were taken. For the element measurements of whole blood, the same decomposition procedure was applied, where 0.3 mL of the whole blood sample was taken for the analysis.\n\n    To determine total iodine quantities in the experimental diets, alkaline digestion of the liver and thyroid gland tissues was performed with 25% (w/w) solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate (TMAH) prepared by dissolution of solid TMAH in water (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). The samples (0.5-1g) were decomposed using microwave digestion with 3 mL of 25% (w/w) TMAH solution in 210 mL PTFE vessels in the decomposition unit, UniClever (Plazmatronika, Wroclaw, Poland) (digestion program: max. power 90 W for 1 min, max. power 105 W for 1 min, max. power 120 W for 1 min, max. power 135 W for 7 min, and 10 min cooling). After cooling, the samples were transferred into 25 mL volumetric flasks. These solutions were filtered through 0.45 mum filters (Whatman, Buckinghamshire, UK); 9 mL of the filtrates was pipetted into 10 mL volumetric flasks, 0.2 mL of the internal standard (IS) solution was added, and the flasks were refilled with water to the mark before the measurements. The TMAH extraction is known to be a suitable method for sample preparation for iodine determination in both animal and plant materials.\n\n    Se content of the digests was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7700x, Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). The ICP-MS was equipped with an autosampler ASX-500, a three-channel peristaltic pump, and a MicroMist nebulizer. The experimental conditions were as follows: RF power of 1.55 kW; plasma flow of 15.0 L/min; auxiliary flow of 0.9 L/min; helium collision cell flow of 8 L/min. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Agilent 720, Agilent Technologies Inc., USA), equipped with a two-channel peristaltic pump, a Sturman-Masters spray chamber, and a V-groove pneumatic nebulizer made of inert material, was applied for the determination of cadmium, copper, iron, manganese, zinc, phosphorus, and sulfur levels in the digests. The experimental conditions were as follows: power of 1.2 kW; plasma flow of 15.0 L/min; auxiliary flow of 0.75 L/min; nebulizer flow of 0.9 L/min. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (F-AAS, Varian 280FS, Varian, Australia; air flow of 13.5 L/min, acetylene flow of 2.2 L/min, burner height of 13.5 mm, and nebulizer uptake rate of 5 mL/min) was used for the determination of Ca, Mg, and K quantities in the digests.\n\n    To establish total iodine concentrations in the alkaline digests, ICP-MS was applied using an ELAN DRC-e instrument (Perkin Elmer, Concord, Canada). The measurement conditions were as follows: RF power 1.1 kW; nebulizer gas flow rate 0.76 L/min; auxiliary gas flow rate 1 L/min; plasma gas flow rate 11 L/min; measured isotopes were 72Ge and 127I. The procedures were performed according to Kana et al.. A solution of approximately 1% (w/w) TMAH served as a washing solution between measurements of the samples to prevent memory effects. Because of the excellent linearity of ICP-MS, a calibration curve based on a blank solution and a single calibration solution was sufficient. The limit of detection was estimated by tripling the standard deviation of the blanks (n = 6); its value was 0.97 mug/L I (26.9 mug/kg I for 1g of sample).\n\n    For the speciation analysis, the thawed samples (approx. 1g) were homogenized using Ultra-Turrax  T10 basic disperser with an S10N-10G dispersing element (IKA, Germany), with 2 mL of demineralized water for 1 min at 20,500 rpm. Solid particles were separated using centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant was transferred to a 10 mL volumetric flask. The solid particles were shaken with 2 mL of water and the suspension was centrifuged. The combined extract was refilled to the mark with water and the solutions were filtered through 0.45 mum filters before analysis. This filtered extract was also used to determine the total iodine content.\n\n    A high-pressure pump, Series 200 (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, USA), was used for the mobile phase delivery to the chromatographic column. The chromatographic column PRP x100 (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 mum, Hamilton) was used for species separation. The samples and standards were injected via Rheodyne 9010 injectors equipped with 50 muL PEEK sample loops. The effluent from the column was mixed with an internal standard solution using a T-piece. The mixture was delivered into ICP-MS equipment using a peristaltic pump. The solution uptake was 1.0 mL/min of column effluent + 0.3 mL/min of internal standard solution. ICP-MS measurements were carried out using an ELAN DRC-e instrument (Perkin Elmer, Concord, Canada). A standard solution of 1000 +- 2 mg L-1 germanium (Ge, CertiPur, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for the preparation of a stock solution of the internal standard containing 5 mg L-1 Ge (IS). A standard solution of iodide (1000 +- 2 mg L-1 I, Analytika, Prague, Czech Republic) and solid potassium iodate (GR ACS, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for preparation of the calibration solutions. Demineralized water, Milli-Q (MilliPore, Bedford, MA, USA), was used for the preparation of all solutions. Solution of 100 mmol L-1 ammonium nitrate (extra pure, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) served as the mobile phase for chromatography; the pH was adjusted via the addition of a 25% ammonia solution (SupraPur, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to a value of 7.4. The limits of detection and accuracy of determination were calculated using chromatography-ICP-MS coupling through the analysis of iodide and iodate solutions (n = 6) with low concentrations (both approximately 0.1 mug/L I) and were estimated to be triple the standard deviation. The detection limit was 0.11 mug/L (1.1 mug/kg I for 1g of sample) for both iodide and iodate.\n\n    The hematological parameters, total number of erythrocytes (Er, T.L-1), hemoglobin (Hb, g.100 mL-1), hematocrit value (Hct, %), mean cell volume (MCV, fL), and total number of leukocytes (Le, G.L-1), were determined in the whole blood that had been stabilized using K2EDTA. All parameters were determined using the computerized analyzer, NIHON KOHDEN MEK 5208. The blood hemolysis solution ISOTONAC 3 MEK 640 was used for the determination of the number of leukocytes and hemoglobin values. In the case of biochemical parameters, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cholesterol content in blood plasma were determined using the computerized analyzer, Cobas 6000 (Roche, Switzerland).\n\n    The activities of selected antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and catalase (CAT) were measured in extracts of rat liver and kidneys. The tissue extracts were prepared by the homogenization of 0.08g of liver or kidney with 1 mL of the buffer (0.01 mol L-1 phosphate buffered saline solution at pH 7.4, 0.137 mol L-1 NaCl, 8.1 mmol L-1 Na2HPO4 12H2O, 1.5 mmol L-1 KH2PO4, and 2.7 mmol L-1 KCl). The homogenates were than centrifuged (Jouan, France) for 10 min at 6,700 xg and 4 C and the supernatants were kept at -20 C until measurement. Specific enzymatic activity in the tissue extracts was determined using the spectrophotometers, Libra S22 (Biochrom, UK) and PowerWave XS (BioTek, USA). Catalase activity was determined according to Goth by using the Catalase Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, USA). The extracts were mixed with 50 mmol L-1 Sorensen buffer (consisting of 19.1 mmol L-1 Na2HPO4 12H2O and 30.9 mmol L-1 KH2PO4) at pH 7.0 and measured at lambda = 240 nm. Glutathione peroxidase activity was determined by the modified method published by Flohe and Gunzler in 100 mmol L-1 potassium phosphate buffer with 1 mmol L-1 EDTA at pH 7.0 and measured at lambda = 340 nm. Glutathione reductase was determined according to Worthington and Rosemeyer in 47 mmol L-1 potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 7) at lambda = 412 nm. Thioredoxin reductase was measured according to Luthman and Holmgren 100 mmol L-1 potassium phosphate buffer with 1 mmol L-1 EDTA at pH 7.0, at lambda = 412 nm. Glutathione S-transferase was measured according to Habig et al. in the buffered saline solution (pH = 7.2) at lambda = 340 nm. All the analyses were performed at 25 C.\n\n    The data were processed using Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and Statistica 12 CZ statistical software. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at P < 0.05 followed by Scheffe's test was applied to the data. The Shapiro-Wilk test (P < 0.05) was used to verify the normality of the data distribution. To assess the differences in the activities of the antioxidative enzymes among the experimental groups, the F-test was applied to observe whether the data complied with the assumption of homogeneity of variance. Subsequently, the unpaired two-sample t-test (P < 0.05), with a Holm-Bonferroni correction to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons, was applied.",
        "Results": "    Table 1 documents no difference in the basic nutritional composition of the experimental diets. As presented in Table 2, the replacement of soybean meal with the selenized DRS resulted in an increase in total Se content (as expected), as well as an increase in the total potassium content in the diet, due to the high natural content of potassium in rapeseed. The other elements that were measured remained unchanged. Se concentrations in whole blood are summarized in Table 3. In most studies presenting blood Se levels, the plasma selenium values are used because plasma selenium responds rapidly to selenium supplementation and is regarded as a biomarker of short-term selenium status. However, whole blood selenium is used as a biomarker of long-term selenium intake and status, so whole blood Se concentration was the more suitable parameter in this experiment. No change in Se content was found in the liver (Table 4), but there was an increase in Se in the kidneys and testes (Tables 5 and 6). In these tissues, however, no significant differences were found among the Se-enhanced experimental diets. Thus, the enhancement of the vitamin E uptake (Diet C) did not result in the improvement of the Se utilization by the rats compared to Diet B. Among the other investigated elements, the blood levels of Ca, Cu, and P increased in the DRS groups of Wistar rats, and, on the contrary, except S, the blood levels of elements tended to decrease in the DRS groups of SHR rats. In the kidney, no alterations in element content were observed, except for ambiguous changes in S content (P < 0.05) in the Wistar rats. In the testes, no effect of the different diets was observed in the Wistar rats, whereas elevated (P < 0.05) contents of Mg, P, and S were determined in SHR rats.\n\n    No significant differences (P < 0.05) in the main hematological parameters of rats were found due to the addition of selenized DRS to the diet (Table 7). In Wistar rat liver, GR, GST, and TrxR activity increased significantly (P < 0.05) in rats fed on the selenized DRS, and this effect was accentuated in Diet C that had elevated vitamin E level (Table 8). Thus, these results indicate potential interaction of Se and vitamin E in the antioxidative response of the rat organism. For GPx, the activity in the liver decreased (P < 0.05) with Se-DRS addition to the diet. CAT activity increased (P < 0.05) in the group fed on Diet B and increased (P < 0.05) again under Diet C. Another enzyme that may have indicated adverse effects of DRS on liver function was alanine aminotransferase (ALT), but no significant changes among the experimental groups were observed (Figure 1).\n\n    The significantly higher (P < 0.05) kidney Se content was determined in the SHR rats fed on Diet C compared to Diet B (Table 5). The content of other investigated elements in the analyzed tissues showed differences in element uptake between Wistar and SHR rats (Tables 3-6), whereas the effect of the different diets on each individual rat strain was ambiguous. In whole blood, most of the elements showed lower values in SHR rats compared to Wistar rats, with the exception of manganese, which displayed the opposite pattern. SHR rats exhibited lower levels of most of the investigated elements in the liver, kidneys, and testes compared to Wistar rats.\n\n    The average activity levels of the antioxidative enzymes in the liver and kidneys of SHR and Wistar rats are summarized in Table 8. In the liver of SHR rats, the activity of GPx, TrxR, and CAT decreased (P < 0.05) for Diet C, which was supplemented with Se and vitamin E. The levels of GR activity increased in the Se-supplemented Diet B and decreased again in the case of Diet C. In the kidneys of Wistar rats, a stepwise increase (P < 0.05) in GST activity in the order Diet A < Diet B < Diet C was found, whereas CAT activity remained unchanged. The activity of GPx and GR decreased in the group fed with Diet B and increased for Diet C with enhanced Se and vitamin E intake. TrxR activity increased in the group fed on Diet B and decreased for Diet C compared to the control (P < 0.05). In the kidneys of the SHR rats, the results were comparable to the Wistar rats, but without the decrease in GPx and GR activity seen in the Se-supplemented Diet B. Generally, significantly (P < 0.05) lower activity of GST was recorded in SHR rats compared to the Wistar strain in both the liver and kidneys, regardless of the experimental diet. Moreover, no differences in ALT activity were recorded between Wistar and SHR rats (Figure 1). The cholesterol content in blood plasma in this experiment (Figure 2) suggested a slight decreasing trend in plasma cholesterol content in Wistar rats (and to a lesser extent in SHR rats) fed on the DRS-containing Diets B and C, but the differences were not statistically significant.\n\n    More than 80% of total iodine content in mammals is concentrated in the thyroid. The results of the total iodine content in whole thyroid glands are summarized in Figure 3. Regardless of the high variability of the results, SHR rats showed significantly higher iodine levels than the Wistar rats. However, no significant differences were observed within the individual strains. The average values were 200-275 mg/kg for Wistar rats and 541-620 mg/kg for SHR rats. The total amount of iodine and water-extractable iodine in the rat liver indicates no effect of elevated Se in the rat diet on iodine levels (Figure 4), as well as no effect of enhanced vitamin E uptake by the rats. Similarly, in the case of the thyroid glands, higher I content was determined in SHR rats compared to Wistar rats.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Potassium is a major nutrient responsible for nitrogen economy in oilseed rape, formation of yield components, and, consequently, oilseed rape yield. Brennan and Bolland reported 32% higher potassium (K) requirements of oilseed rape than wheat (Triticum aestivum) for the production of maximum seed yield. At the same K application rate, the concentration of K in shoots was greater for rapeseed than for wheat. However, soybean also has a high requirement of K in the soil compared to wheat. Thus, we can assume that the differences in K content of the rat diet due to the replacement of soybean meal with DRS are caused predominantly by different growing conditions, soil K status, and mobility of both crops used in this experiment. For instance, it has been shown that soil pH affects K uptake by soybean plants. Thus, among the investigated elements, the replacement of soybean meal with DRS in the rat diet can lead to increasing dietary uptake of K.\n\n    Higher Se levels in the diets resulted in increased blood Se levels, where the differences among the experimental diets were significant (P < 0.05) only in the case of SHR rats. In the blood of both animal strains, Se concentrations tended to increase if the vitamin E level was enhanced in the diet (Diet C). Generally, the SHR rats showed higher blood Se concentrations compared to Wistar rats, regardless of the diet. Similar findings were published by Loyke in the serum of SHR rats compared to normotensive animals, suggesting different metabolism of the SHR rats. Yakobson et al. compared NISAG (hereditary stress-induced arterial hypertension) rats and Wistar rats with acute myocardial infarction and found that, during recovery, selenium content in the plasma and myocardium of NISAG rats was higher than in normotensive animals, most probably due to more intensive functioning of the antioxidant systems. Negative correlations between both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum selenium levels were observed by Telisman et al.. Similarly, Lymbury et al. confirmed that high dietary Se intake (1000 mg Se per kg of the diet) resulted in lower levels of cardiac oxidative damage and a reduction in disease severity and mortality in SHR rats. In the present experiment, the Se content of the diet was lower than in the study of Lymbury et al., but the data also indicate the stimulation of the antioxidative response.\n\n    Although the DRS addition into the rat diet led to higher uptake of K compared to control, no increase of K level in the animal tissues was determined in Wistar rats and even decrease of K was observed in the blood of SHR rats. Decreasing Zn and increasing Mn levels in serum of hypertensive patients were reported by Gouaref et al., and positive relationships between blood Mn level and hypertension were observed by Vigeh et al.. According to Martinez and Diaz, this positive interaction could be related to the role of manganese in erythropoietin synthesis. Alterations in tissue distribution of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn were documented by Giray et al. in I- and/or Se-deficient rats. Under the elevated Se uptake conditions in this experiment, no changes in these elements were observed. In the rat liver, increased (P < 0.05) Zn contents were observed in the Wistar rats fed on Diet C with enhanced vitamin E. Lima et al. reported high Zn content in the liver of lambs fed on a diet supplemented with vitamin E. Contrary to our results, they observed a decrease in Se and an increase in Cu levels in the serum, but these results are not comparable to our data as we measured whole blood, rather than serum. In our case, the blood Se content in SHR rats increased (P < 0.05) and Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, P, and Zn decreased, whereas blood Ca and Cu concentrations in Wistar rats increased (P < 0.05) with increasing Se concentration. The hypertension is frequently associated with insulin resistance, and insulin can modify the functional activity of the hypothalamus, supporting the findings concerning the different metabolism of SHR rats compared to the normotensive animals. Thus, the potential changes in nutrient utilization, including the essential elements, could be speculated in SHR rats as compared with the Wistar rats.\n\n    The total iodine content in whole thyroid glands (Figure 3) is substantially higher than in human thyroids, where total iodine in the whole glands is 3.44 +- 1.11 mg/kg. In accordance with the previous results, only iodide was detected in the liver extracts (Figure 4), whereas the presence of iodate was not confirmed. The iodide proportions in the extracts varied between 55 and 66% in Wistar and between 55 and 70% in SHR rat livers. Similar proportions of iodide were determined by Kana et al. in porcine liver and turkey liver (48.2 +- 8.1% and 50.2 +- 6.5%, resp.). Although the differences were not significant, the results suggested a higher percentage of iodide in the liver of animals fed on the selenized diet, which indicates a lower transformation rate of iodide into organoiodine compounds, compared to the control.\n\n    High selenium content in the thyroid gland, even during selenium deficiency, has been reported by Schmutzler et al.. The lowest selenium concentration for a single thyroid gland sample was 0.51 +- 0.05 mg/kg and the highest was 1.49 +- 0.20 mg/kg. In our case, however, the Se content of the thyroid glands was not determined because of an insufficient amount of material for these analyses. Moreover, plasma or serum selenium concentrations do not reflect intrathyroid concentrations and cannot be used for the estimation of Se status in the thyroid. Windisch reviewed the available literature concerning the intake and interactions of essential trace elements and assumed that there is no homeostatic control of absorption of I. Rather, organisms seem to be passively exposed to influx of this element and the regulation of its metabolism is predominantly via renal excretion. For these metabolic pathways, the element must be present in a metabolically recognizable form, and, for iodine, the major metabolic species is iodide.\n\n    Our previous experiment revealed that the addition of DRS (without selenization) to up to 14% of the total diet did not affect the hematological parameters of rats, regardless of the potential antinutritional characteristics of DRS. Svetina et al. observed no changes in the hematological parameters of pigs fed with a diet containing up to 10% DRS. Similar findings were published by Travnicek et al. (1995), using sheep as the study animal. Therefore, no adverse effect of DRS addition to the rat diet on the main hematological parameters was observed. Similarly, no changes in hematological parameters were observed in goats when they were fed on a diet supplemented with selenium yeast and sodium selenite, resulting in 0.3 mg Se/kg of the diet. Alashi et al. reported antihypertensive activities of rapeseed protein hydrolysates (alcalase and pepsin hydrolysates) in SHR rats. In our case, significantly (P < 0.05) higher total erythrocyte count, lower mean cell volume, and lower total leukocyte count were observed in SHR rats compared to Wistar rats. However, these parameters were not affected by the elevated Se intake in this experiment. Tvrda et al. also observed no effect of increasing nonselenized DRS intake on ALT activity. In this experiment, no effect of enhanced Se and vitamin E intake was observed, although it has been found that vitamin E and nutrient status can affect hepatic enzyme profiles in the case of other elements such as Zn. Thus, our results confirmed a negligible effect of the rat diet modifications on liver function.\n\n    Selenium deficiency, or combined iodine and selenium deficiency, can cause significant alterations in the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as GPx, SOD, and CAT in the thyroid, liver, brain, kidneys, and plasma of rats. Additionally, Parshukova et al. reported the effect of low levels of plasma selenium on GPx activity and thyroid hormone levels in humans living in northern European Russia. Thus, an imbalance in Se and/or I status of animals can result in altered activity of the main antioxidative enzymes, including those closely connected with Se metabolism.\n\n    Induction of pulmonary hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in increased GPx and decreased CAT activity in animal tissues. Similarly, increasing erythrocyte GPx and CAT activity was observed by Cinar et al. in rats with increasing blood pressure. In contrast, lower GPx activity in serum of rats with arterial hypertension was observed by Ciocoiu et al.. Also Lee et al. reported lower GPx activity in kidney of SHR rats compared to Wistar rats. Vericel et al. suggested that decreased GPx activity could induce an increased cellular generation of radical species and lipid peroxidation, which might be linked to hypertension in SHR rats. Ruseva et al. observed that Se supplementation significantly increased GPx activity of whole blood and in the aortas of both Wistar and SHR rats. Moreover, decreased lipid peroxidation level in the aortic wall was found in Se-supplemented SHR rats compared to the nonsupplemented animals. As a result, Se supplementation improved the redox status of the aortic wall in SHR rats. Our previous investigations showed that GPx levels in plasma decreased with increasing nonselenized DRS in the diet, whereas the specific activities of plasmatic GR, GST, TrxR, and CAT increased (P < 0.05). These results indicate that the dietary intake of DRS can affect antioxidative enzyme activity, and the slightly increased Se content in the diet, as in this experiment, cannot balance this effect. However, the additional effect of vitamin E seems to be sufficient to increase the antioxidative response of rats. For instance, an increase in the antioxidant status of boar ejaculate was observed by Horky et al. after the simultaneous addition of selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E to the diet, in rates of 0.5, 350, and 70 mg per kg of diet, respectively. Thus, the increase in Se intake by SHR rats due to ingestion of selenized DRS, at the levels used in our experiment, needs to be supported by another antioxidative agent such as vitamin E.\n\n    Mature seeds of oilseed rape are rich in oil (45-50% v/v); the oil from 00-quality oilseed rape contains high amounts of oleic acid (C18:1, 60% v/v), along with moderate amounts linoleic acid (C18:2, ~30% v/v) and linolenic acid (C18:3, ~10% v/v). Similarly, El-Beltagi and Mohamed investigated the variation in fatty acid composition of oilseed rape and found that oleic acid (C18:1) ranged from 56.3% to 58.7%, linoleic acid (C18:2) from 10.5% to 13.7%, alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3) from 8.8% to 10.3%, and erucic acid (22 : 1) from 0.15% to 0.91%. Xun et al. investigated the long-term effect of human diets containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on the occurrence of hypertension, revealing that the individuals with the highest intake of these compounds had a significantly lower incidence of hypertension. Moreover, this effect was more pronounced at higher Se levels, as measured in toenail clippings. Ono et al. proved that antihypertensive drugs are associated with improved fatty acid metabolism in SHR rats. Thus, we can assume that antihypertensive effect of Se could also lead to the better utilization of the DRS-derived fatty acids. Previous results showed lower cholesterol content in the plasma of Wistar rats (P < 0.05) with increasing nonselenized DRS in the diet. In contrast, increasing cholesterol and triglyceride levels with increasing blood pressure of rats has been reported by Cinar et al.. A decreased cholesterol level in the blood plasma of lambs has been associated with a dietary supplement of Se, Zn, and vitamin E. The relationships among cholesterol level, Se, and vitamin E supplementation in SHR rats were evaluated by Stone et al., where the plasma cholesterol level of the animals fed on the diet containing 1% cholesterol and deficient in both selenium and vitamin E exceeded almost twice the levels of animals fed on the Se and vitamin E supplemented diet. Besides the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on cholesterol levels, Ikeda et al. observed a hypocholesterolemic effect of fiber compounds in the diet. In this context, the fiber content in the DRS should be twice as high as in soybean meal and this factor should be taken into account when assessing the potential effects of DRS addition to animal diets.\n\n    To conclude the experiments, the application of Se-supplemented diets did not result in any significant change in the essential element levels of Wistar rat tissues, which was in accordance with our previous results, and confirmed that DRS and/or selenized DRS dietary intake did not result in any adverse effects on the nutrient status or balance of the animals. More alterations were observed on the case of SHR rats, where significant differences occurred also between the element levels in Wistar and SHR rats due to differing metabolism of the both strains. However, slight shifts in iodine speciation were recorded in animals fed on the selenized diets. In contrast, slight and ambiguous alterations in the antioxidative response of rats were observed, and vitamin E addition to the diet helped to moderate these effects. The influence of DRS on plasma cholesterol content was not significantly contrary to our preliminary observations. In most of the parameters tested, significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed between Wistar and SHR rats, regardless of the experimental diet, indicating that the selenized DRS addition to the rat diet was unable to reduce the differences in nutritional and biochemical status between the rat strains. The potential improvement of the Se status in Se-deficient areas has already been intensively investigated. In agreement with previous studies, selenized DRS application at the levels used in this experiment tended to improve the nutritional status of the rat and can be recommended as an alternative to the Se-rich, complementary feedstuffs for farm animals.",

        "Title": "    Glucose Tolerance Testing and Anthropometric Comparisons Among Rural Residents of Kyiv Region: Investigating the Possible Effect of Childhood Starvation:A Community-Based Study",
        "Abstract": "    A relationship between childhood starvation and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in adulthood was previously indicated. Ukraine suffered a series of artificial famines between 1921 and 1947. Famines of 1932 to 1933 and 1946 were most severe among them. Long-term health consequences of these famines remain insufficiently investigated. Type 2 diabetes mellitus screening was conducted between June 2013 and December 2014. A total of 198 rural residents of Kyiv region more than 44 years of age, not registered as patients with T2D, were randomly selected. In all, 159 persons answered the question about starvation of parental family, including 73 born before 1947. Among them, 62 persons answered positive. Anthropometric measurements and glucose tolerance tests were performed. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate results. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was detected in 7 of 62 persons (11.3%), who starved during childhood vs 6 of 11 (54.5%) who did not (P = .002), age-adjusted and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval): 0.063 (0.007-0.557). Analysis of the anthropometric data revealed a negative connection between adulthood height and neck circumference (cm, continued variables) and childhood starvation: age-adjusted and sex-adjusted ORs 0.86 (0.76-0.97) and 0.73 (0.54-0.97), respectively. Individuals who starved during famines of 1932 to 1933 and 1946 in Ukraine had a decreased T2D prevalence several decades after the famine episodes.",
        "Introduction": "    The scale and consequences of a 20th-century humanitarian catastrophe, known in Ukraine as Holodomor (meaning \"killing by artificial famine\"), have not yet been sufficiently investigated. The possibility to conduct such studies is diminishing every year due to constant decrease in the number of famine's survivors; therefore, any chance to perform such investigations must be used.\n\n    Some literature data and our previous studies suggest a possible positive correlation between starvation during childhood and the risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), and obesity. We also know about reduction in final height in those who failed to receive enough food during early stages of development. However, in Ukraine, the above assumptions were made based only on the analysis of administrative databases of patients with diabetes, rather than on classic \"field\" epidemiologic studies, based on questionnaire and anthropometric data, whereas current prevalence of screening-detected type 2 diabetes (SDDM) among those who survived the famine during childhood and are still alive today remains unknown. We cannot overlook the possibility that carriers of atherogenic and diabetogenic genotype could have greater chances of surviving during famine but lesser longevity chances due to early development of atherosclerosis and/or T2D.\n\n    The risk of SDDM associated with starvation at an early age, revealed by glucose tolerance testing many years later, is the subject of our investigation.\n\n    We have used the possibility to include glucose tolerance data from tests that began in 2013 among residents of Ukrainian rural areas into the analysis of possible influence of starvation in 1932 to 1933 and/or 1946.",
        "Methods": "    This study contains test results of 198 residents of Andriivka and Kopyliv villages (Kyiv region, 50 32'56.0''N 29 50'12.2''E and 50 24'35.8''N 29 53'25.0''E; current population 1046 and 1170 persons, respectively), randomly selected from the general population older than 44 years between 5 June 2013 and December 3, 2014 who permanently live in the above communities and were not registered as patients with T2D. Relevant lists of residents from 2 towns, provided by family doctors were used for randomization. Patients were selected using random number tables and received an invitation to take part in the study. If the patients did not give consent to take part, the invitation was forwarded to the next person in the randomized list. During the \"Great Famine\" in the neighborhood many people died, what today resembles a memorial to fellow villagers died of starvation (Supplement Figure 1). After signing the informed consent forms, the participants filled out a form, providing information about current treatment and lifestyle, as well as about the fact of starvation in their family in 1930s and/or 1946.\n\n    All participants were measured (body mass, height, waist circumference, neck circumference, arterial blood pressure [BP]). Body mass was measured using well-tried electronic scales, height:using standard portable stadiometer. Waist circumference and neck circumference were measured with a cloth-measuring tape at maximum transverse size in standing position. Body mass index (BMI) was determined as a relation of body mass in kilograms to squared height in meters. To measure arterial BP, we assessed the Korotkoff sounds using operational BP monitors from corresponding family medicine clinics. Blood pressure was measured twice, with an interval of 5 minutes. If there was a difference of more than 10 mm, we made a third measurement. The mean value of these 2/3 measurements was counted. High BP was determined as 140/90 mm Hg and above or by the fact of hypotensive drug treatment. Sufficient physical activity (30 min/d) and sufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables (500 g/d) were determined in accordance with current T2D prevention guidelines.\n\n    The blood sampling was done on an empty stomach and 2 hours after taking a glucose solution (75 g of glucose in 200 mL of water). Blood plasma was quickly separated with a centrifuge (10 minutes; 1000g) and stored in a cold environment for further testing during 24 hours. Glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were determined by standard methods and in a certified lab: glucose oxidase method was used for glucose testing, and HbA1c levels were assessed using Clover A1c (Inforia Co., Ltd) system that uses boronate resin to bind HbA1c.\n\n    We also evaluated odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the risk of events in cross-sectional studies using the model of logistic regression. To evaluate the distribution of qualitative indicators, we calculated the manifestation frequency (%), whereas quantitative indicators, due to their nonparametric distribution in many cases, were given as medians and 1 to 3 quartiles. Frequency of events was compared using chi2 test (Yates corrected). In all cases, differences of P < .05 were considered probable. The 2-way Contingency Table Analysis (http://statpages.org/ctab2x2.html) and SPSS 11.0 software packages were used for statistical analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess for the most adequate method of analysis for each case of comparing data rows. If one or both rows had a non-normal distribution of data, Wilcoxon test was used, and in case of a normal distribution, we used Student t test. In tables, the medians and 25th and 75th percentiles (quartiles 1 and 3) are given for comparison purposes.",
        "Results": "    Anthropometric and other measurements of rural residents (Kyiv region, Ukraine) belonging to different categories were created according to a response about starvation of parental family in 1932 to 1933 and/or 1946.\n\n    Of 198 studied individuals more than 44 years of age, 159 answered the question about starvation in the family either positively or negatively. Of them, 73 were born before 1947 and therefore may have personally suffered from the famine. From this number, 62 individuals (group 2) confirmed the fact of starvation in the family, and 11 persons (group 1) gave a negative answer. Those born after 1946 were added to groups 3 (answered negatively about starvation in parental family during 1932-1933 and/or 1946, 25 persons) and 4 (answered positively about starvation in parental family during 1932-1933 and/or 1946, 61 persons).\n\n    Quantitative data about lifestyle and anthropometric values for the 4 created groups are shown in Table 1. Women, who have not personally starved during childhood (group 1), had an age median greater by 4 years, compared with women from group 2 (P = .038).\n\n    Among the studied persons of both sexes (men and women joined together), who replied negatively to the question about starvation in parental family and were born before 1947, there were a lot more individuals whose fasting glucose and/or glucose tolerance corresponded to diabetic level (fasting 7.0 and above and/or 11.1 after standard glucose loading). Comparing the number of individuals in these categories with a \"diabetic\" level of HbA1c demonstrates the same difference.\n\n    A separate analysis for women confirms the reduction in screening-detected diabetes mellitus, compared with those who replied negatively to the question about childhood starvation. In men, a similar difference is present regarding the fraction of diabetes, confirmed by HbA1c level in groups 1 and 2.\n\n    Men from group 1 had greater body weight, BMI, and waist circumference, compared with men from group 2. Analysis of other values for both sexes revealed only lesser physical activity of those from group 1, which is most likely related to them being older. There were no variations of values between individuals from groups 3 and 4.\n\n    Considering the age differences found in persons from groups 1 and 2, we conducted a regression analysis of the studied anthropometric indicators (as extended variables), taking into account age and sex.\n\n    The logistic regression analysis revealed standardized, according to age and sex, higher odds of belonging to group 2 (personal starvation in childhood) related to a decrease in height by 1 cm (OR = 0.857; 95% CI: 0.761-0.966; P = .011).\n\n    A similar standardization by age and sex did not confirm any other anthropometric differences between the investigated groups, except neck circumference (Table 2). After adjusting for age and sex, the association between the reduction in this anthropometric indicator by 1 cm and childhood starvation becomes statistically significant: OR = 0.727 (0.543-0.974), P = .032.\n\n    Using the receiver operating characteristic curve to create categories of \"reduced\" and \"nonreduced\" height related to childhood starvation allowed to determine the following points of separation: for men:height greater than 167.5 cm (test sensitivity 75%, specificity 85%) and for women:159 cm (71% and 67% accordingly), which indicates a fair quality of the model.\n\n    We also analyzed the logistic regression model concerning the risk of having diabetes mellitus confirmed by HbA1c level, or normal glucose tolerance, associated with the fact of starvation during childhood (Table 3) and very low chances of having T2D, diagnosed by epidemiologic screening in group 2 (persons, whose families starved): OR without adjusting = 0.135 (0.027-0.679) and when adjusting by age OR = 0.059 (0.007-0.519). Simultaneous adjusting by age and sex does not alter statistical significance. Separate analysis for men and women also indicates only a statistical tendency toward reduction in T2D chances, influenced by starvation during childhood.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    This study shows that individuals who starved during famines of 1932 to 1933 and/or 1946 in Ukraine had a decreased screening-detected diabetes mellitus prevalence several decades after the famine episodes.\n\n    Besides, we have revealed a reduction in age and height in a group of individuals, born before 1947, whose families suffered from the famine. Decrease in age in a group of persons who starved during childhood may be a reflection of a higher mortality risk, or a decrease in life expectancy, compared with their nonstarving neighbors. This explanation totally contradicts the conclusion made concerning a connection of Ukrainian Holodomor to mortality in later life. However, this conclusion was made by Vaiserman et al based on one of the types of mathematical data modeling of a general government mortality register that did not consider neither individual questionnaires nor the deceased person's region of residence. Thus, the fact that 6 of 24 Ukrainian regions did not suffer from the famine is not considered, which we believe had a negative effect of the significance of this study.\n\n    Investigators of the Dutch famine showed that starvation during any period of gestation leads to an increase in T2D development in later life. Our small study, most likely indicates an opposite result; however, it did not analyze the influence of starvation during gestation period. Our previous opinion about the effect of starvation on the development of T2D was not based on the results of personal questionnaires but rather on the analysis of population patient registers.\n\n    We cannot exclude the factor of selection when explaining long-term consequences of childhood starvation. Survival during famine and/or further long life may be explained by certain genetic features. However, we must note that survival due to one set of genes does not necessarily mean a further long life. On the contrary, it is possible that those who have these genes have worse chances for further long life due to their metabolic deviation. Therefore, a cross-sectional study performed after 70 years shows a decrease in SDDM and mean age in a group of individuals who have confirmed starvation of their parental family. A possible explanation that unites our recent results with previous ones could be that a speedup of T2D development induced by childhood starvation could lead to a situation, where the carriers of a corresponding genes were already diagnosed with diabetes or diabetes may have even led to a reduction in life span, and therefore, they were not included into our screening (exclusion criteria:known T2D).\n\n    A recent genotyping of those who survived the Leningrad siege also led to unexpected results: in case of UCP3 gene, \"normal\" allele C and C/C genotype prevailed in women, whereas \"mutated\" allele T, associated with atherosclerosis, T2D, and obesity was significantly less common. It would be interesting to conduct similar genetic studies of the inhabitants of Ukraine, who suffered from starvation in early childhood. It is clear that conducting epidemiologic studies in Eastern Europe using individual famine exposure data can clarify causal relation between undernutrition during postnatal development and T2D risk in adulthood.\n\n    So we believe that our results do not necessarily contradict the hypothesis of the acceleration of the development of T2D in persons exposed to starvation in the early period of individual development.\n\n    Despite a small number of individuals included in our study, we were able to show a decrease in height, proving the known effect of childhood starvation on final height of men and women, whereas we did not find any epigenetic influence, ie, a relation between starvation of parents and anthropometric features of investigated persons.\n\n    Being possibly the first simultaneous interpretation of data concerning the fact of childhood starvation and anthropometric and biochemical measurements at the level of a Ukrainian rural community can be considered one of this studies' strengths.\n\n    An apparent weakness of this study is its quantitative limitation, related to current external circumstances, which may have been the reason why we were unable to find some other expected associations. In case of the growing scale of this study, it will allow to confirm or refute the link between starvation in childhood and development T2D in later life.\n\n    Besides, this study has a methodological loss which is the lack of perinatal data. In particular, birth weight is missing along with gestational age. The Barker hypothesis or programming has its roots in what occurred during pregnancy and the first 4 to 5 weeks of life. Impaired fetal nutrition and excessive nutrition after being born are the main benchmarks. However, we were not able to use birth weight data together with gestational age. The humanitarian disaster in Ukraine, known as the Holodomor, made it impossible for normal functioning of obstetric care in the villages, including weighing infants or recording gestational age. However, it is possible that Soviet medicine until the 1950s quite often did not provide for these data at all. Researchers of long-term effects of starvation of the inhabitants of besieged Leningrad could not obtain reliable data on birth weight. It is interesting that Stanner et al stated that there was no difference between the subjects exposed to starvation in utero and those starved during infant life in glucose tolerance.",

        "Title": "    Partitioning of heat production in growing pigs as a tool to improve the determination of efficiency of energy utilization",
        "Abstract": "    In growing pigs, the feed cost accounts for more than 60% of total production costs. The determination of efficiency of energy utilization through calorimetry measurements is of importance to sustain suitable feeding practice. The objective of this paper is to describe a methodology to correct daily heat production (HP) obtained from measurements in respiration chamber for the difference in energy expenditure related to physical activity between animals. The calculation is based on a preliminary published approach for partitioning HP between HP due to physical activity (AHP), thermic effect of feeding (TEF) and basal metabolic rate (fasting HP; FHP). Measurements with male growing pigs [mean body weight (BW): 115 kg] which were surgically castrated (SC), castrated through immunization against GnRH (IC), or kept as entire male (EM) were used as an example. Animals were fed the same diet ad-libitum and were housed individually in two 12-m3 open-circuit respiration chambers during 6 days when fed ad-libitum and one supplementary day when fasted. Physical activity was recorded through interruption of an infrared beam to detect standing and lying positions and with force transducers that recorded the mechanical force the animal exerted on the floor of the cage. Corrected AHP (AHPc), TEF (TEFc), and HP (HPc) were calculated to standardize the level of AHP between animals, assuming that the ratio between AHPc and ME intake should be constant. Inefficiency of energy utilization (sum of AHPc and TEFc) was lower than the inefficiency estimated from the slope of the classical relationship between HPc and ME intake but was associated with higher requirements for maintenance. Results indicate that EM pigs had higher FHP but lower TEFc than IC and SC pigs. These results agree with the higher contents in viscera of EM pigs that stimulate their basal metabolic rate and with the reduced utilization of dietary protein to provide energy for maintenance energy requirements and fat deposition (FD).",
        "Introduction": "    In growing pigs, feeding accounts for more than 60% of total production costs. The increased use of crop resources for human consumption or fuel production in a context of constrained land resources promotes feedstuff diversification in pig diets, including the use of increasing amounts of by-products (Martin,). Nevertheless, these new feedstuffs are often poorly documented for their energy values, whereas the technological treatments they undergo, often associated with high contents in dietary fiber, may strongly affect metabolic utilization of energy by the growing pigs. Different feeding systems (from digestible energy to net energy, NE) that take into account different energy losses by the animal can be used to describe dietary energy value (Baldwin,). Among them, the NE system requires measuring energy expenditure associated with the utilization of these feedstuffs for growth (or heat increment HI). The direct measurement in growing animals of heat production (HP) in respiration chamber offers the opportunity to evaluate variation among animals in line with their genotype, phenotype or environmental conditions. Nevertheless, animals produce heat because of different metabolic processes involved in their maintenance and growth functions. The calculation of HI in growing animals needs the partitioning of total HP between a component due to maintenance and a component due to growth. Differences in energy expenditure due to different levels of physical activity between animals have also to be accounted for. The objectives of the paper are to present the methodology developed in our laboratory to calculate HI, using a mathematical model previously described (van Milgen et al.,). Further calculations to standardize HI for difference in physical acitivty between animals are proposed. An experiment in which the energy expenditure was measured in entire male (EM) and castrated pigs is used as an example.",
        "Methods": "    The experiment complied with French laws on animal experimentation and was conducted under the direction of Jean Noblet and Jaap van Milgen, who are both authorized by the French Ministry of Agriculture (n  4739 and 7704).\n\n    The experiment was designed to determine the effects of castration and castration method on nitrogen and energy metabolism of male growing pigs. The experiment was conducted on six groups of three Pietrain x (Large White x Landrace) male pigs that were either surgically castrated (SC), immunocastrated (IC), or kept as EM. Within each group, pigs originated from the same litter (five groups) or had the same father (one group) to reduce possible bias in their energy metabolism induced by difference in their genotype. Measurements consisted in 6 days when fed for measuring nitrogen and energy balances (difference between intake and losses in feces, urine and as CH4 and HP) and 1 day for quantifying fasting HP (FHP) when pigs received no feed. Measurements for IC occurred 5 weeks after the second vaccination when hormonal status of IC pigs was stabilized (Kubale et al.,) and measurements for SC and EM pigs occurred simultaneously or 1 week before because only two respiration chambers were available. During measurements, pigs were placed in a metabolic cage allowing quantitative and separate collection of feces and urine and housed individually in a 12-m3 open-circuit respiration chamber, similar as those described by Vermorel et al.. The temperature and relative humidity in the respiration chambers were kept constant at 24 C and 70%, respectively. The pigs were offered a cereal-based diet ad-libitum into a trough with a trap door (Table 1). A feed hopper placed above the trough ensured that feed was available during the whole day.\n\n    Pigs were weighed on the morning of the first day of measurements, on the morning of the fasting day and on the morning after the fasting day. The amount of feed offered was recorded daily and feed refusals and spillages were collected at the end of the 6 fed days. Offered feed was sampled daily for each week of measurements. At the end of each week, feces from each pig were weighed, mixed, and sampled. Urine was weighed daily and a daily aliquot was cumulated over the 6 days of the fed period for each pig. Ammonia losses that resulted from the degradation of urinary nitrogen were recovered from the condensed water from the air conditioning system while ammonia losses in outgoing air were determined as described by Noblet et al..\n\n    According to the open-circuit respiration chamber technique, volumes of O2 consumption and CO2 and CH4 production were calculated from ventilation rate of the respiration chamber and from the difference in gas concentrations between outgoing and ingoing air. The O2, CO2, and CH4 concentrations in outgoing air were measured using a paramagnetic differential analyzer (Oxymat 6, Siemens) and two infrared analyzers (Ultramat 6, Siemens), respectively. The ventilation rate was measured with a mass gas meter (Teledyne Brown Engineering). Gas concentrations, ventilation rate and physical characteristics of the gas in the respiration chamber (pressure, temperature, and relative humidity) were measured 60 times per second, averaged over 10-s intervals and recorded for further calculations. Each day, access to the feeder was blocked at 6.00 am and measurements were stopped at 8.00 am for ~15 min to provide care to the animals, refill the feeders, collect feces and urine and calibrate the analyzers with ingoing air as baseline and a gas tube with known gas concentrations as standard. Measurements then restarted and access to feeder was allowed at 9.00 am.\n\n    Feeding behavior was recorded continuously using a weighing scale that was placed under the trough. Standing duration was recorded through interruption of an infra-red beam that was placed across the cage at the height of the pig's hip. The mechanical force the pig exerted because of physical activity was recorded using four force sensors (9104A, Kistler) on which the cage was placed. The sensors are transducers that produce an electrical signal proportional to the vertical force the animal exerts on the cage (Quiniou et al.,).\n\n    Feed samples and feed refusals were analyzed weekly for dry matter (DM) content. Feed samples were then pooled and analyzed for DM, nitrogen (Dumas method) and energy contents (AOAC,; AFNOR,). One sample of feces per pig was analyzed for DM content and one sample was freeze-dried. Freeze-dried feces samples were ground through a 1 mm grid and analyzed for DM, nitrogen (Dumas method) and energy contents. Nitrogen content of urine was measured on fresh material according to the Dumas method and energy content was measured after freeze-drying approximately 30 mL of urine in polyethylene bags (AFNOR,).\n\n    Gas analyzers were calibrated at the beginning and at the end of each day and the drift was considered to be linear. The time lag between respiration chamber and gas analyzers equaled 70 s. Taking into account the effect of respiratory quotient (RQ, CO2/O2) on difference between inflow and outflow (Ortigues et al.,), volumes of O2 consumption and CO2 and CH4 production were calculated for 10-s intervals that were cumulated over the day. To account for the interruption of the measurements in the morning (calibration of analyzers ...), these volumes were standardized for 24-h period, assuming proportionality.\n\n    Nitrogen balance was calculated as the difference between intake (calculated as the difference between offered feed and feed refusals and spillages) and losses in feces and urine and as ammonia. Protein deposition (PD) was then calculated, assuming that PD equaled 6.25 times nitrogen retention. Retained energy (RE) was calculated as the difference between feed gross energy intake and energy losses in feces and urine and as CH4 (39.5 kJ/L of CH4) and HP. According to the Brouwer equation, HP was calculated from volumes of O2 consumption, CO2 production, and CH4 production and nitrogen excreted in urine (including ammonia losses). Fat deposition (FD) was calculated from the energy balance, assuming that energy was retained only as protein (23.6 kJ/g PD) and as fat (39.7 kJ/g FD).\n\n    Total HP was partitioned between components due to basal metabolism FHP, physical activity (AHP) and thermic effect of feeding (TEF, Figure 1) through analysis of the dynamic patterns of O2 and CO2 concentrations in the air of the respiration chamber (van Milgen et al.,). The model assumes that the instantaneous variations in O2 and CO2 concentrations are related to O2 consumption and CO2 production by the pig (sub-model \"animal\"; Figure 2), in addition to variation induced by ventilation of the respiration chamber and variation of physical characteristics of the gas within the respiration chamber (sub-model \"chamber\"). A complete description of the mathematical model is given by van Milgen et al..\n\n    The conception of the model was similar for O2 consumption and CO2 production. During the fed days, the sub-model \"animal\" considered that instantaneous O2 consumption or CO2 production (in standard conditions of temperature and pressure: 0 C and 1 atm) equaled the sum of O2 consumption or CO2 production due to physical activity and short-term TEF (TEFs), in addition to constant O2 consumption or CO2 production associated with resting metabolism (VOFED and VCFED, respectively; Figure 2). It was hypothesized that O2 consumption or CO2 production due to physical activity was proportional to the electrical signal from force sensors with different parameters for O2 and CO2 (VOFOR and VCFOR, respectively). The O2 consumption or CO2 production due to TEFs followed a gamma distribution. The latter was modeled as the output of a two-compartment system, which was filled in the first compartment by feed intake (recorded by the weighing scale placed under the trough) and parameterized by the volume of O2 consumed or CO2 produced per g of feed intake (O2TEF and CO2TEF, respectively) and by mean time between feed intake and its related O2 consumption or CO2 production (TTEF). Mathematically, the content of each compartment was modeled from its first-order derivative with respect to time and fractional emptying rates were assumed to be identical for both compartments (2/TTEF; van Milgen et al.,). In addition to these well-identified contributors to O2 consumption and CO2 production, early experiments indicated that modest and time-limited variations in O2 and CO2 concentrations in the respiration chamber can occur irrespective of feed intake or physical activity (van Milgen and Noblet,). Although the contribution of these phenomena to the total volumes of O2 consumption or CO2 production is small (<0.5%), they can affect the estimates of parameters of the model when not accounted for. These events were manually included in the model to ensure proper parameter estimation as instantaneous O2 consumption and CO2 production. During the fasting day, there is no feed intake. However, O2 consumption or CO2 production during resting (when the contribution of physical activity was removed) are lower during fasting than when fed. The decline in O2 consumption or CO2 production was described as a first-order decline between O2 consumption or CO2 production at a fed state (VOFED and VCFED, respectively) and O2 consumption or CO2 production during fasting (VOFAST and VCFAST, respectively). It was hypothesized that the rate of decline (TOADAP and TCADAP, respectively) may be different for O2 and CO2. Finally, the sub-model \"animal\" allowed calculating O2 consumption and CO2 production using feed intake and signals from the force sensors as inputs and seven parameters for the fed days and eight parameters for the fasting day.\n\n    The sub-model \"chamber\" described the variation in physical characteristics of the gas and considered that the air in the respiration chamber was composed of O2, CO2, and N2. Because only the flow of outgoing air was measured, the inflow was calculated as the flow of air required to fill the physical volume of the respiration chamber when O2 consumption, CO2 production and outflow were considered; the physical volume of the respiration chamber was calculated in standard conditions of temperature and pressure (0 C, 1 atm). The concentration of each gas in the respiration chamber was then calculated from its volume divided by the sum of volumes of O2, CO2, and N2.\n\n    Equations of the model were written in Fortran and compiled in a dynamic linked library that was loaded in R (R Development Core Team,). Package deSolve (Soetaert et al.,) was used to solve the ordinary differential equations with an integration step-size of 10 s, after smoothing the data from force sensors, temperature, pressure and outflow to ensure their continuity. Parameters of the model were estimated for each day according to a three-step procedure: parameters directly related to O2 consumption or CO2 production were first estimated separately and then together to minimize the sum of squared differences between predicted O2 or CO2 concentration and measured O2 or CO2 concentrations (Nelder and Mead,).\n\n    Energy expenditure due to fasting metabolism, physical activity and TEFs were calculated from the respective volumes of O2 consumption and CO2 production according to the Brouwer equation. The difference between resting HP when fed (i.e., total HP minus AHP and TEFs) and FHP was attributed to long-term TEF (TEFl) and total TEF was calculated as the sum of short- and long-term components.\n\n    Preliminary analysis on data indicated that correlation between AHP and ME intake was significant (r = 0.56, P < 0.05; Table 2). To standardize HP between animals for difference in their physical activity, it was assumed that a fixed amount of metabolizable energy (ME) intake should be dissipated as corrected AHP (AHPc). The proportion of ME intake that was dissipated as HP due to physical activity equaled the mean value of AHP/ME (8.6%; see results). When AHP was higher than AHPc, the difference between AHP and AHPc resulted in a positive variation of ME available for other metabolic pathways, which was dissipated as TEF or retained as fat. The amount which was dissipated as supplementary TEF was calculated as: (AHP:AHPc) x TEF / (ME:FHP:AHP) and was added to TEF to calculate a corrected TEF (TEFc). The difference between AHP and AHPc which was not dissipated as supplementary TEF was added to RE to calculate corrected RE (REc) and FD (FDc). When AHP was lower than AHPc, the standardization followed the same calculation routine but resulted in lower TEFc, REc and FDc than TEF, RE, and FD, respectively. Assuming that FHP is representative of the basal metabolic rate of ad-libitum fed animals (Baker et al.,), HI was calculated as the sum of AHPc and TEFc. The efficiency of utilizing ME for maintenance and growth (kmg, %) was calculated as (1-HI/ME) x 100. Maintenance ME requirements (MEm) were calculated as FHP x 100/kmg (Labussiere et al.,). All energy traits were expressed relative to metabolic body size, which was calculated as body weight (BW) raised to the power 0.60 (Noblet et al.,).\n\n    The NE intake was calculated as the difference between ME intake and HI. The energy values of the diet (ME and NE contents) were calculated as the ratio between ME or NE intake (MJ/day) and feed intake.\n\n    One FHP value was missing for a SC pig in group 2 and it was calculated (kJ/kg BW0.60 per day) as the average of the values obtained for the SC in the five other groups. The data (n = 18) were analyzed for the effects of sex (EM, SC, IC) and group using the PROC GLM of SAS (SAS,). Only the P-values for the effect of sex will be described in details. Pearson correlation coefficients between time spent standing, mean voltage measured from force sensors, ME intake, AHP and AHP/ME ratio were calculated (PROC CORR; SAS,). The linear relationship between AHP (% of ME intake) and the mean voltage from force sensors (mV/day) was tested and the difference of the slope from zero was tested through a T-test (PROC GLM; SAS,). The linear relationship between corrected HPc (HPc) (kJ/kg BW0.60 per day) and ME intake (kJ/kg BW0.60 per day) was tested for the effect of sex on intercept and slope of the relationship (PROC GLM; SAS,).",
        "Results": "    The BW of the pigs did not differ between sexes and averaged 115 kg during measurements (Table 3). Voluntary ME intake varied significantly between 2396 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day for EM pigs to 2864 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day for IC pigs. There was no effect of sex on time spent standing that averaged 1.4 h/day but individual values varied from 0.9 to 2.0 h/day (Figure 3). The force the animals exerted on the floor (mean voltage measured from force sensors) varied from 1.6 to 4.0 mV/day (Figure 4) and it was significantly correlated with ME intake, AHP and AHP/ME intake (Table 2). The AHP did not differ significantly between sexes (Table 3) but it was significantly correlated with ME intake (Table 2). When expressed as a percentage of ME intake, AHP was not affected by sex and averaged 8.6% (Table 3). Additionally, it was significantly correlated with mean voltage from force sensors (Table 2).\n\n    Total HPc tended to vary according to the same pattern as ME intake from 1376 to 1519 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day (P = 0.06; Table 3). The relationship between HPc and ME intake did not differ significantly between sexes; the intercept equaled 554 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day and the slope equaled 34%. Among HPc components, FHP was significantly higher for EM pigs (856 vs. 761 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day on average for castrated pigs) whereas TEFc was significantly lower for EM pigs (315 vs. 474 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day or 13.0 vs. 17.2% of ME intake on average for castrated pigs). When HP due to physical activity was corrected for the differences between animals, HI was significantly lower in EM pigs than in castrated pigs (522 vs. 712 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day, on average). Variations in ME intake and energy expenditure resulted in lower REc in EM than in castrated pigs (1020 vs. 2562 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day, on average). Additionally, inefficiency of utilizing ME for maintenance and growth (i.e., HIc expressed as % of ME intake) was significantly lower in EM than in castrated pigs (21.6 vs. 25.9%, on average for castrated pigs). Maintenance ME requirements varied among pigs and ranged from 997 for SC pigs to 1091 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day for EM pigs. The RQ was significantly lower in EM pigs than in castrated pigs, irrespective of castration method (1.08 vs. 1.15). Dietary ME content tended to vary between 15.13 in IC pigs to 15.41 MJ/kg DM in EM pigs. The NE content of the diet was significantly higher for EM pigs (12.02 vs. 11.34 MJ/kg DM on average for castrated pigs).\n\n    The BW gain was calculated from BW measured at the beginning and at the end of the 6 days of balance measurement; it did not differ between sexes and averaged 1273 g/day (Table 4). From balance measurements, PD was significantly lower for SC pigs (196 vs. 254 g/day on average for EM and IC pigs) whereas FDc was significantly lower for EM pigs (288 vs. 429 g/day on average for SC and IC pigs). Accordingly, the FDc content of BW gain was lower for EM pigs whereas the PD content of BW gain did not differ significantly between sexes and averaged 234 g/day.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    The evaluation of the energy value of feedstuffs and feeds requires estimating the efficiency of energy utilization of nutrient utilization by animals. In growing animals, theoretical calculations involve the artificial distinction between energy use for maintenance and for growth and require several assumptions regarding metabolic pathways and composition of BW gain (protein and lipid deposition, protein and lipid turnover, fatty acid composition of de novo lipid synthesis). Additionally, these calculations do not account for the energy costs associated with ingestion and digestion of feed. Alternatively, calorimetry measurements in living animals allow estimating an overall efficiency of utilizing dietary energy for maintenance and growth and they include the associated energy costs. In this paper, efficiency was calculated from the inefficiency due to TEF and AHP. Nevertheless, it could be biased by differences in physical activity among animals (i.e., social confinement, reduced physical activity because of contention).\n\n    Several methods have been used in the past to quantify physical activity and to link physical activity to energy expenditure. In pigs, these methods have been based on regression analyses between HP and time budget that was determined using infrared barriers (e.g., Noblet et al.,) or video recordings (e.g., Rijnen et al.,) but these methods do not allow quantifying the level of physical activity (i.e., the mechanical force and the associated efficiency the animal develops because of its physical activity). In this way, results from our experiment indicate that the time the animals spent standing has little effect on AHP (Figure 3). Indeed, the time the pig was standing was measured through an infra-red barrier, which was placed across the cage at the height of the pig's hip. Consequently, standing also included other activities like sitting, rubbing, walking (only to small extent because of the cage), or digging. The quantification of physical activity requires measuring traits which are thought to be proportional to the mechanical force which is exerted by the animal. Indeed, ultrasonic burglars were used in pigs (e.g., Schrama et al.,) and more recently, accelerometers have been proposed to measure physical activity in rodents and humans. Nevertheless, these measurements may be subject to errors in estimating accurately physical activity of large animals because measured values can be specific to a given physical activity. The consequence is that measured values can be less representative of the physical activity of the whole body, depending on the position of the ultrasonographic burglar devices relative to the body of the animal, or the position of the accelerometer on the body of the animal. In our experiments and in others (e.g., Even et al.,), the cage where the animals were housed was located on force transducers that are sensors that produce an electrical signal proportional to the force the animal exerts on the floor. The partitioning of total HP to determine what is due to physical activity then requires estimating the amount of energy expenditure per unit of electrical signal from force sensors and involves parameter optimization through mathematical modeling. Using the signals from force transducers, the latter has been performed through Kalman filtering (Kalman,; Even et al.,) or Nelder-Mead minimization (Nelder and Mead,; van Milgen et al.,). In our approach, parameter optimization includes also the determination of energy cost associated with TEF and resting metabolism. In this paper, the determination coefficient of the variations in gas concentrations by the mathematical model averaged 92% over the 126 days that were modeled (18 pigs with 7 days each). Nevertheless, the model considers that each unit of electrical signal from force transducers corresponds to a fixed volume of consumed O2 and produced CO2 and does not account for the metabolic difference in muscles involved in physical activity between standing and lying.\n\n    Growing animals produce heat because of their maintenance and growing metabolism. Classically, the slope of the relationship between HPc and ME intake (34% in our experiment) was considered as an estimate of the inefficiency of utilizing dietary energy but this approach has been questioned because of the adaptation of animal to feeding level (de Lange et al.,; Labussiere et al.,). In the modelling approach for partitioning HP, AHP and TEF are indicative for the inefficiency in utilizing dietary energy whereas FHP is indicative of the basal metabolic rate of animals (Labussiere et al.,). This inefficiency varied from 22% in EMs to 26% in castrated pigs which agrees with previous results (Labussiere et al.,). These values were also lower than those estimated from the classical regression between HPc and ME intake but they were associated with higher values of maintenance energy requirements (Labussiere et al.,).\n\n    Irrespective of castration method, AHP accounted for 8.6% of ME intake, which agrees with previous observations in growing pigs fed close to ad-libitum (from 7.6 to 11.6% of ME intake; Schrama et al.,; Le Bellego et al.,; Quiniou et al.,; van den Borne et al.,; Labussiere et al.,; Renaudeau et al.,) but values were highly variable between animals (Figure 3). To account for the possible bias induced by the variation in AHP between animals, a calculation routine was used to standardize AHP between animals, which resulted in variations in TEFc and REc. In our experiment, TEFc was higher in SC and IC pigs than in EM (Table 3). Values for SC or IC pigs agree with previous results in SC pigs which received a similar diet (16.8% of ME intake; Barea et al.,). Data for TEFc in EM pigs are scarce but the differences in TEFc between EMs and castrated pigs agree with the differences in metabolism of nutrients due to lower feed intake, higher PD and lower lipid deposition that result in a lower RQ in EM pigs. Indeed, theoretical calculations for energy efficiencies for lipid deposition are always lower when the energy is provided by proteins rather than by carbohydrates or lipids (Armstrong,). Calculations using diet composition and the difference between digested N and N deposited in PD (Table 4) indicate that dietary protein contributed to 13% in EM and 18% in SC of the energy used for maintenance and lipid deposition, which agrees with the lower TEFc in EM pigs. Consequently, dietary NE content, which is thought to be representative of the true energy value of the diet, depended on the sexual type of the animal and it was higher in EM pigs (Table 3).\n\n    During the fasting day, the mathematical modeling of HP was considered to occur according a first-order decrease in energy metabolism between fed and fasted states. The FHP was calculated as the asymptotic value of resting HP (van Milgen et al.,). These values of FHP exclude the energy expenditure due to physical activity and the values for SC pigs agree with values previously estimated using a similar methodology (711 to 846 kJ/kg BW0.60 per day; Le Bellego et al.,; Le Goff et al.,; Lovatto et al.,; Barea et al.,; Labussiere et al.,). According to previous results with growing pigs (van Milgen et al.,), FHP of EM pigs was higher than that of castrated pigs (Table 3). This result agrees with the greater mass of viscera in EM than in SC (Quiniou and Noblet,), which influences FHP (Koong et al.,; Pekas and Wray,) because of the greater energy requirements of the portal-drained viscera (Johnson et al.,; Ortigues et al.,). Estimating FHP allows determining MEm in growing animals as the ratio between FHP and kmg (Labussiere et al.,) without involving the classical regression analyses between RE and ME intake (Kielanowski,; Baldwin,). The classical regression analysis has been criticized because of the adaptation of the animal to feeding level (de Lange et al.,; Labussiere et al.,). In our experiment, MEm was higher in EM than in SC pigs, which disagrees with previous results (Noblet et al.,). Nevertheless, the latter values were calculated from the classical regression methods and were obtained with pigs at lower BW (i.e., younger) than those in the present study. The difference in energy metabolism between entire and castrated males may be less pronounced because of less advanced sexual maturity.\n\n    In conclusion, mathematical modeling of daily dynamics of HP and accounting for the variation in physical activity among animals allows calculating the energy expenditure due to physical activity and TEF, in addition to the HP due to basal metabolic rate. In growing animals, the energy utilization of the diet depends on metabolic pathways involved in maintenance and lipid deposition, according to the nutrients that are used. Consequently, the dietary NE content depends on the sexual type of growing animals.\n\n    The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.",

        "Title": "    Brg1 Is Required for Cdx2-Mediated Repression of Oct4 Expression in Mouse Blastocysts",
        "Abstract": "    During blastocyst formation the segregation of the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm is governed by the mutually antagonistic effects of the transcription factors Oct4 and Cdx2. Evidence indicates that suppression of Oct4 expression in the trophectoderm is mediated by Cdx2. Nonetheless, the underlying epigenetic modifiers required for Cdx2-dependent repression of Oct4 are largely unknown. Here we show that the chromatin remodeling protein Brg1 is required for Cdx2-mediated repression of Oct4 expression in mouse blastocysts. By employing a combination of RNA interference (RNAi) and gene expression analysis we found that both Brg1 Knockdown (KD) and Cdx2 KD blastocysts exhibit widespread expression of Oct4 in the trophectoderm. Interestingly, in Brg1 KD blastocysts and Cdx2 KD blastocysts, the expression of Cdx2 and Brg1 is unchanged, respectively. To address whether Brg1 cooperates with Cdx2 to repress Oct4 transcription in the developing trophectoderm, we utilized preimplantation embryos, trophoblast stem (TS) cells and Cdx2-inducible embryonic stem (ES) cells as model systems. We found that: (1) combined knockdown (KD) of Brg1 and Cdx2 levels in blastocysts resulted in increased levels of Oct4 transcripts compared to KD of Brg1 or Cdx2 alone, (2) endogenous Brg1 co-immunoprecipitated with Cdx2 in TS cell extracts, (3) in blastocysts Brg1 and Cdx2 co-localize in trophectoderm nuclei and (4) in Cdx2-induced ES cells Brg1 and Cdx2 are recruited to the Oct4 promoter. Lastly, to determine how Brg1 may induce epigenetic silencing of the Oct4 gene, we evaluated CpG methylation at the Oct4 promoter in the trophectoderm of Brg1 KD blastocysts. This analysis revealed that Brg1-dependent repression of Oct4 expression is independent of DNA methylation at the blastocyst stage. In toto, these results demonstrate that Brg1 cooperates with Cdx2 to repress Oct4 expression in the developing trophectoderm to ensure normal development.",
        "Introduction": "    The first cell-fate decision in the preimplantation embryo, the differentiation of the ICM and trophectoderm, is regulated by the transcription factors Oct4 and Cdx2. Initially, both Oct4 and Cdx2 are widely expressed. However, during blastocyst formation Oct4 expression is restricted to the ICM and Cdx2 expression is confined to the trophectoderm. Evidence indicates that suppression of Oct4 in the trophectoderm is mediated by the inhibitory actions of Cdx2. For example, loss of Cdx2 in early mouse embryos results in developmental arrest around the blastocyst stage and widespread expression of Oct4 in the trophectoderm. Furthermore, forced expression of Cdx2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells induces Oct4 repression via Cdx2 binding to the autoregulatory element (ARE) in the Oct4 promoter resulting in a trophectoderm cell-fate. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of Cdx2 in repression of Oct4 expression in the developing trophectoderm.\n\n    While much has been learned about the sequence of morphological and molecular events that lead up to segregation of the ICM and trophectoderm lineages, less is known about the epigenetic processes that facilitate Oct4 repression in the blastocyst trophectoderm. Brahma related gene 1 (Brg1)-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes represent a subclass of SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) ATP-dependent remodelers that play key roles in embryo development and cellular differentiation. In the nucleus Brg1 and Brg1 associated factors (BAFs) are recruited to target gene promoters via tissue-specific transcription factors to regulate transcription. Previously, we identified an important role for Brg1 in blastocyst development and ES cell pluripotency. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown (KD) of Brg1 in early mouse embryos results in developmental arrest at the blastocyst stage, defects in the trophectoderm, and failure to repress Oct4 and Nanog transcription. Furthermore, utilizing genome-wide location analysis we and others showed that Oct4 and Nanog are direct targets of Brg1 in ES cells. Consistent with these findings Brg1 and BAF155 are required for the repression of pluripotency genes in differentiating ES cells. Altogether, these findings suggest that Brg1 plays a critical role around the blastocyst stage when the first cellular lineages are established.\n\n    Here we report that Brg1 is an essential co-repressor required for Cdx2-mediated silencing of Oct4 expression in the trophectoderm. We found that Brg1 and Cdx2 interact at the chromatin level to repress Oct4 transcription in blastocysts. These findings point to a novel role for Brg1 in transcriptional regulation of key Cdx2 target genes in the developing trophectoderm to ensure normal embryo development.",
        "Methods": "    B6D2/F1 female mice aged 6-8 weeks (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were superovulated as previously described and mated with B6D2/F1 males. Fertilized one-cell embryos were collected in M2 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), washed, and cultured in potassium simplex optimized medium (KSOM) with amino acids (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ). Microinjections were carried out as described previously. In brief, 5-10 pL of 100 microM Brg1, Cdx2, or control siRNA (siGenome; Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO) was injected into the cytoplasm of one-cell embryos using a PL100 picoinjector (Harvard Apparatus, Hollistan, MA). Following injection, embryos were cultured in KSOM for 2 to 4 days depending on the experiment. Outgrowth analysis was carried out on day 4 blastocysts by removing zona pellucidae with acid Tyrode (Sigma-Aldrich), washing in M2 medium, and culturing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1,000 U/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). After 96 hours the percentage of blastocysts that attached and underwent outgrowth was calculated. All animals were treated in accordance with Institution Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under current approved protocols at Michigan State University.\n\n    R1 ES cells were, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were cultured on mitomycin-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in medium containing high-glucose DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS), LIF, L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, beta-mercaptoethanol. Cdx2-inducible ES cells were kindly provided by Dr. Minoru Ko. These cells were cultured on mitomycin-treated puromycin resistant MEFs in ES cell medium supplemented with 0.2 microg/ml of doxycycline and 1.0 microg/ml of puromycin. Prior to Cdx2-induction cells were switched onto gelatin and cultured in the presence of 1.5 microg/ml of puromycin for 3 days. Transgene expression was induced by removal of doxycycline and was verified by Western blot using a Flag antibody (F3165; Sigma- Aldrich). Cdx2 expression was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using a Cdx2 antibody (CDX2-88; Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). TS cells were derived from day 4 blastocysts as described by Rossant and co-workers. TS cells were cultured on mitomycin-treated MEFs in RPMI medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, beta-mercaptoethanol, fibroblast growth factor 4(FGF4), and Heparin. Two to 3 days before harvesting for biochemical assays they were switched onto gelatin coated plates, minimizing contamination by MEFs.\n\n    Brg1 KD and control embryos were transferred into a 1.5-mL tube in ~1 microL of M2 medium and immediately stored at -80 C until used. Total RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA isolation Kit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Prior to RNA isolation, 2 ng of RNA encoding GFP was added to each sample to act as a carrier. Isolated RNA was then subjected to a single round of cDNA synthesis, and final volume was adjusted so that 1 microL was equivalent to an embryo. qRT-PCR analysis was carried out as described previously using TaqMan probes and an ABI 7500 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All qRT-PCR experiments were carried out using a total of 3 to 6 biological replicates.\n\n    ICC analysis of preimplantation embryos and Cdx2-Inducible ES cells was performed as previously described, with slight modifications. Briefly, embryos or stem cells were fixed, permeabilized, washed, blocked, and incubated in a 1/100 dilution of antibodies for Oct4 (ab19857; abcam, Cambridge, MA), Cdx2 (CDX2-88; Biogenex), or Brg1 overnight at 4 C. The following day embryos or stem cells were washed 3 times in block solution. For secondary detection, samples were incubated in a 1/1,000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and imaged using a spinning disc confocal module (CARV; Atto Bioscience, Rockville, MD) with Metamorph software.\n\n    For immunoprecipitation of Brg1, approximately 2 mg of TS cell lysate (200 microl) was diluted to 500 microl in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES,150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% tween 20) containing protease inhibitors and incubated with 12 microl of Brg1 rabbit anti-serum or equivalent amount of rabbit IgG overnight at 4 C. Following overnight incubation stable complexes were affinity purified by incubation with 50 microl of Protein-G Fast Flow agarose beads (Millipore) for 4 hours at 4 C. Beads bound to immunoprecipitated complexes were washed once in lysis buffer and twice in PBS. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2X Laemmli buffer and size fractionated using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. CDX2 was detected by Western blot analysis using an affinity purified rabbit anti-CDX2 antibody (A300-692A, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc). In order to avoid intervening signal from immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, HRP-conjugated Protein A (Zymed, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for Western blot detection instead of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.\n\n    Cdx2-inducible ES cells were harvested and chemically crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 19 hours at 4 C. We previously determined that these fixation conditions work excellent for Brg1 ChIP. Cells were pelleted, washed with PBS and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer. Cells were sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 450D (Branson, Danbury, CT, http://www.sonifer.com) at 50% amplitude, with 6 1-minute pulses in ice water. Postsonication, samples were centrifuged and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sonicated cell extracts equivalent to 2.5x106 cells were used in subsequent immunoprecipitations. Samples were precleared with protein G Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Carlsbad, CA, http://www.invitrogen.com/dynal) in 1 ml of dilution buffer. Cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 C with 5 microL of Brg1 rabbit anti-serum, 2 microg of rabbit anti-Flag (F7425, Sigma-Aldrich), or 2 microg of rabbit non-specific IgG (Millipore). Chromatin antibody complexes were isolated with 50 microL of protein G Dynabeads and washed one time with low-salt buffer, one time with high-salt buffer, one time with LiCl wash buffer, and twice with TE buffer. Protein/DNA complexes were eluted from the beads at 65 C with occasional vortexing. Crosslinking was reversed by addition of NaCl and incubation overnight at 65 C. Extracts were then treated with RNase A and proteinase K, and DNA was purified using an Upstate EZ ChIP kit (Millipore). qRT-PCR was performed on Brg1 ChIP DNA, Flag-Cdx2 ChIP DNA, Input DNA and IgG control DNA using SYBR Green Master Mix reagents with an ABI 7500 sequence detection system. The following primer pair was used to analyze the Oct4 ARE region: forward 5'-TGAACTGTGGTGGAGAGTGC-3' and reverse 5'-AGGAAGGGCTAGGACGAGAG-3'. Negative control primers for an intergenic region were the following: forward 5'-TTTTCAGTTCACACATATAAAGCAGA-3' and reverse 5'-TGTTGTTGTTGTTGCTTCACTG-3'.\n\n    The trophectoderm of day 4 and day 4.5 blastocysts (control and Brg1 KD) was isolated by laser dissection using a 40X laser objective lens and controller (Hamilton Throne Bioscience, Beverly, MA). A total of 10 to 15 isolated trophectoderm from each time point were pooled (~400 cells), and stored at -80 C for future use. A total of 5 to 7 ES cell or TS cell colonies were isolated, and stored at -80 C. Extraction of genomic DNA and bisulfite mutagenesis sequencing analysis were conducted using the ReadyAmp Genomic Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After bisulfite mutation, DNA was eluted in 20 microL of elution buffer, and subjected 2 successive rounds of PCR amplification (35 cycles each) using primer pairs for the Oct4 Promoter. For the proximal enhancer we used the following outer and inner primer pairs: outer forward primer, 5'-TTTGTAGATAGGTATTTTGAGGGT-3' and outer reverse primer, 5'-ACAAAACTTCCCCAACTCTCCACC-3'; inner forward primer, 5'-GGGATTTTTAGATTGGGTTTAGAAA-3' and inner reverse primer, 5'- CTCCTCAAAAACAAAACCTCAAATA-3'. For the proximal promoter we used an outer forward primer, 5'-GGTTTTTAGGTGGGTTTGGAATC-3' and outer reverse primer, 5'-CAACCAAATCCCTTCACTTACCT-3'; inner forward primer, 5'-AGAGGTATTGGGGATTTTTTTATGT-3' and inner reverse primer, '5-AAAATTAATTCCACCTTCTCCAACT-3'. PCR products were verified by running on a 2% agarose gel. Then, PCR products were ligated into the pTOPO 10 vector system (Invitrogen) and 10 to 12 clones were randomly picked for sequencing. A total of two biological replicates were analyzed.\n\n    Data from qRT-PCR and DNA methylation experiments were analyzed by SAS software (version 9.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A student's t-test was used to determine statistical differences between groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.",
        "Results": "    Recently, we detected higher amounts of Oct4 transcripts in Brg1 depleted blastocysts compared to control blastocysts. To further assess the potential role of Brg1 in Oct4 regulation, we examined the temporal and spatial expression of Oct4 during blastocyst formation. In addition, we evaluated the expression of the homeobox gene Cdx2, a negative regulator of Oct4 transcription in mouse blastocysts. To accomplish this we microinjected fertilized 1-cell embryos with Brg1 siRNA or control siRNA and cultured them to the 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages. The siRNAs utilized in this study are the same siRNAs described previously; they induce specific ablation of Brg1 transcripts in mouse embryos and phenocopy Brg1 null embryos. A combination of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) was used to examine the expression of Oct4 and Cdx2. At the 8-cell and morula stages we did not detect any differences in the expression or localization of Oct4 and Cdx2 in Brg1 knockdown (KD) versus control embryos (Figure 1A and B; p>0.05). In contrast, at the blastocyst stage, we observed a significant increase in Oct4 mRNA (Figure 1A; p<0.05) and widespread expression of Oct4 protein in Brg1 KD embryos versus control embryos (Figure 1B). Interestingly, the levels of Cdx2 transcripts in Brg1 KD and control blastocysts were similar (Figure 1A; p>0.05), suggesting that the Cdx2 gene itself is not a transcriptional target of Brg1 in blastocysts.\n\n    To further explore the relationship between Brg1 and Oct4 transcription we microinjected various concentrations of Brg1 siRNA (0, 0.1, 1.0, 100 microM) into 1-cell embryos to generate a series of day 4 blastocysts with different amounts of Brg1. We reasoned that if Brg1 is a direct repressor of the Oct4 gene there should be a dose dependency of Brg1 siRNA on Oct4 mRNA expression. qRT-PCR was used to measure the levels of Brg1 and Oct4 transcripts in Brg1 KD blastocysts. Interestingly, we observed an inverse relationship between Brg1 levels and Oct4 expression (Figure 1C). As the levels of Brg1 decreased there was a steady increase in Oct4 mRNA. Altogether, these findings indicate that Brg1 regulates Oct4 expression in a dose dependent manner and is critical for regulation of Oct4 transcription at the blastocyst stage.\n\n    Since Cdx2 is a direct repressor of Oct4 transcription in the trophectoderm, we examined the precise expression and localization of Cdx2 and Oct4 in Brg1 KD blastocysts. We reasoned that changes in Cdx2 expression per se could be accountable for misexpression of Oct4 in the trophectoderm. Using confocal microscopy we calculated the average number of Oct4+ (green), Cdx2+ (red), and Oct4 & Cdx2+ cells (yellow) in control blastocysts and Brg1 KD blastocysts. In control blastocysts Oct4 expression was restricted to cells in the ICM and was largely absent in the Cdx2+ trophectoderm cells (Figure 2A a-d; Fig. S1). In contrast, in Brg1 KD blastocysts Oct4 was widely expressed in the Cdx2+ trophectoderm (Figure 2A e-h; Fig. S1). Remarkably, there was no difference in the number of Cdx2+ cells (Figure 2B; 30+-1.6 vs. 32+-4.3; p>0.05) nor the total cell number (Figure 2B; 53+-2.0 vs. 59+-1.2; p>0.05) between Brg1 KD and control blastocysts. On the other hand, there were approximately twice as many Oct4+ cells in Brg1 KD blastocysts compared to control blastocysts (Figure 2B; 35+-1.7 vs. 18+-1.9; p<0.05). Most importantly, there were a higher number of cells that co-expressed Oct4 and Cdx2 in Brg1 KD blastocysts versus control blastocysts (Figure 2B; 20+-1.9 vs. 4+-0.6; p<0.05). Collectively, these results demonstrate that in Brg1 KD blastocysts Oct4 is widely expressed in the trophectoderm and that this phenomenon is not caused by alterations in Cdx2.\n\n    The phenotype of Brg1 KD blastocysts resembled the phenotype previously described for Cdx2 knockout blastocysts. Moreover, the phenotype of Brg1 KD blastocysts is similar to Cdx2 KD blastocysts that were generated via microinjection of Cdx2 siRNA into one-cell embryos (Figure S2). For example, both Brg1 and Cdx2 KD embryos arrest around the blastocyst stage, exhibit defects in the trophectoderm, and have increased expression of Oct4 in the trophectoderm cells. Interestingly, in Cdx2 KD blastocysts the levels of Brg1 mRNA and protein are similar to control blastocysts further demonstrating that Brg1 and Cdx2 do not regulate each other, but may act together to repress Oct4 transcription (Figure S2). Thus, we hypothesized that Brg1 cooperates with Cdx2 to repress Oct4 transcription in the trophectoderm.\n\n    To test this hypothesis we first examined the effect of combined depletion of Brg1 and Cdx2 levels on Oct4 expression in blastocysts. We predicted that loss of the Brg1-Cdx2 interaction would de-repress Oct4 mRNA expression in blastocysts resulting in higher levels of Oct4 transcripts. Accordingly, 1-cell embryos were either microinjected with Brg1 siRNA (group 1), Cdx2 siRNA (group 2), Brg1 siRNA and Cdx2 siRNA (group 3), or control siRNA (group 4) and cultured to the blastocyst stage. Microinjection of Brg1 siRNA, Cdx2 siRNA, or a combination of both induced a similar decrease in Brg1 and Cdx2 transcripts (Figure S3). Microinjection of Brg1 siRNA or Cdx2 siRNA alone resulted in a 2.1+-0.2 and 2.3+-0.5 fold increase in Oct4 mRNA compared to control blastocysts, respectively (Figure 3A; p<0.05). Remarkably, in Brg1 & Cdx2 double KD blastocysts we observed a 4.3+-0.4 fold increase in Oct4 mRNA compared to control blastocysts (Figure 3A; p<0.05). This increase was significantly greater than the levels of Oct4 in Brg1 KD and Cdx2 KD blastocysts alone (Figure 3A; p<0.05). These results suggest that Cdx2 and Brg1 may function additively to repress Oct4 transcription in blastocysts.\n\n    To determine whether Brg1 and Cdx2 associate during trophectoderm development, three sets of experiments were carried out. We first conducted co-immunoprecipitation assays using mouse TS cells as a reference system for the blastocyst trophectoderm. In these experiments, endogenous Brg1 was recovered using a Brg1 rabbit anti-serum and endogenous Cdx2 recovery was measured by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 3B, Cdx2 was indeed enriched in samples recovered from the anti-Brg1 immunoprecipitation relative to reactions performed using a rabbit IgG.\n\n    To further examine whether Brg1 and Cdx2 associate in the trophectoderm confocal immunofluorescence analysis was carried out in blastocysts using Brg1 and Cdx2 antibodies. This analysis revealed that endogenous Brg1 and Cdx2 co-localize within similar nuclear foci in trophectoderm cells (Figure 3C).\n\n    Lastly, we used chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to determine whether Brg1 and Cdx2 are recruited to the Oct4 promoter during trophectoderm formation. To accomplish this we utilized a doxycycline controllable Cdx2-inducible ES cell line as a model system for the developing blastocyst trophectoderm; these ES cells transdifferentiate into TS cells following induction of Cdx2 expression. Previously, Rossant and co-workers demonstrated that Cdx2 is recruited to the ARE of the Oct4 promoter within 24 hours after induction of Cdx2 expression. In preliminary experiments we confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis that Flag-Cdx2 was strongly induced at 24 hours following removal doxycycline (Figure 3D). Moreover, at 24 to 48 hours after induction Oct4 expression was significantly down-regulated in these cells (data not shown). Remarkably, ChIP analysis revealed that both Brg1 and Cdx2 are recruited to the Oct4 ARE at 24 hours following induction of Cdx2 expression (Figure 3E; p<0.05). The recruitment of Brg1 and Cdx2 to the ARE corresponded to when Oct4 became repressed in these cells. Importantly, enrichment of Brg1 and Cdx2 was not observed at a negative control intergenic region (Figure 3E; p>0.05). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that Brg1 and Cdx2 cooperate at the chromatin level to repress Oct4 transcription during trophectoderm development.\n\n    It has been established that Oct4 silencing in TS cells is controlled by epigenetic modifications of chromatin, including DNA methylation. In some cellular contexts, Brg1 represses transcription through recruitment of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to target gene promoters. Thus, we hypothesized that Brg1-mediated repression of the Oct4 expression in blastocysts might involve epigenetic modification events. We decided to test (1) whether the Oct4 gene is repressed via DNA methylation at the blastocyst stage and (2) if disruption of Brg1 influences the methylation status of the Oct4 promoter. To accomplish this we conducted bisulfite-sequencing analysis of genomic regions within the Oct4 proximal enhancer (PE) and proximal promoter (PP) in blastocysts, TS cells, and ES cells. Accordingly, in ES cells the Oct4 PE and PP regions were largely unmethylated consistent with the high levels of Oct4 expression in these cells (Figure 4A I and II). In contrast, in TS cells where Oct4 expression is silenced, the Oct4 promoter was highly methylated in both the PE and PP regions (Figure 4A I and II;P<0.05). We next analyzed the methylation profiles of the trophectoderm of Brg1 KD blastocysts versus control blastocysts. To achieve this we separated the trophectoderm from early blastocysts (day 4.0) and late blastocysts (day 4.5) using laser-mediated dissection and processed them for bisulfite sequencing. First, to confirm that our assay was sensitive enough for smaller pools of embryos we analyzed the differentially methylated region (DMR) of the imprinted Snrpn gene. We found that this region was hemi-methylated in these embryos (data not shown). Interestingly, in the trophectoderm of control blastocysts, irrespective of the stage, the Oct4 PE and PP regions were almost completely unmethylated (Figure 4B). Moreover, in Brg1 KD embryos we did not observe any changes in DNA methylation in the trophectoderm of early or late blastocysts (Figure 4B). No differences in methylation were observed between control blastocysts and Brg1 KD blastocysts (p>0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that Brg1-mediated repression of Oct4 in blastocysts does not require DNA methylation and that other mechanisms are likely important for facilitating Oct4 repression during blastocyst formation.\n\n    We describe herein a novel role for Brg1 and Cdx2 in regulation of Oct4 expression in blastocysts. To date little is known about the repressive function of Brg1 during blastocyst formation and establishment of the first cellular lineages. Moreover, the underlying epigenetic processes responsible for Cdx2-mediated repression of Oct4 in the trophectoderm are largely unknown. Our results in preimplantation embryos and TS cells show that: (I) Brg1 is required for repression of Oct4 expression in the trophectoderm, (II) Brg1 cooperates with Cdx2 to repress Oct4 transcription, and (III) Brg1 does not require DNMT activity to repress Oct4 expression at the blastocyst stage. Therefore, we propose a two-step model to explain the repression of Oct4 transcription in the blastocyst trophectoderm. Firstly, we predict that Brg1 and Cdx2 are recruited to the ARE of the Oct4 promoter during blastocyst formation (Figure 5). This view is supported by our findings in Cdx2-inducible ES cells where we observed a significant enrichment of both Cdx2 and Brg1 at the Oct4 promoter 24 hours after induction of Cdx2. The temporal order in which Brg1 and Cdx2 are recruited to the Oct4 promoter is currently not known. Notably, in some cell-types Brg1 is recruited to target gene promoters via tissue-specific transcription factors. We envision that a similar mechanism may exist in blastocysts. In future experiments we will determine whether the recruitment of Brg1 to the ARE of the Oct4 promoter depends on Cdx2.\n\n    Secondly, we theorize that once at the Oct4 promoter, Brg1 and Cdx2 cooperate to facilitate chromatin remodeling and/or targeting of other co-repressors to induce Oct4 repression (Figure 5). In some cellular contexts Brg1 can associate with HDACs and DNMTs to repress transcription. In the current study we addressed whether DNA methylation was required for Brg1-dependent repression of Oct4 expression in blastocysts. Interestingly, DNA methylation does not appear to be required for the initial repression of Oct4 expression during blastocyst formation. This finding is consistent with another study that showed that the Nanog promoter is largely unmethylated in blastocysts around the time Nanog becomes restricted to the ICM. Conversely, in TS cells Oct4 and Nanog silencing is tightly associated with DNA methylation. This suggests that the silencing of Oct4 gene in the trophectoderm lineage may be facilitated by a series of sequential epigenetic modifications that initiate early on during blastocyst formation and ensue during blastocyst development. We hypothesize that histone modifications such as histone deacetylation are required for the initial repression of Oct4 during blastocyst formation. In support of this notion immunoprecipitation of Cdx2 in Cdx2-inducible ES cell extracts resulted in a significant enrichment of HDAC1/2. Future studies will address whether Brg1 and/or Cdx2 are necessary for the recruitment of HDAC1/2 to the Oct4 promoter during the early stages of trophectoderm development.\n\n    In conclusion, Brg1 is obligatory for Cdx2-mediated repression of Oct4 expression in blastocysts. It is likely that Brg1 is critical for transcriptional regulation of other Cdx2 target genes in the developing embryo. Our results provide a foundation for further examination of these mechanisms.",

        "Title": "    Dualistic Role of BARD1 in Cancer",
        "Abstract": "    BRCA1 Associated RING Domain 1 (BARD1) encodes a protein which interacts with the N-terminal region of BRCA1 in vivo and in vitro. The full length (FL) BARD1 mRNA includes 11 exons and encodes a protein comprising of six domains (N-terminal RING-finger domain, three Ankyrin repeats and two C-terminal BRCT domains) with different functions. Emerging data suggest that BARD1 can have both tumor-suppressor gene and oncogene functions in tumor initiation and progression. Indeed, whereas FL BARD1 protein acts as tumor-suppressor with and without BRCA1 interactions, aberrant splice variants of BARD1 have been detected in various cancers and have been shown to play an oncogenic role. Further evidence for a dualistic role came with the identification of BARD1 as a neuroblastoma predisposition gene in our genome wide association study which has demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in BARD1 can correlate with risk or can protect against cancer based on their association with the expression of FL and splice variants of BARD1. This review is an overview of how BARD1 functions in tumorigenesis with opposite effects in various types of cancer.",
        "Introduction": "    In 1996, Wu et al. in effort to understand the function of BRCA1 they used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that associate with it in vivo. By this analysis the BRCA1-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1) protein was discovered as a binding partner of BRCA1. BARD1 protein is encoded by sequences on chromosome 2q35 and forms a functional heterodimer with BRCA1 through the binding of their RING-finger domains which functions as tumor-suppressor in breast and ovarian cancer. The full length (FL) BARD1 mRNA includes 11 exons and encodes a protein comprising of one N-terminal RING-finger domain, three Ankyrin repeats (ANK) domains and two C-terminal BRCT domains (Figure 1). The recognizable protein motifs of BARD1 are well conserved in mouse, Xenopus laevis, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana, including the RING domain, the three tandem Ankyrin repeats and, to a lesser extent, the two BRCT domains. This complexity of structure indicates that BARD1 could have multiple functions.\n\n    Conditional inactivation of Bard1 in mice induces mammary carcinomas that are indistinguishable from carcinomas induced by conditional knock-out of Brca1, which establishes BARD1 itself as a tumor suppressor. The knock-out of Brca1 and Brca2 genes in mice led to embryonic lethality. Similarly, homozygous disruption of Bard1 in mice results in lethality between embryonic days E7.5 and E8.5, at time when Bard1 but not Brca1 expression is maximal. The phenotype of Bard1 knock-out mice demonstrated that Bard1 is essential for cell viability and maintenance of genome integrity and embryos lethality only after eight days of development could mean that Bard1 deficiency is deleterious to the cells. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that BARD1 mutations are associated with few cases of non-BRCA1/BRCA2-related sporadic breast and ovarian tumors and account for only a small fraction of cases of familial breast cancer overall. Interesting to note, BRCA1 mutations do not immediately result in malignant phenotype but have cumulative effect that is possibly caused by incorrect stoichiometry with interacting proteins.\n\n    The BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer has ubiquitin ligase activity that targets proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, hormone signaling and modulating chromatin structure. Several reports show that BARD1 has an additional BRCA1-independent tumor suppressor function in cancer that is antagonized by the expression of BARD1 isoforms. Briefly, the expression of FL BARD1 (tumor suppressor role) is required for genomic stability and cell cycle control; in cancer initiation and progression the expression of BARD1 isoforms (oncogenes) antagonize FL BARD1 functions and permit uncontrolled proliferation (Figure 1B). In the following review, we have focused on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the dualistic role of BARD1 as oncogene and tumor-suppressor in cancer.\n\n    Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most common causes of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and are associated with a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 50-85% and of ovarian cancer of 15-40%. It is now apparent that mutations of several other genes, such as BARD1, PALB2 (Partner And Localizer Of BRCA2) and BRIP1 (BRCA1 Interacting Protein C-Terminal Helicase 1), contribute to familial breast cancer. BARD1 mutations are expected to account for additional cases of non-BRCA1/2 inherited breast cancer and have been reported in non-BRCA mutated breast cancer families. A recent work has suggested BARD1 as cancer-associated gene in ovarian cancer by a case-control association analysis between 1915 patients and Exome Sequencing Project (ESP, ) and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, ) controls. The authors report a mutation frequency for BARD1 of 0.2% and Odd Ratio of 4.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-12.5). Similar results have been presented by Couch et al. from multigene panel-based clinical testing for pathogenic variants in inherited cancer genes among patients with breast cancer. The case-control association analysis between 38,326 white patients with breast cancer and 26,911 ExAC controls demonstrated an association between pathogenic rare variants in BARD1 with a moderate risk value (Odd Ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-3.63) and a mutation frequency of 0.18%. Thus, most of the published data are consistent with BARD1 involvement in breast and ovarian cancers susceptibility. Indeed, BARD1 is now included on clinical gene panels for testing for susceptibility to these two tumors. However, no recurrent hotspot variant has been identified so far.\n\n    Beyond single nucleotide variants, other types of risk mutations have been found in BARD1 such as splicing mutations and large deletion. Interestingly, Ratajska et al. identified 16 BARD1 mutations in BRCA1/2-negative high-risk breast and/ovarian cancer patients from Poland. Among these mutations, a splice mutation (c.1315-2A > G) resulted in exon 5 skipping and a silent change (c.1977A > G) which altered several exonic splicing enhancer motifs in exon 10 and resulted in a transcript lacking exons 2-9. In a recent study, three BARD1 mutations were identified that alter splicing leading to skipping of exons 5, 8 and 2-9, respectively.\n\n    The Table 1 shows the list of mutations (n = 79) defined as \"Pathogenic\" and \"Likely Pathogenic\" in ClinVar database . Most of mutations are loss-function due to deletion, nonsense or frame shift mutations and are associated with susceptibility to breast cancer (Table 1 and Figure 2). Only one missense mutation is reported even if recent literature reports diverse potential pathogenic missense mutations in BARD1. Moreover, others and we have demonstrated that BARD1 is enriched in rare, potentially pathogenic, germline variants also in neuroblastoma patients. Particularly, the nonsense variant (rs587781948; exon 2), included in ClinVar, has been found in two patients in these two different gene-sequence projects. Based on these observations a curated update of BARD1 mutations in ClinVar database is needed. We also expect that massive sequencing of BARD1 in breast, ovarian cancers, neuroblastoma and other tumors will increase the number of rare pathogenic missense mutations to be inserted into the ClinVar database as \"Pathogenic\". However, these data strongly support the role of tumor-suppressor of BARD1 in different cancers.\n\n    Different copy number variants of BARD1 locus have been found associated with congenital conditions (hypospadias and congenital heart defects: coarctation of aorta and tetralogy of fallot) and developmental phenotypes (Table 1). Neuroblastoma, tetralogy of fallot and coarctation of aorta are related to tissues that origin from neural crest cells. Moreover, literature data report cases of patients with coexisting neuroblastoma and congenital heart defects. In 2004 George et al. demonstrated that congenital heart defects are more common in neuroblastoma patients than in a control group of children with another type of cancer. Another study has demonstrated that depleting frog embryos of BARD1 leads to defective developmental phenotypes (for instance: malformed neural tube and eye structures). Together, these evidences indicate that BARD1 might play a role in early organogenesis; however, additional studies are needed to demonstrate this hypothesis.\n\n    Although variants in protein-coding regions have received the most attention, numerous studies have noted the importance of non-coding variants in cancer. A sequencing of 20 complete genes, including noncoding and flanking sequences, in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients (n = 287) identified a single nucleotide variants in 5' UTR (c.-53G > T; rs143914387) of BARD1 predicted to alter the mRNA structure. Further complete gene sequencing or whole genome sequencing projects are warranted to investigate the contribution of rare non-coding variants of BARD1 in conferring cancer risk.\n\n    Many genome-wide association studies (GWAS), using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based microarray technology, have been conducted in the commonest cancer types and have identified more than 4032 genetic associations (GWAS catalog, date: 21 August 2017), confirming that susceptibility to these diseases is polygenic. We have performed a large GWAS to define the genetic landscape of sporadic neuroblastoma predisposition and have identified common DNA alleles in different genes that are associated significantly with neuroblastoma development. In that GWAS, one of the most significant and robustly replicated association signals that was enriched in the high-risk subset of neuroblastomas resided in the BARD1 locus that is also the only neuroblastoma susceptibility gene validated in Afro-American, Chinese and Spanish individuals. We have demonstrated that, in BARD1 locus, SNPs associated with risk of neuroblastoma correlates with high expression of splice variants of BARD1 and SNPs protecting against neuroblastoma correlates with high expression of FL BARD1. Interestingly, one disease-associated variant (rs6435862) correlates with the expression of an oncogenetically activated isoform, BARD1beta, which has growth-promoting effects in neuroblastoma models potentially through cooperation with the Aurora family of kinases. Furthermore, by performing a fine mapping analysis of BARD1 locus, we have identified additionally functional polymorphisms associated with risk of neuroblastoma and over-expression of FL BARD1. These data strongly suggest that the dual role of BARD1 as oncogene or tumor-suppressor is due to the function of disease-associated variants. Together, these evidences highlight that the risk of neuroblastoma development may be estimated by a specific combination of BARD1 risk genotypes as suggested by the results of a published computational analysis of GWAS-identified neuroblastoma risk loci.\n\n    Recently, the SNP rs7585356 previously associated to neuroblastoma has been found also associated to nephroblastoma, which is the most frequent malignant renal tumor in children. Although the SNP rs7585356 located in 3' UTR of BARD1 may have a role in BARD1 mRNA regulation, additional investigations are needed to validate this genetic association.\n\n    Candidate gene association studies have suggested that the low-frequency variant Cys557Ser (rs28997576) confers risk of single and multiple primary breast cancers in Icelandic and South American populations. However, independent studies failed to replicate that genetic association in Polish, multiethnic, Chinese, Australian individuals. We also failed to validate that genetic association in a case series consisting of 540 high-risk neuroblastoma cases and 1142 controls with European-American origins. These discordant results might be due to population substructure or gene modifiers affecting the role of BARD1 in cancer development.\n\n    Whereas common and rare hereditable variants of BARD1 have been associated with cancer risk, recent high-throughput sequencing studies have found no frequently acquired somatic mutations in tumor tissues. In accord to previous studies, our exome and deep sequencing of 82 clinically aggressive neuroblastomas detected only one somatic acquired mutation. Interestingly, a large whole exome sequencing study on 500 metastatic cancers identified BARD1 among the genes somatically altered at low-frequency and recently BARD1 has been included in the list of Cancer Gene Census in COSMIC database (.). Here we have analyzed all somatic mutations of BARD1 deposited in COSMIC database by using the Cancer-specific High-throughput Annotation of Somatic Mutations (CHASM) tool to distinguish passenger variation events from driver ones across a cohort of tumors and the Variant Effect Scoring Tool (VEST) to identify variants that affect the molecular function of the protein and prioritize them on the basis of the likelihood of their involvement in human disease (Table 2). We confirm that even if pathogenic somatic mutations are relatively infrequent, BARD1 can be considered a cancer driver gene (CHASM gene score = 0.73; CHASM gene p-value = 0.0000004).\n\n    Tumor suppressor functions of BRCA1 are thought to be mediated by the BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in DNA repair and in other essential functions for maintaining genomic stability, as homologous recombination, centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle assembly (Figure 3). Specific functions of BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer will not be dealt with in this paragraph. Although partner of this complex, FL BARD1 initiates or facilitates DNA repair pathways by controlling polyadenylation machinery in BRCA1-independent way through BARD1 binding with mRNA polyadenylation factor cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF1).\n\n    BARD1 expression fluctuates in a cell-cycle dependent manner, with maximal expression levels occurring in mitosis. In mitosis FL BARD1 stability is increased due to phosphorylation by cell-cycle dependent kinase complexes (cyclin A/E-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDK2) within regions required for ubiquitin ligase activity of BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer. Contrary, BRCA1 is mostly expressed during S-phase of cell-cycle. We can speculate that the concomitant expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 in S-phase support the function of BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer and FL BARD1 expression in mitosis supports additional BRCA1-independent functions.\n\n    BRCA1 and BARD1 have specific individual functions due to their interaction with various proteins and the dissociation of heterodimer might be regulated by post-translation protein modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination or PARylation. Cancer-associated BRCA1-independent activities of BARD1 have been reported in various tumor cell lines (Figure 3). An access of monomer BARD1 over BRCA1 has been associated with BRCA1 mutations and with p53-mediated apoptosis. The link between BARD1 and apoptosis has been further highlighted by BARD1 co-immunoprecipitation with p53 in tissues exposed to genotoxic stress. Particularly, the region of BARD1 binding with p53 involves ANK repeats and the region between ANK and BRCT domains in BARD1-C terminal fragment. It is interesting to note that mutations or deletions in TP53 gene are frequent in cancer with BRCA1 mutations. We can speculate that BRCA1 mutated tumors save BARD1 pro-apoptotic functions and additional TP53 mutations may enhance cancer development. Contrary deleterious BARD1 mutations are infrequent in cancer because the cells lose both DNA repair capabilities and pro-apoptotic function. BARD1 is also transcriptionally up-regulated in response to genotoxic stress and in brain after hypoxia suggesting that BARD1 is expressed specifically in tissues undergoing apoptosis.\n\n    BARD1 is involved in transcription factor NF-kappaB pathway. The binding of C-terminal fragment of BARD1 to the ANK repeats domain of BCL3, a NF-kappaB inhibitor in vitro, may affect the correct regulation of NF-kappaB in cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Emerging evidences report the interaction of BARD1 BRCT domain to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and consequent recruitment of BARD1-BRCA1 complex to DNA repair after damage. PAR pathway is particularly interesting because of the promising drugs act on inhibiting PAR polymerizing enzyme (PARP) are more efficient in cells BRCA1 mutated with saved BARD1 tumor suppressor function. Finally, a significant association found between over-expression of FL BARD1 and favorable outcome in colon cancer patients highlighted FL BARD1 function as prognostic factor in cancer.\n\n    BARD1 is characterized by full length and diverse spliced isoforms (Figure 1). Down-regulation of FL BARD1 can have oncogenic effects whereas BARD1 isoforms that lack RING or/and ANK domains are often up-regulated and associated with negative prognosis in breast, ovarian endometrial and lung cancers. Several scientific evidences show that cancer-associated BARD1 isoforms antagonize the functions of FL BARD1 as tumor suppressor and act as a driving force for carcinogenesis.\n\n    BARD1beta and BARD1delta isoforms were first identified in rat spermatocytes and in a highly tumorigenic and resistant to apoptosis rat ovarian cancer cell line NuTu-19. BARD1beta is characterized by lack of exons 2 and 3 and encode to a protein lacking the RING finger and BRCA1 domain interaction. In breast and ovarian cancer an imbalance of FL BARD1 and BARD1beta was observed with BARD1beta dominant negative function. BARD1beta scaffolds Aurora B and BRCA2 at the midbody during telophase and cytokinesis, antagonizing Aurora B ubiquitination and degradation by BARD1-BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. BARD1beta oncogenic driver of tumorigenesis is also supported by GWAS that identified BARD1 as new susceptibility locus in neuroblastoma as mentioned above. BARD1beta depletion in vitro caused genotype-specific inhibition of cell proliferation in neuroblastoma cells, whereas overexpression of BARD1beta led to the transformation of non-malignant murine fibroblast.\n\n    BARD1delta is characterized by deletion of exons 2-6 that encode for the majority of the RING finger and the entirety of the ANK repeats, critical regions for the interaction with BRCA1 and p53; this isoform was detected in many gynecological cancers and in multiple processes of tumorigenesis. In MCF-7 cells, BARD1delta does not stimulate apoptosis due to p53 deficiency; however, its mitochondrial localization suggested a function in regulation of mitochondrial response to tumorigenic stress. Interestingly, BARD1delta specifically binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) antagonizing ERalpha-BARD1 binding and ERalpha degradation. To note, BARD1delta dominant negative of FL BARD1 is temporally and spatially regulated by estrogen signaling in human invasive cytotrophoblasts cells of early pregnancy. Recently, Maxim Pilyugin et al. described BARD1delta antagonizes chromosome and telomere protection function of BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer by binding molecules that confer chromosome integrity. It is likely that BARD1delta confers genomic instability and acquired oncogenic property in absence of cell cycle control, due to p53 deficiency and of chromosome integrity.\n\n    BARD1omega isoform contains only exons 6-11 encoding ANK repeats and BRCT domain. This isoform was found highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in AML cell lines. In vitro BARD1omega overexpression induced multiple mitotic defects like aberrant chromosome alignment at the metaphase and anaphase state, abnormally increased size of nucleus and apoptosis inhibition. These scientific evidences highlight oncogenic proprieties of BARD1omega.",

        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In this review, we summarized the genetic and molecular mechanisms associated to a dualistic role of BARD1 in cancer initiation: tumor suppressor and oncogene. BARD1 shows relatively low frequent mutations in cancer and, even if rare, BARD1 mutations seem to drive malignant transformation. The reduced expression of FL BARD1 due to somatic mutations or predisposition gene silencing variants may be considered the first hit of BARD1 tumor suppressor function. Instead, FL BARD1 loss-of function consequently to aberrant splicing and gain of dominant negative functions is associated with its proto-oncogenic role. Indeed, cancer associated BARD1 isoforms antagonize the functions of FL BARD1 as tumor suppressor and lead to genetic instability, loss of DNA repair and cell cycle control functions and permits uncontrolled proliferation. This antagonist effect is also supported from a more recently published research article that suggests that specific microRNAs, in healthy tissues, maintain an equilibrium of FL BARD1 and isoforms in favor of FL BARD1 instead, in cancer cells, create a disequilibrium in favor of BARD1 isoforms upon epigenetic activation of non-coding BARD1 isoform BARD1 9'L.\n\n    In ClinVar database, beyond deletion, nonsense or frame shift mutations, only one missense mutation of BARD1 is reported as \"Pathogenic\" even if recent literature demonstrates the association of common and rare point mutations with cancer initiation. Thus, further functional investigations of non-coding and coding disease-associated variants are needed in order to verify their role in tumorigenesis and drug response.\n\n    BARD1 might also play a role in early organogenesis and in diseases related to tissues that origin from neural crest cells. In light of these evidences additional studies to explore BARD1 function in cancer and in developmental disorders should be considered in the next future.\n\n    BARD1beta has been identified as an oncogenic driver of high-risk neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and a stabilizer of Aurora family of kinases. This strongly supports the development of potential therapeutic strategy with Aurora kinase inhibitors for clinically aggressive neuroblastoma. Moreover, the switching from FL BARD1 to BARD1beta permits the deregulated turnover of the Aurora kinases. Thus, Aurora and BARD1beta expression levels might be predictive biomarkers for response to Aurora inhibitors.\n\n    Protein PARylation functions as a signal to recruit DNA damage repair proteins like the BARD1-BRCA1 complex to repair Double Strand Breaks (DSBs). BARD1 BRCTs bind ADP-ribose, the basic unit of PAR, at DNA damage sites which mediates the rapid recruitment of BRCA1. PARP inhibition directly suppresses the fast recruitment of the BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer to DNA damage sites and impairs DNA repair. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) selectively kill BRCA1-deficient cells and several PARPi are currently in breast cancer clinical trials. However, the mechanism underlying the sensitivity of the tumor cells bearing BRCA1 mutations that abolish the interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1 to PARPi is not clear. Ovarian and breast cancer patients who harbor BRCA1 mutations develop resistance to both PARPi and platinum therapy. Secondary mutations in BRCA genes as well as gene methylation status for BRCA1, BRCA2 and other genes that control homologous recombination have been examined in patients' biopsies as potential resistance mechanisms. One way to overcome clinical resistance is to investigate as the expression of FL or isoform BARD1 could contribute to the success or failure of PARPi therapy. A recent paper has demonstrated that BARD1beta sensitizes colon cancer cells to poly PARP-1 inhibition even in a FL BARD1 background, thus suggesting that BARD1beta may serve as a future biomarker to assess suitability of colon cancers for homologous recombination targeting with PARPi in treatment of advanced colon cancer. In the future, it will be interesting to evaluate the efficacy of PARPi in patients with loss-of-function mutations of BARD1 that are relatively frequent (Table 1).\n\n    The early detection of cancer is the most important factor contributing to the total eradication of cancer. The over-expression of BARD1 isoforms is strongly correlated with tumor progression, specifically in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Based on these evidences Irminger-Finger et al. have developed a blood test for the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer based on capturing autoimmune antibodies against BARD1 antigens. Additional studies are needed to verify the efficacy of this test in detection of lung cancer and it will be very interesting to extend this experimentation to other cancers such as neuroblastoma, ovarian and breast cancer.",

        "Title": "    How autochthonous microorganisms influence physiological status of Zea mays L. cultivated on heavy metal contaminated soils?",
        "Abstract": "    The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of autochthonous microorganisms present in soil collected from heavy metal (HM) uncontaminated (Pb   59 mg kg-1, Cd   0.4 mg kg-1, Zn   191 mg kg-1), moderately (Pb   343 mg kg-1, Cd   12 mg kg-1, Zn   1876 mg kg-1), and highly (Pb   1586 mg kg-1, Cd   57 mg kg-1, Zn   3280 mg kg-1) contaminated sites on Zea mays elemental composition, physiological status, and growth parameters. For this purpose, half of the collected soil was sterilized and soil characterization was performed. After 45 days of cultivation, the presence of HM in the soil negatively affected photosynthesis and transpiration rates, relative chlorophyll content, anthocyanins index, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and content of oxidative stress products (H2O2 and Malondialdehyde) of Zea mays, while soil sterilization had a positive effect on those parameters. Average percentage of colonization of root segments by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi decreased with an increase of HM contamination in the soil. The increase in shoot concentration of HMs, particularly Cd and Zn, was a result of contaminated soils sterilization. Aboveground biomass of maize cultivated on sterilized soil was 3-fold, 1.5-fold, and 1.5-fold higher for uncontaminated, moderately contaminated and highly contaminated soils respectively when compared to nonsterilized soils. Contrary to our expectation, autochthonous microflora did not improve plant growth and photosynthetic performance; in fact, they had a negative effect on those processes although they did reduce concentration of HMs in the shoots grown on contaminated soils.\n\n    The online version of this article (10.1007/s11356-018-3923-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
        "Introduction": "    The interaction between soil microbes and plant roots has been studied widely. The dynamics of this interaction depend on several factors, such as the physiological characteristics of plants and microorganisms, physicochemical soil properties, and even climatic conditions (Haney et al.; Kohl et al.; Mohite; Pii et al.). Plant associated microorganisms can play an important role in growth and nutritional status improvement (Cabral et al.; Ercoli et al.; Valliere and Allen), as well as in the detoxification of harmful substances and maintenance of soil structure (Sulowicz et al.; Thijs et al.; Watts-Williams et al.). Indigenous microorganisms living on heavy metal-contaminated sites have often adapted well to the presence of these elements, driven by long-term exposure to site-specific stress factors, and these adaptations can provide useful opportunities for bioremediation at such sites (Giller et al.; Oliveira et al.; Touceda-Gonzalez et al.; Vivas et al.; Yu et al.).\n\n    Many authors reported a connection between reduction of dehydrogenase activity and presence of pollutants in soil at high concentrations, which correlates with a decrease in microbial community diversity and biomass (Bacmaga et al.; Wang et al.; Wolinska and Stepniewska).\n\n    An important component in the rhizosphere are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), belonging to the phylum Glomeromycota, which live in symbiosis with 70-90% of plant species (Bonfante and Genre; Bothe et al.; Gianinazzi et al.; Huang et al.; Zhu et al.). Recently, an increasing number of reports have emphasized the role of mycorrhiza in reducing stress reactions associated with environmental pollution by heavy metals (Firmin et al.; Gucwa-Przepiora; Li et al.). AMF associated with plants may contribute to the accumulation of heavy metals in roots in a nontoxic form inside hyphal cell walls or bind them into phosphate compounds inside the fungal cells (Andrade and da Silveira).\n\n    High concentrations of heavy metals in the soil negatively affect many plant physiological processes through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This in turn results in lipid peroxidation, mostly irreversible oxidation of proteins and DNA damage. There are many reports indicating that plant-microbial interactions can alleviate oxidative stress caused by toxic concentrations of heavy metals (Islam et al.; Islam et al.; Nadeem et al.). Islam et al. observed improving gas exchange parameters, such as photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), as well as reduction of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in lentils (Lens culinaris Medik) grown in heavy metal-contaminated soil inoculated with microorganisms, in comparison with non-inoculated ones.\n\n    To date, most experiments have investigated the influence of selected microbes on plant growth and development, considering either selected strains alone on sterilized soil or a combined effect of selected microbes with autochthonous microorganisms on nonsterilized soil (Bai et al.; Guo et al.; Liang et al.; Rostami et al.; Wang et al.; Verma et al.; Zhu et al.). However, the influence of autochthonous microorganisms, particularly on plant growth and physiological processes, is poorly described in the literature (Liu et al.; Miransari et al.; Yang et al.). Experiments conducted on sterilized and nonsterilized soil without inoculation can offer an opportunity to assess the impact of these autochthonous microorganisms on plants cultivated on soils with different levels of heavy metal contamination. We hypothesize that presence of autochthonous microorganisms in soils should improve plant growth and photosynthesis performance of Zea mays plants. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plant growth and the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, gas exchange parameters, pigments content, mineral nutrient status, heavy metals concentration, and oxidative stress in maize plants cultivated on contaminated and noncontaminated soils with and without autochthonous microorganisms.",
        "Methods": "    Soil for the pot experiment was sampled from three experimental sites located in Upper Silesia, Poland. Sites were selected according to heavy metal (HM) contamination status: fallow land in Piekary Slaskie (50  22' 06.2\" N 18  57' 52.9'' E) with a high degree of pollution (HMhigh), caused by close vicinity to the former Pb/Zn smelter; arable land in Bytom (50  20' 41.9\" N 18  57' 19.9'' E) with a moderate level of contamination (HMmod), resulting from being a short distance (about 2.5 km) from the same smelter and arable land in Gliwice (50  15' 16.9\" N 18  40' 46.6'' E), located about 24 km from the smelter, classified as a nonpolluted area (HMlow). The zinc and lead smelter was operated from 1927 until 1990 when significant soil contamination occurred due to dust fall of particles containing HM (Fig. S1). At the Bytom site, cereals have been cultivated commercially for the last 20 years, while at the Gliwice site between 1970 and 2000, vegetables were cultivated without the use of any chemical fertilizer, and from 2000, this field was left fallow. The soil collected from each site was air-dried, passed through a 4-mm sieve, which removed stones and plant residues, mixed and divided into two parts. Half of each soil sample remained unsterilized while the second was sterilized in an autoclave at 120  C and 1.2 bar for 20 min; this sterilization procedure was repeated four times with a 1-day interval.\n\n    G_NS:nonsterilized soil from Gliwice, (HMlow)\n\n    G_S:sterilized soil from Gliwice, (HMlow)\n\n    B_NS:nonsterilized soil from Bytom, (HMmod)\n\n    B_S:sterilized soil from Bytom, (HMmod)\n\n    P_NS:nonsterilized soil from Piekary Slaskie, (HMhigh)\n\n    P_S:sterilized soil from Piekary Slaskie, (HMhigh)\n\n    Subsamples for each soil were put into plastic pots. For each variant, four pots (0.0015 m3 volume) were established. Experimental treatments were as follows:\n\n    Caryopses of maize (Zea mays L., cv. 'Lokata') were germinated in the dark at 28  C. After 2 weeks of germination, three seedlings per pot were planted. The plants were cultivated in a phytotron for 45 days under controlled conditions: temperature 24  C, light intensity PAR = 300 mumol (photons) m-2 s-1 and humidity 40%. The measurements of plant gas exchange parameters and pigment content were conducted after the 18th day from planting and consequently repeated every 2 weeks until the end of the experiment. Additionally, at the end of the experiment, chlorophyll a fluorescence and plant height measurements were taken. Following this, plant and soil samples were collected for further analysis. The plants were divided into shoots and roots, washed in tap water to remove soil particles, and then washed again with deionized water. The rest of the plant growth measurements were then carried out along with assessments of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents in leaf samples. In addition, the intensity of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi was assessed. The rest of the shoots and roots biomass was dried for 72 h at 70  C and then ground for elemental analysis. Soil samples collected from the pots after the experiment were examined for dehydrogenase activity.\n\n    Soil samples were collected before the experiment, air-dried and sieved to 2 mm (for pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter content) and then ground to < 0.25 mm for further analysis (total metal concentration, bioavailable metal concentration, nutrients: N, P, K).\n\n    Soil pH was measured in H2O (ratio 1:2.5 m/v) with a combination glass/calomel electrode (OSH 10-10, METRON, Poland) and a pH-meter (CPC-551, Elmetron, Poland) at 20  C. The electrical conductivity was determined using the same device as for pH measurements using an ESP 2ZM electrode (EUROSENSOR, Poland) following the standard Polish protocol, PN-ISO 11265:.\n\n    Soil texture was evaluated by the sieve method according to protocol ISO 11277:. Soil organic matter content (OM) was measured by loss on ignition as follows: air-dry soil was dried at 105  C for 24 h and then (5 g) treated with 550  C for 4 h (Pogrzeba et al.).\n\n    The bioavailable forms of Pb, Cd, and Zn in the soil were extracted using 0.01 M CaCl2 (for a review, see Peijnenburg et al.). Extraction was conducted with 5 g of air-dried soil (< 0.25 mm) and 50 ml 0.01 M CaCl2 for 2 h. Bioavailable metal concentrations (Cd, Pb, Zn) were measured in filtrate using flame atomic absorption spectrometer (iCE 3500 FAAS, Thermo Scientific).\n\n    Total concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cd, Mg, Fe, and Ca in the soil (< 0.25 mm) and plant samples were obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (iCE 3500 FAAS, Thermo Scientific) after microwave sample digestion in concentrated HNO3 and H2O2 (4:1 v/v) (ETHOS 1, Milestone, Italy).\n\n    The total nitrogen (N) concentration in soil was determined using the dry combustion method (ISO 13878:). Available phosphorus (P) and available potassium (K) concentrations in the soil were assessed according to the method described by Egner et al.. Total N concentration in plant shoots and roots was measured using the titration method (Bremner), whereas total phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentration in plant shoots and roots were estimated in previously mineralized samples using ICP (Liberty 220,Varian, USA).\n\n    Dehydrogenase activity was determined according to the modified method of Casida et al.. Soil samples (3 g) were placed in test tubes and incubated at 25  C for 96 h. After that, the substrate (3% v/w TTC) was added and the tubes were incubated at 25  C for 24 h. The samples were vortexed, filtered using acetone as an extractor agent, and read at lambda = 485 nm using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (BioPhotometer  D30, Eppendorf, Germany).\n\n    For the estimation of mycorrhizal development, the roots were prepared according to a modified method of Phillips and Hayman. After washing in tap and deionized water, the roots were purified in 7% KOH at 90  C for 10 min and then rinsed in a few changes of deionized water. The root samples were acidified in 5% lactic acid for 24 h and stained with 0.01% aniline blue in lactic acid for 24 h. Subsequently, the evaluation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization was conducted according to Trouvelot et al. using Mycocalc software (http://www.dijon.inra.fr/mychintec/Mycocal-prg/download.html). Fifteen root fragments on one slide were observed under the microscope and rated according to the range of classes indicated in the Trouvelot et al. method. These classes give a rapid estimation of the level of mycorrhizal colonization of each root fragment and the abundance of arbuscules. The following parameters were evaluated: F%, percentage of segments showing internal colonization; M%, average percentage of colonization of root segments; A%, percentage of arbuscules in the whole root system.\n\n    Plant gas exchange parameters, such as photosynthesis rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs) transpiration rate (E), and intracellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were conducted on the first fully developed leaf (mostly the third from the apex). Measurements were carried out on the 18th, 32nd, and 45th day of plant cultivation in the soil using an infrared gas analyzer (LCpro+, ADC Bioscientific, UK) under controlled climate conditions (T = 24  C, PAR = 1000 mumol m-2 s-1). Measurements were performed between 9 am and noon.\n\n    Relative chlorophyll and anthocyanins content was measured using a plant pigment meter (DUALEX SCIENTIFIC+ , Force-A, France). The plant pigment content assay was performed immediately following the gas exchange measurements and using the same leaves as for the gas exchange measurements.\n\n    Chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured using Handy Plant Efficiency Analyzer (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., UK). Before analysis, leaves were dark-adapted for 25 min using specially designed clips (LC, Hansatech Instruments, Ltd., UK). Measurements were conducted on the 45th day using the same leaves as for the plant pigment content and gas exchange measurements.\n\n    At the end of the experiment, the shoot height (h) and dry biomass of plant shoots and roots were measured.\n\n    The H2O2 content was determined in leaves using the modified procedure described by Loreto and Velikova while lipid peroxidation, an indicator of oxidative cell damage, was assessed by measuring MDA content in plant leaves according to the Dhindsa et al. method.\n\n    All data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc test (P < 0.05) for comparison of more than two independent groups, while Wilcoxon test (P < 0.05) was used for comparison of two independent groups. Principal component analyses (PCA) were performed on a correlation matrix to detect clusters of cases and correlation between investigating parameters corresponding to plant physiological status (plant growth measurements, elements concentration in shoots, gas exchange measurement, plant pigment content, mycorrhizal colonization, oxidative stress indicators). Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica v13.1 (Dell Inc., USA).",
        "Results": "    The soil from Gliwice (HMlow) was classified as medium loam, while from Bytom (HMmod) and Piekary Slaskie (HMhigh) as Silty Loam (Table 1, Table S1). The lowest soil pH was found for Bytom site, while the highest was observed in Gliwice site. Analysis of soil electrical conductivity (EC) did not show significant differences between sterilized and nonsterilized soil, demonstrating similar tendencies as pH values (Table 1). Bytom soil showed a significantly lower content of organic matter (OM) by about 1%, compared to the soil from Gliwice and Piekary Slaskie. The elemental concentration in the soils is presented in Table 1. The significantly higher Ntotal concentration (by about 20%) was found in Gliwice and Piekary Slaskie when compared to Bytom soil. No significant differences were observed in Pavailable concentration in Bytom and Gliwice. The lowest Pavailable concentration was found in Piekary Slaskie soil and it was about 63% lower in comparison with the other soils. Kavailable concentration was higher in soils from Bytom and Piekary Slaskie, where there were no significant differences, while Kavailable concentration in soil from Gliwice was nearly 50% lower. The highest Mg and Cu concentration was observed in the P_NS soil while there were no significant differences between G_NS and B_NS. G_NS soil had the highest Ca concentration (75% higher than the other soils).\n\n    Concentration of bioavailable forms of the investigated heavy metals, Pb in each variant and Cd in control variants (G_NS and G_S) were below detection limit. The highest bioavailable Zn and Cd concentration was found in Piekary Slaskie soil, while moderate and the lowest were found in Bytom and Gliwice soil respectively. Sterilization did not affect soil elemental composition except for Pavailable concentration. It was found that sterilization of soil from Gliwice and Bytom resulted in a decrease of Pavailable concentration in those experimental variants.\n\n    Dehydrogenase activity (DHA), measured at the end of the experiment, was very much lower in the sterilized soils compared to nonsterilized which showed that sterilization was successful (Table 1). Sterilization decreased DHA in noncontaminated G_S soil by 96.7%, whereas in soils contaminated by heavy metals DHA, it was diminished by 87-88%. In nonsterilized soil, the highest DHA was found for noncontaminated soil (G_NS), while the lowest for the most contaminated soil (P_NS).\n\n    The concentrations of investigated elements in plants are presented in Table 2. Concentrations of elements in root and shoots, in most cases, correspond to the values obtained during soil elemental analysis; however, the most notable differences were driven by comparisons between plants cultivated in sterilized or nonsterilized soils.\n\n    There were significant differences in N, K, and Mg root concentration, with a decrease of these elements concentration in roots of plants cultivated on B_S soil when compared to its nonsterilized counterpart. In addition, a decrease in roots Mg concentration by about 37% was found for G_S soil in comparison to its nonsterilized counterpart.\n\n    Nitrogen concentration in shoots was significantly lower (10%) for plants cultivated in G_S soil and significantly higher (37%) for plants cultivated in P_S soil as compared to their nonsterilized counterparts. Significantly, lower values for K shoot concentration were found in variants with sterilized soil. Interestingly, Ca concentration in shoots was significantly lower in sterilized soil, despite the fact that differences between concentrations of this element in roots were statistically insignificant. Sterility of soil significantly affected Cd concentration in shoots; it caused higher concentrations in plants cultivated in B_S and P_S soil by about 54 and 70% when compared to plants cultivated in B_NS and P_NS soil, respectively. A similar relationship was found for Zn shoot concentration; however, this was only seen in the Piekary Slaskie (HMhigh) soil.\n\n    Mycorrhizae colonization levels were significantly affected by HM concentration in soil (Fig. 1). The lowest mycorrhizal intensity (M%) was found in P_NS and B_NS plant roots which were lower by 86 and 70% in comparison G_NS, respectively. G_S, B_S, and P_S plant roots were devoid of AMF colonization. Moreover, in contrast to P_NS (HMhigh) and B_NS (HMmod) plants, G_NS (HMlow) showed the Arum-type mycorrhizal colonization. In plants grown on the HMC soils, AMF, when present, exhibited Paris-type mycorrhizal colonization (Fig. S2).\n\n    Dark septate endophytes (DSE) were found in plants cultivated on HM-contaminated soils (P_NS and B_NS), while they were absent in root samples from G_NS. The mycelium was brownish and occurred mainly in root fragments where arbuscules were not present. Both dematiaceous septate hyphae and microsclerotia were observed (Fig. S3).\n\n    Relative chlorophyll content in Z. mays leaves decreased during the experiment, irrespectively of the studied experimental treatment (Fig. 2a). No significant difference in relative chlorophyll content was observed on the 18th day from planting across all experimental variants. The largest decrease of relative chlorophyll content was observed on the 45th day after planting. Among plants cultivated on nonsterilized soil, the greatest decrease of relative chlorophyll content was found in B_NS (HMmod) and P_NS (HMhigh) plants, which were 63% lower relative to that measured on the 18th day. In addition, by the 45th day, G_NS (HMlow) plants had significantly higher relative chlorophyll content than plants cultivated on the other nonsterilized soils. In contrast to measurements taken on the 18th day, significant differences were seen in relative chlorophyll content in leaves on the subsequent measuring dates (32nd and 45th days) with chlorophyll tending to be significantly higher in plants cultivated on sterilized soils compared to nonsterilized ones. Among plants cultivated on sterilized soil, by the 32nd and 45th days, the highest relative chlorophyll content was found in G_S and P_S plants, with no significant differences noted between them, while the lowest relative chlorophyll content was found for B_S plants.\n\n    Anthocyanin levels also increased during cultivation (Fig. 2b). Analysis carried out on the 18th day sampling showed no significant differences between any of the treatments. By the 32nd day, a large increase in anthocyanin index was observed across all soils, about 64% higher than earlier measurements in plants cultivated on the nonsterilized soils. Leaves of plants grown on sterilized soils also showed an increased anthocyanin index, but the values were lower in comparison with their nonsterilized counterparts by 74%, 29%, and 55% for G_S, B_S, and P_S plants respectively. This 32nd day sampling revealed significant differences between sterilized and nonsterilized soils. Within the HM status groups, nonsterilized soils were not different to each other; in contrast, all three soil types within the sterilized group were significantly different to each other at this time point.\n\n    With the exception of G_NS, all treatments had again increased in anthocyanin index by the 45th day sampling. Among plants cultivated on nonsterilized soil, the highest values were found in leaves of P_NS plants, which was ten times higher than that of the first (18th day) measurements. The lowest values were found in leaves of G_NS. Among plants cultivated on sterilized soil, the highest values were found in leaves of B_S and P_S plants. Across all treatments, the lowest anthocyanin index tended to be found on the uncontaminated sterilized and unsterilized soils.\n\n    The transient sector between bands (O, J, I, and P) of the chlorophyll induction curve provides important information about the kinetic energy transfer and conversion between the different components of photosynthetic apparatus related to the light-dependent phase of photosynthesis (for review, see Goltsev et al.; Kalaji et al.; Strasser et al.).\n\n    Across all experimental treatments, the only differences in the fluorescence transient curve were found at K- and J-band (Fig. 3). No differences were found at I-band. Different doses of HM in soil as well as soil sterility did not influence I-P phase.\n\n    The significant differences in most of JIP-test parameters (Table 3) were visible between sterilized and nonsterilized variants of the same soil, as well as between variants of different concentration of heavy metals in soil. Significantly, higher values of minimal fluorescence intensity (FO), maximal fluorescence intensity (FM), maximum quantum yield of primary photochemical reactions (phiPo - FV/FM), indicator of photosystem II (PSII) functional activity normalized to the absorbed energy (PIABS) and total performance index; indicating the integral functional activity of PSII, photosystem I (PSI), and intersystem electron transport chain (PItotal) found in Z. mays leaves cultivated in soil from Gliwice (HMlow) and Piekary Slaskie (HMhigh). However, no significant differences were found between these parameters for plants cultivated in the Bytom (HMmod) sterilized and nonsterilized soil. In contrast, a significant decrease of absorption energy flux per active reaction centers (ABS/RC) and dissipated energy flux per RC (DIo/RC) was found in the same experimental variants, containing soil from Gliwice (HMlow) and Piekary Slaskie. Interestingly, ABS/RC, DIo/RC, PIABS, and PItotal in the nonsterilized soil did not show any differences between Gliwice (HMlow) and Bytom (HMmod) (simultaneously with lower values for Piekary Slaskie (HMhigh)). On sterilized soil significantly higher values were found for plants cultivated in Gliwice (HMlow) soil as compared to the B_S and P_S and no significant differences were found between the variants containing excessive level of heavy metals. Regarding differences in FO values between nonsterilized experimental variants, no significant differences were found between B_NS and other nonsterilized variants, while plants grown on Gliwice (HMlow) soil showed 25% higher values when compared to P_NS. However, on sterilized variants, the highest Fo was found for P_S, while 10 and 34% lower values were found for G_S and B_S respectively. Similar pattern was seen for FM; however, B_NS differ significantly from other nonsterilized variants, and on sterilized variants, no significant differences were found between G_S and P_S. The most common JIP-test parameter, phiPo, also known as FV/FM, showed the same pattern of changes in the sterilized and nonsterilized soil. No significant differences were found between plants cultivated in soil from Gliwice (HMlow) and Bytom (HMmod), while significantly lower values were found for plants cultivated on soil from Piekary Slaskie (HMhigh).\n\n    Measurements taken on the 18th day after planting showed significant differences in photosynthetic rate (A) between plants grown on nonsterilized and sterilized soils (Fig. 4a). Plants from sterilized soils showed a higher photosynthetic rate in comparison with those of nonsterilized soils, by 25%, 26%, and 31% for G_S (HMlow), B_S (HMmod) and P_S (HMhigh) plants, respectively. Among the plants cultivated on sterilized soils, the highest rate was found for B_S plants and the lowest for P_S plants. Plants cultivated on moderately HM-contaminated (HMmod) and -sterilized soil (B_S) did not differ significantly from their uncontaminated control (HMlow) (G_S); results were similar for plants grown on the sterilized soils. Analysis carried out on the 32nd day showed a decreasing trend in photosynthetic rate; here, the highest rate was observed for G_S plants with this treatment showing the smallest decrease between the 18th and 32nd day of sampling (18%). There were no significant differences between G_NS and P_NS plants on the 32nd day. The lowest photosynthetic rate was observed for both B_NS and B_S (57 and 60%, respectively). After the 45th day of cultivation the highest rate was noted for the uncontaminated G_NS and G_S plants with no significant difference between the two soil sterilization treatments. Across all soils (sterilized and nonsterilized) plants from the HM-contaminated treatments tended to have lower photosynthetic rates than those from the uncontaminated one. However, values obtained for plants cultivated on highly contaminated sterilized soil were significantly higher when compared to the other values obtained for plants grown on contaminated soils.\n\n    Transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (gs) showed a similar declining trend over time (Fig. 4b, c). Measurements taken on the 18th day showed significant differences between plants grown on nonsterilized and sterilized soils. Plants from nonsterilized soils showed a lower transpiration rate in comparison with these of sterilized soils by 13%, 19%, and 31% for G_NS, B_NS, and P_NS plants, respectively. Among plants cultivated on sterilized soils, the highest rate was found for P_S plants and the lowest for B_S plants. For plants cultivated on nonsterilized soil, E value was the highest in G_NS plants and the lowest in P_NS plants. The highest differences in E and gs values were found between the 18th and 45th day after planting:by about 60% for all variants.\n\n    Intracellular concentration of CO2 (Ci) increased over time (Fig. 4d). Analysis carried out on the 18th day sampling showed no significant differences within the HM treatments in the nonsterilized soils but did show differences between all three HM levels in the sterilized soils. Among these plants cultivated on sterilized soils, the highest rate was found for G_S (HMlow) plants and the lowest for B_S plants. After 32 days, a large increase in intracellular concentration of CO2 was seen compared to values recorded on the 18th day, particularly in G_NS plants (by 120%). In other variants, there was also high increase of Ci value by 65%, 98%, 103%, and 127%, for B_NS, B_S, P_NS, and P_S plants, respectively. On the 45th day, Ci values were generally significantly higher on the sterilized soils though the highest value here individually was seen on the nonsterilized G_NS soil. Furthermore, among plants cultivated on nonsterilized soil there were no significant differences between the two HM contamination levels B_NS and P_NS, which recorded the lowest intracellular concentration of CO2. Among plants cultivated on sterilized soils, there were no significant differences in Ci concentrations between the different HMC levels.\n\n    Plants grown on sterilized soils had longer shoots than those on nonsterilized soils, with the exception of P_NS and P_S, where differences in plant height were insignificant (Table 2). Among plants cultivated on sterilized soils, the highest shoot length was noted in G_S (81 +- 3 cm) plants, and the lowest in P_S plants, both were significantly different from B_S (73 +- 2 cm) plants. Among plants cultivated on nonsterilized soils, no significant differences between treatments were found.\n\n    Shoot biomass was generally lower for plants cultivated on nonsterilized soil in comparison with those cultivated on sterilized ones by 63%, 17%, and 36% for G_NS, B_NS, and P_NS, respectively (Table 2). Similar trends were observed for root biomass, which was lower in plants cultivated on nonsterilized soil when compared to plant cultivated on sterilized soil by 70%, 37%, and 63% for G_NS, B_NS, and P_NS experimental variants respectively. Among plants from nonsterilized soils, the highest root and shoot biomass was found for plant cultivated in Bytom soil (HMmod); however, on sterilized soil, the highest root biomass was found for plant cultivated on G_S and B_S soil while the highest shoot biomass was found for plants cultivated on G_S soil.\n\n    H2O2 content in the leaves was generally lower for plants grown in sterilized soils compared to nonsterilized soils though for B_S specifically the opposite was true (Fig. 5a). Among plants cultivated on nonsterilized and sterilized soil, the highest content of H2O2 was found on the HMhigh soils (P_NS and P_S), while the lowest content of H2O2 was found in the HMlow controls (G_NS and G_S). Maize leaves from contaminated soils typically showed H2O2 levels twice as high as their corresponding controls. Between the soil sterilization treatments there were no significant differences with the exception of HMmod, where the sterilized treatment did show a significantly higher H2O2 value compared to the nonsterilized.\n\n    Similarly to the H2O2 results, MDA content in the leaves was lower in plants cultivated on sterilized soils compared to nonsterilized soils. Again, as heavy metal contamination in the soil increased, the MDA content in the leaves of both groups increased correspondingly (Fig. 5b).\n\n    Principal component analysis (Fig. 6a, b) was performed on correlation matrix of all parameters to detect relationships between those corresponding to the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus (photosynthesis rate, plant pigments content), plant growth parameters, HM concentration in plant shoots (Pb, Cd, Zn), primary mineral macronutrients concentration in shoots (N, P, K), oxidative stress indicators in plant leaves (H2O2, MDA), and microbiological indicators (F%, M%, A%, DHA). The first principal component (PC1) is conditioned mostly by parameters of photosynthetic apparatus efficiency, element concentrations, and oxidative stress indicators, while the second principal component (PC2) is conditioned by plant growth parameters and microbial indicators (Fig. 6a). Parameters included in the PCA were assigned to four different correlated parameter groups. The first group contains microbial indicators (F%, M%, DHA, A%), the second group contains gas exchange measurements (A, gs, E), chlorophyll content in leaves (Chl) and two primary mineral macronutrients concentration in shoots (N and P). The third group consists of plant growth parameters with the last group consisting of HMs concentration in shoots (Pb, Cd, Zn), K concentration in shoots, anthocyanins, and oxidative stress indicators (MDA and H2O2).\n\n    According to their location in a coordination system (Fig. 6b) based on the two principal components (PC1 x PC2), it is possible to distinguish four clusters. The first two clusters distinguish between plants cultivated on HM-contaminated and -uncontaminated soils. The next two distinguish between nonsterilized and sterilized soil. It can be seen in Fig. 6b that the distance between cases corresponding to plants cultivated on sterilized and nonsterilized contaminated soils is shorter when compared to distance between cases corresponding to plants cultivated on sterilized and nonsterilized uncontaminated soil. A similar result was also seen for distance between sterilized contaminated and uncontaminated variants, which was shorter when compared to distance between nonsterilized contaminated and uncontaminated variants.",
        "Conclusion": "    Our results showed that steam sterilization did not have a significant effect on soil physicochemical properties. The average percentage of colonization of root segments by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) decreased with the increase of heavy metals (HM) concentration in soil by more than 50% depending on the level of contaminants. Alongside a decrease in AMF colonization due to sterilization there was significant increase in Cd shoot concentration by about 119 and 228% for B_S and P_S variants, respectively, when compared to nonsterilized counterparts. However, Zn plant shoot concentration was significantly higher by 68% only for P_S variant, when compare to nonsterilized counterpart. Dark septate endophytes were only present in roots of plants cultivated in HMhigh soils. Lower biomass yields on nonsterilized soil could be the result of competition between plants and microorganisms for mineral nutrients. Anthocyanins content could be good indicator of HM-induced oxidative stress due to its correlation with MDA and H2O2 leaf content. Autochthonous microflora seems to be a key player in determining differences between Zea mays physiological status cultivated on the sterilized and nonsterilized contaminated soils, having a negative impact on growth and photosynthetic performance, likely due to competition with plants for nutrients. This observation tends to overthrow the hypothesis that autochthonous microorganisms improve plant growth and photosynthetic performance. However, a lack of these microorganisms in the same soils considerably increased plants HM concentration, particularly Cd and Zn.",
        "Discussion": "    In general, Z. mays plants were characterized by better growth and physiological status on sterilized soil as compared to the nonsterilized soil. Bowen and Rovira obtained similar results for root development on sterilized and nonsterilized soils for Solanum lycopersicon Mill., Trifolium sp. and Phalaris arundinacea L., suggesting that the presence of microorganisms reduced the primary root growth in those plants. This phenomenon could be associated with competition between plant roots and rhizosphere microorganisms for mineral N and other mineral nutrients. At the initial stage of plant development microorganisms outcompete plant roots for mineral nutrients, because of rapid growth rates and high surface-area-to-volume ratios compared with those of root hairs. However, over longer periods of cultivation microorganisms cannot compete so effectively with plants for nutrients (Kuzyakov and Xu,). Another possible explanation for better growth is that nutrients could be released into soils from dead microorganisms following soil sterilization (Passioura). To address this possibility, an elemental analysis was carried out on both sterilized and nonsterilized soils assuming that there is no significant fertilization effect of the sterilization.\n\n    The results obtained for nonsterilized soil indicated that with an increase of heavy metal (HM) contamination, a reduction in dehydrogenase activity (DHA) occurs. However, the differences between values obtained for the two contaminated soils were statistically insignificant. Chen et al. reported that long-term exposure of microorganisms to heavy-metal pollution results in a decrease of microbial biomass and corresponding activity as well as a reduction of microbial community diversity. This suggestion is in agreement with our observation of significantly lower arbuscular bycorrhiza fungi (AMF) root colonization and DHA on heavy metal-contaminated (HMC) soils as compared to the uncontaminated soil. Previous studies from Zn- and Pb-mining regions showed a strong negative effect of soil HM contamination on AMF abundance and diversity (Zarei et al.). In addition, our results suggest that AMF on the contaminated soils displayed Paris-type mycorrhiza, while on uncontaminated soil AMF followed the Arum type, agreeing with results reported by Vogel-Mikus et al.. Microscopic root observation in our study also indicated the presence of DSE and microsclerotia on both contaminated soils, while there were no visible such structures on samples from uncontaminated soil. Zhang et al. reported that in most plants grown on lead and zinc slag heaps the colonization of roots by DSE appeared. In addition, presence of DSE in Piekary Slaskie (HMhigh) soil was previously reported by Gucwa-Przepiora et al.. Those endophytes may be integral to the function of HM-contaminated ecosystems due to their function as replacements or complements of mycorrhizae damaged by pollutants (Zhang et al.). Despite successful sterilization of soil, low DHA was observed for these sterilized soils which could be caused by secondary soil contamination by deposition of microbes from the air (Despres et al.).\n\n    Besides soil specificity, there were almost no differences in mineral macronutrient concentration in shoots between nonsterilized and sterilized variants, except K and Ca. The lower K and Ca concentrations in shoots were observed on sterilized soils as compared to nonsterilized soils. However, due to higher biomass production on sterilized soils, competition between plants and microorganisms for mineral nutrients cannot be excluded. The phenomenon of competition between plants and microorganisms for N was previously reviewed by Kuzyakov and Xu. In addition, it was found that on HMhigh-sterilized soil (P_S), there were considerably higher shoot N concentrations when compared to the nonsterilized equivalent (P_NS). Although lower K and Ca concentration in plant shoots grown on sterilized soil could be associated with higher Cd shoot concentrations in plants cultivated on HMC soils (Ghnaya et al.; Malkowski et al.), the considerably higher shoot N concentrations on HMhigh-sterilized soil when compared to HMhigh-nonsterilized soil was an unexpected result. We hypothesize that such differences between P_NS and P_S could be driven by a combined effect of HM toxicity and plant-microbe competition for mineral nutrients on the nonsterilized HMhigh soil.\n\n    Higher concentration of Cd in shoots was found in both contaminated sterilized soils, whereas it was not observed in HMlow soil (G_S). This phenomenon may be associated with a low concentration of Cd in a bioavailable forms in uncontaminated soil. Distinct results were observed for Zn shoot concentrations, where significantly higher concentrations were obtained only in soil where Zn concentration was the highest (P_S). There are many reports which show the impact of AMF on reduction of HM translocation due to their immobilization on root surface by AMF hyphae (Abdelmoneim et al., Ban et al., Wu et al.). Thus, it is supposed that observed in our current study, the higher concentration of Cd and Zn (only for P_S) in shoots of maize grown on sterilized and contaminated soils is a result of very low root colonization by AMF due to soil sterilization.\n\n    Direct measurements of photosynthetic rate clearly indicated an inhibition of this process due to an accumulation of HM in plant tissues, which has been widely reported (Farooq et al.; Hattab et al.; Mobin and Khan). Slightly higher photosynthetic rates and higher FM in plants grown on the P_S (HMhigh) soils when compared to the B_S (HMmod) could be related to higher N accumulation in shoots. Previous studies have suggested a correlation between chlorophyll content and N concentration in maize shoots (Schlemmer et al.), which is with agreement to results obtained for chlorophyll content at the 45th day and the N concentration at the end of the experiment. Considerably higher concentrations of mineral nutrients, particularly N, could slightly mask the toxic effect of HM on the photosynthetic apparatus from sterilized HMhigh soils (P_S). The differences between trends obtained for direct photosynthetic rate (A) and the efficiency of the light-dependent photosynthesis phase, obtained from chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis, may be associated with a higher impact of HM on enzymatic activity in the light independent phase when compared to its influence on the electron transport chain during light-dependent phase (Dias et al.; Rodriguez et al.).\n\n    Despite the fact that slight differences appeared at absorption energy flux per active reaction center (ABS/RC) and dissipated energy flux per reaction center (DIo/RC) between contaminated and uncontaminated variants, which influenced on the other parameters (phiPo, PIABS, PItotal), no differences were found in further electron transport chain at parameters related to flux of excitation energy trapped per active RC (TRo/RC) and electron transport flux per RC (ETo/RC) as well as on JIP-test parameters related to the PSI functionality (data not shown). Interestingly, OJIP-test parameters indicated that a more pronounced effect was found when comparing sterilized with nonsterilized experimental variants. However, within this comparison, changes were only visible between uncontaminated (HMlow) variants (G_NS vs. G_S) and highly contaminated (HMhigh) variants (P_NS vs. P_S). This observation may suggest that the competition between plant and microorganisms has a greater effect on plant growth and photosynthesis than the toxic effect of heavy metals.\n\n    This hypothesis explaining the slower growth of plants due to competition for nutrients between plants and autochthonous microorganisms seems to be reasonable taking into account the chlorophyll fluorescence analysis. This technique was previously used to assess the effect of nutrient deficiencies in the medium where plants were cultivated (Cetner et al.; Kalaji et al.; Kalaji et al.; Tang et al.). Kalaji et al. reported for rapeseed plants cultivated in soil with different mineral nutrients concentration that deficiencies of nutrients resulted in increase in ABS/RC even at low nutrients deficiencies; moreover, the authors found that there was increase in the K band at O-J phase. Those results are in agreement with phenomena observed between sterilized and nonsterilized soils in our study, i.e., nonsterilized soils may suffer a slight deficit due to competition. A decrease in the number of active reaction centers (RC) was considered as the mechanism of nutrient-deficient leaves against photo-oxidative damage and an excess of absorbed light energy, while the appearance of the K band denoted damage to the oxygen-evolving complex (Kalaji et al.; Kalaji et al.).\n\n    Transpiration rate, as well as stomatal conductance, decreased during the experiment, irrespectively of HM accumulation. The same trend was observed by Ci et al. and Anjum et al. for plants treated with different concentrations of Cd. The concentration of intracellular CO2 increased with the aging of plants and accumulation of HMs, which corresponds with results obtained by Tian et al.. It has been shown that Cd concentration decreases the activity of enzymes involved in carboxylation reactions (e.g., RuBPCase) (Siedlecka et al.), which could be related to an increased concentration of intracellular CO2. Values recorded for plant pigments and gas exchange parameters on the 18th and 32nd day could indicate the plants striving for an equilibrium state during acclimation in soil to varying environment conditions. This phenomenon is most visible in chlorophyll and anthocyanins content and photosynthesis rate. On the 18th day, sampling plant pigments did not differ significantly, while by the 32nd day, those parameters gave values characteristic for HM impact on plants, especially on sterilized experimental variants, while on nonsterilized variants this equilibrium was shifted in time. A similar phenomenon was observed for photosynthesis rate; however, on the 18th day, the highest values were recorded for plants cultivated on Bytom soils and the lowest for plants cultivated in Piekary Slaskie soils. On the 32nd day, the photosynthesis rate seems to stabilize at the levels which can suggest a toxic effect of HM on photosynthetic apparatus efficiency (Farooq et al.). This phenomenon could be associated with a delay in plant reaction to the harsh environment due to reaching a critical concentration of ROS after some time from acclimation. It agrees with the suggestion by Poschenrieder et al. that metal induced ROS production can trigger antioxidant defenses that induce hormetic responses under certain conditions. However, once toxicity thresholds are passed, the ROS-induced scavenging system will be overcome and the negative effects on the antioxidant system and growth inhibition will occur.\n\n    The most common indicators of oxidative stress in plants are contents of H2O2 and malonedialdehyde (MDA) (Bidar et al.; Rizwan et al.; Wu et al.; Zhang et al.). However, there is also evidence for an increase of anthocyanin content under HM stress (Chen et al.,; Mobin and Khan). Our results show clearly that cultivation of Z. mays on contaminated soil results in increased levels of H2O2, MDA and anthocyanin in leaves, corresponding to HM concentration in soil. Moreover, anthocyanin measurements suggest that differences between experimental variants appears earlier in sterilized treatments with anthocyanin content being lower in comparison to the nonsterilized treatments. Lower values of MDA and H2O2 concentrations in leaves were also obtained for sterilized soils at the end of the experiment. Zhang et al. reported that H2O2 accumulation in clover roots occurred in response to colonization by AMF. The similar tendencies obtained for MDA are likely driven by strong connectivity between H2O2 concentration and lipid peroxidation (Shahid et al.).\n\n    Based on the results obtained from PCA, it could be assumed that autochthonous microorganisms are key players driving differences between plants cultivated in soil with different levels of contamination. In addition, differences between sterilized and nonsterilized variants were more apparent when higher microbial activity in the nonsterilized treatment was present, possibly demonstrating competition between plants and microorganisms.",

        "Title": "    Comprehensive molecular profiling of advanced/metastatic olfactory neuroblastomas",
        "Abstract": "    Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare, locally aggressive, malignant neoplasm originating in the olfactory epithelium in the nasal vault. The recurrence rate of ONB remains high and there are no specific treatment guidelines for recurrent/metastatic ONBs. This study retrospectively evaluated 23 ONB samples profiled at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, Arizona) using DNA sequencing (Sanger/NGS [Illumina], n = 15) and gene fusions (Archer FusionPlex, n = 6), whole genome RNA microarray (HumanHT-12 v4 beadChip, Illumina, n = 4), gene copy number assays (chromogenic and fluorescent in situ hybridization), and immunohistochemistry. Mutations were detected in 63% ONBs including TP53, CTNNB1, EGFR, APC, cKIT, cMET, PDGFRA, CDH1, FH, and SMAD4 genes. Twenty-one genes were over-expressed and 19 genes under-expressed by microarray assay. Some of the upregulated genes included CD24, SCG2, and IGFBP-2. None of the cases harbored copy number variations of EGFR, HER2 and cMET genes, and no gene fusions were identified. Multiple protein biomarkers of potential response or resistance to classic chemotherapy drugs were identified, such as low ERCC1 [cisplatin sensitivity in 10/12], high TOPO1 [irinotecan sensitivity in 12/19], high TUBB3 [vincristine resistance in 13/14], and high MRP1 [multidrug resistance in 6/6 cases]. None of the cases (0/10) were positive for PD-L1 in tumor cells. Overexpression of pNTRK was observed in 67% (4/6) of the cases without underlying genetic alterations. Molecular alterations detected in our study (e.g., Wnt and cKIT/PDGFRA pathways) are potentially treatable using novel therapeutic approaches. Identified protein biomarkers of response or resistance to classic chemotherapy could be useful in optimizing existing chemotherapy treatment(s) in ONBs.",
        "Introduction": "    Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), also called esthesioneuroblastoma, is a rare, locally aggressive, malignant neoplasm originating in the specialized sensory neuroepithelial olfactory cells found in the upper part of the nasal cavity. Multiple modalities are currently in use to treat ONB, including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Numerous studies confirmed that a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for the majority of primary-site ONBs. Advanced and metastatic ONBs are usually treated with classic chemotherapy, including etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and nitrogen mustard. However, due to the unpredictable biological behavior of the tumor and a lack of consensus on traditional treatment modalities, the recurrence rate of ONB remains high and effective treatment guidelines for high-grade ONBs are yet to be developed.\n\n    In recent years, with the advancement of molecular diagnostic methods, the focus has been on developing individualized targeted therapies for treating different types of cancer. Cytogenetic studies on ONB revealed diverse and complex genomic imbalances in entire chromosomes and chromosome segments. Several studies have reported copy number changes in ONB including gains at 7q11 and 20q and deletions at 2q, 5q, 6p, 6q, and 18q, as well as novel chromosome aberrations that have not been previously described. In addition, some chromosome regions could be implicated in the tumor progression and metastases formation. These results not only indicate complex molecular processes underlying ONB, but also point to the need for a more detailed molecular characterization of ONBs at different stages of tumor progression.\n\n    Currently only a few studies have investigated genomic landscape of ONBs, using different sequencing techniques. Furthermore, in three of these studies the potential of targeted therapy with specific drugs was explored. Weiss et al. performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on paired normal and tumor DNA from a patient with metastatic ONB. They detected mutations specific only to the metastatic ONB sample (i.e., in KDR, MYC, SIN3B, and NLRC4 genes) as well as mutations present in both, the metastatic and original surgical resection specimens (i.e., in TP53, TAOK2, and MAP4K2 genes). Analyzing cancer genomes from seven rare types of metastatic adolescent and young adult cancers (including ONB) using whole exome sequencing [WES], whole-transcriptome sequencing, or OncoScan , Cha et al. identified TP53 missense mutation in a metastatic ONB sample, as well as a loss-of-function in CDKN2C gene. Based on these results, they proposed CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib and LY2835219, as potential treatment strategies. Similarly, a recent comprehensive genomic study of Gay et al revealed alterations of TP53, PIK3CA, NF1, CDKN2A, and CDKN2C in ONBs. The study of Wang et al. was first to report a case of recurrent ONB treated with a targeted therapy regimen determined after WES. Mutations in EGFR, FGFR2, KDR, and RET genes were detected, therefore the authors utilized a combination of cetuximab and sunitinib.\n\n    Considering the lack of standardized treatment guidelines, the potential advantages of targeted therapy approaches and the paucity of data exploring the molecular pathogenesis of ONB, we explored potentially targetable biomarkers/pathways in a cohort of recurrent or metastatic ONBs, using multiplatform molecular profiling approach. We identified multiple protein biomarkers of response or resistance to classic chemotherapy and targeted therapy that could be useful in optimizing the cytotoxic chemotherapy and further improving personalized treatment of ONB.",
        "Methods": "    This retrospective study included 23 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of the patients with recurrent or metastatic ONB (see S1 Excel File) profiled at the CLIA-certified laboratory, Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, Arizona) in the period 2012-2017. Histologic diagnosis and review of results of immunohistochemical tests performed at the referring institutions to support the diagnosis of ONB were confirmed by a board certified pathologist (Z.G.) and appropriate slides were used for molecular profiling. Microdissection of tumor samples was performed when appropriate to enrich the tumor cell population.\n\n    Caris Life Sciences de-identified, remnant samples provided by participating investigators. Tumor profiling was performed and results were associated to a Subject ID. Because remnant tissue from previous samplings with no associated identifiers were utilized, this research was compliant with 45 CFR 46.101(b). Therefore, the project was deemed exempt from IRB oversight and consent requirements were waived.\n\n    Expression of predictive biomarkers was evaluated immunohistochemically using commercially available antibodies and detection kits by automated staining techniques (Benchmark XT, Ventana, Tucson, AZ): antibodies against androgen receptor (AR) [n = 18], topoisomerases 1 and 2 alpha (TOPO1, TOP2A) [n = 19], estrogen receptor (ER) [n = 18], progesterone receptor (PR) [n = 18], MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (c-MET) [n = 13], human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [n = 19], tyrosine protein c-Kit receptor kinase (c-Kit) [n = 6], epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [n = 5], phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) [n = 18], O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) [n = 19], P-glycoprotein (PGP) [n = 16], thymidylate synthase (TS) [n = 19], transducin-like enhancer of split 3 (TLE3) [n = 12], ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) [n = 15], serum protein acidic and rich in cysteine M (SPARC-M) [n = 13], tubulin beta-3 chain (TUBB3) [n = 14], anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) [n = 4], breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [n = 4], excision repair cross-complementation group 1 protein (ERCC1) [n = 12], multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1) [n = 6], programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) [n = 8], platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) [n = 4], and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) [n = 10], tyrosine receptor kinase (pan-antiNTRK [TrkA+B+C]) [n = 6]. Scoring system and cutoffs for all antibodies were used as described in our previous studies (S1 Table). All IHC assays were run along with both positive and negative controls.\n\n    FISH was used for evaluation of the EGFR status (Vysis LSI EGFR SpectrumOrange/CEP7 Spectrum Green Probe, Abbott) [n = 5] while HER2 [n = 11] and c-MET [n = 9] genes were evaluated using CISH (dual EGFR DNP/CEP 7 DIG probes; INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail; commercially available c-MET and chromosome 7 DIG probe; Ventana, Tucson, AZ) as previously described. The tumors were considered amplified for HER2 when HER2/CEP17 ratio >2; EGFR was amplified when EGFR/CEP7 ratio >2 or >15 EGFR gene copies per cell were observed in >10% of analyzed cells. cMET was amplified if >5 cMET copies on average were observed.\n\n    NGS was performed on genomic DNA isolated from 15 FFPE samples using the Illumina MiSeq platform (La Jolla, CA). The Illumina TruSeq Amplicon:Cancer Panel (TSACP) was used for amplifying specific genomic regions. The NGS panel covering 46 genes were tested on 10 ONB cases while five cases were explored using the extended NGS panel that covers 592 genes (available here: http://www.carismolecularintelligence.com/solid_tumors_international).\n\n    For selected regions of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), c-KIT, EGFR, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) genes Sanger sequencing was also used.\n\n    Six recent ONB cases were tested for gene fusions using Archer FusionPlex Solid Tumor Kit with Illumina MiSeq (Table 1, S2 Table, and online: http://www.carismolecularintelligence.com/solid_tumors_international).\n\n    Whole-genome expression (RNA) was analyzed in four samples using Illumina cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension and ligation (DASL) process with the HumanHT-12 v4 beadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The RNA used for this analysis was extracted from FFPE samples by the Qiagen kit. The control used in this study consisted of three nerve RNAs from three healthy individuals pooled into a single sample. The over and under expression of transcripts in ONB samples were determined by taking the ratio of transcript in each ONB over the control. Transcripts were identified as significant if all the four ONB samples had consistently high or low ratio of expression when compared to control.",
        "Results": "    The study included 23 patients (10 male and 13 female patients, age range: 29-84 years) with recurrent or metastatic ONB, profiled at Caris CLIA-certified laboratory in the period 2012-2017 (Table 1, S1-S3 Excel Files).\n\n    The IHC, ISH, and sequencing results are summarized in Fig 1, Table 1 and S2 Excel File.\n\n    No cases expressed PD-L1 (0/10). Multiple protein biomarkers of response or resistance to classic chemotherapy drugs were identified: PD-1 positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in 25% (2/8), low ERCC1 (cisplatin sensitivity in 83% (10/12), high TOPO1 (irinotecan sensitivity in 63% [12/19], high TUBB3 (vincristine resistance in 93% [13/14] (Fig 2F), and high MRP1 (multidrug resistance) in 100% (6/6). Four out of six tested ONBs (67%) were positive for pNTRK (Fig 2E).\n\n    Mutations (pathogenic and variants of unknown significance [VUS]) were detected in 10/16 (63%) ONBs including tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) [3 cases], beta-catenin 1 gene (CTNNB1), EGFR [2 cases, respectively], while single cases harbored Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), cKIT, cMET, Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (PDGFRA), CDH1 (E-cadherin), Fumarate Hydratase (FH) and SMAD4 gene mutations (Table 1). CTNNB1 gene alterations were further evaluated by the IHC (Fig 2C and 2D).\n\n    None of the cases harbored gene amplifications of EGFR, HER2 and cMET genes. Also, gene fusions were not identified in any of the 6 successfully tested ONBs (the panel of fusion genes is available in S2 Table).\n\n    When compared with the control tissue, 21 genes were consistently over-expressed and 19 genes consistently downregulated by an average of 10 fold. Some of the upregulated genes, such as Secretogranin II (SCG2), stem cell marker cluster of differentiation 24 [CD24] (Fig 2A), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), and downregulated genes (ATP-binding cassette transporter 8 [ABCA8] have been described to play a role in different malignancies, and were not hitherto described in ONBs (Table 2). Among the downregulated genes, GHR is a novel observation as most studies associate GHR over-expression as a risk factor for cancer. CD24 gene expression has been confirmed by the IHC (Fig 2B).\n\n    In order to better understand the pathways perturbed in ONB, we extended the list of over- and under-expressed genes to those that were consistently over- and under-expressed by two fold followed by functional classification of these genes using the Panther website (http://pantherdb.org) and the Reactome database (see S3 Excel File for the list of genes). Overall, 183 genes were found to be downregulated and 146 were over-expressed. At the nominal p-value of 0.05, fifty-nine Reactome pathways were shown to be enriched with the 183 downregulated genes in ONB including 10 genes in the organization of extra cellular matrix and 4 genes in the cell junction organization. Pathway analysis of the 146 upregulated genes identified 100 enriched pathways including 13 genes in the Cell Cycle pathway, 10 genes in the TP53 pathway, 8 genes in Chromatin Modifying Enzyme pathway (The list of all enriched pathways can be found in S3 Excel File).",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    Recent studies demonstrated potential therapeutic benefits of comprehensive molecular profiling for the patients with advanced and/or metastatic cancers. In this study, we explored a wide range of potentially targetable biomarkers/pathways in recurrent or metastatic ONB samples using multiple molecular profiling platforms, including IHC, ISH, expression microarray and NGS. The sequencing results showed mutations in TP53 (n = 3/16), CTNNB1 (n = 2/16), EGFR (n = 2/16), APC, cKIT, cMET, PDGFRA, CDH1, FH, and SMAD4 genes (n = 1/16, respectively). Multiple genes within the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway including CTNNB1, APC and CDH1 exhibited mutations within this cohort. Loss-of-function mutations in these genes lead to deregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and excessive stem cell renewal/proliferation, and are associated with metastatic disease. However, we found no targetable Wnt pathway enrichment in our cohort using whole-genome expression assay. The potential of several anti-cancer drugs has been explored by targeting different stages or components of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway with limited success. The role of cKIT and PDGFRA mutations has been, most notably, investigated in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), where these two mutations are mutually exclusive. Imatinib (tyrosine-kinase inhibitor) response in GIST patients depends not only on the protein expression, but also on the type of mutation in KIT and PDGFRA genes. One ONB case in our study had a pathogenic cKIT mutation while another harbored VUS PDGFRA mutation. Both EGFR gene mutations in our study were VUS while EGFR amplification was not observed in any of the tested cases. These results indicate a limited therapeutic benefit of EGFR inhibitors in ONB patients. Mutations in TP53 gene were also detected in other studies that performed DNA sequence analysis in ONB samples. Due to the disease progression in those patients, a role of TP53 mutation as an unfavorable prognostic and predictive factor in ONB has been suggested. Of note, tumors harboring TP53 mutations may be sensitive to WEE kinase inhibitors acting against G2-M checkpoint regulators of the cell cycle WEE1 and CHK1.\n\n    In addition, our microarray analysis revealed up or downregulation of several genes previously implied in carcinogenesis but not previously described in ONBs, including CD24, SCG2, and IGFBP-2 among the upregulated genes, and ABCA8 and GHR among the downregulated genes. In a recent study by Dvorak et al. a comprehensive expression analysis of all members of the ABC transporter genes across multiple cancers showed that ABCA8 downregulation was more observed in higher grade and its upregulation was associated with lower grade tumors. This is consistent with the data presented in our paper that ABCA8 was consistently downregulated in all four high-grade ONB samples. Interestingly, the study by Dvorak et al. was able to show that out of all 49 ABC transporters that were investigated in various tumors, ABCA8 and four others (ABCC7, ABCC8, ABCA3, and ABCA12) were among the most dysregulated ABC genes. ABCA8 has also been studied by others in relation to cancer and it has been found to be downregulated in multidrug resistant ovarian cancer cell lines as well as in breast and prostate cancer. In one study, ABCA8 was found to be upregulated in a subtype of medulloblastoma defined as Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and downregulated in the subtype defined as Wnt signaling. It should be noted that the downregulation of GHR gene in ONB was an unexpected result, as most studies in the literature associate GHR upregulation with increased cancer risk.\n\n    More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) have revolutionized the treatment of many tumors with most remarkable benefits in the patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Our study is the first to report on the lack of PD-L1 expression in ONB samples, which makes these patients less likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs.\n\n    Recently, Gay et al. comprehensively profiled 41 samples of ONBs identifying potential targets in the mTOR, CDK and growth factor signaling pathways. Other, small studies on molecular characteristics of ONB showed variable and largely inconsistent results. In the study of Weiss et al. 119 somatically lost genes and 45 gained or amplified genes were reported in a metastatic ONB sample using whole genome sequencing. Seven somatic short nucleotide variants (SNVs) were validated by Sanger sequencing. Specific mutations in KDR, MYC, SIN3B, and NLRC4 genes were present only in the metastatic ONB sample, while mutations in TP53, TAOK2 and MAP4K2 genes were present in both the metastatic and original surgical resection specimens. Our study confirmed some of these mutations (e.g. TP53) but failed other mutations including MYC mutation. In contrast to other genetic alterations (copy number variations, chromosomal translocations, increased enhancer activity), MYC gene mutations are uncommon, but have been described in some cancers (e.g. lymphomas). Furthermore, the described MYC mutation in ONB has not been verified in the COSMIC database (Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer). Notably, none of our ONB cases harbored MYCN gene amplification, a hallmark of pediatric neuroblastomas. Further studies should definitely elucidate the role of MYC gene(s) in ONBs.\n\n    Using two different genomics platforms, Cha et al. reported a TP53 missense mutation in a metastatic ONB sample and a loss-of-function in CDKN2C gene. Wang et al. detected mutations in EGFR, FGFR2, KDR, and RET genes in a recurrent ONB sample, using WES. In addition, EGFR and KDR genes were over-expressed in the tumor tissue.\n\n    Despite over-expression of the tropomyosin receptor kinase receptor family (NTRK) observed in 4/6 tested ONB cases, we did not detect any fusion of either one of the three NTRK genes (NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3). Cancers with overexpression of NTRK driven by gene fusions had been successfully treated with novel NTRK kinase inhibitors but it remains unclear if a \"constitutive\" overexpression such as this observed in ONB would offer any treatment advantages. Interestingly, one of the cases with NTRK overexpression exhibited TUBB3 positivity and was CD24 positive (Fig 2) indicating a potential therapeutic benefit of retinoid-based therapy.\n\n    ALK (anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase) gene alterations have been reported in various cancers including pediatric neuroblastomas. We found no ALK gene alterations (mutations or fusions) or over-expression of Alk protein in any of the tested ONB cases, so these patients are unlikely to benefit from the ALK inhibitors.\n\n    In several studies, alternative approaches to ONB treatment, especially in metastatic or recurrent cases, have been explored. A combination of cetuximab (a monoclonal antibody to EGFR) and sunitinib (small-molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases [RTKs] including kinase insert domain receptor [KDR], fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 [FGFR2], and RET RTK) was selected as a treatment regimen in a case of recurrent ONB, after WES analysis. One month after this treatment, a complete response was observed in the patient. In another study, a significant improvement of clinical symptoms and disease stabilization for 15 months were observed after treatment with sunitinib in a patient with progressive ONB. Furthermore, imatinib mesylate was reported as a potential second-line treatment for inducing long-term remission in heavily pretreated ONB patients. Young et al. went a step further and explored the efficacy of several combinations of targeted drugs in human ONB cell line TC268. The combinations of AEW541 (insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1] inhibitor) and FS114 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 [S6K1] inhibitor) or sunitinib and FS115 (S6K1 inhibitor) were the most effective according to their results. In addition, Sabongi et al. described a case with multiple recurrences of ONB adjuvantly treated with the radiolabeled-somatostatin analogue, 177Lu-DOTA-TATE. After three cycles of 177Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment, the stabilization of the disease was reported. Finally, Mao et al. investigated the role of SHH signaling pathway in the development of ONB, by treating ONB cell lines (TC-268 and JFEN) with cyclopamine, a selective inhibitor of the SHH pathway. After the cyclopamine treatment, inhibited ONB cell proliferation and colony formation, induced ONB cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, downregulated expression of SHH signaling components, i.e. PTCH1 and Gli1, and CCND1 (cyclin D1, cycle-related regulator), as well as upregulated p21 expression were observed in vitro.\n\n    The efficacy of classic chemotherapy in ONBs remains unclear. Chemotherapy alone, or in combination with radiotherapy, is often limited to advanced and surgically inoperable ONB cases. Our IHC results indicate that several biomarkers may be used in tailoring the classical cytotoxic drugs including cisplatin and irinotecan sensitivity and vincristine resistance.\n\n    Our study have several limitations including a small sample size and lack of clinical (follow-up) data. In addition, all samples were not tested with all methodologies as these have been dynamically changing per molecular testing advances/improvements. This may result in insufficient and biased therapeutic implications.\n\n    Although our data indicate limited therapeutic options in patients with advanced and/or metastatic ONBs, several potential biomarkers that could tailor both targeted (e.g., Wnt and cKIT/PDGFRA) and classical therapeutic options merit further research. The therapeutic benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors are less likely due to the low or lack of PD-1/PD-L1 expression.",

        "Title": "    Tudor Domain Containing Protein 3 Promotes Tumorigenesis and Invasive Capacity of Breast Cancer Cells",
        "Abstract": "    Tudor domain containing protein 3 (TDRD3) is a modular protein identified based on its ability to recognize methylated arginine motifs through its Tudor domain. We have previously shown that TDRD3 localizes to cytoplasmic stress granules, a structure shown to promote survival upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer cells. Here, we report TDRD3 as a novel regulator of cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. Our study also demonstrates that TDRD3 depletion inhibits tumor formation and metastasis to the lung in vivo. Furthermore, we show that TDRD3 regulates the expression of a number of key genes associated with promotion of breast cancer tumorigenesis and disease progression. Strikingly, we report that TDRD3 regulates some of these key targets at the level of translation. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration of a functional role for TDRD3 in promoting breast cancer development and progression, and identify TDRD3 as a potential new therapeutic target for breast cancer.",
        "Introduction": "    Similar to all cancers, breast cancer arises through the dysregulation of cellular pathways regulating sensitivity to growth stimuli, cell proliferation and replication, apoptosis, angiogenesis and tissue invasiveness and metastasis. Although therapeutic options are available, in many instances, tumors become refractory to these treatments and the tumor recurs. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of how dysregulation of cellular homeostasis contributes to development and progression of breast cancer in order to identify molecular targets for novel treatment options.\n\n    Numerous studies have identified dysregulation of arginine methylation as a contributing factor in the development and progression of breast cancer. Accordingly, many of the enzymes that catalyze this post-translational modification, the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), are over-expressed in breast cancer. For example, our group has demonstrated that PRMT7 expression is significantly upregulated in both primary breast tumor tissues and in breast cancer lymph node metastases, identifying PRMT7 as a key player in promoting breast cancer metastatic potential through regulation of MMP9 expression. Similarly, we have previously characterized an alternatively spliced isoform (v2) of PRMT1 that is specifically over-represented in breast cancer and shown that it promotes evasion from apoptosis and metastatic potential in breast cancer cells, at least in part through regulation of beta-Catenin expression. Downstream effects of this post-translational modification are mediated by reader/effector proteins containing Tudor domains, which recognize the methylation mark on arginine residue.\n\n    One such reader/effector protein for arginine methylation is Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3). TDRD3 recognizes dimethyl arginine residues generated by PRMT1 and CARM1 on histones, and other proteins. TDRD3 is a modular protein and harbours several other conserved domains in addition to its Tudor domain. Specifically, the N-terminal region contains a DUF/OB fold domain, a poorly characterized domain thought to mediate interactions with nucleic acids, sugars and/or other proteins. Downstream is an ubiquitin binding domain (UBA), which binds Lys48-linked tetra-ubiquitin (the signal for proteasome degradation of proteins). C-terminal to the Tudor domain is the mapped interaction domain with Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). An exon junction complex binding motif (EBM) follows the FMRP binding domain. The EBM domain allows TDRD3 to interact with various components of early mRNPs, including Y14/Magoh, CBP20/80, and PABP1 (See below). Recognition of histone arginine methylation permits TDRD3 to function as a transcriptional co-activator and regulator of estrogen-mediated gene transcription. In addition, TDRD3 recruits DNA Topoisomerase 3beta (TOP3beta) to the promoter region of target genes promoting their transcription through resolution of R loop structures. Moreover, TDRD3 serves as a scaffold protein in a trimeric complex with TOP3beta and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). This complex when associated with messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) was shown to harbour CBP20/80 but not eIF4E, suggesting that this complex may function in the pioneer round of translation. Furthermore, upon cellular exposure to various environmental stresses, TDRD3 localizes to cytoplasmic stress granules, a structure implicated in cancer cell survival.",
        "Methods": "    Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. 293T and MDA MB 231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Hs578T and MCF7 cells were supplemented with 2.75 microg/ml insulin. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pGIPz TDRD3 shRNA plasmid (RHS4430-200228777) was purchased from Dharmacon. Lentivirus was produced in 293T cells using the lentiviral packaging vectors pMDG.2 and psPAX2. Stably expressing shTDRD3 cell lines were established by selection with 2 microg/mL puromycin.

The Vimentin antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (550513), the GFP antibody from Chromotek (3H9) and the GAPDH antibody from BioLegend (MMS-580S).\n\n    pCMV Myc TDRD3 expression constructs (TDRD3, E691K, DeltaN328, Central Linker, 647-744) were previously described. The pCMV Myc Tudor construct was created through PCR amplification of the Tudor domain, inserting the product into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites. DeltaEBM constructs were generated through restriction digest of TDRD3 with the MscI restriction enzyme. MscI cleaves TDRD3 internally before the EBM domain. DeltaFMRP constructs were generated through mutagenesis with primers flanking the FMRP binding domain: 5'-atcaagcccattcaaggccagccaagacga-3' and 5'-tcgtcttggctggccttgaatgggcttgat-3'. The DeltaTudor construct was created using primer sets that generated PCR products skipping the Tudor domain P1: 5'-caggaaaagggtccctcctttgcagaggc-3' and 5'-ctcccatgcctctgtcttgttgtcttccca-3' and P2: 5'-tgggaagacaacaagacagaggcatgggag-3' and 5'-acctcccacacctccccctgaacc-3'. The PCR products were digested with AanI and ligated back together. TDRD3 was cloned into the pEGFP-C1 expression vector at the EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing.\n\n    MTT assays were performed as previously described. Absorbance was read at 590 nm using a BIOTEK Synergy H1 Multi-Mode Plate Reader.\n\n    Those experiments were performed essentially as we have described previously. For Transwell chamber assays, 24-well BD control or Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers containing 8-micron pores (BD Biosciences) were used to assess cell motility and invasion, respectively, according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 50,000 cells in serum-free DMEM were seeded into each chamber and placed in a 24-well plate containing 500 muL complete DMEM and incubated for 24 h or 72 h. A minimum of four random fields at 20x magnification were counted to determine the number of cells that passed through the chamber membranes.\n\n    Experiments were conducted with the approval of the University of Ottawa Animal Care Committee and Animal Care and Veterinary Services according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.\n\n    Experiments were performed on five week old female CB17.Cg-Prkdc scid Hr hr/IcrCrl (SHC) and Crl:SHO-Prkdc scid Hr hr (SHO) (Charles River, Montreal, Qc, Canada). SHC (n = 3) or SHO (n = 3) mice were subcutaneously injected on opposite flanks with MDA MB 231 cells stably expressing a non-targeting (shControl) or TDRD3-targeting (shTDRD3) shRNA (10 million cells/200 microL PBS). Tumor diameter was measured twice per week using a digital caliper (Marathon Watch Company Ltd, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada). Experiments were terminated when tumor diameter reached 1.7 cm (around 50 days post-injection). Tumor volumes were determined using the formula:\n\n    Six-week-old female NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/JSCID mice (Charles River, Montreal, QC, Canada) were injected intravenously in the tail vein with MDA MB 231 cells stably expressing luciferase and shControl or luciferase and shTDRD3 (500 000 cells/100 microL PBS). Imaging and analysis of lung tumor nodule formation were performed as previously described.\n\n    Immunoblotting were performed as previously described.\n\n    RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis was performed as previously described. RT-qPCR was performed in a CFX384 Touch qPCR (Bio-Rad) using IQTM Sybr Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). PCR reactions were performed in triplicate with data acquisition and analysis performed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager data software. GAPDH was used as an endogenous reference gene. Primer pairs are listed in Supplemental Table S1.\n\n    MDA MB 231 cells were infected with shControl or shTDRD3 expressing lentivirus for 96 hours. Sucrose gradient fractionation was performed as previously described. RNA was isolated from fractions and percent mRNA association was determined by qPCR using the delta delta (Ct) value. Primer pairs are listed in Supplemental Table S1.\n\n    DNA: protein complexes were cross-linked using 0.75% formaldehyde for 10min. Reactions were quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min, and cells were lysed using FA Lysis Buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). DNA was sonicated using a Covaris S220 Ultra-Sonicator and immunoprecipitation reactions were performed overnight using 25 microg. Samples were incubated for 2 h with protein A/G agarose beads (pre-blocked with 75 ng/microl beads of salmon sperm DNA and 100 ng/microl beads of BSA). Beads were washed sequentially using wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0), final wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0). Samples were eluted from beads with Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM NaHCO3) for 15 min at 30  C, reverse cross-linked overnight at 65  C, and incubated with 20 microg RNase A and 40 microg proteinase K for 1 h at 45  C.

Primer pairs are listed in Supplemental Table S1.\n\n    Two-tailed t-tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine statistical significance. A minimum of three independent biological replicates was performed for each experiment.",
        "Results": "    It has previously been demonstrated that TDRD3 can act as a co-activator of estrogen-mediated transcription, therefore, we examined whether alteration of TDRD3 expression in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF7 breast cancer cells may affect cell proliferation. To investigate this possibility, pools of MCF7 cells expressing a non-targeting (shControl) or a TDRD3-targeting (shTDRD3) shRNA were established (Supplemental Fig. 1a). Using MTT assays to measure cell growth over time, we observed that TDRD3 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation in two independently selected pools of MCF7 cells (shTDRD3-1, shTDRD3-2) (Fig. 1a). Since TDRD3 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation in MCF7 cells, we next examined whether TDRD3 overexpression could enhance cell proliferation. As predicted, MCF7 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged TDRD3 (Supplemental Fig. 1b) displayed increased proliferation relative to parental cells transfected with an empty vector control (Fig. 1b). Based on these results we next investigated whether TDRD3 could also affect cell proliferation in ER- breast cancer cells. Pools of TDRD3 knockdown cells were established as above (Supplemental Fig. 1c) using MDA MB 231 and Hs578T ER- breast cancer cell lines. In both MDA MB 231 and Hs578T cells, TDRD3 depletion in two independently selected pools of cells (shTDRD3-1, shTDRD3-2) resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation, as demonstrated using MTT assays (Fig. 1c and d, respectively). Taken together, these results indicate that TDRD3 can regulate cell growth regardless of estrogen receptor status in breast cancer cells.\n\n    To assess whether modulating TDRD3 levels could affect tumor growth in vivo, a mouse xenograft model was used. MDA MB 231 cells stably expressing either shControl or shTDRD3 (Supplemental Fig. 1d and e) were subcutaneously injected into the flank of two distinct lines of scid mice, Crl:SHO-Prkdc scid Hr hr (SHO) and CB17.Cg-Prkdc scid Hr hr/IcrCrl (SHC). Injections were performed bi-laterally in these mice to allow for a direct comparison of the growth of these cells in the same mouse. The knockdown of TDRD3 in MDA MB 231 cells resulted in a significant decrease in xenograft tumor growth rate in both mouse models used. In SHO mice, a significant impairment in tumor growth with TDRD3 knockdown was observed at 31 days post injection. At endpoint (46 days), the mean tumor volume observed with TDRD3 knockdown cells was 14.5-fold smaller relative to controls (Fig. 1e and f). Likewise, in the SHC mice, a significant decrease in tumor volume was observed with TDRD3 knockdown beginning at 38 days post-injection. At endpoint, the tumors formed in these mice by the cells expressing shTDRD3 were 2.7-fold smaller than those formed by the control cells (Fig. 1e and g). These results thus demonstrate that TDRD3 is required for efficient growth of breast cancer xenograft tumors.\n\n    The capacity of cancer cells to metastasize to distant sites within the body is dependent on enhanced motility and ability to invade beyond the epithelial basal lamina and extracellular space. In order to determine whether TDRD3 could regulate these hallmarks, Transwell chamber assays were used. First, whether TDRD3 could promote increased motility and invasion in weakly invasive MCF7 cells was determined. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with either Myc- (Fig. 2a, left panel) or GFP-tagged (Fig. 2a, right panel) TDRD3 or empty vector. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were plated in motility and invasion chambers for 72 hours. Myc-tagged TDRD3 expression resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in invasion, whereas GFP-tagged TDRD3 promoted a 2.8-fold increase (Fig. 2b and c). Likewise, Myc- and GFP-tagged TDRD3 expression resulted in a 2.1 and 2.8-fold increase in cell motility, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2a and b). Similar results were obtained using MCF7 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged TDRD3, where overexpression resulted in a 3.4-fold increase in motility (Supplemental Fig. 2c), and a 3.7-fold increase in invasion (Supplemental Fig. 2d). Importantly, these results show that increased TDRD3 expression was sufficient to confer increased motility and invasive properties to intrinsically weakly invasive MCF7 cells.\n\n    Next, we sought to determine whether TDRD3 was required to maintain the highly metastatic properties of triple-negative breast cancer cells. Transwell chamber assays were performed using MDA MB 231 and Hs578T cells stably expressing a TDRD3 shRNA. Cells were plated in motility and invasion chambers for 24 hours. In MDA MB 231 cells, TDRD3 depletion (shTDRD3-1, shTDRD3-2) resulted in a 1.4-fold decrease in motility (Supplemental Fig. 2e), and a 2.6 to 4.8-fold decrease in invasion (Fig. 2d). Similarly, in Hs578T cells, TDRD3 knockdown resulted in a 2.1 to 2.3-fold decrease in invasion (Fig. 2e). However, no decrease in motility was observed (Supplemental Fig. 2f).\n\n    In order to gain mechanistic insight into the function of TDRD3 in promoting breast cancer cell invasion, and to mitigate the possibility of any off-target effects of shRNAs, TDRD3 expression was rescued in MDA MB 231 TDRD3 deficient cells. Specifically, a series of myc-tagged TDRD3 deletion constructs and mutant alleles (Fig. 3a) were transfected into MDA MB 231 shTDRD3 cells for 48 h (Fig. 3b) and Transwell chamber assays were performed after an additional 24 h. As expected, and consistent with a specific effect of TDRD3 in cell invasion, full length myc-TDRD3 was able to fully rescue cell invasion (Fig. 3c). Similarly, invasion was rescued using a GFP-tagged TDRD3 construct (Supplemental Fig. 3). Interestingly, neither the E691K mutant allele, which abrogates TDRD3's ability to recognize methyl arginines, nor constructs lacking the Tudor domain were able to rescue invasion (Fig. 3c). This insinuates that TDRD3's ability to recognize methylated arginine residues through its Tudor domain is somehow required for its activity in promoting increased cell invasion. However, the Tudor domain alone was not sufficient to rescue cell invasion. In fact, only the full length wild type construct was able to fully rescue in these experiments (Fig. 3c). Altogether, these results indicate that an intact TDRD3, capable of taking part in interactions with for example TOP3beta, components of the EJC, and/or FMRP, is required to promote cell invasion in breast cancer cells. This also suggests that both TDRD3's known nuclear (transcriptional co-activator) and cytoplasmic (stress granules) roles are potentially part of the mechanism.\n\n    To determine if TDRD3 exudes a similar effect on invasion, in vivo, a lung metastasis mouse model was employed. This model measures the ability of human cancer cells, which are injected intravenously into the tail vein of immune-compromised mice to migrate through the blood stream, invade the lungs, and form tumour nodules. MDA MB 231 cells stably expressing Control or TDRD3-targeting shRNAs (Fig. 4a) were infected with lentivirus expressing a luciferase cDNA, allowing these cells to be detected using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Control and shTDRD3 cells were injected into the tail vein of NOD.CB17-PrkdcSCID/NrcCrl SCID mice and in vivo imaging was performed, eight and fifty days post-injection. No signal was detected for either group at the eight day time-point (Fig. 4b) and this was taken as the basal bioluminescence level. The extent of lung metastasis was then evaluated 50 days post injection and, as expected, the bioluminescent signal (radiance) was localized to the lung area. Importantly, mice injected with TDRD3-depleted cells showed a drastically reduced bioluminescent signal compared to those injected with control shRNA expressing cells (Fig. 4b). As a non-biased approached to measure the metastatic tumor burden within the lungs, the bioluminescent signal for each mouse was quantitated and the mean radiance for each group was determined. This assessment showed that the group injected with TDRD3 knockdown cells had a significantly lower mean radiance compared to the control cells (Fig. 4c), thus indicating a reduction in the metastatic potential of cells in vivo with reduced TDRD3 levels. At endpoint (50 days), mice were sacrificed, the lungs were excised and stained with India ink, and the number of tumor nodules determined. Consistent with the bioluminescent data, a significant decrease in lung nodule formation was observed in the lungs of mice injected with shTDRD3 expressing cells (Fig. 4d and e). These results demonstrate that TDRD3 is required to promote breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis to the lungs.\n\n    Since altered TDRD3 expression affected cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs in vivo, we investigated whether TDRD3 depletion altered the expression of proteins commonly associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic potential in breast cancer. MDA MB 231 cells were infected with lentivirus expressing TDRD3 or control shRNAs, cells were harvested and total RNA was isolated. RT-qPCR analysis was performed and revealed a significant decrease in the mRNA levels of MYC proto-oncogene (MYC), a known target of TDRD3, but also for Vimentin (VIM), Snail (SNAI1), Slug (SNAI2), and beta-Catenin (CTNNB1) mRNAs (Fig. 5a). Accordingly, TDRD3 knockdown resulted in a decrease in protein expression of VIM, SNAI1, SNAI2, CTNNB1 and MYC (Fig. 5b). In contrast, depletion of TDRD3 had no effect on expression of E-Cadherin (CDH1) or Fibronectin (FN1) (Fig. 5a and b). These results demonstrate that TDRD3 is a novel regulator of key genes known to be involved EMT and metastasis in breast cancer cells.\n\n    To assess whether TDRD3 may regulate these novel targets at the level of transcription, Myc epitope-tagged TDRD3 was exogenously expressed in MDA MB 231 cells, and Myc antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate Myc-TDRD3 from cell lysate and perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. Exogenous TDRD3 expression was performed as efficient and specific immunoprecipitation of endogenous TDRD3 was not achievable in our hands using available antibodies. As above, the previous documented presence of TDRD3 at the MYC promoter was used as a positive control for our ChIP experiments (Fig. 5c). This analysis also revealed enriched occupancy of TDRD3 at the promoters of CTNNB1 and VIM genes (Fig. 5c). In contrast, no enrichment was observed at the promoters of SNAI2 or SNAI1, suggesting that these two targets may be regulated by TDRD3 through a distinct mechanism.\n\n    As a first step towards determining whether TDRD3 affected levels of SNAI2 and/or SNAI1 through an RNA-related mechanism, we assessed whether TDRD3 associated with these mRNAs, using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). Again, MDA MB 231 cells transiently expressing Myc epitope-tagged TDRD3 were used for these experiments (Fig. 5d, right panel). Strikingly, RIP experiments revealed an association of TDRD3 with both SNAI2 and SNAI1 mRNAs, but not with GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 5d, left panel). Furthermore, TDRD3 was found to also bind CTNNB1 and VIM mRNAs (Fig. 5d, left panel), suggesting that for these targets, TDRD3 may remain associated, directly or indirectly, with the RNA beyond a transcriptional or co-transcriptional step.\n\n    We have been the first to report that TDRD3 associates with polyribosomes and can be found in cytoplasmic stress granules, findings that have since been corroborated by other groups. Nevertheless, a direct role for TDRD3 in translation has not been demonstrated. Based on our results with Slug and Snail, we investigated whether TDRD3 may regulate the expression of these mRNAs at the translational level. MDA MB 231 cells were infected with lentivirus expressing either a TDRD3 or control shRNA and post-nuclear supernatants were subjected to sucrose gradient sedimentation (Supplemental Fig. 4a), essentially as we have previously reported. RNA was isolated from monosome and polysome fractions and relative mRNA distribution determined by RT-qPCR. Strikingly, TDRD3 depletion resulted in a drastic shift in SLUG mRNA distribution, from predominantly heavy polysomal to monosome fractions (Fig. 6a), suggesting that TDRD3 is required for efficient translation of SNAI2  mRNA. This result was confirmed by plotting the mean SNAI2 mRNA distribution from four independent experiments, using pooled monosomal vs polysomal fractions (Fig. 6b). A similar tendency was observed for SNAI1 mRNA, although statistical significance was not quite achieved (p = 0.0518; Fig. 6c,d). Interestingly, statistically significant shifts from polysomal to monosome fractions were observed for CTNNB1 and VIM mRNA in TDRD3 depleted MDA MB 231 cells (Fig. 6e-h, respectively). In contrast, no difference in polysome profile distribution was observed for MYC mRNA between control and shTDRD3 MDA MB 231 cells (Supplemental Fig. 4b,c). Taken together, our results show that TDRD3 can selectively promote translation of a specific subset of mRNAs in breast cancer cells.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    We have documented in the current study a novel role for TDRD3 in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in breast cancer cells. Specifically, dysregulation of TDRD3 expression altered cell proliferation in culture, with depletion impeding tumor xenografts growth in mice. In highly aggressive breast cancer cells, knockdown resulted in decreased cell invasion and reduced lung metastasis, while in weakly metastatic cells, overexpression of TDRD3 was sufficient to confer to them the ability to invade through an extracellular-like matrix. We show that TDRD3 promotes the expression of a number of genes known to be crucial players in the EMT process in breast cancer cells, including SNAI1, SNAI2, CTNNB1 and VIM. Lastly, we demonstrate, for the first time, that TDRD3 regulates the expression of at least some of these genes at the level of translation.\n\n    In previous studies, TDRD3 was shown to act as a transcriptional co-activator at estrogen receptor dependent promoters. While MCF7 breast cancer cells were used for those experiments, the potential influence of TDRD3 on the cancer-related features of these cells was never explored. We report here that TDRD3 promoted efficient cell growth in ER+ MCF7 cells, but importantly, it also exerted this effect in two different ER- breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, TDRD3 depletion in these cells drastically impeded tumor growth in mouse xenograft experiments. This suggests that TDRD3 may regulate cell growth through more than one mechanism. Interestingly, TDRD3 is enriched at the MYC promoter, functioning as a co-activator of MYC-mediated gene transcription, and promotes the recruitment of a topoisomerase (TOP3beta) to chromatin in order to prevent R loop accumulation. As previously reported, Myc mRNA expression was reduced upon TDRD3 knockdown in MCF7 cells, a phenotype also observed here in MDA MB 231 cells. Since increased MYC expression is oncogenic and a driver of uncontrolled cell proliferation in many cancers including breast cancer, it is conceivable that TDRD3 may regulate breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth at least in part through this pathway. Intriguingly, TDRD3 is also a transcriptional target of MYC, suggesting that it may function as part of a feed-forward mechanism sustaining high Myc expression. In future experiments, it would be interesting to explore the potential beneficial effect of targeting and reducing TDRD3 expression in cancers known to be 'addicted' to MYC over-expression.\n\n    Our current study has also uncovered a role for TDRD3 in promoting increased cell motility and invasion in vitro, and metastasis to the lung in an experimental metastasis model in vivo. Again, these effects were observed in both ER+ luminal cells (MCF7) as well as triple negative cells (e.g. MDA MB 231). Intriguingly, however, TDRD3 knockdown did not affect cell motility in Hs578T cells. This suggests that TDRD3 may regulate motility through more than one molecular mechanism and/or could reflect intrinsic differences in the signaling pathways active in each of these cell lines, although they are both of the Claudin-low subtype. Our demonstration that TDRD3 promotes high metastatic potential may explain, at least in part, the fact that it was identified as a top hit in two separate unbiased genomic studies searching for gene expression signatures correlating with poor prognosis in late stage disease of triple-negative breast cancers.\n\n    Using a candidate approach, we have identified in the current study a number of novel target genes regulated by TDRD3, including beta-Catenin, Vimentin, Snail, and Slug. beta-Catenin expression is enriched in highly aggressive, metastatic breast tumors and is associated with an overall decrease in patient survival. Furthermore, its expression is necessary for cell migration and invasion in highly aggressive breast cancer cell lines. Vimentin is a component of intermediate filaments and its involvement in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion is well characterized. Increased vimentin expression in cancer cells is also indicative of a mesenchymal cell phenotype. In breast epithelial cells, the transcription factors SNAIL and SLUG are key central regulators of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition program promoting metastasis, drug resistance, and stem cell traits. Although CDH1 is a known transcriptional target downstream of SNAIL and SLUG, we have not observed any increase in CDH1 mRNA or protein expression. This may be due to the documented methylation occurring on the promoter of CDH1 in MDA MB 231 cells, thus inhibiting E-CADHERIN expression. Alternatively, TDRD3 may regulate CDH1 by affecting its localization at the plasma membrane, a mechanism also known to take place during EMT. We have detected TDRD3, using ChIP, in the promoter region of CTNNB1 and VIM. Interestingly, the VIM locus is known to undergo R-loop formation, with resolution promoting its active transcription, although the mechanism by which R-loop resolution is mediated was not determined. It is thus a possibility that TDRD3 may recruit TOP3beta to its locus in order to resolve R-loop formation and promotes its efficient transcription. However, to date, evidence of R loop formation on the promoter of CTNNB1 is lacking. Finally, we cannot exclude that TDRD3 may also promote cell invasion and metastasis through its regulation of MYC transcription as described above.\n\n    Although our results strongly suggest that TDRD3 regulates CTNNB1 and VIM expression at the transcriptional level, we have uncovered that it also promotes their efficient translation, as well as that of SNAI2. For SNAI1, an effect of reduced TDRD3 expression on its translation was not as pronounced, and did not quite reach statistical significance. Since TDRD3 was not found at the SNAI1 promoter, but was present in association with SNAI1 mRNA, TDRD3 may regulate this target at the level of mRNA stability, although this would require further investigation. A cytoplasmic role for TDRD3 was first proposed by us and Utz Fischer's group in 2008 when it was shown to be a novel protein re-localizing to so-called 'stress granules' upon cell exposure to various environmental stresses. These foci are tightly coupled to translational regulation and are thought to represent sites of mRNA triage influencing post-transcriptional gene expression programs through selective translation and mRNA stability. Stress granules have also been linked with cancer, potentially contributing to tumor survival and chemoresistance, so it would be interesting in future studies to investigate whether re-location of TDRD3 to these structures is part of its role in breast cancer. In addition to its presence within stress granules, TDRD3 was also found to associate with polyribosomes. Although this previous work led to the proposition that TDRD3 may somehow participate in translational regulation, our current study provides the first experimental demonstration that TDRD3 can regulate translation of specific mRNAs.\n\n    TDRD3 is thought to exist in cells mostly as part of a trimeric protein complex, with TOP3beta and Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). The functional relevance of this trimeric complex has so far been studied mostly in the context of neuronal cells, where it was shown to contribute to an expression program important for synapse formation and normal neurodevelopment and mental health. TDRD3 was postulated to function as a scaffolding protein in this trimeric complex. Our in vitro invasion rescue experiments indeed demonstrated a requirement for the N-terminal portion of TDRD3 (DeltaN169), which mediates its interaction with TOP3beta, and the FMRP-interacting motif (DeltaFMRP) to promote cell invasion. Interestingly, FMRP was recently shown to promote breast cancer cell invasion and lung metastasis through regulation of specific mRNAs involved in EMT, including Vimentin mRNA. However, in contrast to our results, E-Cadherin was amongst the mRNAs that were regulated by FMRP. While FMRP has been implicated in breast cancer progression, to date, a role for TOP3beta has yet to be documented. Thus, our results suggest that TDRD3's function within the trimeric complex with TOP3beta and FMRP may be target-specific. Whether TDRD3's function in breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis is dependent on its involvement in the trimeric complex will require further experimentation.\n\n    Our results show that TDRD3's ability to recognize dimethyl arginine residues is required to rescue efficient breast cancer cell invasive potential as DeltaTudor or E691K mutant alleles were not able to rescue invasion. Since the Tudor domain is involved in mediating arginine methylation-dependent interactions, this suggests that one or more PRMT(s) may be implicated upstream of TDRD3 in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, PRMT1 and CARM1, for which TDRD3 is thought to act as a downstream reader/effector molecule, have both been shown to promote various hallmarks of breast cancer. Of particular interest is our previous work showing that a predominantly cytoplasmic isoform of PRMT1, PRMT1v2, specifically promotes metastatic potential and survival of breast cancer cells. So, it will be important in future studies to explore whether TDRD3 and specific PRMTs act in the same pathway(s) to promote breast cancer development and disease progression.",

        "Title": "    Marine Natural Products from Indonesian Waters",
        "Abstract": "    Natural products are primal and have been a driver in the evolution of organic chemistry and ultimately in science. The chemical structures obtained from marine organisms are diverse, reflecting biodiversity of genes, species and ecosystems. Biodiversity is an extraordinary feature of life and provides benefits to humanity while promoting the importance of environment conservation. This review covers the literature on marine natural products (MNPs) discovered in Indonesian waters published from January 1970 to December 2017, and includes 732 original MNPs, 4 structures isolated for the first time but known to be synthetic entities, 34 structural revisions, 9 artifacts, and 4 proposed MNPs. Indonesian MNPs were found in 270 papers from 94 species, 106 genera, 64 families, 32 orders, 14 classes, 10 phyla, and 5 kingdoms. The emphasis is placed on the structures of organic molecules (original and revised), relevant biological activities, structure elucidation, chemical ecology aspects, biosynthesis, and bioorganic studies. Through the synthesis of past and future data, huge and partly undescribed biodiversity of marine tropical invertebrates and their importance for crucial societal benefits should greatly be appreciated.",
        "Introduction": "    Natural products have been the core of the evolution of organic chemistry. About 40 molecules have been detected that have had revolutionary effects and become indispensable for human society. In particular, three MNPs, (+)-palytoxin, (+)-brevetoxin B, and (-)-ecteinascidin 743, are engines for its development. The beautiful and challenging structures of MNPs have been disclosed by several methods, including classic and modern structure elucidation, even though they are often available only in invisibly small amounts and have unprecedented properties in nature. This is becoming the predominant task of organic chemistry.\n\n    MNPs are defined as secondary metabolites produced by marine organisms, both macro- and microorganisms, as responses that are part of their defense strategies, responses to the food chain, or as communication signals with their environment. Moreover, these functions are related to biodiversity, which is considered an important key for obtaining diverse metabolites, the structures of which are responsible for the characteristics of a vast range of chemical reactions, both in living and non-living systems.\n\n    Biodiversity generally refers to the number of species living in a particular ecosystem. The accepted number of species on land is 0.45-1.9 million, while the species richness in the oceans is estimated to be 0.30-10 million. Some of the highest concentrations of species are located in the tropical region. Due to high diversity of species, and hence the high competition for survival, MNPs exhibit chemical structures and biological activities that are different from those of traditionally investigated terrestrial natural products. The uniqueness of skeletons, functional groups (FGs) and remote chiral centers are some features of MNPs that are presented in this review.\n\n    To date, eight marine-derived natural products have been recorded as approved drugs, of which seven molecules have been used to date. (-)-Ecteinascidin 743 (Yondelis ) was derived directly from the Caribbean ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata (the true producer was recently established as gamma-proteobacterial endosymbiont Candidatus endoecteinascidia frumentensis). The molecule is used for treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma and for treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer when combined with liposomal doxorubicin. The peptide omega-conotoxin MVIIa (Prialt ) from the venom of the cone snail Conus magus is used for analgesic treatment. The anticancer agent (-)-eribulin mesylate (Halaven ) is a synthetic truncated derivative of the polyketide halichondrin B, a super-carbon chain compound isolated from the Japanese sponge Halichondria okadai. The last approved anticancer drug related to MNPs is the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris ). It consists of a tumor-specific antibody and the pentapeptide auristatin E, a derivative of dolastatin 10 derived from the Indian sea hare Dolabella auricularia. The molecule is used for the treatment of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) in those who have received prior systemic therapy. In addition, the ADC is used to treat untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with chemotherapy. A mixture of two ethyl esters of fish-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentanaenoic acid (EPA) was approved under the trade name Lovaza  and is used for reducing serum triglycerides. Iota-carrageenan (Carragelose ), isolated from red algae Eucheuma/ Cnondrus, works as an anti-viral barrier in the nasal cavity. Two nucleosides, the anticancer agent (+)-cytarabine (Cytosar ) and the antiviral drug against herpes simplex virus (-)-vidarabine (Vira-A ) are derivatives of spongothymidine and spongouridine from the Caribbean sponge Tethya crypta, respectively. (-)-Vidarabine (Vira-A ) has been discontinued in the US and in Europe.\n\n    The structural diversities of natural products affording unique pharmacological or physiological activities and intricate structures have contributed to breakthroughs in basic (i.e., organic) chemistry and applied sciences (e.g., marine biotechnology), and have even led to a few Nobel Prizes. Ultimately, the diversity of chemicals and biological activities can provide excellent tools for other scientific fields, including biology, agriculture, medicine, materials, energy, and the environment. These facts have made marine organisms attractive targets for research endeavors.\n\n    Indonesia is located at one of the centers of biodiversity hotspots, endowed with a coral reef triangle, and is an epicenter of marine biodiversity covering 10.36 million km2 of ocean and coastal waters surrounding Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Timor Leste, and Australia. The country consists of 34 provinces (Figure 1) and surrounding water areas encompassing 5.79 million km2, of which 1.08% or 62,600 km2 is protected as national parks. The features of this area include not only species richness, endemism and habitat diversity, but its relatively pristine condition. An understanding of the fundamental biodiversity gained through investigation of bioactive molecules is required by having skills to do individual chemical investigations with small specimens to reduce costs and to minimize environmental impact. Another way is to use fermentation and culture of marine microbes. Although permission to collect and export specimens has been given, researchers must be aware and respectful of indigenous knowledge and cultural sensitivities. Chemists are not yet adept at easily creating molecules with high potency for use as medicines, whereas nature has an enormous, almost incomprehensible, capacity for diversity and adaptation. Perhaps the most important way of solving biodiversity problems is through the synthesis of past and future data not only on the basis of taxonomic and spatial distribution, but also through chemical and biological:including ecological and genetic, as well as medicinal:perspectives. This would be in tandem with national and international collaborative research programs. The wise use of cutting-edge technology and access to biodiversity through benefit-sharing agreements are believed to conserve our global ecosystems while advancing science.\n\n    Although Indonesian MNPs have been reviewed, there is no comprehensive review from the earliest research of Indonesian MNPs to the present. The earliest observation of marine products was realized by poisoning with clupeoid fish, while the first MNP discovered in Indonesian waters was (-)-25-hydroxy-24xi-methylcholesterol 1, isolated in 1972 (Figure 2).\n\n    To provide a current status of Indonesian MNPs, we performed a literature review of new chemical structures found in Indonesian waters, including their chemistry, biological activities, spatio-temporal dimensions, taxonomy, and dissemination of information from marine macro- and microorganisms published during the period January 1970-December 2017. An estimated 15,500 new MNPs were discovered worldwide between 1970 and 2010, among which about 486 new molecules (3.1%) were found in Indonesia. In the period 1990-2009, the number of new MNPs worldwide was 9812, while that from Indonesian waters was 406 (4.1%). The present work covered a total of 732 original MNPs, with 4 known to be synthetic compounds, 34 revised, and 9 unnatural MNPs, from January 1970 to December 2017 (Figure 3A). In addition, 43 MNPs were isolated as mixtures, while 130 MNPs were reported with incomplete stereochemistry. Of 732 MNPs, none of them has been approved or is under clinical trial.\n\n    Before 1990, the exploration trend of Indonesian MNPs was relatively steady; however, after 1990 the discovery of new molecules has increased significantly (Figure 3B). More specifically, in the period of 1970-1979, 31 terpenoids were the only MNPs reported. In the next decade, 1980-1989, the structural types of Indonesian MNPs were alkaloids (4 molecules) and polyketides (2 molecules). From 1990 to 1999, the numbers of Indonesian MNPs were: 27 terpenoids, 19 alkaloids, 11 polyketides, 5 peptides, 1 fatty acid, and 1 carbohydrate. The discovery of new Indonesian MNPs was at its highest in the period 2000-2009, with 139 terpenoids, 121 alkaloids, 44 polyketides, 30 peptides, and 8 fatty acids. In the current decade, 2010-2017, the structural types of Indonesian MNPs were 116 alkaloids, 79 terpenoids, 64 polyketides, 25 peptides, 4 fatty acids, and 1 carbohydrate. Alongside improvement of techniques for structure elucidation, separation, and synthesis, the increased number of bioactive Indonesian MNPs in the last two decades may be due to logistical ease, as many Indonesian biodiversity hotspots are in remote areas.\n\n    The original Indonesian MNPs were reported in 266 papers in 39 different journals. Among them, J. Nat. Prod. is placed for top tier dissemination (296 molecules, 40.4%) followed by Tetrahedron (103 molecules, 14.1%), Tetrahedron Lett. (42 molecules, 5.7%), and J. Org. Chem. (41 molecules, 5.6%) (Figure 3C). Of 266 papers, 117 papers (44.0%) were written by local researchers who are affiliated with Indonesian research centers/universities.\n\n    The chemical diversity of Indonesian MNPs has been analyzed with respect to carbon skeleton, functional group, rare motif, and atomic diversity. New carbon skeletons were observed in 28 molecules, while rare FGs and motifs were found in 18 and 44 molecules, respectively (Figure 4). A few examples of new carbon skeletons can be seen in vannusal A (198), halioxepine (281), manadomanzamine A (318), and phormidolide (702), while rare FGs and motifs can be seen in sinulasulfone (44), polycarpaurine C (487), siladenoserinol A (505), lanesoic acid (541), and petroquinone A (734), to name a few. In this review, the MNPs are organized into their structural types, consisting of 276 terpenoids (37.7%), 260 alkaloids (35.5%), 60 peptides (8.2%), 13 fatty acids and linear molecules (1.8%), 121 polyketides (16.5%), and 2 carbohydrates (0.3%) (Figure 4B). Among 97 chemical types of Indonesian MNPs, piperidine alkaloids (48 molecules), tyrosine alkaloids (38 molecules), indole alkaloids (37 molecules), aromatic polyketides (34 molecules), and quinones (33 molecules) are listed as the top five chemical types (Figure 4C).\n\n    The evaluation of atomic diversity within Indonesian MNPs (Figure 4D) shows that 27 molecules (written in red numbers) contain 6 different atoms in 1 molecule, while the majority (326 molecules) contain 3 different atoms in 1 molecule. Most of them contain C, H, O, N, with the addition of Br and I (4 molecules), as in enisorine E (438), agelanesins B (464) and D (466), 1-O-methylhemibastadinol 4 (440); Br and Cl (1 molecule), as in diazonamide E (611); Br and S, as in mauritamides D (462), B (467) and C (468); Cl and S (4 molecules), as in dysithiazolamide (552), biakamides A-D (742-745); P and S (12 molecules), as in siladenoserinols A-L (505-516); Na and S (1 molecule), as in cupolamide A (564). Of 732 molecules, 373 (51.0%) are nitrogenous molecules. Further inspection of the atomic diversity indicated that 122 molecules (16.7%) possess a ratio of H/C < 1, which is often challenging with respect to structure elucidation. The smallest H/C was found in cadiolide B (679) (H/C = 0.4). In terms of molecular weight, the biggest MNP is kakelokelose (747), with an estimated molecular weight of between 3 and 500 kDa, while the smallest MNP was plakofuranolactone (683), at 172 Da. The biggest unsaturation number (Un) 43 of petroquinones A (734) and B (735) is composed of 16 rings and 27 double bonds, while the smallest is 1 in strepsiamides A-C (518-520).\n\n    The chemical diversity of Indonesian MNPs can also be reflected by the use of several orthogonal-tactic-classic and modern structure elucidations describing the nature of Indonesian MNPs, such as molecular size, complexity, and type and distribution of functional groups. Having a single crystal molecule, the structure elucidation task is more straightforward and secured to perform by employing X-ray crystallography to reveal the 2D and 3D molecular structure, including absolute configuration and conformation. Of 732 original MNPs, 30 MNPs were determined by X-ray crystallography in combination with other spectroscopic data. In addition, three revised MNPs, vannusal B (199b), trans, trans-[D-allo-ile] ceratospongamide (566b) and 659b, were securely determined with the aid of X-ray diffraction.\n\n    The presence and position of nitrogen atoms and their correlations to hydrogen or carbon atoms within the molecules can be detected by 15N NMR and NH-HMBC as in manadomanzamine A (318), neo-kauluamine (321), lanesoic acid (541), polycarpathiamine A (544), sintokamide A (553), and cis, cis-ceratospongamide (565), while P-containing molecules can be evaluated by the use of 31P NMR as in siladenoserinol A (505). The planar structure of the 10-membered polysulfur ring, as in lissoclibadin 1 (498), could be elucidated by applying NOEs with a combination of other tactics such as quantum chemical calculation (QCC). The presence of a sulfate group can be detected by infrared (IR) and confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS)/MS fragmentation, as in polycarpaurines B and C (497-498).\n\n    For cyclic molecules with rigid three- to six-membered rings, their relative stereochemistry can be elucidated by analyzing 1H-1H spin coupling constants (3JHH), chemical shifts and NOEs. For geometrically flexible molecules such as multiple stereocenters of acyclic chains or macrocycles, it cannot be concluded with NOEs. To handle such molecules, NMR-based approaches including J-based configuration analysis (JBCA), universal NMR database (UDB), theoretical calculation of NMR parameters and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were applied as tools to determine the relative configuration of natural products. Of 732 molecules, relative stereochemistry of at least four molecules 541, 552, 702, and 708 were elucidated with the aid of JBCA method, while the relative configuration of one molecule as in 595 was elucidated by JBCA-QCC tactics.\n\n    The absolute configurations (ACs) of MNPs can be elucidated by NMR in two approaches: (a) substrate analysis without derivatization (i.e., by the addition of a chiral solvating agent (CSA)) and (b) analysis of the diastereomeric derivatives prepared with a chiral derivatizing agent (CDA). The ACs of 31 Indonesian MNPs were determined by applying CDA. If chiral molecules possess appropriate chromophore(s), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) can be applied, as in 56 MNPs. Comparison of the ECD calculated by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the experimental ECD spectra was performed for the ACs of as-exemplified lamellodysidine A (41), niphatheolide A (128), sulawesin A (133), and nakamuric acid (448a). However, nakamuric acid (448a) was first revised to 448b1 by synthesis, and later to 448b2 based on the comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra. Molecular modelling, total synthesis, and QCC were used to determine the structure of vannusals A (198) and B (199). Combination of NMR and chemical degradation helped to determine the long carbon chain molecules, karatungiols A (655) and B (626). For small heterocyclic molecules with the ratio of H/C < 1, total synthesis is helpful for confirming unusual rings, as in latonduine A (450) and polycarpathiamine A (544).\n\n    With respect to phylogeny, new MNPs have been discovered from 5 kingdoms, 10 phyla, 14 classes, 32 orders, 64 families, 106 genera, and 94 species (Figure 5A,B) in Indonesian waters over the past 47 years. Three phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, and Chordata) are found to be the major sources (498 molecules, 68.0%; 116 molecules, 15.8%; and 60 molecules, 8.2%, respectively) of novel metabolites. The remaining 8.0% were discovered from the following phyla: Mollusca (3 molecules, 0.4%), Rhodophyta (3 molecules, 0.4%), Ciliophora (2 molecules, 0.3%), Dinoflagellate (2 molecules, 0.3%), Ascomycota (45 molecules, 6.1%), Cyanobacteria (1 molecule, 0.1%), and Actinobacteria (2 molecules, 0.3%). The phylum Porifera, the largest source of Indonesian MNPs, consists of three classes: Demospongiae (91.8%), Homoscleromorpha (6.6%) and Calcarea (1.6%). Among these, Demospongiae is comprised of 11 orders and 32 families. The Cnidaria is comprised of 1 class (Anthozoa), 3 orders (Alcyonacea, Pennatulacea, Actinaria), and 9 families (Alcyoniidae, Nephtheidae, Xeniidae, Briareidae, Ellisellidae, Isididae, Veretillidae, Pennatulidae, and Stichodactylidae).\n\n    The top 10 genera reported for new MNPs are Achantostrongylophora (4.4%), Xestospongia (3.6%), Sinularia (3.4%), Apysinella, Theonella and Strepsichordaia (each 2.9%), Plakortis, Petrosia, Spongia, Melophlus (each 2.6%), Agelas, Rhabdastrella, and Lissoclinum (each 2.5%). Unknown genera were the sources of 6.2% of new MNPs. Symbiotic relationships are generally found between sponges and fungi, algae and fungi, and dinoflagellates and acoel flatworms. The list of Indonesian marine organisms producing new MNPs is described in Figure 6.\n\n    The most frequently evaluated biological activities of Indonesian MNPs is cytotoxicity (122 molecules, 16.7%) (Figure 7). Results are generally expressed in the terms of the dose or concentration that inhibits cell growth to 50% of the control (ED50, EC50, ID50, IC50, LD50, LC50 in mug/mL or muM), and the criterion for a cytotoxic compound is ED50 < 4 mug/mL. Cytotoxic evalution has been performed on cell-based (120 human, 26 murine, and 1 monkey Cercopithecus aethiops cell lines), enzyme-based (mainly protease and kinase), and brine shrimp (Artemia salina) assays. Of 122 molecules, four molecules:60, 619, 652, and 702:showed significant toxicity against A. salina. Antibacterial activity has been the second most frequently used bioassay for Indonesian MNPs, with 43 molecules (5.9%) showing significant results followed by anticancer (4.0%), cytostatic (3.0%), antifungal (2.7%), and antiparasitic activity (2.6%). Of 4.0% anticancer molecules, only 2.3% showed anticancer activity without cytotoxicity. It is noteworthy that at least 86 out of 260 alkaloids have been isolated and tested as salt forms against various targets of assays. In addition, about 609 molecules have been used for in vitro assay, while 10 molecules had been used for in vivo evaluation.\n\n    Biogeography of Indonesian MNPs shows that 18 (NST, WST, BTN, JSCR, WJV, CJV, BLI, ENT, EKM, NSW, GTO, CSW, SSW, SES, NMU, MLU, SRWP, and PUA) of 34 provinces are sources of new MNPs. Among the 18 provinces, more than 70% of the total new MNPs are supplied by five provinces: NSW (33.0%), SSW (12.7%), MLU (10.4%), BLI (7.8%), and EKM (6.6%) (Figure 8A,B). The frequent discovery of Indonesian MNPs in the Eastern part of Indonesia may be due to it being closer to the center of Coral Triangle.\n\n    From the above results, it can be seen that Indonesian marine macro- and micro-organisms are still largely underexplored and may provide viable sources and inspiration for a large number of new chemical entities. Modern structure elucidation and other strategies are keys to providing new therapeutic agents and/or new tools for life science studies.\n\n    Data presented in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 16, Figure 17, Figure 18, Figure 19, Figure 20, Figure 21, Figure 22, Figure 23, Figure 24, Figure 25, Figure 26, Figure 27, Figure 28, Figure 29, Figure 30, Figure 31, Figure 32, Figure 33, Figure 34, Figure 35, Figure 36 and Figure 37, Figures S1-S22 and Tables S1-S22 were assembled from the SciFinder , Scopus , and MarinLit databases and through manual curation of all published articles from an extensive panel of journals in chemistry and chemical biology fields. We emphasized new structures and structural revisions as elucidated through a variety of modern methods. Biological activities, origins of organisms, bioorganic studies on the MNPs, and syntheses that led to revision of structures or stereochemical assignments were also highlighted. We hope this comprehensive review will provide a useful overview and will help direct future efforts in Indonesian scientific development, governance, resource management, and conservation regarding the value of marine biodiversity.\n\n    There are five important components in MNP research programs: (1) collection and identification of marine organisms or culture of microorganisms, (2) screening of crude extracts for bioactivity or chemical structures, (3) isolation and structure elucidation of MNPs, (4) pharmacological evaluation of isolated compounds, and (5) further development of MNPs for science and technolgy. Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) diving is generally used to collect shallow-water marine biota. SCUBA is also used to take photographs for characterization of specimens and to record ecological information on marine biota. The specimens are sorted and stored either frozen in aqueous ethanol or as dried material. Voucher specimens are prepared for taxonomic studies. At greater depths, specimens are collected by rebreather diving, dredging, trawling, and submersibles.\n\n    Many challenges must be overcome for this work. The presence of inorganic salt may become a problem if the sample amount is minuscule and the compounds are water-soluble, making them more difficult to handle than lipophilic compounds. When the bioassay is based on the behavior of marine organisms, it is difficult to mimic the marine environment. A routine procedure for isolation work is to group molecules by the level of their polarity, followed by separation and purification of target fractions using a variety of chromatographic methods. Bioassay or a signature of functional groups (substructures) or even molecular weight can be used as a guide for isolation or identification of MNPs. As a rule, in vitro bioassays require very little material, and take a shorter time to perform. It is normal to screen crude extracts with in vitro assays and reserve in vivo assays for pure compounds. Thin layer chromatography (TLC), NMR, and MS spectra can be used to identify characteristic extracts or fractions as guides for isolation work.\n\n    Modern structure elucidation requires a variety of spectroscopic methods (NMR, MS, IR, ultraviolet (UV), ECD, X-ray diffraction, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and others), chemical transformations (derivatives or selective degradation or total synthesis), molecular modeling or computational calculations, information technology with molecular networking, and biosynthetic consideration in order to reveal the planar and stereostructure of target molecules. In general, the chemical structure of molecules with low H/C ratios (<1) is challenging to elucidate. To find a new molecule, one should consider a strategy of dereplication using NMR, LC-MS, MS/MS, or DNA sequence, in addition to exploring new groups of marine organisms and geographical selection of collection sites. On the other hand, known molecules can be screened with a set of new assays in order to find new function of molecules.\n\n    A total of 276 marine terpenoids were discovered within the period, consisting of 38 sesquiterpenoids, 84 diterpenoids, 50 sesterterpenoids, 21 triterpenoids, 52 steroids, 5 saponins, and 26 meroterpenoids. Among them, six molecules 10a, 33a, 70a, 71a, 198a, and 199a have been revised. One molecule, 53, was isolated as a natural product, while it had been synthesized previously. Five molecules, 16c, 17c, 18c, 45c, 200c, and 252c, were isolated as derivatives. Of 276 terpenoids, ACs of 18 molecules were determined by X-ray crystallography. In addition, ACs can also be revealed by the use of ECD as in 21 terpenoids. Modified Mosher's method was applied for 14 chiral terpenoids, while total syntheses proved the ACs of 3 terpenoids. Since the biological activity of true natural products is preferable, one should consider replacing the FG with the original one. Alternatively, the chromatography system can be modified so that the original molecule can be obtained. Indonesian marine terpenoids were found to show cytotoxic (37 molecules), cytostatic (18 molecules), anticancer without cytotoxicity (4 molecules), antifungal (5 molecules), antibacterial (3 molecules), antidiabetic (2 molecules), ichthyotoxic, algicidal, antiinsecticidal, anti-inflammatory, anti-Alzheimer, physicoactive (CB receptor ligand), antiangiogenic, antiatherosclerotic, and antioxidant activity (each 1 molecule).\n\n    Sesquiterpenoids isolated from Indonesian waters from January 1970 to December 2017 are summarized in Figure 9A, Figure S1 and Table S1 of the Supplementary Materials. As shown in Figure 9B, some sesquiterpenoids had been discovered in an earlier period (1970-1980). The marine sesquiterpenoids are comprised of 38 new natural products, 3 revised molecules (2 new and 1 known), 3 derivatives 16c, 17c and 18c, and 6 mixtures (Figure 9C). Two molecules, 2/3 and 41, have been reported to have new skeletons, and 1 molecule, 39/40, contains a rare functional group (Figure 9D). Fourteen different types of carbon skeletons (Figure 9E) are observed. Among them, capnellane (12 molecules), nardosinane (6 molecules), and hirsutane (4 molecules) are top three. Two molecules remain to be determined with respect to their stereochemistry (2/3 and 39/40). The ACs of six sesquiterpenoids, 4, 7, 22, 31, 35, and 38, and one derivative, 16c, have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In addition, ECD was applied to 6 molecules, 2/3, 12, 38, 41, and 42. The modified Mosher's method was applied to 31. Of 38 molecules, one molecule, 10a, was revised to 10b by total synthesis. The structure of 15a was corrected to 15b after total synthesis. Hirsutanol C (33a) was revised to 33b by the work of a fungal metabolite. Four phyla, Ascomycota (4 molecules), Porifera (5 molecules), Cnidaria (27 molecules), and Mollusca (2 molecules), were recorded to be sources of new sesquiterpenoids (Figure 9F). The new molecules are mainly found in NSW and MLU (Figure 9G).\n\n    The first sesquitepenoid found in Indonesian waters was africanol (35) from Lemnalia africana and Lemnalia nitida, collected off Tanimbar, MLU. Its structure, including AC, was established by X-ray analysis and confirmed by total synthesis. It was proposed that 35 was derived from a humulene through its CT (cross and parallel rearrangements of two double bonds) conformer 35-I, which undergoes acid-catalyzed closure to the 9-africyl cation 35-II, followed by proton loss and hydration to provide 35 (Figure 10). Africanol (35) showed toxicity against guppy Lebistes reticulatus and unicellular algae Chaetoceros septentrionalis, Astrionella japonica, Thallasioscira excentricus, Protocentrum micans, and Amphidinium carterae.\n\n    Diterpenoids are molecules more frequently found from Cnidarian (56 molecules, 66.7%), particularly Alcyonacea (57.1%), than from Porifera (28 molecules, 33.3%). The diterpenoids found in Indonesian waters from January 1970 to December 2017 are compiled in Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials, Figure 11A and Figure S2. As for sesquiterpenoids, initial studies on diterpenoids were performed in 1970s, and publication increased after 1996 (Figure 11B). All of these efforts resulted in 84 new, 2 revised, 1 derivative, and 1 known but first from marine (Figure 11C). Among the new molecules, 4 have new skeletons, 80, 100, 117, and 128 (Figure 11D), 2 molecules contain rare FGs, sulfoxide or sulfone, and 5 molecules are listed to possess a rare structural motif, 77, 79, 113, 119, and 124 (Figure 11D). The chemical diversity of Indonesian marine diterpenoids (84 molecules) was proved, as there were 15 different skeletons: 19 spongianes, 18 each of briaranes and cembranes, 7 cladiellanes, 6 xenicanes, 3 each of nor-cembranes and acyclic peroxide diterpenes, 2 each of copalanes and acyclic diterpenes, and 1 each of niphatane, flexibilane, seco-cladiellane, dollabelane, isocopalane, and seco-isocopalane (Figure 11F). Four molecules, 101, 108, 110, and 112, were determined by X-ray analysis. ECD was used to reveal the ACs of 8 molecules, 43, 44, 79, 82, 88, 89, 90, and 128. In particular, 5 molecules, 82, 88-90 and 128, were elucidated by comparing actual spectra and calculated ECD. The modified Mosher's method was applied for 8 molecules, 54-57, 63, 70a, 113, and 124. Two molecules, 70a and 71a, were revised to 70b and 71b. NSW is the most favored place for finding new marine diterpenes (41 molecules, 48.8%), followed by MLU (10 molecules, 11.9%) (Figure 11H). One molecule, 45c, was isolated as a derivative, while molecule 53 was isolated as a natural product for the first time, but was previously known as a semisynthetic.\n\n    The AC of niphateolide A (128), an inhibitor of p53-Hdm2 interaction from the sponge Niphates olemda, was established as 10R,11R by ECD measurements in the vacuum-ultraviolet region based on theoretical calculation. The remaining stereocenter at C17 remains unsolved.\n\n    The sestertepenoids found in Indonesian waters from January 1970 to December 2017 are shown in Table S3 and Figure 12A, Figure S3. The first sesterterpenoids were 147-152 and 173-178, isolated from Strepsichordaia aliena in 2000. Of the 56 sesterterpenoids reported, 50 were new and 6 were isolated as mixtures (Figure 12C). The molecules are comprised of 24 tetracylic followed by 7 pentacyclic, 6 bicyclic, 5 each of monocyclic and acyclic sesterterpenoids, and 5 acyclic norsesterterpenoids (Figure 12D). Three molecules, 148, 165 and 174, including their ACs, were revealed by X-ray crystallography, while the ACs of 2 molecules, 160 and 161, were disclosed by comparing calculated and experimental ECD. The AC of 165 was determined by the modified Mosher's method. The biological sources of Indonesian sesterterpenoids are exclusively from the phylum Porifera, class Demospongiae with 6, 9, and 10 differrent families, genera, and species, respectively (Figure 12E). In regard to biological activities, significant cytotoxicity was observed for 9 molecules, while others were recorded as exhibiting anticancer activity without cytotoxic (2 molecules), cytostatic, antidiabetic, and antifungal activities (1 molecule each) (Figure 12D). Marine sesterterpenoids were mainly found in specimens in SSW (25 molecules) and EKM (18 molecules) (Figure 12G).\n\n    Indonesian marine triterpenoids (Table S4 and Figure 13A, Figure S4) are comprised of 21 new, 7 mixtures, 1 derivative, and 2 revised molecules (Figure 13C). The triterpenes are grouped into three structural classes: squalane (1), isomalabaricanes (18) and vannusanes (2 molecules). Of 21, only vannusals A (198) and B (199) were found to have a new skeleton. The 3 skeletons were obtained from 3 species, Euplotes vannus for 198a and 199a, Rhabdastrella globostellata for 180-197, and Hyrtios erectus for 179 (Figure 13C,D). The AC of 1 molecule, 199b, was solved by X-ray analysis. Of the triterpenoids, six were found to show significant cytostatic activity. The metabolites were mainly isolated from specimens collected in SSW (12 molecules) (Figure 13F). Two molecules, 198a and 199a, were revised to 198b and 199b. The stereochemistry of vannusal B (199b) was also examined by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of vannusals A (198b) and B (199b) was proposed (Figure 14).\n\n    Indonesian marine steroids found in the period of 1970-2017 are comprised of 52 pure molecules and 4 mixtures (Figure 15C) and are shown in Table S5 in Supplementary Materials and Figure 15A, Figure S5. The discovery trend increased in the first 5 years and also in the years after 1990 (Figure 15B). The ratio among new skeletons, rare functional groups, and rare motifs is 1:1:5 (Figure 15D). Four different skeletons are observed in 52 steroids (Figure 15E). Among them, Delta5-sterols constitute the majority (18 molecules). Sulfated steroids were reported as 203, 206 and 224-226, while a phosphated steroid was observed in 217. From 1970-2017, Indonesian marine sulfated steroids have contributed 3.3% of the total marine sulfated steroids worldwide, while Indonesian marine phosphated steroids are expected to contribute 20% of total marine phosphated steroids. The ACs of three steroids, 201, 204 and 241, were disclosed by X-ray analysis, while that of 241 was determined by ECD spectrum. For two molecules, 224 and 239, their absolute configurations were determined by MTPA esters and PGME methods, respectively. With regard to the biological sources, the steroids were mainly obtained from the phyla Cnidaria (29 molecules) and Porifera (23 molecules), as listed in Figure 15F. In regard to biological activities, 10 molecules showed significant cytotoxicity, while 11 molecules were cytostastic (Figure 15G). The molecules were isolated mainly from specimens from NSW (14 molecules) and ENT (11 molecules) (Figure 15H).\n\n    The unique molecules in the steroids are cortistatins isolated from the sponge Corticium simplex collected off Flores, ENT, with a new skeleton comprised of a 9(10-19)-abeo-androstane and isoquinoline. The structure of cortistatin A (241) was determined by X-ray analysis and the ECD excition chirality method. Molecules 241-244 showed selective antiproliferative properties against human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The most potent member, cortistatin A (241), showed a selectivity index of more than 3000 against HUVECs in comparison with human fibroblast (NHDF) and several other tumor cells KB31, K562 and Neuro 2A. Additional members, cortistatins E (250), F (251), G (248), and H (249) with N-methyl piperidine or 3-methylpyridine unit isolated from the same source, also showed antiproliferative activity against HUVECs. Three additional cortistatins J (245), K (246) and L (247) were isolated from the same source. The first synthesis of 241 verified its 3D structure, featuring an inexpensive terrestrial steroid prednisone as the starting material. The second total synthesis of 241 was achieved by using intra-molecular oxa-Michael addition/aldol/dehydration cascade reaction, Sonogashira, and Suzuki-Miyaura couplings.\n\n    Molecules 241 and 245 were confirmed to show an antiproliferative effect on additional cancer cell lines: MCF7, NCI-H460, SF268, IA9, PTX22, and A8, including drug-resistant ones. Structure-activity relationships with natural cortistatins and synthetic analogues suggested that substitution at position 7' of isoquinoline is a key determinant of the phenotypic effects of cortistatins. It is hypothesized that the biological activity of 241 is due to inhibition of one or more protein kinases. Molecule 241 inhibits the function of several different kinases in vitro. It is proposed that 241 may occupy the ATP-binding site of at least one of the following enzymes: Rho associated, protein kinase (ROCK), or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 8 and 11. The X-ray crystallographic analysis of the ligand-protein complex disclosed that the isoquinoline binds to the kinase hinge, that the steroid region of the molecule is complementary to the shape of the ATP-binding cleft, that the terminal polar A ring is exposed to solvent, and that a salt bridge exists between an aspartate side chain (ROCK I only) and dimethylamino group of 241.\n\n    Only five saponins 253-257 with 1 derivative 252c were discovered in Indonesian waters in the period 1970-2017 (Table S6 and Figure 16A, Figure S6). All the saponins retain a lanostane skeleton with five sugar moieties. ECD spectrum has been used to reveal the stereochemistry of 252c. Four molecules, 253-256, were found in a specimen of the sponge Melophlus sarassinorum from SSW, while 257 was from a Petrosia sp. of NSW. Significant antifungal activity was observed for sarasinoside J (253).\n\n    Marine meroterpenoids, comprised of 26 pure compounds and 2 mixtures, have been discovered since 2000 (Table S7 and Figure 17A-C, Figure S7). Marine meroterpenoids are composed of various skeletons, as shown in 264-265, 281 and 282, while a rare motif is exhibited by 276. The majority of marine meroterpenoids found in Indonesian waters are the 21 merosesquiterpenoids, followed by the 3 meroditerpenoids and the 2 merotriterpenoids (Figure 17E). X-ray crystallography was used for two molecules, 264-265, to determine their ACs, while ECD spectra were used to elucidate the ACs of 261-262. The marine meroterpenoids were isolated from the phyla Ascomycta (4 molecules), Porifera (19 molecules), and Chordata (3 molecules). More specifically, 19 molecules from Porifera were found in 3 families: Dysideidae (2 molecules), Chalinidae (3 molecules), and Dictyodendrillidae (2 molecules). With regard to their biological activities, 8 molecules showed significant cytotoxicity, followed by 1 molecule as antiatherosclerotic and 1 molecule as antioxidant and antidiabetic (Figure 17G). The marine merosesquiterpeoids were isolated from specimens from MLU (9 molecules), while meroditerpenoids (2 molecules) and merotriterpenoids (2 molecules) were found from SSW and NMU, respectively (Figure 17H).\n\n    The alkaloids from Indonesian marine sources are comprised of 260 new molecules, 5 revised molecules (332a, 333a, 348a, 403a, and 404a), 3 derivatives (328c, 452c and 453c), and 3 molecules that were known, but had been isolated for the first time as natural products (397 and 546-547). Of these, 102 and 91 molecules were isolated as freebases and salt forms, respectively, and 7 as mixtures. The total of 260 Indonesian marine alkaloids can be grouped into 48 piperidines, 7 pyridines, 37 indoles, 13 acridines, 11 quinolines or isoquinolines, 38 tyrosines, 31 pyrroles, 13 imidazoles, 14 polysulfur aromatics, 15 serines, and 33 others. The last group is comprised of a pyrroloimino-quinone, 5 ceramides, 15 tetramic acids, 2 nucleosides, 2 formamides, a polycyclic diamine, a pterin alkaloid, 2 thiadiazoles, a pyrazole, an azirine, and 2 simple amines/amides. Purification of alkaloids is often challenging due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and their behavior as a base. To tackle this problem, researchers often adjust the pH of mobile phases of chromatography by adding formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid, or modify the stationary phase into a suitable one. Because of their basic nature, many alkaloids are tested as salt forms. Significant activity was observed for 118 molecules consisting of cytotoxic (49), antibacterial (29), anticancer without cytotoxicity (1), antiparasitic (9), antifungal (8), immunosuppresive (2 molecules), antiviral, anti-cystic fibrosis, immunomodulatory, anti-neurodisease, and electrophysiological activity (each 1 molecule).\n\n    The majority of piperidine alkaloids are manzamine-related molecules characterized by the presence of a unique polycyclic ring system. The molecules are compiled in Table S8 in Supplementary Materials and are drawn as in Figure 18A, Figure S8. The first piperidine alkaloid found in Indonesian waters was halicyclamine A (322), from a Haliclona sponge, in 1994, followed by more alkaloids after 2001 (Figure 18B). As mentioned earlier in Figure 4C, piperidine alkaloids constitute one of the dominant groups of Indonesian MNPs, with 48 molecules, which were classified into 33 manzamines, 284-286, 297-302, 309-312, and 318-321, 2 degraded beta-carbolines, 313 and 314, 3 ircinal-related molecules, 315-317, 6 molecules with two piperidines, 322-327, one fused piperidine-pyran, 329a, one zoanthamine, 330, and 2 molecules with a piperidine in a tricyclic system, 331-332. Inspection of the chemical structures allowed us to identify new skeletons in 313 and 318, rare functional groups in 309 and 329a, and 6 molecules with rare structural motifs in 306-308, 311 and 320-321 (Figure 18D). X-ray analysis was used to reveal ACs of molecules 289, 324 and 327. ACs of three 306, 313 and 328c were determined by comparing experimental and calculated ECD spectra, while three others, 290, 293 and 330, were elucidated with modified Mosher's method. In terms of their biological activities, significant antibacterial (14), cytotoxic (11), anticancer without cytotoxicity (1), antiparasitic (5), antifungal (5), antiviral and immunosuppresive activity (each 1 molecule) were observed (Figure 18E). The sources of piperidine alkaloids are Porifera (45), Cnidaria (1), and Chordata (2 molecules). In total, 48 molecules were isolated from specimens of NSW (31), JSCR (7), ENT, BLI (3), and SES, NMU, PUA (1 molecule each) (Figure 18G).\n\n    Manadomanzamines A (318) and B (319) (Figure 18A, Figure S8), obtained from a sponge Acanthostrongylophora sp. collected off Manado, have a novel skeleton. Their ACs and conformation were determined by ECD, NOESY and molecular modelling analysis. Molecules 318 and 319 showed growth inhibition against HIV-1 and against fungi causing opportunistic infection with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Biosynthesis of 318 and 319 is proposed, as shown (Figure 19).\n\n    Only 7 molecules were classified as pyridine alkaloids, as shown in Table S9 and in Figure 20A-C, Figure S9. The molecules were reported recently, in 2016-2017 (Figure 20B). One molecule, 333a, was revised to the known 333b after comparing NMR data of total synthesis work. The incorrect structure of 333a was due to the misinterpretation of HMBC signals.\n\n    There have been 37 new and 1 proposed 356d indole alkaloids in the Indonesian MNPs (Table S10, Figure 21A-C, Figure S10). ECD was used to determine ACs of (-)-360. In addition, the ACs of two indoles, 340 and 341, were determined by total synthesis. Cytotoxicity was the dominant biological activitiy reported for indole alkaloids (7), followed by antiparasitic and anticancer activity (1 molecule each). The alkaloids were found to be from Porifera (31), Cnidarian (2) and Chordata (4 molecules).\n\n    In total, 13 new and 1 revised acridine alkaloids were reported from Indonesian waters (Figure 22A-C, Figure S11 and Table S11). Of 13 molecules, six were isolated as free bases, while the remaining seven were obtained as salts. One molecule, 385a, has been revised to 385b. A new skeleton was proposed for 390. Research on marine acridines began with the discovery of styelsamines A-D (378-381) in 1988 (Figure 22B). The structure of the alkaloid 390 was determined by X-ray analysis. Six molecules showed significant cytotoxicity. The acridine alkaloids were isolated from Porifera (8) and Chordata (5 molecules).\n\n    The ascidian Eusynstyla latericius, collected off Makassar, SSW, was found to contain styelsamines A-D (378-381, Figure 23A, Figure S11) which showed cytotoxic effect against HCT116 cells. A biomimetic synthesis of styelsamine B (379) was conducted from kynuramine (379-I) and N-acetyl dopamine (379-II) (Figure 23) featuring a CeCl3-catalyzed oxidative coupling of 379-I and 379-II in the presence of silver oxide. The structure of styelsamine C (380) was also confirmed by a total synthesis utilizing biaryl Suzuki cross-coupling. The preparation of 379 and 381 was also achieved by using a simple biomimetic synthetic method. Styelsamine D (381) could be a biosynthetic intermediate for a large subset of pyridoacridine alkaloids. Styelsamines B (379) and D (381) showed high affinity to calf thymus DNA.\n\n    In total, 11 natural quinoline or isoquinoline alkaloids were discovered in Indonesian waters (Figure 24A-C, Figure S12, Table S12). The very first member of this group is an aaptamine derivative obtained off Jakarta, JSCR (Figure 24B). Of 11 molecules, nine were isolated as free bases, while two were obtained as salts. Two molecules, 391 and 395, of the class contained a rare motif. With respect to biological activity, 3 molecules showed significant cytotoxicity, while 2 molecules were antibacterial (Figure 24D). All the compounds were found from the marine sponges Aaptos suberitoides (5), Aaptos sp. (2) and Xestospongia sp. (4 molecules) (Figure 24E). JSCR (4 molecules) and MLU (4 molecules) were the major source areas of the group (Figure 24F).\n\n    A total of 38 tyrosine alkaloids were found in Indonesian waters. Of 38 molecules, 7 molecules were isolated as mixtures (Figure 25A-C, Figure S13, Table S13). The first member of this class was bastadin reported in 1994. The chemical structures of this class contained 1 new skeleton 405. With respect to biological activity, antiparasitic activity was seen for 3 molecules followed by one cytotoxic molecule (Figure 25E). The sources of tyrosine alkaloids are Porifera consisting of 3 species and 1 undescribed species (Figure 25F). Most molecules were found from specimens of BLI (21), EKM (7), CSW (7), and NSW (2 molecules) (Figure 25G).\n\n    A total of 31 pyrrole alkaloids have been discovered from the Indonesian waters in addition to 2 revised and 2 derivatives (Figure 26A-C, Figure S14 and Table S14). Nineteen molecules out of 31 were isolated as free bases, while 9 were isolated as salts. The first member, 441, was discovered in 1995, and 12 molecules were reported in 2010 (Figure 26B). This class of alkaloids contains 1 new skeleton in 450 and 1 rare motif in 448. The ACs of two molecules, 443 and 448b2, of this class were determined by ECD spectra, while 1 molecule, 450, was confirmed by total synthesis. Cytotoxicity (2 molecules) and anti-cystic fibrosis (1 molecule) are the signature of significant biological activity of the pyrrole alkaloids (Figure 26E). The sources of pyrrole alkaloids are exclusively Porifera, consisting of 3 families (Agelasidae 22 molecules, Axinellidae 1 molecule, and Scopalinidae 8 molecules).\n\n    Two dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nakamuric acid (448a) and its methyl ester, 449, showing antibiotic activity against B. subtilis, were isolated from the sponge Agelas nakamurai, collected in MLU. A total synthesis of (9R,10S,9'R,10'S)-nakamuric acid (449a) was accomplished by the minimal use of protective groups with exploration of 2-aminoimidazole. The AC of 448a was established to be (9S,10R,9'S,10'R) by comparison of the experimental and calculated ECD spectra. Thus, 448a was proved to be an enantiomer of the synthetic one. The sponge Stylissa carteri from SSW was found to contain two unprecedented molecules, latonduines A (450) and B (451d). Their structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data and confirmed by total synthesis of 450. It is proposed that ornithine is the biogenetic precursor to the aminopyrimidine fragment, as shown in Figure 27.\n\n    The marine sponges Lissodendroryx fibrosa, Leucetta chagosensis, and Leucetta microraphis, as well as the ascidian Polycarpa aurata (Figure 28E), are the sources of 13 imidazole alkaloids, which were isolated as free bases (8) and salts (5 molecules) (Figure 28A-C, S 15, Table S15). Compound 483 retains 1 new skeleton, while four compounds, 475, 484, 485, and 487, have rare structural motifs (Figure 28D). With regard to biological activity, significant antifungal (1) and cytotoxic activity (3 molecules) was found (Figure 28E). The sources of imidazole alkaloids were collected at 3 regions (NSW, 6; SSW, 5; MLU, 2 molecules).\n\n    Lissodendrins A (483) and B (484) (Figure 28A, Figure S15), 2-amino imidazole alkaloids, were isolated from the sponge Lissodendoryx (Acanthodoryx) fibrosa collected off Ambon, MLU. The latter compound contains a (p-hydroxyphenyl)glyoxal moiety as an unprecedented skeleton. A plausible biosynthetic scheme for these compounds was proposed, as in Figure 29.\n\n    Polysulfur aromatic alkaloids are an unusual class of MNPs. To date, there have been 14 MNPs isolated as salts (Figure 30A-C, Figure S16, and Table S16). The polysulfur aromatic alkaloids were reported in 2005 (3), 2007 (6), and 2009 (5 molecules) (Figure 30B). The first discovery of this group was lissoclibadin 1 (498). Three molecules, 498, 499 and 501, of polysulfur aromatic alkaloids retain new skeletons. With respect to biological activity, significant cytotoxic (12), antibacterial (7), and antifungal activity (1 molecule) was reported (Figure 30D). All the molecules were found from Lissoclinum cf. badium collected in NSW.\n\n    A total of 15 serine-derived alkaloids have been discovered (Figure 31A-C, Figure S17, Table S17). Among them, 2 molecules, 503a and 504a, were revised to 503b and 504b. All the alkaloids share a common structural feature: 6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane (6,8-DOBCOs). One of them, 502, possesses a new skeleton. The first discovery in this group was reported in 1999 (3 molecules), which was followed by another 12 molecules before 2013 (Figure 31B). The ACs were determined for 505 by ECD and for 503b, 504b and 505 by total synthesis. With regard to biological activities, significant anticancer activity without cytotoxicity was reported for 4 molecules. Tunicates were proved as the sole source of this class of MNPs. The majority of the molecules were isolated from specimens collected in NSW (12) and NMU (3 molecules).\n\n    A total of 33 alkaloids do not belong to the above structural classes. They are comprised of a pyrroloimino-quinone, five ceramides, 15 tetramic acids, two nucleosides, two formamides, one polycyclic diamine, one pterin, two thiadiazoles, one pyrazole, one azirine, two simple amine/amide alkaloids (2 molecules) (Figure 32A-C, Figure S18, Table S18). Of 33 molecules, seven, 538, 540, 541, 544, 548, 549, and 551, contain rare structural motifs. ACs of three molecules, 524, 525 and 538, were determined by ECD. With regard to biological activities, cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity were seen in 4 and 3 molecules, respectively, whereas antifungal, immunosuppresive, immunomodulatory, neurological, and electrophysiological activity were shown in one molecule each (Figure 32D). The sources of the molecules are 10 sponge species and 2 tunicates (Figure 32E). The majority of the alkaloids were found from specimens from SSW (19), MLU (4), NSW (2), EKM (2), and BLI (1 molecule) (Figure 32F).\n\n    Bioorganic studies of melophlin A (523) to dynamins II and I-like proteins in cells, thereby modulating signal transduction through the Ras network, was conducted by using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Furthermore, Mg or Zn complexes of 523 are antiproliferative in various cancer cells, while they are less toxic to normal fibroblasts. The complexes dissolve more in water than Ca analogue. Melophlin A (523) also exhibited anti-dormant mycobacterial activity and cytotoxicity against L1210 cells. The influence of 523 on the colony formation of Chinese hamster V79 lung cells and of the production of interleukin (IL)-8 in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated HL60 cells were examined.\n\n    Two alkaloids containing an uncommon 1,2,4-thiadiazole ring named polycarpathiamines A (544) and B (545) (Figure 32B) were isolated from the ascidian Polycarpa aurata collected in MLU. The structures of 544 and 545 were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and by synthesis. Polycarpathiamine A (544) showed cytotoxicity to L5178Y cells. The biosynthetic relation of 544 and 545 was proposed as shown in Figure 33.\n\n    Marine peptides have emerged as a very important class of bioactive compound in Indonesian MNPs. The class is comprised of 60 natural and 6 revised MNPs (Figure 34A-C, Figure S19, Table S19). The natural peptides can be grouped into: linear dipeptides, 552-557, a linear tridecapeptide, 590, a cyclotetrapeptide, 608, two cyclopentapeptides, 604-605, cyclohexapeptides, 558-563, cyclohepta-peptides, 564-570, a cyclooctapeptide, 571, cycloundecapeptides, 572a-575, cyclopeptides with a linear peptidic chain, 576a, 577-579, 580a, 581, 582b, 583-588, and 606-607, and cyclodepsipeptide, 591a-603, cyclodepsipeptide with a side chain, 589, and macrocyclic peptides, 609-611. Nine molecules, 553, 561, 564, 589, 590, 591a, 593, 595, and 602, are categorized as having rare FG and structural motifs. After their first discovery in 1996, the number of Indonesian marine peptides has kept increasing until now. The ACs of peptides (41 molecules) have generally been determined by Marfey analysis. Only 3 peptides, 553, 565 and 566b, were solved by X-ray crystallography. With respect to biological activity, 20 peptides were reported to be cytotoxic, followed by 4 with antifungal, 3 each with antibacterial and antiviral, and one each with anti-inflammatory and antiparasitic activities (Figure 34E). Indonesian marine peptides have been found from 4 phyla (Rhodophyta, Porifera, Chordata, and Mollusca). On the biogeography, MLU (18 molecules) and NSW (14 molecules) are the top places for the discovery of Indonesian marine peptides (Figure 34F).\n\n    A total of 13 (or 12) Indonesian marine fatty acids or linear molecules, probably biosynthesized through acetate pathways, have been reported, and they were characterized by the presence of double or triple bonds or their combination, ranging from 1 to 7 (Figure 35A, Figure S20, Table S20). After the first discovery of (-)-elenic acid (612) in 1995, this group of metabolites has been reported continuously (Figure 35B). Of 13 molecules, one showed cytotoxicity, three showed neurological, and five showed antihyperlipidemic activity (Figure 35D). The ACs of the metabolites were determined by modified Mosher's method for 615-619, and by total synthesis for 613 and 615-617. With respect to biological sources, 12 molecules were found from Porifera and 1 from Ascomycota (Figure 35E). All the molecules were isolated from specimens collected in NSW (5), MLU (3), SSW and ENT (2 each), and UEP (1 molecule).\n\n    Several polyketides have been discovered in Indonesian waters, particularly since 1995. The molecules can be grouped into 121 natural, 13 mixtures, and 10 revised molecules (Figure 36A-C, Figure S21 and Table S21). Of 121 polyketides, significant biological activities were observed, with 11 cytotoxic, 9 antiparasitic, 8 antibacterial, 7 anticancer without cytotoxicity, 4 cytostatic, and 3 each of antifungal and growth restoring activity (Figure 36D). Polyketides can be classified into 9 different structural groups, consisting of 2 polyols, 18 cyclic peroxides, 34 aromatic polyketides, 1 vertinoid polyketide, 6 gamma-lactones, 10 delta-lactones, 16 macrolides, 33 quinones, and 4 halogenated polyketides. Stereo or regiochemistry of four molecules 659b, 687-688 and 705 were determined by X-ray crystallography, while the ACs of 21 molecules were determined by ECD. Seven structures, 659a, 663a, 664a, 689a, 692a, 693a, and 701a, were revised to 659b, 663b, 664b, 689b, 692b, 693b, and 701b. In addition, four molecules, 661a, 662a, 665a, 666a, were revised twice as 661b1 to 661b2, 662b1 to 662b2, 665b1 to 665b2, and 666b1 to 666b2. The revision was made by reisolation work, total synthesis, and X-ray analysis. For large molecules, such as 625 and 626, structure elucidation was aided by chemical degradation. The polyketides were isolated from specimens of 5 phyla: Ascomycota (35 molecules), Ciliophora (2 molecules), Rhodophyta (1 molecule), Porifera (78 molecules), and Chordata (2 molecules).\n\n    One each of carbohydrates 746 and 747 (Figure 37) was isolated from a soft coral Sinularia sp. and from the tunicate Didemnum molle collected in NSW. Sinularioside (746), a triacetylated glycolipid, contains two alpha-D-arabinopyranoses and a myristyl alcohol. The structure of 747 was solved by interpretation of MS and NMR data, along with ECD analysis of degradation products. Molecule 746 was proved to inhibit LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) release. A polysaccharide, kakelokelose (747), inhibited the proliferation of HIV. Analysis of 1H and 13C NMR data of the polysaccharide and its desulfated derivative revealed that it consisted of a sequence of 2,3-disulfated mannose units joined through beta-1,6 glycosidic linkages.",

        "Conclusion": "    Over the past 47 years (from January 1970 to December 2017), 732 new natural products, 4 compounds isolated for the first time as natural products but known previously as synthetic entities, 34 compounds with structural revision, and 9 derivative compounds have appeared in 270 papers. Currently, have been over 29,000 MNPs discovered since the first report of spongothymidine in 1950. Original Indonesian MNPs have largely been found in Porifera, Cnidaria and Chordata, while the global trends are Porifera, Cnidaria, and Ascomycota. In addition to the three phyla, Indonesian MNPs have been found in 94 species, 106 genera, 64 families, 32 orders, and 14 classes. The chemical diversity of Indonesian MNPs has been substantiated on the basis of 28 compounds with new skeletons and 62 molecules with rare structural motifs and FGs, while atomic diversity is manifested in 27 molecules with 6 different atoms in 1 molecule. Of 732 molecules, 373 (51.0%) are nitrogenous. In addition, 122 molecules (16.7%) possessed a ratio of H/C < 1. Of 34 defined provinces, 18 (NST, WST, BTN, JSCR, WJV, CJV, BLI, ENT, EKM, NSW, GTO, CSW, SSW, SES, NMU, MLU, SRWP, and PUA) have been reported as collection sites for new MNPs. Among these, NSW, MLU, SSW, BLI, and EKM were the major regions for specimens, while there still remain underexplored regions with vast areas, like MLU, even though a certain number of MNPs have already been discovered. A large number of Indonesian marine macro- and microorganisms are still underexplored, and they may provide inspiration for many chemical entities. The significant biological activity of Indonesian MNPs is dominated by cytotoxicity (16.7%), followed by antibacterial activity (5.9%). By exploring untapped novel groups of organisms and by proposing newer biological targets, MNP researchers may be able to enhance the search for new marine drugs to treat human diseases. Moreover, careful and innovative techniques for the MNPs isolation are required for identification of new structures and activities including unstable intermediates. The establishment of the Nagoya Protocols on the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010 has had a positive impact on global biodiversity especially in Indonesia by encouraging productive interaction between biodiversity-rich source countries and the more science and technology-advanced countries. International natural product researchers are strongly urged to be guided by the CBD principles in a fair and equitable framework that includes access and benefit-sharing. These interactions will be crucial for conserving our global biodiversity and providing valuable new MNPs for humankind. Therefore, the current primary issues in marine conservation, such as the loss of biodiversity through over-exploitation and habitat degradation, can be overcome.

        "Title": "    Loss of KLHL6 promotes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma growth and survival by stabilizing the mRNA decay factor Roquin2",
        "Abstract": "    Kelch-like protein 6 (KLHL6) is an uncharacterized gene mutated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We report that KLHL6 assembles with CULLIN3 to form a functional CULLIN-Ring ubiquitin ligase. Mutations of KLHL6 inhibit its ligase activity by disrupting the interaction with CULLIN3. Loss of KLHL6 favors DLBCL growth and survival both in vitro and in xenograft models. We further established the mRNA decay factor Roquin2 as a substrate of KLHL6. Degradation of Roquin2 is dependent on B-cell receptor activation, and requires the integrity of the tyrosine 691 in Roquin2 that is essential for its interaction with KLHL6. A non-degradable Roquin2 (Y691F) mutant requires its RNA binding ability to phenocopy the effect of KLHL6 loss. Stabilization of Roquin2 promotes mRNA decay of the tumor suppressor and NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible gene 3 (TNFAIP3). Collectively, our findings uncover the tumor suppressing mechanism of KLHL6.",
        "Introduction": "    B-cell cancers hijack protein ubiquitylation and degradation to promote growth and survival, as shown by the successful use of a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) and E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitor (lenalinomide) in multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma. Despite the significant progress, much remains to be explored in the field of ubiquitin and molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis.\n\n    Kelch-like protein 6 (KLHL6) is a member of the bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad-complex (BTB) domain family of proteins with a lymphoid tissue-restricted expression pattern. Whole-genome and exome sequencing have revealed cancer-associated mutations of the KLHL6 gene in B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); however, the relevance of these mutations as well as the molecular function of KLHL6 is currently unknown.\n\n    DLBCL is the most common type of lymphoid malignancies with two distinct molecular subtypes: activated B cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B cell-like (GCB) lymphoma. ABC-DLBCLs depend on hyper-activation of the inhibitor of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and the NF-kappaB transcription factor program for their proliferation and survival. This is evidenced by frequent mutations in the BCR pathway, including activating mutations of positive (CD79A/B and CARD11) and inactivating mutations of negative (TNFAIP3) NF-kappaB regulators. How KLHL6 contributes to the pathology of human DLBCL and whether it influences NF-kappaB activation are currently unknown.\n\n    Regulatory networks that promote cancer progression modulate gene expression at the level of mRNA stability. The RNA-binding proteins RC3H1 and RC3H2 (from now on Roquin1 and Roquin2) promote mRNA decay via recognition of stem-loop motifs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs. Through this recognition, Roquins recruit the CCR4-CAF1-NOT complex, leading to mRNA deadenylation and subsequent destabilization. In T-cells, Roquin proteins contribute to immune homeostasis by promoting decay of Inducible T-cell Costimulator (ICOS). However, the role of Roquin in B-cell cancers has not been investigated.\n\n    Here, we demonstrate that KLHL6 is an E3 ligase for Roquin2. Cancer-associated mutations of KLHL6 inhibit its ubiquitin ligase activity and inactivation or loss of KLHL6 in ABC-DLBCL promotes cancer cell growth and survival through stabilization of Roquin2 and subsequent decay of the TNFAIP3 mRNA. This study shows how ABC-DLBCL cells hijack the ubiquitin pathway to promote their proliferation via alteration of the mRNA decay process.",

KLHL6, Roquin1/2, TNFAIP3, CULLIN1, CULLIN3, p100/p52, p105/p50 and RelA antibodies were validated in our lab utilizing RNAi as well as overexpression, and were also validated by manufacturer. All other primary antibodies were validated on manufacturer datasheets.\n\n    The following agarose beads were used: anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel (Sigma, A2220) and Strep-Tactin Superflow 50% suspension (Neuromics).\n\n    All animal work was performed following the ethical guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma-/- (NSG) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Six to eight-week-old NSG mice received sub-cutaneous (s.c.) flank injections of 1x107 U2932 KLHL6-/- (clone-derived) cells re-expressed either with empty vector, KLHL6(WT), or KLHL6(S94I)), and 1x107 U2932 cells infected with retroviruses encoding HA-Roquin2(WT) or HA-Roquin2(Y691F) in 100mul sterile PBS. Tumor burden was monitored weekly by palpation and eye inspection. Tumor volume calculated by caliper measurement. Tumor weight was analyzed on the excised tumors at the experimental endpoint using an analytical scale. After about one month, tumor volume and weight were measured.\n\n    Approximately 5x108 HEK293T and ARP-1 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged KLHL6(WT) or FLAG-tagged KLHL6(L65P) cells were harvested and subsequently lysed in lysis buffer (LB: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 0.5% NP40, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors). KLHL6 was immunopurified with an anti-FLAG agarose resin (Sigma) and washed five times with LB (15 minutes each). After washing, proteins were eluted with FLAG peptides (Sigma). The eluates (1% of the IP) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained by Silver Staining (Life Technology). The final eluate was then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA).\n\n    The ubiquitylation of KLHL6 and Roquin2 was performed in a volume of 10 mul, containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1.5 ng/mul E1 (Boston Biochem), 10 ng/mul UBCH5C, 2.5 mug/mul ubiquitin (Sigma), 1 muM ubiquitin aldehyde, and purified FLAG-KLHL6 or FLAG-KLHL6/HA-Roquin2 complex from HEK293T cells via FLAG immunoprecipitation. The reactions were incubated at 37 C for the indicated times, subjected to SDS-PAGE, then analyzed by immunoblot. When indicated, upon reaction, beads were resuspended in 1% SDS, boiled, then diluted to 0.1% SDS. The eluted proteins were further FLAG-immunoprecipitated, washed and eluted in Laemmli buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis.\n\n    U2932 KLHL6+/+ and KLHL6-/- (clone-derived) cells were treated with or without MG132 for 6hrs and lysed in 1% SDS. Lysates were then diluted to 0.1% SDS in NP-40 buffer and immunoprecipated (IP) with a polyclonal antibody against Roquin2. The immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot.\n\n    For in vitro binding assays, in vitro-translated FLAG-tagged KLHL6 was added to lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA) with indicated amounts of Roquin2 peptides. Anti-streptavidin resin was then added to the lysis buffer and incubated at 4 C for 2hrs. Samples were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and complexes were eluted in Laemmli buffer. For the use of HEK293T cells stably expressing KLHL6(WT), cells were lysed with the lysis buffer and anti-streptavidin resin was directly added to the whole cell lysates with the peptides.\n\n    HEK293T cells were transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI). For retrovirus and lenvirius production, GP-293 packaging cells (Clontech) or pCMV-DeltaR8.2 were used respectively. The virus-containing medium was collected after forty-eight hours of transfection and supplemented with 10 mug/ml polybrene (Sigma).

Quantitative PCR analysis with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was performed according to standard procedures. Primer sequences were:\n\n    Protein concentrations of cell extracts were measured using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Lowry assay) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each experiment, equal amounts of protein (~15mug) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Equal protein levels in each lane were confirmed by Ponceau S staining of the membrane and by immunoblotting a constitutively expressed protein.\n\n    2 x 103 cells were plated for MTS assay according to manufacturers' protocols.\n\n    For the long-term cell proliferation assay, 5x104-2x105 cells were plated, counted and re-plated every 3-5 days.\n\n    Flow cytometry was performed on Attune NxT Flow Cytometer using FITC for GFP-expressing cells, Alexa-680 AnnexinV to detect apoptosis, FITC to detect IgM or APC to detect IgG staining. All stainings were performed according to manufacturers' protocols. For investigating shRNA or gRNA effects on survival, 5x105 cells were spin-infected in a 24-well plate with 1000 mul lentivirus containing medium in the presence of polybrene(8mug/ml). Media was changed after the spin-infection and the number of infected cells was determined on day 2 when GFP was fully expressed in all infected cells. The number of viable GFP positive cells on day 2 was set to 100% to normalize for transduction efficiency and every consecutive assessment was calculated in relation to day 2. When indicated, AnnexinV positive cells were gated on GFP positive cells (see gating strategy in Supplementary Figures 3 and 5).\n\n    TCA-precipitated proteins were urea-denatured, reduced, alkylated and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche), followed by modified trypsin (Roche), as described. Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 100-mum fused silica microcapillary columns packed with 5-mum C18 reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex), strong cation exchange particles (Luna, Phenomenex), and reverse phase. Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump and a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (Thermo Scientific). Fully automated 10-step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides, as described. Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were interpreted using SEQUEST against a database of 61,318 sequences, consisting of 30,449 non-redundant human proteins (downloaded from NCBI on 2012-08-27, 160 usual contaminants (such as human keratins, IgGs and proteolytic enzymes), and, to estimate false discovery rates, 30,659 randomized amino-acid sequences derived from each non-redundant protein entry. Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect with the following criteria set: spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08 and a minimum XCorr of 1.8 for singly-, 2.0 for doubly-, and 3.0 for triply-charged spectra. In addition, peptides had to be fully tryptic and at least seven amino acids long. Combining all runs, proteins had to be detected by at least two such peptides, or one peptide with two independent spectra. Under these criteria the final FDRs at the protein and spectral levels were 2.1%+-0.3 and 0.94% +- 0.03, respectively. Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST. To estimate relative protein levels, Normalized Spectral Abundance Factors (NSAFs) were calculated for each detected protein, as described.\n\n    Raw DNA copy number data from high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis of 609 primary DLBCL tumors were utilized form a previously published study. The data were visualized using the integrative genomics viewer (IGV). Cases were sorted according to their KLHL6 copy number status, and those with copy number <1.8 were classified as possessing a deletion, according to previously described criteria.\n\n    Gene expression microarray from 249 tumors with matched DNA copy number data were obtained from a previously published study. Their cell of origin subtype was determined using the Wright algorithm, as previously reported. Row normalized heatmaps for 4 probe sets corresponding to KLHL6 were sorted according to their average expression, and significant reduction in KLHL6 expression defined as being 1 standard deviation below the mean.\n\n    Raw cel files for publicly available Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 gene expression microarray data for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumors (GSE10846, GSE34171, GSE31312) were obtained from the gene expression omnibus. Data were RMA normalized using the ExpressionFileCreator module of GenePattern. Scores to categorize diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumors by cell of origin subtype were calculated according to the Wright algorithm, Intensities from the 4 probes for KLHL6 (1555275_a_at, 1560396_at, 1560397_s_at, 228167_at) were averaged for use in the survival analysis. Cases were dichotomized into being above or below the median expression level of KLHL6 expression within each dataset to avoid confounding batch effects. For NF-kappaB signatures, Affymetrix U133 plus 2 gene expression microarrays were performed on 84 matched DLBCL tumors. Raw cel files were RMA normalized with median scaling using the ExpressionFileCreator module of GenePattern. Sample-level enrichment of NF-kappaB target genes was calculated using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis and the c3 TFT gene set database of mSigDB.\n\n    Total RNA was extracted from U2932 cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, #74104) and polyA+ transcripts isolated with oligo (dT)25-conjugated magnetic Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher). Strand specific RNA-seq libraries were prepared following a published protocol. Briefly, RNA was chemically fragmented in first strand buffer, converted to cDNA using SuperScript  III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), end-repaired, A-tailed and ligated to custom-designed universal adapters using an end-repair mix, klenow fragment, and T4 DNA ligase (all from Enzymatics). After ligation, adapters were removed by SPRI purification using SPRIselect beads (Beckman coulter) and amplified with Q5 Hot Start DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) while introducing custom dual indexes. Three biological replicates were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) at a depth of at least 2x107 reads each. Reads were mapped and analyzed with a custom bioinformatic pipeline based on STAR, SAMTOOLS, and the R packages DEGseq and DEseq2. We used human genome version GRCh38 and gene annotations from the ENSEMBL release 83. GO analyses were performed using version 6.8 of the DAVID web server.\n\n    The data discussed in this publication were obtained from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO at Series accession numbers GSE55105. FASTQs were downloaded and mapped to hg19 with bowtie2 (v2.1.0). Genome browser tracks were generated using custom scripts. When available, biological replicate were merged by taking the mean of the reads density at each position. The data were visualized using the integrative genomics viewer (IGV).\n\n    All graphs show mean values with error bars signifying standard deviation (s.d.) as indicated in the figure legends. Exact P values for each experiment are provided in Supplementary Table 6. Unless otherwise noted, all immunoblots were successfully repeated at least three times. One-tailed t-test was performed for Fig. 3e (right panel) and two-tailed t-test for Fig 4g. Other analyses performed were either one-way (Fig. 3c, 3e (left panel), 5e, 6a, 7i, 7j, S3b, S3f) or two-way ANOVA (Fig. 1i, 3b, 3d, 4g, 4h, 6e, 7h, S2d, S3d, S4e, S4h, S5b) as indicated in the figure legends. DEseq2 was performed for RNA-seq analysis in Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 3. Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) was performed for Supplementary Table 5. Mantel-Cox was performed for survival analysis in Fig. 3a. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used in Fig. S2c.\n\n    RNA-seq data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession code GSE93675. Previously published CHIP-seq data were obtained from GEO under accession code GSE55105. KLHL6 copy number change and expression were calculated through re-analysis of SNP data and microarray from GSE11318, GSE12906, GSE15127, GSE22082, GSE34171 and GSE11318, GSE34171, respectively.

        "Results": "    Analysis of genomic databases of human mature B-cell cancer patients revealed mutations of the KLHL6 gene in DLBCL (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ and), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) (Fig. 1a). DLBCL cohorts displayed the highest rate of genetic mutations (Fig. 1a), which are similarly stratified amongst GCB-DLBCL, ABC-DLBCL and uncharacterized DLBCL (Fig. 1b). Most mutations in DLBCL are missense and monoallelic, with a low number in non-sense and frameshift mutations (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1 and). Majority of mutations clusters near and inside the BTB-domain of KLHL6 with mutational hotspots in Leucines 65 and 90 (Fig. 1c). Moreover, re-analysis of published SNP array data revealed infrequent deletion of the KLHL6 locus (Fig. S1a), while ~6% of DLBCL tumors displayed lower expression of KLHL6 transcript (Fig. S1b).\n\n    To understand the impact of these cancer-associated mutations, we compared the protein interactome of KLHL6(WT) to that of the cancer mutant KLHL6(L65P). FLAG-KLHL6(WT) or FLAG-KLHL6(L65P) complexes were immunopurified from two cell lines (HEK293T and ARP-1) and the tryptic digestion of each protein eluate was analyzed by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Table 2). Unique spectral counts corresponding to CULLIN3 were identified in KLHL6(WT), but not in KLHL6(L65P) immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 2).\n\n    We validated our proteomic analysis via immunoprecipitation of KLHL6 with endogenous CULLIN3, but not CULLIN1, in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1e). By carrying out an in vitro ubiquitylation assay, we found that KLHL6 promoted self-ubiquitylation and, notably, its BTB-domain alone [KLHL6(DeltaKelch)] was sufficient in catalyzing self-polyubiquitylation to a greater degree (Fig. 1f). These data suggest that KLHL6 assembles a functional CULLIN3-RING ubiquitin Ligase (CRL3) (Fig. 1j).\n\n    We then investigated the effect of DLBCL-associated BTB-domain mutations on KLHL6 ligase assembly and activity. All mutations tested (L65P, S94I, F97L) disrupted binding to CULLIN3 (Fig. 1g) and consequently led to a loss of self-polyubiquitylation in vitro (Fig. 1h). Correspondingly, the protein levels of BTB-domain KLHL6 mutants were remarkably high at steady state and displayed extended half-lives as compared to those of wild-type (Fig. 1i), suggesting loss of KLHL6 self-ubiquitylation affects its turnover in cells.\n\n    Since KLHL6(L65P) is unable to promote ubiquitylation, we reasoned that it might trap (i.e. interact with, but not ubiquitylate) substrates (Fig. 1j). By ranking proteins by the number of unique spectral counts, we identified Roquin2 as a potential substrate (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2).\n\n    In agreement with our proteomic data, KLHL6 specifically co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Roquin2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2b). The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed Roquin2, but not Roquin1, as a KLHL6 interactor (Fig. 2c). This complex was also detectable at an endogenous level in DLBCL cells (Fig. S2a). Importantly, interaction between KLHL6 and Roquin2 required the intact Kelch domain in KLHL6 (Fig. S2b), further supporting substrate-like interaction.\n\n    In DLBCL cell lines, abundance of KLHL6 and Roquin2 displayed an inverse correlation (Fig. 2d and S2c). To investigate whether KLHL6 controls Roquin2 protein levels, we assessed Roquin2 protein turnover upon knockdown or knockout of KLHL6 in OCI-LY10 and U2932 cells, respectively. In both cases, down-regulation of KLHL6 significantly extended the half-life of Roquin2, but not that of Roquin1 (Fig. 2e, 2f and S2d).\n\n    Gain-of-function experiments showed that re-expression of KLHL6 in cell lines with low KLHL6 expression (i.e.; HEK293T and HBL1, see Fig. 5a right panel) down-regulated Roquin2 protein levels (Fig. S2e). Moreover, BTB-domain mutants were incapable of inducing Roquin2 down-regulation (Fig. S2f). Notably, co-expression of KLHL6(WT) along with BTB-mutants still promoted Roquin2 degradation, suggesting these mutations are not dominant negative (Fig. S2g).\n\n    Next, we utilized B-cell lymphoma cell lines harboring endogenous KLHL6 mutations. VAL cells harbor two BTB-mutations: N60T and T72R (Fig. 2g). Binding analysis revealed that only the KLHL6(T72R) mutant lost interaction with CULLIN3 (Fig. 2g), while KLHL6(N60T) mutant did not. Knockdown of KLHL6 in VAL cells did not result in Roquin2 accumulation (Fig. 2h), whereas re-expression of KLHL6 induced Roquin2 downregulation (Fig. 2j). In VAL cells, expression of KLHL6 at the mRNA level was comparatively low (Fig. 2i). This suggests that VAL cells display one KLHL6 allele inactivated by a mutation in the BTB-domain and an additional down-regulation of KLHL6 mRNA. In contrast, mutations of KLHL6 in SUDHL10 cells had no impact on KLHL6 function (Fig. 2g, 2h 2i, and 2j).\n\n    Lastly, to explore whether KLHL6 directly controls Roquin2 ubiquitylation in vitro, we incubated immunopurified KLHL6-Roquin2 complex with a ubiquitylation mix. High-molecular weight species of Roquin2 were detected with the KLHL6(WT) complex, but not with KLHL6(L65P) (Fig. 2k). Correspondingly, ubiquitylation of Roquin2 was abolished in KLHL6-/- cell lines in vivo (Fig. S2h).\n\n    Although mutations of KLHL6 occur at a similar rate in GCB- and ABC-DLBCL (Fig. 1B), low KLHL6 expression correlated with a significantly poorer survival in ABC-DLBCL patients (Fig. 3a) as previously reported.\n\n    To assess the biological effect of KLHL6 loss in ABC-DLBCL lines, we infected Cas9-expressing U2932, OCI-LY10 and TMD8 cells with lentiviruses encoding three different gRNAs targeting the KLHL6 gene locus. Ablation of KLHL6 resulted in an increase in cellular proliferation and a decrease in apoptosis (Fig. 3b and 3c). This effect was confirmed in 3D cultures as measured by a larger number and size of colonies (Fig. S3a and S3b). To rule out the possible off-target effects of gRNAs, we utilized shRNA-mediated knockdown of KLHL6 in U2932 and OCI-LY10 and observed similar results (Fig. S3c-f).\n\n    To investigate the role of cancer mutations in cell growth, we re-expressed KLHL6(WT) or KLHL6 BTB-domain mutants or an empty vector (EV) in a clonally-derived U2932 KLHL6-/- cell line (Fig. 3d). While re-expression of KLHL6(WT) decreased cell proliferation, expression of KLHL6 BTB-domain mutants phenocopied loss of KLHL6, confirming these mutations as loss of function. In xenograft models, expression of KLHL6(WT) decreased tumor burden while expression of KLHL6(S94I) displayed a similar tumor burden compared to KLHL6-/- cells (EV) (Fig. 3e).\n\n    We mapped the KLHL6 binding motif in Roquin2. By performing mutagenesis experiments, we identified a region in Roquin2 between amino acids 640 and 700 as necessary for interaction with KLHL6 (Fig. 4a and 4b). More refined deletions narrowed the interaction domain between amino acids 690 and 695 (Fig. 4c). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the individual residues surrounding the 691-704 region revealed that a conserved tyrosine residue, in position 691, was required for KLHL6-Roquin2 interaction (Fig. 4d). In vitro binding assays confirmed that a Roquin2 peptide from 686 to 700 directly interacts with KLHL6 (Fig. S4a-d). Mutations of tyrosine 691 into alanine or phenylalanine impaired the ability of Roquin2 to co-immunoprecipitate with KLHL6 in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 4e and S4c), suggesting that the integrity of the tyrosine hydroxyl group is critical for KLHL6 interaction.\n\n    We retrovirally-transduced BJAB with Roquin2(WT) or Roquin2(Y691F) to investigate whether tyrosine 691 controls Roquin2 stability in DLBCL cells. Roquin2(Y691F) displayed increased protein levels at steady state as well as an extended half-life when compared to that of Roquin2(WT) (Fig. 4f and S4e). Furthermore, KLHL6(WT) effectively down-regulated protein levels of Roquin2(WT), but not those of Roquin2(Y691F) (Fig. S4f). KLHL6 BTB-mutant(L65P) had no effect on protein levels of Roquin2(WT) and Roquin2(Y691F) (Fig. S4f).\n\n    Next, we analyzed the effect of Roquin2 stabilization on DLBCL growth. Expression of the non-degradable Roquin2(Y691F) mutant increased tumor burden as monitored by tumor volume and weight at the experimental endpoint (Fig. 4g). This effect was not an artifact of overexpression because the levels of Roquin2(Y691F) were comparable to those of endogenous Roquin2 in KLHL6-/- cells (Fig. S4g). Moreover, knockdown of Roquin2 impaired the cell growth advantage of KLHL6-/- U2932 and OCI-LY10 cells (Fig. 4h, and S4h and S4i). Importantly, loss of Roquin2 increased toxicity of KLHL6-/- cells preferentially (Fig. S4h), suggesting that loss of KLHL6 promotes cell proliferation in a Roquin2-dependent manner.\n\n    KLHL6 is a member of the B-cell Receptor (BCR)-signalosome and is induced upon antigen stimulation in the germinal center. Thus, we investigated whether mRNA and protein levels of KLHL6 and Roquin2 were affected by BCR stimulation. First, we found ABC-DLBCL cells predominantly expressed an IgM-BCR as opposed to GCB-DLBCL cells, which are positive for IgG-BCR (Fig. S5a). Then, we analyzed levels of KLHL6 and Roquin2 in IgM-positive ABC-DLBCL cell lines (U2932, OCI-LY10 and HBL1) (Fig 5a). BCR stimulation using the fragment affinity-purified antibody F(ab')2-IgM induced up-regulation of KLHL6 and a corresponding down-regulation of Roquin2 protein levels in OCI-LY10 and U2932, but not in HBL1 [cell line with low KLHL6 for both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5a)].\n\n    To demonstrate that BCR-dependent down-regulation of Roquin2 protein depends on CRLs, we pre-treated U2932 cells with MLN4924, a NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor that blocks Cullin neddylation. MLN4924 treatment rescued Roquin2 down-regulation induced by BCR-crosslinking, suggesting that a functional CRL-complex is required to promote Roquin2 degradation (Fig. 5b). Notably, BCR stimulation induced KLHL6 up-regulation both at transcriptional and protein levels (Fig. 5a, 5b and 5c).\n\n    Since BCR signaling converges on NF-kappaB activation, we investigated whether KLHL6 is an NF-kappaB target gene. Analysis of CHIP-Seq datasets of NF-kappaB factors revealed enrichment of p50, p52, RelA and RelB at the KLHL6 gene locus (Fig. 5d). Correspondingly, treatment of cells with an IKK or a BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib), resulted in a down-regulation of KLHL6 both at mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5e). Interestingly, a reduced sensitivity of KLHL6-/- cells to ibrutinib was observed (Fig. S5b).\n\n    BCR-induced Roquin2 degradation was impaired in KLHL6-/- (Fig. 5f) and KLHL6-knockdown cells (Fig. S5c and S5d). Correspondingly, while exogenous Roquin2(WT) was degraded in a dose-dependent manner upon BCR stimulation, Roquin2(Y691F) mutant was not affected (Fig 5g), supporting BCR signaling promotes Roquin2 degradation in a KLHL6-dependent manner.\n\n    To investigate whether the pro-proliferative effect of the non-degradable Roquin2(Y691F) mutant depends on its RNA binding ability, we generated a double mutant Roquin2(Y691FDeltaROQ) lacking the ROQ domain. Notably, deletion of the ROQ domain abolished the growth advantage induced by Roquin2(Y691F) expression (Fig. 6a).\n\n    Next, we investigated whether misregulation of Roquin2 degradation would result in a deregulation of the BCR transcriptional program. We measured differential gene expression in U2932 cells expressing Roquin2(WT) or Roquin2(Y691F) upon BCR ligation via RNA-seq (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 3). Pairwise comparison revealed that 133 mRNAs were significantly down-regulated in Roquin2(Y691F) expressing cells as compared to Roquin2(WT). 64 of these 133 mRNAs overlapped with BCR-responsive genes defined as those with at least a two-fold up-regulation in expression upon BCR stimulation in cells expressing Roquin2(WT) (Fig. 6b and 6c). These 64 genes represented BCR responsive genes that failed to be up-regulated upon BCR stimulation in presence of a non-degradable Roquin2 mutant.\n\n    Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Fig. S6a and Supplementary Table 4) revealed Roquin2 regulated genes are involved in immune and inflammatory responses and implicated as regulators of the NF-kappaB pathway and lymphoid tumor suppressors (e.g., TNF, NFKBIE, TNFAIP3, LTA, TNFRSF14). To identify targets relevant to DLBCL biology, we ranked these genes by the percentage of genetic alterations in human DLBCL (TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) and the base mean expression in our RNA-Seq analysis (Fig. S6b and Supplementary Table 3). We validated the top 11 candidates in a secondary screen and found 7 of them were dependent on a functional ROQ domain (Fig. S6b and c).\n\n    Amongst these targets, we focused on tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible gene 3 (TNFAIP3) because it is frequently inactivated in ABC-DLBCLs and is a direct target of the Roquin proteins. We found that TNFAIP3 was up-regulated upon BCR stimulation consistent with its function as a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB program (Fig. 6d). This response was abolished in cells expressing Roquin2(Y691F), suggesting that stabilization of Roquin2 contributes to a reduction of TNFAIP3 mRNA levels during BCR signaling. This effect was rescued partially in cells expressing Roquin2(Y691FDeltaROQ) as a build-up of TNFAIP3 mRNA levels was observed. Notably, other NF-kappaB target genes (NFKBIE and LTA) and the tumor suppressor gene TNFRSF14 displayed a similar pattern.\n\n    Lastly, we investigated whether the KLHL6-Roquin2 axis directly controls TNFAIP3 mRNA stability. Ablation of KLHL6 shortened the half-life of TNFAIP3, which was partially rescued by concomitant ablation of Roquin2 (Fig. 6e). Re-expression of KLHL6(WT) in VAL, which carries endogenous BTB-mutations, also increased the half-life of TNFAIP3 (Fig. 6e).\n\n    Since KLHL6 regulates TNFAIP3 mRNA levels, we hypothesized that loss of KLHL6 would lead to increased NF-kappaB activation in ABC-DLBCL. First, we investigated whether the TNFAIP3 transcriptional changes would reflect similar changes in protein levels. BCR dependent degradation of Roquin2(WT) inversely correlated with the up-regulation of TNFAIP3 levels, which was reduced in cells stably expressing Roquin2(Y691F) (Fig. 7a). Correspondingly, TNFAIP3 protein levels were down-regulated in KLHL6-/- cells, both at steady state and in response to BCR stimulation (Fig. 7b). Knockdown of Roquin2 in U2932 KLHL6-/- cells rescued TNFAIP3 levels similar to those of KLHL6+/+ cells (Fig. S7a). Likewise, depletion of Roquin2 more robustly upregulated of TNFAIP3 protein levels in HBL1 cells (Fig. 7c). Correspondingly, re-expression of KLHL6(WT) in U2932 KLHL6-/- cells increased TNFAIP3 levels (Fig. S7b).\n\n    Next, we investigated whether loss of KLHL6 resulted in increased IKK activation. The amount of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation upon BCR stimulation was higher in KLHL6-/- cells, suggesting increased IKK activity (Fig. 7d). Importantly, the increase in phosphorylation was reduced by re-expression of KLHL6(WT) (Fig. S7c). We also detected an increase in the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB transcriptional factors in KLHL6-/- cells (Fig. 7e), which was partially mitigated by the concomitant knockdown of Roquin2 (Fig. S7d). Moreover, ablation of KLHL6 increased RelA DNA-binding at the NFKBIA promoter, an effect reversed by simultaneous knockdown of Roquin2 (Fig. 7f).\n\n    We analyzed the mutual exclusivity of BTB-associated KLHL6 mutations with TNAFAIP3 alterations in DLBCL patients. Deleterious KLHL6 BTB-mutations showed no overlap with TNFAIP3 biallelic deletion or mutation (Fig. 7g and S7e). Using a weighted test, we found exclusivity with a trend toward significance (P-value 0.085, Supplementary Table 5). Instead, 4 BTB-mutations had a coincident monoallelic deletion in TNFAIP3, suggesting that these mutations might confer additional NF-kappaB activation when only one TNFAIP3 allele is lost. Interestingly, tumour cells from patients with KLHL6 mutations revealed a higher NF-kappaB activity, although this signature was not only confined to KLHL6 mutated cases (Fig. S7f).\n\n    To investigate whether the tumor suppressor role of KLHL6 would be diminished in TNFAIP3-null ABC-DLBCLs, we ablated KLHL6 in RCK8 cells and observed no significant effects on cellular proliferation (Fig. 7h) and apoptosis (Fig. 7i). Additionally, utilizing shRNAs targeting Roquin2 in both HBL1(TNFAIP3 WT) and HLY1 cells (TNFAIP3-null), we observed elevated apoptosis in HBL1 only (Fig. 7j), indicating the relevance of Roquin2 in cells harboring a functional TNFAIP3 gene.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    KLHL6 is a BTB-Kelch domain protein mutated in human DLBCL. Somatic mutations localize to the BTB domain with relevant hotspots at amino acids 65 and 90. Most KLHL6 alterations in DLBCL include monoallelic missense mutations and infrequent copy loss. Mutations of KLHL6 are likely the consequence of aberrant hypersomatic mutation, similarly to those of BCL6 and MYC. Importantly, the hotspots and other deleterious BTB-domain mutations result in loss of both CULLIN3 interaction and E3 ligase activity. Data from VAL cells suggest that mutations might be accompanied by a transcriptional down-regulation, resulting in a loss of function. Indeed, about 6% of DLBCL tumors display down-regulation of KLHL6 transcript. In ABC-DLBCL cell lines, ablation of KLHL6 promotes cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, supporting a tumor suppressor role. These findings are consistent with low KLHL6 expression levels correlating with poorer survival in ABC-DLBCL patients.\n\n    Furthermore, we identified Roquin2 as the bona fide substrate of KLHL6. KLHL6 specifically binds, ubiquitylates and triggers Roquin2 (but not Roquin1) degradation in a BCR-dependent manner. Expression of a non-degradable Roquin2(Y691F) mutant phenocopies loss of KLHL6 and concomitant ablation of Roquin2 in KLHL6-/- cells results in an inhibition of cell proliferation. This pro-proliferative effect depends on the ability of Roquin2 to bind RNA. Although Roquin1 and Roquin2 are genetically redundant in the T-cell compartment, no studies have assessed the functional redundancy in B-cell cancers. Transgenic mice overexpressing Roquin2 or the non-degradable mutant in the GC might be helpful to model the oncogenic role of Roquin2 in DLBCL in vivo.\n\n    TNFAIP3 is a relevant target of Roquin2-mediated mRNA decay. In ABC-DLBCL, BCR-signaling triggers transcription of KLHL6 and degradation of Roquin2, thus releasing TNFAIP3 from mRNA decay. We speculate that KLHL6 inhibits TNFAIP3 decay via Roquin2 degradation contributing in establishing a negative feedback loop to terminate the NF-kappaB signaling (Fig. 7k). Thus, loss of KLHL6 function promotes BCR-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in ABC-DLBCL. Correspondingly, mutations of KLHL6 correlate with high NFkappaB signatures and could serve as a marker of resistance to NFkappaB pathway targeting drugs such as Ibrutinib, MLN4924 or bortezomib.\n\n    TNFAIP3 genetic mutations and deletions are frequently observed in ABC-DLBCLs. Functional reconstitution of TNFAIP3 in TNFAIP3-null DLBCL causes apoptosis and growth arrest, supporting a tumor suppressor role in DLBCL. Interestingly, co-occurrence of KLHL6 BTB-mutations and TNFAIP3 biallelic deletion or mutations was rarely observed in human DLBCL, suggesting that these two genes may have similar downstream components (i.e. IKK activation). A partial overlap between KLHL6 BTB-mutations and TNFAIP3 monoallelic deletion further points to a possible synergy towards NF-kappaB activation. On the other hand, neither Roquin2 amplification nor sequence alteration of TNFAIP3 mRNA at the Roquin2 binding site has been observed in DLBCLs. This suggests that the tumor suppressor mechanism of KLHL6 might extend beyond Roquin2/TNFAIP3 deregulation. It is possible that KLHL6 might be involved in other biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration or immune surveillance in patients.\n\n    Much remains in evaluating the functional impact of the KLHL6-Roquin2 axis in GCB-DLBCLs, where unknown KLHL6 substrates or different Roquin2 mRNA targets can contribute to the proliferation and survival of GCB-DLBCL cells. It is also worth noting that KLHL6 mutations are not observable at high frequency in non-B-cell cancers, suggesting a possibly differential role for KLHL6 in a different genetic and cellular context.",

        "Title": "    Akt-phosphorylated PIKE-A inhibits UNC5B-induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines in a p53-dependent manner",
        "Abstract": "    UNC5B induces apoptosis in the absence of its cognate ligand netrins and acts as a tumor suppressor. UNC5B is a direct transcriptional target of p53 upon UV stimulation. Here we show that Akt phosphorylates PIKE-A and regulates its association with UNC5B and inhibits UNC5B-provoked apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.\n\n    UNC5B acts as a tumor suppressor, and it induces apoptosis in the absence of its cognate ligand netrins. UNC5B is a direct transcriptional target of p53 upon UV stimulation. Here we show that Akt phosphorylates PIKE-A and regulates its association with UNC5B and inhibits UNC5B-provoked apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. PIKE-A GTPase binds active Akt and stimulates its kinase activity in a guanine-nucleotide-dependent way. Akt feeds back and phosphorylates PIKE-A on Ser-472 and subsequently enhances its stimulatory effect on Akt kinase activity. Akt activity is significantly reduced in PIKE -/- Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) cells as compared to wild-type cells. PIKE-A directly interacts with UNC5B, which is regulated by netrin-1-activated Akt. Overexpression of PIKE-A diminishes UNC5B expression through down-regulation of p53. Knocking down PIKE-A stabilizes p53, increases UNC5B, and escalates UV-triggered apoptosis. Depletion of Akt abrogates PIKE-A's inhibitory effect on both p53 and UNC5B. Hence our findings support the notion that Akt-phosphorylated PIKE-A inhibits UNC5B-elicited apoptosis and reduces its expression level through inactivation of p53.",
        "Introduction": "    PI 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) was originally identified as a brain-specific nuclear GTPase that binds PI 3-kinase and stimulates its lipid kinase activity. Nerve growth factor (NGF) activates PIKE by triggering PLC-gamma1 nuclear translocation, which acts as a physiologic guanine nucleotide exchange factor for PIKE through its SH3 domain. To date, three forms of PIKE have been characterized: PIKE-S, PIKE-L, and PIKE-A. PIKE-S is the initially cloned shorter isoform. PIKE-L, a longer isoform of the CENTG1 gene, differs from PIKE-S by the addition of a 40-kDa C-terminal extension containing Arf-GAP and two ankyrin repeat domains. Whereas PIKE-S exclusively resides in the nucleus, PIKE-L occurs in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. PIKE-L interacts with Homer 1, an mGluR I-binding adaptor protein. The Homer-PIKE-L complex couples PI 3-kinase to mGluR I and regulates a major action of group I mGluRs, prevention of neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, we recently showed that netrin-1 induces the interaction of UNC5B with the brain-specific GTPase PIKE-L. This interaction triggers the activation of PI 3-kinase signaling, prevents UNC5B's proapoptotic activity, and enhances neuronal survival. A third PIKE isoform, PIKE-A, was identified in human glioblastoma multiformes. Unlike the brain-specific PIKE-L and -S isoforms, PIKE-A distributes in various tissues. PIKE-A lacks the N-terminal proline-rich domain present in PIKE-L, which binds PI 3-kinase and PLC-gamma1. Instead, PIKE-A specifically interacts with active Akt and up-regulates its activity in a GTP-dependent manner, mediating human cancer cell invasion and preventing apoptosis. PIKE-A is overexpressed in numerous human cancers, escalating U87MG glioblastoma invasion and provoking NIH3T3 cell transformation. Our previous findings show that PIKE-A acts as a proto-oncogene, promoting cell transformation through Akt activation.\n\n    The three mammalian transmembrane receptors UNC5H1, UNC5H2, and UNC5H3 (also called UNC5A, UNC5B, and UNC5C when referring to humans) that belong to the UNC5H family of netrin-1 receptors were initially proposed as mediators of the chemorepulsive effect of netrin-1 on specific axons. However, they were also shown to act as dependence receptors. Such receptors induce apoptosis when unbound to their ligands. Mehlen and his colleagues showed that the expression of human UNC5A, B, and C is down-regulated in multiple cancers and they act as putative tumor suppressors.\n\n    The TP53 gene is mutated in approximately half of human cancers and encodes a transcription factor that is activated by various stresses, including hypoxia and DNA damage, and exerts its tumor-suppressive actions through a number of pathways mediated by its target genes. Intron 1 of UNC5B contains a p53-binding sequence, and genotoxic stress induces UNC5B expression in wild-type p53-expression cancer cells, and netrin-1 inhibits p53-induced apoptosis when binding to UNC5B. The tumor-suppressor protein, p53, and the oncoprotein, Akt, are involved in a cross-talk that acts as the core of a cell's control machinery for switching between survival and death. This cross-talk is a combination of reciprocally antagonistic pathways emanating from p53 and Akt and also involves another oncogene, Mdm2. It is well accepted that Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination plays a crucial role in p53 regulation. In addition to proteasome-mediated degradation, ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2 acts as a key signal for its nuclear export. Akt has been shown to modulate the activity of p53 through its substrate MDM2. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates p53 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation of MDM2 on Ser-166 and Ser-186 by Akt stimulates translocation of MDM2 to the nucleus, where it binds to p53 and targets p53 degradation by the proteosome. In this report, we demonstrate that Akt phosphorylates PIKE-A and enhances its interaction with UNC5B and suppresses its proapoptotic activity. However, Akt-phosphorylated PIKE-A further escalates Akt kinase activity and promotes p53 degradation, leading to repression of UNC5B transcription and inhibition of apoptosis.",
        "Methods": "    HEK293, U87-MG, LN229, LN-Z308, TP366, and SF188 cells were maintained in DMEM including 10% FBS and 100 units penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 C with 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator. EGF and NGF were from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). Myc antibody was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, and GST-HRP were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Anti-phospho-Akt Ser-473, anti-p53, and anti-His were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Si-TP53 and Akt (sc5298) antibody were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Active Akt protein and Akt substrate crosstides were from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). All the chemicals not included above were from Sigma.\n\n    Caspase-3 activity was measured by means of the CaspACE assay system fluorometric kit or Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were initially seeded at a density of 4.5 x 105 in six-well plates and infected with control, sh-PIKE-A, PIKE-A wild-type adenoviruses. After 48 h infection, cells were UV irradiated at 10 J/m2 using UV cross-linker, and caspase-3 activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions. HA-UNC5B and/or Myc-PIKE-A-transfected LN229 and LN-Z308 cell death were examined using trypan blue.\n\n    Total RNA was isolated from various cell lines using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA). Two micrograms of RNA was transcribed into cDNA by Superscript III (Invitrogen) in 20 mul, and 2 mul was subjected to RT-PCR. RT-PCR was examined using specific primers.\n\n    Purified GST fusion proteins or immunoprecipitated Myc tagged proteins were incubated with active Akt with or without crosstides in 20 mul of kinase reaction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, with 10 mM MgCl2) containing 25 muM ATP and 2.5 muCi of gamma-[32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 C. Reactions were terminated by adding 7 mul of Laemmli's sample buffer. A portion of the sample (15 mul) was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed, analyzed by a PhosphorImage analyzer, or subjected to liquid scintillation assay.\n\n    The information about the plasmids used in this study, including a p53-luc reporter plasmid, a pCH110 plasmid encoding beta-galactosidase, pCMV-p53, and pCMV-p53mt135 expression vectors, the purification and transfection of these plasmids, and the luciferase activity assay, were described in detail previously. Luciferase and beta-galactosidase assays were performed using the luciferase and beta-galactosidase enzyme assay systems (Promega), respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized with beta-galactosidase activity.\n\n    A 10-cm plate of transfected HEK293 cells was washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium beta-glycerophosphate, protease inhibitor cocktail), and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 x g at 4 C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and mixed with a variety of antibody. After SDS-PAGE, the samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting analysis was performed with a variety of antibodies.",
        "Results": "    PIKE-A binds active Akt and enhances its kinase activity. In exploring the sequence of PIKE-A, we noticed that it contains numerous amino acids corresponding to a motif that is identified as a consensus Akt phosphorylation element present in various Akt substrates (Figure 1A). An in vitro Akt kinase assay revealed that both the GTPase domain (a.a. 73-356) and the PH domain (a.a. 357-555) were robustly phosphorylated by active Akt. By contrast, N-terminal domains (a.a. 1-72 and 72-237) were not phosphorylated (Figure 1B, top). Mutation with Ser-472A but not Ser-320A in PIKE-A completely abolished the phosphorylation of PIKE-A, suggesting that Ser-472 is the major residue that can be phosphorylated by Akt in vitro (Figure 1C, top). To explore whether endogenous PIKE-A can be phosphorylated by Akt in intact cells, we developed Ser-472 phosphorylation-specific antibody. We pretreated the cells with MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) and PI3K inhibitors, Wortmannin and LY294002, respectively, followed by growth factor stimulation. Compared to control, epidermal growth factor (EGF) elicited potent PIKE-A phosphorylation, which was substantially blocked by PI3K inhibitors but not by the MEK1 inhibitor. The Akt activation status correlated with PIKE-A Ser-472 phosphorylation (Figure 1D, first and second panels). PIKE-A phosphorylation was markedly decreased when Akt1 was depleted by its siRNA compared to control siRNA. Overexpression of active plasma membrane myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) substantially enhanced PIKE-A phosphorylation, underscoring that Akt is the physiological upstream kinase for PIKE-A (Figure 1E). Collectively, these data support that PIKE-A is a physiological substrate of Akt.\n\n    Our previous study shows that PIKE-L binds to UNC5B, for which PIKE-L's GTPase activity is indispensable, and netrin-1 treatment escalates the association. To examine whether netrin-1 modulates PIKE-A interaction with UNC5B, we cotransfected UNC5B into HEK293 cells with wild-type or dominant-negative PIKE-A-KS (K413AS414N). This mutant cripples PIKE-A's GTPase activity. It binds Akt but fails to activate it. Compared to the control, netrin-1 increased PIKE-A interaction with UNC5B; in contrast, PIKE-A-KS failed to bind UNC5B regardless of netrin-1 stimulation (Figure 2A), indicating that GTPase activity is essential for the association. Coimmunoprecipitation with UNC5B antibody revealed that endogenous PIKE-A selectively bound to UNC5B, and netrin-1 stimulated the association (Figure 2B, top), suggesting that PIKE-A specifically interacts with UNC5B in response to netrin-1. PIKE-A Ser-472 phosphorylation tightly coupled to Akt activation by netrin-1 (Figure 2B, bottom two panels). The binding assay demonstrated that truncation of the death domain in UNC5B completely abolished the association between PIKE-A and UNC5B (Figure 2C), supporting that the death domain in UNC5B is required for its binding to PIKE-A. To explore whether PIKE-A phosphorylation by Akt is required for its association with UNC5B, we transfected HEK293 cells with Myc-PIKE-A and HA-UNC5B and pretreated the transfected cells with PI3K inhibitors and MEK1 inhibitor. Netrin-provoked PIKE-A-UNC5B complex was substantially disrupted by PI3K inhibitors, whereas PD98059 had no effect (Figure 2D). PIKE-A is overexpressed in human glioblastoma cell line LN-Z308. Netrin treatment enhanced PIKE-A phosphorylation on Ser-472, whereas depletion of Akt substantially blocked its phosphorylation (Figure 2E), underscoring that Akt is an endogenous upstream kinase responsible for phosphorylating PIKE-A on Ser-472. The death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) mediates UNC5B-induced apoptosis by interacting with the death domain. To explore whether this downstream signaling is regulated by PIKE-A, we conducted a binding assay. PIKE-A enhanced the interaction between DAPK and UNC5B, and this interaction was further elevated by netrin-1 (Supplemental Figure 1, top). Interestingly, the Ser-308 phosphorylation on DAPK was slightly decreased in the presence of PIKE-A and was reduced more by netrin-1 treatment (Supplemental Figure 1, third panel). Therefore these data support that netrin-1 up-regulates the association between PIKE-A and UNC5B, for which Akt-mediated PIKE-A phosphorylation by netrin is required.\n\n    To test the notion that Akt phosphorylation is essential for PIKE-A to interact with UNC5B, we transfected HA-UNC5B into HEK293 cells with phosphorylation mimetic mutant PIKE-A Ser-472D and unphosphorylated mutant PIKE-A Ser-472A. Compared to wild-type PIKE-A, PIKE-A Ser-472D strongly bound to UNC5B, whereas Ser-472A barely interacted with UNC5B (Figure 3A). PIKE-A directly binds Akt and regulates its kinase activity. To explore if Ser-472 phosphorylation plays any role in mediating its stimulatory effect on Akt kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated various Myc-tagged PIKE proteins from transfected cells and monitored their effects on the purified Akt kinase in the presence of the substrate peptide Crosstide. Wild-type PIKE-A immunocomplex significantly increased Akt activity compared to control immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the stimulatory effect was further enhanced by phosphorylation mimetic mutant PIKE-A Ser-472D, indicating that Akt phosphorylation of PIKE-A feeds back and escalates Akt kinase activity. By contrast, the unphosphorylated PIKE-A Ser-472A mutant reduced Akt kinase activity (Figure 3B). In the absence of its cognate ligand netrins, UNC5B activates caspase-3 and yields the fragmented intracellular region that contains the death domain. As expected, HA-UNC5B strongly displayed the cleaved band, which was predominantly blocked by wild-type PIKE or PIKE-A Ser-472D. In contrast, this inhibitory effect was evidently diminished in PIKE-A Ser-472A transfected cells (Figure 3C, top), fitting with its weak binding affinity to UNC5B. Accordingly, the caspase-3 activation pattern tightly correlated with UNC5B cleavage activity (Figure 3C, bottom). To further explore whether PIKE-A interaction with UNC5B is critical for suppressing its proapoptotic action, we employed wild-type and PIKE-A-null Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) cells. Transfection of UNC5B provoked evident poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in PIKE-A -/- cells but not in wild-type MEF cells. Cotransfection of PIKE-A Ser-472A, which barely bound to UNC5B, failed to repress its proapoptotic effect. By contrast, wild-type PIKE-A decreased PARP cleavage in PIKE-A -/- MEF cells and almost completely suppressed PARP cleavage in wild-type MEF cells (Figure 3D). Hence these data support that Akt phosphorylation of PIKE-A up-regulates its association with UNC5B, which is critical for its inhibitory action on UNC5B-mediated apoptosis.\n\n    Netrin receptors UNC5 and DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) are able to trigger apoptosis in the absence of netrin-1. To examine whether PIKE-A regulates UNC5B's apoptotic action in human cancer cells, we screened a panel of glioblastoma cell lines' gene expression patterns including PIKE-A, p53, UNC5, DCC, netrin, etc. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that netrin was strongly expressed in both LN229 and LN-Z308 cells. UNC5A and UNC5B were detectable in both cell lines, but LN-Z308 cells demonstrated more abundant UNC5B than LN229 cells. Interestingly, p53 was potently expressed in LN229, whereas it was negligible in LN-Z308 cells, indicating that other mechanisms but not p53 predominantly regulate UNC5B expression in LN-Z308 cells. However, DCC was markedly expressed in U87MG and LN229 cells, and its expression was not detectable in any other cells. Consistent with our previous report, PIKE-A was evidently overexpressed in LN-Z308 and TP366 (Figure 4A, top). A physiological target of p53:p21:was robustly expressed in some of these cells, including U87MG, LN229, and SF188, indicating that p53 in these cells is functional. We chose LN229 and LN-Z308 cells due to their different gene expression patterns. We transfected LN229 and LN-Z308 cells with HA-UNC5B in the presence or absence of PIKE-A and monitored cell death using trypan blue exclusion assay. Transfection of UNC5B provoked robust cell death in both cell lines, and netrin-1 treatment substantially decreased the apoptotic effect (Figure 4B, top, lanes 3 and 4), fitting with previous reports. Interestingly, cotransfection of PIKE-A significantly diminished UNC5B-triggered cell death in LN229 cells, while the inhibitory effect by PIKE-A in LN-Z308 cells was modest (Figure 4B, top, lanes 3 and 5). Hence it is possible that p53 is required for PIKE-A to suppress UNC5B-mediated apoptosis, because p53 is null in LN-Z308 cells. As expected, netrin-1 treatment elicited notable reduction of cell death in both UNC5B and PIKE-A cotransfected cells (Figure 4B, top, lane 6). Consistently, UV-provoked PARP cleavage was reduced by netrin-1 in LN229 cells, and this inhibitory effect was not evident in LN-Z308 cells (Figure 4B, bottom panels). To monitor the molecular events in the transfected cells, we conducted immunoblotting analysis. PARP cleavage was demonstrable in UNC5B-transfected LN229 cells, which was strongly blocked by cotransfection of PIKE-A. Netrin treatment further elevated the inhibitory effect. Nonetheless, PARP cleavage was not substantially diminished in LN-Z308 cells regardless of netrin treatment or PIKE-A transfection or both (Figure 4C, third panel). This result fits with the trypan blue cell death assay. Strikingly, p53 expression was completely blocked in LN229 cells when PIKE-A was transfected. No p53 was detectable in LN-Z308 cells (Figure 4C, fourth panel). Hence overexpression of PIKE-A represses p53 expression and decreases UNC5B-stimulated cell death in LN229 cells. To explore whether p53 is implicated in the inhibitory action by PIKE-A to UNC5B-mediated apoptosis, we knocked down p53 in LN229 cells that were cotransfected with UNC5B and various PIKE-A plasmids. The depletion of p53 significantly blocked the inhibitory activity by PIKE-A on UNC5B-induced apoptosis (Supplemental Figure 2). This effect was similar to what occurred in p53-null LN-Z308 cells. Thus this finding indicates that PIKE-A blocks UNC5B-triggered apoptosis through p53.\n\n    UNC5B is a direct transcriptional target of p53. To explore whether PIKE-A also antagonizes UNC5B through inhibiting p53, we conducted a titration assay. Gradually increasing PIKE-A levels progressively repressed p53 expression in LN229 cells. Accordingly, UNC5B was proportionally diminished, whereas DCC remained unchanged. By contrast, LN-Z308 cells lack the expression of p53, and overexpression of PIKE-A had no effect on UNC5B protein levels. Immunoblotting data were tightly correlated with RT-PCR results (Figure 4D). To further test this notion, we transfected PIKE-A Ser-472A that fails to bind UNC5B into LN229 cells. Overexpression of the PIKE-A mutant did not significantly alter p53 or UNC5B protein levels (Figure 4E). Because the PIKE-A mutant is unable to provoke Akt kinase activity, this experiment suggests that PIKE-A-provoked Akt kinase activity might be necessary for suppressing the p53 protein level and subsequently repressing UNC5B expression. Therefore our data support that PIKE-A down-regulates p53 and leads to a reduction of UNC5B expression.\n\n    The transcription of UNC5B can be activated by various cellular stresses, including UV, in a p53-dependent manner. To explore whether PIKE-A is required for protecting cells from UV-triggered apoptosis, we depleted PIKE-A in a variety of glioblastoma cells. Knocking down PIKE-A markedly increased caspase-3 activity in all tested cells except LN-Z308 cells (Figure 5A), suggesting that PIKE-A is required for the survival of all the tested cells but not LN-Z308 cells. Presumably LN-308 cells lack functional p53 for triggering UV-induced cell death. However, the overexpression of PIKE-A considerably protected U87MG, LN229, and SF188 cells from UV-provoked apoptosis, whereas no significant difference was detected in either LN-Z308 or TP366 cells (Figure 5B). This might be due to the high levels of overexpressed endogenous PIKE-A from genomic amplification in these two cell lines.\n\n    Our previous study shows that PIKE-A promotes cell survival through activating Akt. To assess whether PIKE-A phosphorylation by Akt plays any role in mediating its survival action, we transfected both LN229 and LN-Z308 cells with various PIKE-A constructs, and we treated the cells with UV. Compared to the control, the overexpression of wild-type PIKE-A and the phosphorylation mimetic Ser-472D mutant elevated cell survival in LN229 cells. However, transfection of PIKE-A Ser-472A even reduced cell survival compared to the control. Nonetheless, in LN-Z308 cells, UV-provoked cell death was not significantly altered regardless of transfection of any form of PIKE-A (Figure 5C), which might be due to highly overexpressed endogenous PIKE-A in LN-Z308 cells or a lack of p53. Therefore our findings support that Akt phosphorylation of PIKE-A regulates its prosurvival action.\n\n    To examine the role of PIKE-A in activating Akt and how it promotes survival against apoptosis through p53 and UNC5B, we first determined the effect of PIKE-A in regulating Akt activity in wild-type and PIKE-A-null MEF cells. Fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%) stimulates a time-dependent Akt activation, whereas Akt activity was dramatically reduced in PIKE-A-null MEF cells (Figure 5D, top). Subsequently the phosphorylation of GSK3beta, a physiological substrate of Akt, was also decreased in PIKE -/- cells (Figure 5D, bottom). Hence PIKE-A is required for the full activation of Akt. Notably, UV treatment strongly decreased Akt activity in wild-type MEF cells and it completely eliminated Akt activity in PIKE-null cells. As expected, p53 was substantially up-regulated in PIKE-A -/- cells upon UV stimulation (Figure 5E, top left panels). Consequently, UV stimulation provoked much stronger apoptosis in PIKE-A-null cells than in wild-type MEF cells (Figure 5E, top right). Transfection of wild-type PIKE-A back into PIKE-A -/- MEF cells elicited much stronger Akt activation than the PIKE-A Ser-472A mutant cells, which were greatly diminished by UV treatment. Accordingly, the p53 level was up-regulated upon UV treatment (Figure 5E, bottom left panels). Consistently, the apoptosis activity was tightly coupled to p53 levels in PIKE-A-null cells (Figure 5E, bottom right panel). To further assess whether PIKE-A is necessary for suppressing p53/UNC5B-triggered apoptosis, we knocked down PIKE-A in TP366 cells using adenovirus expressing its specific shRNA, followed by UV treatment. Compared to control cells, knockdown of PIKE-A elevated UNC5B, and UV treatment further increased UNC5B levels. Accordingly, caspase-3 was more strongly activated than in control cells. However, overexpression of PIKE-A greatly repressed UV-induced UNC5B and caspase-3 activation (Figure 5F, top three panels). As expected, p53 levels were notably up-regulated when PIKE-A was depleted. It was substantially blocked by PIKE-A overexpression. As predicted, Akt activity in control cells and PIKE-A overexpressed cells was higher than in PIKE-A knockdown cells (Figure 5F, fifth and sixth panels).\n\n    UNC5B is a direct transcriptional target for the tumor suppressor p53 and mediates p53 proapoptotic activity. Akt down-regulates the p53 protein level through phosphorylating MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53. To examine whether PIKE-A represses the UNC5B protein level through the Akt-p53 pathway, we transfected LN229 and LN-Z308 cells with active Akt or GFP-PIKE-A. Overexpression of plasma membrane-associated myristoylated Akt (Myr-Akt) completely eliminated p53 expression and transfection of PIKE-A markedly diminished the p53 level. Consequently, UNC5B protein levels were substantially decreased in Myr-Akt and PIKE-A overexpressed cells, coupling to p53 expression levels in LN229 cells. By contrast, UNC5B remained unchanged in p53-deficient LN-Z308 cells regardless of Akt or PIKE-A overexpression (Figure 6A). Transfection of wild-type PIKE-A increased Akt activation, which was further enhanced by Akt-phosphorylation mimetic mutant PIKE-A Ser-472D. As expected, Akt activation was not detectable in Ser-472A-transfected LN229 cells (Figure 6B, fifth panel). Both p53 and UNC5B protein levels tightly and inversely fitted with Akt activation by PIKE-A transfection. As a control, the DCC protein level remained unchanged (Figure 6B). To further investigate whether PIKE-A down-regulating p53 or UNC5B is mediated through Akt, we depleted Akt1 with its specific siRNA in the presence or absence of PIKE overexpression. Knocking down endogenous Akt slightly increased both p53 and UNC5B protein levels. By contrast, overexpressing PIKE-A markedly diminished both p53 and UNC5B protein levels (Figure 6C, lanes 2 and 3). As expected, knocking down Akt in PIKE-A-transfected cells considerably increased the p53 level and blunted PIKE-A's inhibitory action on UNC5B protein level (Figure 6C, lane 4), suggesting that PIKE-A inactivates p53 or UNC5B through activating Akt. To explore, under stimulation conditions, whether PIKE-A decreases the protein levels of p53 and UNC5B via Akt, we knocked down Akt in LN229 cells that were transfected with various amounts of Myc-PIKE-A and treated the transfected cells with or without UV. Without UV stimulation, we found that p53 and UNC5B proteins were reduced by PIKE-A in a dose-dependent manner. Depletion of Akt increased UNC5B levels, though p53 levels were not significantly elevated (Figure 6D, first and fourth panels, lanes 1-6). Interestingly, UV stimulation substantially increased p53 levels. The extent of p53 reduction by PIKE-A overexpression was evidently reduced when Akt was depleted. We made an observation similar to that for UNC5B protein levels as compared to control cells and Akt knockdown cells when PIKE-A was overexpressed (Figure 6D, first and fourth panels, lanes 7-12). Akt activation and its total levels were verified (Figure 6D, second and third panels). Hence PIKE-A decreases p53 and UNC5B protein levels via activation of Akt.\n\n    To further examine whether PIKE-A down-regulates UNC5B expression through diminishing p53, we cotransfected PIKE-A with wild-type and mutated p53 in the presence of p53 responsive reporter construct. When the individual reporter construct was transiently cotransfected with empty pCMV, pCMV-p53, or pCMV-p53mt135 vector into LN229 cells, we found that transfection of pCMV-p53 but not pCMV-p53mt135 increased the luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid, demonstrating that the reporter plasmid is p53 sensitive. Cotransfection of PIKE-A greatly diminished the p53 protein level and p53-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6E), which supports that PIKE-A blocks p53 transcriptional activity through decreasing its protein levels. To explore whether overexpressing p53 in glioblastoma cells that also express PIKE-A and UNC5B would override the prosurvival function of PIKE-A, we infected various human brain tumor cell lines with adenovirus expressing p53. Overexpression of p53 strongly augmented much more robust apoptosis in U87MG, LN229, and SF188 cells than LN-Z308 and TP366 cells that expressed high PIKE-A levels than other human cancer cells (Figure 6F). Thus higher levels of PIKE-A antagonize p53-induced apoptosis. Together, these data support that Akt-phosphorylated PIKE-A highly activates Akt, leading to down-regulation of p53 and UNC5B, for which Akt is indispensable.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    In the current study, we show that PIKE-A is a physiological substrate of Akt. Consequently, Akt phosphorylation of PIKE-A enhances its stimulatory effect on Akt kinase activity. PIKE-A binds UNC5B, which is enhanced by netrin-1. The association between PIKE-A and UNC5B is tightly regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of PIKE-A, because the blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling disrupts the association between UNC5B and PIKE-A. Moreover, the Akt phosphorylation mimetic PIKE-A Ser-472D mutant robustly binds UNC5B, whereas unphosphorylated PIKE-A Ser-472A barely binds UNC5B. Accordingly, cotransfection of PIKE-A evidently blocks UNC5B-provoked apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Therefore PIKE-A inhibits UNC5B's apoptotic action, presumably through both direct interaction with the dependence receptor and down-regulation of its transcription level. Employing siRNA to knock down Akt, we show that PIKE-A suppresses p53 and UNC5B expression through activating Akt. Thus this study establishes the model that PIKE-A prevents UNC5B's apoptotic effect through both protein-protein interaction and transcriptional repression mechanisms.\n\n    The tumor supressor gene TP53 encodes a transcription factor that exerts its physiological functions by binding to a specific sequence within its target gene and activating its transcription. The p53 family includes two other members, p63 and p73. Each of them uses multiple promoters and alternative splicing to generate an array of isoforms, including full-length isoforms with transactivation (TA) domain homologues to that of full-length p53, and N-terminal truncated (DeltaN) isoforms. Whereas the full-length TA isoforms of p63 and p73 can activate downstream target genes and induce apoptosis, DeltaN isoforms that lack the TA domain can function as dominant inhibitors of the full length of p53, p63, and p73, inhibiting transactivation of target genes and induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, Gespach and his colleagues recently showed that netrin-1induced apoptosis in human cervical tumor cells and p53-deficient HEK293 cells through up-regulation of Tap73alpha by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Hence the transcriptionally active Tap73alpha is implicated in apoptosis induced by netrin-1 in a p53-independent and DCC/ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. Recently UNC5B was shown to be a direct target gene for p53 that mediates p53-dependent apoptosis. UNC5B is also known to be a dependence receptor that regulates apoptosis either positively or negatively depending on its interaction with netrin-1. It remains unknown whether p63 or p73 is implicated in regulating UNC5B transcription. Conceivably, netrin-1 has a dual role in provoking apoptosis or cell survival in human cancer cells, depending on the genetic context, including p53 family members, netrin receptors, expression profiles, etc. UNC5B-induced apoptosis appears independent of the mitochondrial and death-receptor pathways. This might therefore represent a third pathway for p53-dependent apoptosis. Our recently study demonstrates that PIKE-L selectively binds to the death domain of UNC5B through PIKE's GTPase domain, preventing the apoptotic actions of UNC5B. This interaction is mediated by Fyn phosphorylation of PIKE-L upon netrin treatment. Thus, PIKE-L acts as a downstream survival effector for netrin-1 by blocking UNC5B in the nervous system. In the current study, we establish that PIKE-A acts as a physiological substrate of Akt and find that Ser-472 phosphorylation on PIKE-A by Akt is critical for its affinity to UNC5B. In addition to direct association with the UNC5B receptor and blockade of its apoptotic action, PIKE-A also mediates UNC5B transcription through down-regulating p53 by activating Akt. Hence PIKE-A exerts its inhibitory effect on UNC5B through at least two different molecular mechanisms.\n\n    Our previous study shows that PIKE-A binds Akt and enhances it kinase activity. Here we show that PIKE-A is also a downstream target of Akt (Figure 1). Akt phosphorylation of PIKE-A substantially increases its stimulatory effect on Akt kinase activity (Figure 3). However, knocking out PIKE-A notably diminishes Akt activation (Figure 5). Thus a positive feedback loop exists between PIKE-A and Akt. They mutually regulate each other through direct protein-protein interaction. However, Liu and his colleagues recently reported that PIKE-A was phosphorylated by Akt on the Ser-692 site, which is different from the Ser-472 residue that we identified here. Unfortunately, they did not verify the phosphorylation residue by preparing a phosphospecific antibody. In addition, the Ser-692A mutation failed to completely abolish PIKE-A phosphorylation by Akt. Obviously, Ser-692 is not the major Akt phosphorylation site on PIKE-A. Recently we showed that PIKE-A acts as a proto-oncogene, promoting cell transformation through Akt activation. These findings are confirmed by a recent report showing that PIKE-A is overexpressed in human prostate cancers, and PIKE-A enhances proliferation, foci formation, and tumor progression in vivo.\n\n    Netrin-1, an axon navigation cue, plays a crucial role during colorectal tumorigenesis by regulating apoptosis. The netrin-1 receptors, UNC5H, are initially proposed as mediators of the chemorepulsive effect of netrin-1 on specific axons. The netrin-1 receptors DCC and UNC5H belong to the family of dependence receptors that share the ability to induce apoptosis in the absence of their ligands. Both inactivation of UNC5C and overexpression of netrin-1 in the gastrointestinal tract are associated with intestinal tumor progression, supporting that loss of netrin-1 dependence receptors might be a causal factor for tumor progression. It has been reported that the expression of human UNC5A, UNC5B, or UNC5C is down-regulated in multiple human cancers. The loss or reduction of expression may be a crucial mechanism for tumorigenicity because the expression of UNC5 receptors inhibits tumor cell anchorage-independent growth and invasion. Furthermore, these hallmarks of malignant transformation can be restored by netrin-1 addition or apoptosis inhibition. Hence UNC5 receptors have been proposed to act as tumor suppressors that inhibit tumor extension outside the region of netrin-1 availability by inducing apoptosis. Interestingly, PIKE-A only selectively binds to UNC5B but not to UNC5A or UNC5C (Supplemental Figure 3A). However, it also displays a srtonger binding affinity to UNC5B than PIKE-S and PIKE-L in the absence of netrin-1 (Supplemental Figure 3B). UNC5B contains a death domain in its intracellular region, and deletion of the death domain of UNC5B completely abrogates UNC5B-induced apoptosis, implying that the death domain is essential for this process. It has been proposed that DAPK might mediate UNC5B-induced apoptosis by interacting with the death domain. The cleavage of UNC5B by caspases seems to be indispensable for UNC5B-induced apoptosis. Most recently, we provided evidence that the PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in signaling in netrin-1-regulated antiapoptosis in neurons. In glioblastomas, netrin-1 might provoke Akt activation, which, in turn, phosphorylates PIKE-A and escalates its interaction with UNC5B, preventing its apoptotic cleavage and blocking its proapoptotic action. Moreover, Akt-phosphorylated PIKE-A further elevates Akt kinase activity and leads to p53 degradation through the Akt-MDM2 pathway, culminating in down-regulation of UNC5B transcription (Figure 7). Taken together, our data support that PIKE-A exerts its prosurvival functions by directly interacting with UNC5B, suppressing its proapoptotic action, and down-regulating p53 by enhancing Akt activation.",

        "Title": "    GATA4 Regulates Epithelial Cell Proliferation to Control Intestinal Growth and Development in Mice",
        "Abstract": "    The embryonic small intestinal epithelium is highly proliferative, and although much is known about mechanisms regulating proliferation in the adult intestine, the mechanisms controlling epithelial cell proliferation in the developing intestine are less clear. GATA4, a transcription factor that regulates proliferation in other developing tissues, is first expressed early in the developing gut in midgut endoderm. GATA4 function within midgut endoderm and the early intestinal epithelium is unknown.\n\n    By using Sonic Hedgehog Cre to eliminate GATA4 in the midgut endoderm of mouse embryos, we determined the impact of loss of GATA4 on intestinal development, including epithelial cell proliferation, between embryonic day (E)9.5 and E18.5.\n\n    We found that intestinal length and width were decreased in GATA4 mutants compared with controls. GATA4-deficient intestinal epithelium contained fewer cells, and epithelial girth was decreased. We further observed a decreased proportion of proliferating epithelial cells at E10.5 and E11.5 in GATA4 mutants. We showed that GATA4 binds to chromatin containing GATA4 consensus binding sites within cyclin D2 (Ccnd2), cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6), and frizzled 5 (Fzd5). Moreover, Ccnd2, Cdk6, and Fzd5 transcripts were reduced at E11.5 in GATA4 mutant tissue. Villus morphogenesis was delayed, and villus structure was abnormal in GATA4 mutant intestine.\n\n    Our data identify GATA4 as an essential regulator of early intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. We propose that GATA4 controls proliferation in part by directly regulating transcription of cell-cycle mediators. Our data further suggest that GATA4 affects proliferation through transcriptional regulation of Fzd5, perhaps by influencing the response of the epithelium to WNT signaling.",
        "Introduction": "    Gata4 deletion from the small intestinal epithelium beginning at embryonic day 9.5 disrupts epithelial cell proliferation. GATA4 regulates proliferation in the early developing intestine by directly regulating Ccnd2, Cdk6, and Fzd5. Villus morphogenesis is delayed in GATA4 mutant intestine.\n\n    The small intestine has one of the highest surface area-to-volume ratios in the body, which is critical for nutrient absorption. When intestinal mass is lost, decreased nutrient, vitamin, and fluid absorption can restrict growth and disrupt hydration and electrolyte balance. This type of intestinal failure, termed short-bowel syndrome (SBS), occurs in neonates and infants as a consequence of necrotizing enterocolitis or congenital defects such as reduced intestinal growth, intestinal atresia, midgut volvulus, and gastroschisis. High mortality and morbidity are associated with SBS, and SBS-related economic and quality of life costs are high. One strategy to gain insights into congenital SBS causes, which are poorly understood, and to discover novel SBS therapies, including those based in regenerative medicine, is to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms of intestinal development, particularly those relevant to intestinal growth and elongation.\n\n    Distinct epithelial morphogenetic processes occurring during development contribute to the establishment of an intestine of requisite length and absorptive area. At embryonic day (E)9.0-E9.5 in the mouse, the primitive small intestine is lined by a polarized epithelium derived from midgut endoderm. Between E9.5 and E14.5, the gut rapidly expands. During this time, proliferating epithelial cells elongate and densely pack, and the simple epithelium transitions to pseudostratified. Epithelial pseudostratification often occurs in highly proliferative tissues, allowing for greater cell density compared with simple epithelia. Increased intestinal epithelial girth coincides with pseudostratification, and actomyosin-dependent and microtubule-dependent signaling events drive changes in cell shape that increase girth. Between E14.5 and E18.5, villus morphogenesis ensues, converting the pseudostratified epithelium to simple columnar, and cytodifferentiation generates absorptive and secretory epithelial cell populations.\n\n    Although the establishment of a highly proliferative pseudostratified epithelium is central for gut expansion, the mechanisms controlling proliferation within the epithelium during early gut development are largely unknown. Hedgehog, wingless type MMTV integration site family (Wnt5a), receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2), secreted frizzled-related protein, fibroblast growth factor 9, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and caudal type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) mutants all have shorter guts, but only WNT5A has been shown to play an essential role in regulating epithelial cell proliferation during this developmental window. Secreted by the mesenchyme, WNT5A influences epithelial cell proliferation in a paracrine manner. The factors functioning within the nascent epithelium itself to regulate proliferation, including those downstream of WNT5A, are unknown. Our laboratory previously studied the zinc-finger DNA binding transcription factor GATA4 in the context of intestinal development and showed that elimination of GATA4 from the small intestinal epithelium after E14.5 only subtly affects the embryonic intestine. GATA4, however, is expressed in the developing intestine before E14.5. It is present in the midgut endoderm fated to form the small intestinal epithelium. GATA4 function within the midgut endoderm and the early intestinal epithelium has not been investigated. Therefore, to determine GATA4 function during early intestinal development (before E14.5), and particularly the role of GATA4 in epithelial cell proliferation, we eliminated GATA4 in the midgut endoderm using sonic hedgehog Cre (ShhCre). Small intestine lacking GATA4 was shorter than control intestine. Furthermore, we observed a decreased proportion of proliferating epithelial cells at E10.5 and E11.5 in GATA4 mutants compared with controls. We found that GATA4 binds to chromatin within cyclin D2 (Ccnd2), cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6), and frizzled 5 (Fzd5), suggesting that GATA4 directly regulates proliferation within the early gut by controlling transcription of cell-cycle regulators and WNT receptors. Villus morphogenesis also was delayed in GATA4 mutant intestine. Collectively, these data show GATA4 as a key regulator of early intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and suggest novel relationships between GATA4 and WNT signaling and between proliferation and villus morphogenesis.",
        "Methods": "    Gata4loxP(Gata4tm1.1Sad), Gata4-(Gata4tmo1Eno), ShhCre(Shhtm1(EGFP/cre)Cjt/J), Gata4flbio/flbio(Gata4tm3.1Wtp), Rosa26BirA(Gt(ROSA)26SorTm1(birA)Mejr), and CD-1 (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) mice were used. Embryos were obtained by timed mating with a vaginal plug at noon considered E0.5. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with tail tip, ear punch, or yolk sac genomic DNA (Table 1, primers). For proliferation studies, 200 mug of 5-ethynyl-2'deoxyuridine (EdU) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was administered to pregnant mice by intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes before euthanizing. EdU incorporation was detected with the Click-it EdU Alexa-Fluor kit (Invitrogen). The Medical College of Wisconsin's Animal Care Committee approved all animal procedures.\n\n    Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed as previously described. At E9.5-E10.5, whole embryos were used. At E11.5-E18.5, dissected intestines were used. The entire intestine was examined at E9.5-E12.5. At E14.5-E18.5, jejunal tissue (0.5 cm) collected from the intestinal midpoint was assayed unless otherwise noted (Table 2 lists antibodies). Measurements and cell counts were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA). Fluorescent images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Melville, NY) using a Nikon digital smart DS-QiMc camera. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry slides were scanned using a NanoZoomer slide scanner (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ), and images from scanned slides were captured using NDP.view 2 software (Hamamatsu).\n\n    DNase-treated RNA from whole intestine (E11.5, E12.5, E14.5, E18.5) or from epithelial cells (E16.5) was used for quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR (Table 3 lists TaqMan assays [Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA] used). Epithelial cells were isolated as previously described. Epithelial cell preparations excluded the distal 10% of the intestine. For each gene assayed, 3 technical replicates were performed with at least 3 biological samples per genotype. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used for normalization. Data were analyzed as previously described.\n\n    Previously published publically available BAM files containing alignment data from GATA4 biotin-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (Bio-ChIP-Seq) of mouse jejunal epithelial cells mapped to Mus musculus build 9 (GSE68957) were imported into Partek Genomics Suite (PGS) software version 6.6 (Partek, Inc, St. Louis, MO) for analysis using the ChIP-Seq workflow. Peaks were detected with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.001. Peaks enriched in GATA4 Bio-ChIP compared with input were identified using a threshold of P < .05. Peaks were annotated to genes by PGS software by considering a gene to include all exons and introns as well as 10 Kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. Supplementary Table 1 contains a list of all annotated peaks. We performed Bio-ChIP-PCR as previously described. Briefly, jejunal epithelial cells from adult Gata4flbio/flbio::Rosa26BirA/BirA (n = 6) and Gata4wt/wt::Rosa26BirA/BirA (n = 6) mice were used. Endogenous GATA4 protein is biotinylated in Gata4flbio/flbio::Rosa26BirA/BirA mice, allowing for precipitation of GATA4-chromatin complexes with streptavidin. GATA4 occupancy was detected by PCR, with primers (Table 1) flanking predicting GATA4 binding sites and alpha32P-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (dATP). As a negative control, PCR was performed using primers amplifying an upstream region of Dll1. PCR products were separated by 4% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. For quantitation, PCR products were visualized using a Storm820 Phosphor Imager (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Band intensity was measured using ImageQuant 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The percentage of enrichment was calculated by dividing the band intensity for the ChIP sample by 10x the band intensity for the input sample to account for the 1:10 dilution of input sample used in the PCR reaction. A 2-sample Student t test was used to compare means.\n\n    All authors had access to the study data. All authors reviewed and approved the final manuscript.",
        "Results": "    To determine GATA4 function during early intestinal development, we eliminated GATA4 from the midgut endoderm using ShhCre, which has robust activity in midgut endoderm by E9.5. To identify when GATA4 first was deleted efficiently in mutant intestine, we isolated Gata4loxP/+ and Gata4loxP/-ShhCre (Gata4 conditional knockout [cKO]) embryos beginning at E9.5 and stained for GATA4. At E9.5, all Gata4 cKO embryos examined contained reduced GATA4 in midgut endoderm (Figure 1) (n = 10 embryos). GATA4 was reduced further in E10.5 mutant embryos with a small subset showing low to no GATA4 protein (Figure 1) (n = 8 embryos: 6 of 8 with reduced GATA4 and 2 of 8 with low to no GATA4). By E11.5, all mutant embryos examined had little to no detectable GATA4 (Figure 1) (n = 13 embryos: 12 of 13 with no GATA4 and 1 of 13 with sparse cells with reduced GATA4). As expected, GATA4 protein was undetectable in mutant intestinal epithelium at E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5 (Figure 1). Therefore, we concluded that GATA4 was depleted efficiently in mutant intestine by E11.5.\n\n    To determine if GATA4 loss affected gut elongation, we measured small intestinal length at E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5. We found that GATA4-deficient small intestine was shorter than control intestine by 8% at E12.5, by 16% at E14.5, by 19% at E16.5, and by 22% at E18.5, suggesting that GATA4 is required for gut elongation (Figure 2A). Moreover, the total width of GATA4 mutant intestine was smaller than controls (Figure 2B and C). We determined total small intestinal girth in control and mutant intestine at E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 by measuring the total cross-sectional width at 2 points, as shown in Figure 2C, and averaging these values. We found that the average width of GATA4-deficient small intestine was decreased by 15% at E12.5, by 19% at E14.5, and by 20% at E16.5 (Figure 2C). To confirm that changes observed were not related to ShhCre, we compared H&E sections and overall length of small intestine between Gata4+/+ShhCre and Gata4loxP/+ embryos and found no differences (Figure 2D and E).\n\n    Closer examination of H&E-stained tissues (Figure 2B) suggested that reduced total intestinal width observed in GATA4 mutants reflected a change in epithelial thickness rather than a change in mesenchymal thickness. To mark the epithelium, we stained for HNF4A, a transcription factor exclusively expressed in epithelium (Figure 3A). We determined epithelial girth by measuring thickness of HNF4A+ tissue at 4 sites per cross-section and averaging these values to obtain an average epithelial thickness per section (Figure 3B). We observed a trend toward a thinner epithelium at E11.5 (10% reduction; P = .140) (Figure 3B). At E12.5, we observed a statistically significant 28% decrease in average epithelial thickness in GATA4 mutants compared with controls (Figure 3B). At E14.5, we quantified epithelial girth in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and found it to be reduced in GATA4 mutants in all regions (reduced by 42% in duodenum, by 25% in jejunum, and by 15% in ileum) (Figure 3B). We used the same strategy to determine the average mesenchymal thickness in controls and mutants at E12.5 and E14.5 (jejunum) and found no difference (Figure 3C), supporting the conclusion that reduced intestinal girth reflects a change in epithelial thickness rather than mesenchymal thickness.\n\n    It has been argued that epithelial girth is related to cell number. Because cellular packing density increases with pseudostratification, individual cells become longer and thinner, thereby increasing epithelial thickness. Consequently, a thinner epithelium in GATA4 mutants may reflect a change in epithelial cell number. Therefore, we determined epithelial cell number in control and mutant intestine at E11.5, E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 by counting HNF4A+ cells/section. At E14.5 and E16.5, we quantified HNF4A+ cells in jejunum. At all stages, we found fewer epithelial cells in GATA4-deficient small intestine compared with controls (Figure 3D) (reduced by 19% at E11.5, by 23% at E12.5, by 44% at E14.5, and by 26% at E16.5).\n\n    One explanation for fewer epithelial cells is that proliferation is reduced without GATA4. Therefore, to quantify proliferation in the developing small intestinal epithelium, we measured EdU incorporation at E9.5, E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5. Between E9.5 and E11.5, we identified proliferating epithelial cells as CDX2+/EdU+ cells (Figure 4A). At E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5, we identified proliferating epithelial cells as EdU+ cells located on the luminal side of the laminin+ basement membrane (Figure 4A). At E9.5, we observed no change between controls and mutants (Figure 4B). By E10.5 and E11.5, however, we found a reduced proportion of proliferating epithelial cells in mutants compared with controls (Figure 4B) (decreased by 28% at E10.5 and by 44% at E11.5). By E12.5 and beyond, the proportion of proliferating cells recovered in GATA4 mutants matching that of control tissue (Figure 4B). From these data, we conclude that GATA4 is essential for epithelial cell proliferation during the early stages (E10.5-E11.5), but not the later stages (E12.5-E16.5), of intestinal development. Studies using VillinCre to eliminate GATA4 from the intestinal epithelium after E14.5 concur with this finding because proliferation is normal in Gata4VillinCre mutants. Although the proportion of proliferating cells returned to control levels at E12.5 and beyond, this was insufficient to rescue epithelial cell number (Figure 3D). We assayed cell death in control and mutant intestine at E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 by active caspase 3 staining and observed no difference between mutant and control groups (Figure 5). We also found no difference in epithelial cell polarity because E-cadherin, atypical protein kinase C, phalloidin, and gamma-tubulin staining were comparably localized at the apical cell surface in cells of both control and mutant epithelium at E10.5, E11.5, and E14.5 (Figures 6 and 7).\n\n    One mechanism through which GATA4 could control proliferation is by transcriptional regulation of cell-cycle mediators. Studies in the heart have shown that GATA4 directly regulates Ccnd2 and Cdk4, suggesting these as candidates for GATA4 regulation in the intestine. We obtained published GATA4 Bio-ChIP-Seq data generated from mouse jejunal small intestinal epithelium (GSE68957) and analyzed these data with Partek Genomics Suite software to identify GATA4 enrichment sites within Ccnd2 or Cdk4. We observed one peak in Ccnd2 intron 3 (Figure 8A), and no peaks within Cdk4. The region identified in Ccnd2 represented a novel GATA4 regulatory element because sites identified as GATA4-bound in cardiac tissue reside in the promoter 558 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. No GATA4 enrichment was observed in this region of Ccnd2 in GATA4 Bio-ChIP-Seq in intestine (Figure 8A, dotted box). Although no GATA4 enrichment peaks were found in Cdk4, we did identify a peak in Cdk6 intron 4 (Figure 8A). CCND2 complexes with either CDK4 or CDK6 to regulate the cell cycle. Furthermore, the stringent GATA4 consensus sequence WGATAR was found within Ccnd2 and Cdk6 regions identified by ChIP-Seq (Figure 8A, orange text). To verify GATA4 occupancy of novel GATA4 sites within Ccnd2 and Cdk6, we performed Bio-ChIP-PCR using small intestinal epithelial cell chromatin from adult Gata4flbio/flbio::Rosa26BirA/BirA and Rosa26BirA/BirA mice. We conducted 3 independent Bio-ChIP-PCR experiments, and each experiment assayed chromatin from 2 Gata4flbio/flbio::Rosa26BirA/BirA and 2 Rosa26BirA/BirA mice (n = 6 mice/genotype). By using PCR with primers flanking putative GATA4 binding sites in Ccnd2 and Cdk6, we found GATA4 enriched at these loci in chromatin from Gata4flbio/flbio::Rosa26BirA/BirA intestine compared with chromatin from Rosa26BirA/BirA intestine (Figure 8B). Therefore, we conclude that GATA4 binds to Ccnd2 and Cdk6 in the intestine.\n\n    If GATA4 controls proliferation by directly regulating Ccnd2 and Cdk6, we expected these transcripts to be decreased in Gata4 cKO intestine compared with control intestine. We evaluated Ccnd2 and Cdk6 levels by qRT-PCR and found that both transcripts were reduced in GATA4-deficient small intestine compared with control intestine at E11.5, when the proportion of proliferating cells was lower in mutants compared with controls. At E12.5, when proliferation was comparable between mutants and controls, we detected no difference in Ccnd2 or Cdk6 levels (Figure 8C).\n\n    It also was striking that the magnitude and timing of the proliferation decrease that we observed in GATA4 mutants mirrored that observed in WNT5A mutants, suggesting a relationship between GATA4 and WNT5A. At E11.5, epithelial cell proliferation was reduced by 44% in GATA4 mutants and by 37% in WNT5A mutants. The mechanism through which WNT5A acts on epithelial cells to influence proliferation is unknown. No change in epithelial proliferation was observed in WNT5A-receptor ROR2 mutants, suggesting an ROR2-independent mechanism. FZD5, which is expressed by intestinal epithelial cells, is another WNT5A receptor. Although FZD5 function has not been investigated during early intestinal development because Fzd5-/- embryos die at approximately E10.75, endothelial cell proliferation was reduced in the FZD5-deficient yolk sac. Because studies of yolk sac development suggest a role for FZD5 in regulating proliferation, we queried ChIP-Seq data to determine if GATA4 enrichment was present in Fzd5 and found a peak within the Fzd5 promoter containing a single WGATAR consensus sequence (Figure 8A). We confirmed GATA4 occupancy within this region by Bio-ChIP-PCR and found that Fzd5 transcript was decreased in GATA4 mutant E11.5 intestine (Figure 8B and C). Similar to Ccnd2 and Cdk6, Fzd5 levels were unchanged at E12.5 (Figure 8C). We infer from Bio-ChIP and expression data that GATA4 controls proliferation at E11.5 by not only directly regulating transcription of cell-cycle regulators themselves (Ccnd2 and Cdk6), but also by directly regulating transcription of Fzd5, thereby potentially impacting the magnitude of WNT5A signaling received by the epithelium.\n\n    We noted that villi appeared to be abnormal in GATA4-deficient intestine compared with control tissue (Figures 1, 2B, and 3A). Therefore, we evaluated villus morphogenesis in controls and mutants between E14.5 and E16.5 by platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) immunohistochemistry, which marks mesenchymal cell clusters where presumptive villi will emerge. In E14.5 controls, PDGFRA+ mesenchymal clusters were readily observed (Figure 9A, arrowheads). Although PDGFRA+ cells were present throughout the mesenchyme of GATA4 mutants, no clusters comparable with those in controls were evident (Figure 9A). By E15.5, control tissue contained numerous villi. PDGFRA+ clusters populated nascent villi tips and marked sites of new villi (Figure 9B). GATA4 E15.5 mutant tissue, however, resembled control tissue at E14.5 with sparse PDGFRA+ clusters (Figure 9B). Although villi were present in E16.5 mutant tissue, they appeared to be fewer in number compared with controls (Figure 9C). By E18.5, the intestinal epithelium of controls was organized as long, slender villi with columnar epithelial cells (Figure 9D and E). In contrast, GATA4-deficient epithelium appeared disorganized with fewer shorter, wider villi (Figure 9D and E). Regions resembling pseudostratified epithelium also persisted (Figure 9E, arrowhead). Taken together, we conclude that villus morphogenesis is delayed and that villus structure is abnormal in GATA4 mutants.\n\n    Two important morphogens secreted by epithelium known to regulate villus morphogenesis are SHH and PDGFA. To assess Shh and platelet-derived growth factor alpha (Pdgfa) expression in GATA4-deficient intestine, we used qRT-PCR to measure transcript abundance at E11.5, E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5. We found that at early stages (E11.5-E14.5), when villus morphogenesis was delayed in GATA4 mutant embryos, Shh transcript was less abundant in GATA4 mutant intestine compared with control intestine; Pdgfa levels were unchanged (Figure 9F). At E16.5, when villus morphogenesis was underway in GATA4 mutant intestine, both Shh and Pdgfa increased in mutant epithelium (Figure 9F). Analysis of GATA4 Bio-ChIP-Seq data showed a GATA4 binding site within the Pdgfa gene but not within the Shh gene (Figure 9G). We performed Bio-ChIP-PCR using small intestinal epithelial cell chromatin from Gata4flbio/flbio::Rosa26BirA/BirA and Rosa26BirA/BirA mice as described earlier and found no enrichment of GATA4 at this binding site within Pdgfa (Figure 9G). Together, these data suggest that changes in Shh and Pdgfa abundance observed in GATA4 mutant tissue were not related directly to GATA4 transcriptional control. Because changes in Pdgfa could affect proliferation in the mesenchymal compartment, we compared the proportion of EdU+ proliferating mesenchymal cells between control and GATA4 mutant intestine at E16.5 and found no difference (Figure 4B, right panel).\n\n    Because we used ShhCre for these studies and SHH itself is an important regulator of villus morphogenesis, we verified that defects in villus morphogenesis observed in GATA4 mutants were specific to loss of GATA4 by assessing villus morphogenesis in ShhCre control embryos. We performed PDGFRA staining with tissue from Gata4+/+ShhCre embryos and found no change in villus morphogenesis (Figure 9H and I), showing that the phenotype is specific to loss of GATA4.\n\n    Finally, we observed potential premature crypt formation in GATA4 mutant tissue (Figure 9E, stars). To determine if premature crypt formation occurred in the absence of GATA4, we measured PR domain containing 1 (Prdm1) expression in control and GATA4 mutant intestine at E18.5. Prdm1 levels normally decrease as crypts form, and precocious crypt development occurs in Prdm1 null mice. We observed no change in Prdm1 expression between control and mutant tissue, suggesting that premature crypt formation did not occur in GATA4 mutant intestine (Figure 9J).\n\n    When GATA4 is deleted with VillinCre, differentiated epithelial cell marker gene expression is altered, and goblet cells increase. Because earlier loss of GATA4 could influence this phenotype, we compared enterocyte and secretory cell lineage gene expression between control and Gata4-ShhCre mutants. Similar to Gata4-VillinCre mutants, jejunal-enriched enterocyte transcripts were reduced, ileal-enriched enterocyte transcripts were increased, and goblet cell transcripts were increased in Gata4-ShhCre mutants compared with controls (Figure 10A). Furthermore, the percentage of MUC2+ goblet cells was increased by 2-fold in Gata4-ShhCre mutants, similar to the 1.5-fold increase observed in Gata4-VillinCre mutants (Figure 10B). Increased neurogenin 3 and chromogranin A levels implied that Gata4-ShhCre mutant jejunum contained more enteroendocrine cells (Figure 10A). This reflects a difference between Gata4-VillinCre and Gata4-ShhCre mutants because the expression of neurogenin 3 and chromogranin A, and by extension enteroendocrine cell number, was unchanged in Gata4-VillinCre mutants.\n\n    Increased numbers of secretory cells and a 3.5-fold atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) transcript increase in GATA4 mutant intestine suggested Notch signaling was decreased in mutants. Therefore, we examined the expression of the Notch transcriptional targets hairy and enhancer of split (Hes)1, Hes6, and olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4) at E11.5 and at E16.5. At E11.5, we found no change in Hes1 or Hes6 abundance between groups, and Olfm4 was undetectable in both control and GATA4 mutant intestine (Figure 10C). At E16.5, we observed slight increases in Hes1 and Hes6 abundance in GATA4 mutant epithelium (1.7-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively), but Olfm4 transcript was decreased 2-fold (P = .12) (Figure 10C). Although we observed nonuniform changes in levels of Notch target transcripts, together reduced Olfm4, increased Atoh1, and increased goblet cell number suggest that Notch signaling is abnormal in GATA4 mutant intestine. Cumulatively, the data indicate that Notch signaling likely is decreased in GATA4 mutant intestine.",
        "Conclusion": "",
        "Discussion": "    During embryonic development, the intestine grows dramatically, and epithelial proliferation is an important driver of organ growth. However, mechanisms through which epithelial cells regulate proliferation during this period are poorly understood. Our data establish GATA4 as an epithelial cell-specific factor that controls proliferation during transition of the midgut endodermal epithelium from simple to pseudostratified. We propose that GATA4 controls proliferation through transcriptional regulation of the cell-cycle regulators Ccnd2 and Cdk6 and the WNT receptor Fzd5. GATA4 has been shown previously to regulate Ccnd2 in the developing heart. Our data indicate that GATA4 activates intestinal Ccnd2 expression through a tissue-specific mechanism using a regulatory element in Ccnd2 that is distinct from that used in the heart. Moreover, GATA4 regulates an alternative CCND2 binding partner in the intestine (Cdk6) compared with the heart (Cdk4). Interactions with tissue-restricted factors likely contribute to the tissue specificity of GATA4 function. Although reductions in Ccnd2, Cdk6, or Fzd5 transcripts may be modest individually, we argue that the cumulative change in expression of these genes translates into decreased proliferation. Furthermore, our studies do not exclude the possibility that GATA4 regulates additional targets involved in controlling proliferation to regulate expansion of the early gut epithelium.\n\n    The overlap between GATA4 and WNT5A mutant phenotypes suggested that there could be interplay between these molecules/pathways with respect to epithelial proliferation. Our finding that the WNT5A receptor Fzd5 is a GATA4 transcriptional target provides a possible link. The mechanism through which WNT5A acts on epithelial cells to influence proliferation is unknown, but studies of ROR2 mutants indicate that ROR2 is not required, leading us to focus on FZD5. Our data suggest that WNT5A could function through FZD5 to regulate proliferation in the early intestine. Supporting a role for FZD5 in regulating proliferation, endothelial cell proliferation is reduced in the Fzd5 null yolk sac. In adult FZD5 mutant intestine, Paneth cell localization is altered. FZD5 function has not yet been evaluated during early intestinal development. We propose that in GATA4 mutants, reduced levels of Fzd5 affect WNT5A signaling, thereby providing another possible mechanism through which GATA4 regulates proliferation. Whether WNT5A-FZD5 signaling in the early intestine occurs through canonical or noncanonical pathways to affect proliferation is unclear. Wnt5a null intestine shows no change in activity of a canonical WNT reporter compared with controls, and the abundance of canonical WNT targets Axin2, Lef1, and Tcf1 is unchanged in WNT5A mutants. We investigated canonical WNT signaling in GATA4 mutant intestine at E11.5 by examining levels of canonical target transcripts and found no change in Axin2, Cd44, Ccnd1, or sry-box 9 levels in GATA4 mutants compared with controls (Figure 11). Together, these data suggest that WNT5A-FZD5 does not affect proliferation in the early intestine via canonical WNT signaling. Our studies provide a rationale for future studies to investigate the relationship between FZD5 and WNT5A and the mechanisms through which FZD5 affects epithelial proliferation during intestinal development.\n\n    Between E9.5 and E11.5, we observed a dramatic increase in the percentage of proliferating cells in control epithelium, which was maintained through E14.5 (Figure 4). During this time, the epithelium transforms from simple to pseudostratified. Epithelial pseudostratification likely occurs in highly proliferative tissues as an adaptation to accommodate greater cell number by densely packing elongated cells. Correspondingly, intestinal epithelial girth increases. In addition to actomyosin-dependent and microtubule-dependent signaling events that reorganize cell shape to alter girth, we propose that the number of epithelial cells present in a given space necessarily influences epithelial girth. In an environment with fewer cells, such as GATA4 mutant intestine, space is less constrained, suggesting that cells do not pack as densely, thereby affecting girth.\n\n    Between E14.5 and E16.5, the proportion of proliferating cells decreases (Figure 4). During this period, the epithelium undergoes villus morphogenesis, transitioning from pseudostratified to simple columnar. Cytodifferentiation also ensues. Epithelial remodeling may provide a quick and efficient mechanism to extend gut length. In GATA4 mutants, decreased proliferation resulted in fewer epithelial cells. Consequently, fewer epithelial cells were available to lengthen the gut, and GATA4 mutant intestine was shorter than control intestine. Villus morphogenesis also was delayed in GATA4 mutants. The events driving initiation of villus morphogenesis are unclear. One explanation for the GATA4 mutant phenotype is that proliferation and villus morphogenesis are interdependent. We could interpret our data to indicate that a critical number of epithelial cells is required to initiate villus morphogenesis, possibly reflecting a requirement for threshold levels of epithelial-derived morphogens essential for villus morphogenesis. GATA4 thereby indirectly would influence villus morphogenesis indirectly by regulating proliferation. Our finding that Shh levels were decreased between E11.5 and E14.5, without evidence for GATA4 direct transcriptional regulation of Shh, supports this interpretation. However, if delayed villus morphogenesis was simply a consequence of cell numbers and morphogen thresholds in GATA4 mutants, we would predict that Pdgfa levels also would have been lower during this period, which we did not observe. A caveat to the interpretation of Pdgfa expression data is that Pdgfa, unlike Shh, also is expressed in nonepithelial cell types. The developing muscle layer expresses Pdgfa. Because we used total intestinal RNA to analyze Pdgfa expression between E11.5 and E14.5, it is possible that any decrease in epithelial expression of Pdgfa was masked by its expression in the muscle layer. We propose that compensatory mechanisms likely explain the Shh and Pdgfa increases at E16.5.\n\n    Together, studies of GATA4 in ShhCre and VillinCre conditional knockout mice indicate that the requirement for GATA4 during intestinal development changes over time. Gata4 deletion from the midgut endoderm caused a more severe intestinal phenotype compared with Gata4 deletion from the epithelium after E14.5. Proliferation was uniquely altered in Gata4-ShhCre mutant intestine, suggesting that it is controlled differently during early and late intestinal development. Overlapping function between GATA4 and GATA6 or GATA4 and CDX2 could explain why loss of GATA4 at later stages does not alter proliferation, and compound GATA4-GATA6 and GATA4-CDX2 mutants each show proliferation defects. When both GATA4 and GATA6 are deleted in the developing intestinal epithelium with VillinCre, proliferation is increased. Deletion of GATA4-GATA6 or GATA4-CDX2 in the adult intestine using tamoxifen-inducible VillinCre reduces crypt cell proliferation. It is unclear why GATA6 and CDX2 compensate for GATA4 function in late embryonic and adult intestine, but not in early intestine. One interpretation is that GATA4 uniquely regulates proliferation during this discrete developmental window.\n\n    Our previous study of intestine from Gata4Gata6-VillinCre double conditional knockout embryos provides evidence that GATA factors influence Notch signaling and epithelial cytodifferentiation because we identified GATA factors as direct regulators of the Notch ligand Dll1. In GATA4-GATA6-deficient intestine at E18.5, Dll1 expression was reduced, Olfm4 expression was decreased 8.7-fold, and goblet cells were increased 4.3-fold. Hes1 and Hes6 levels, however, remained normal in double mutants. Dll1 knockout intestine also contains increased goblet cells, and expression of at least one Notch target, Hes5, remained unchanged. Similarly, in Gata4-ShhCre mutant intestine, we observed variable outcomes in Notch target gene expression with Olfm4 decreased and Hes1 and Hes6 increased. Downstream of Notch signaling is Atoh1. When Notch signaling is high, Atoh1 is repressed. Conversely, low Notch signaling is permissive for Atoh1 expression, and secretory cell differentiation occurs. Both Atoh1 and goblet cell number were increased in GATA4 mutant intestine, suggesting that despite discordant changes in Notch target gene expression, Notch signaling was lower in GATA4 mutant tissue. It is clear from these studies that Notch signaling in the developing intestine is complex. Future studies should aim to precisely map the molecular mechanisms of Notch signaling in the developing intestine so that the significance of changes in expression of Notch targets including Hes1, Hes6, and Olfm4 can be better interpreted. Finally, because we identified Dll1 as a GATA target gene in intestine of Gata4Gata6-VillinCre double conditional knockout embryos, we examined Dll1 expression in E16.5 Gata4-ShhCre mutant intestine. We found its expression to be unchanged between controls and mutants (data not shown). It is possible that GATA6 compensates for loss of GATA4 in regulating Dll1 expression in Gata4-ShhCre mutant intestine. This could provide an explanation for the less severe secretory cell phenotype observed in single GATA4 knockouts compared with double GATA4-GATA6 knockouts.\n\n    One strategy to increase our understanding of the etiology of congenital forms of SBS and to discover novel therapies for SBS is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of intestinal development, particularly those relevant to intestinal growth and elongation. Through a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of intestinal development, it may be possible to develop methods to restore intestinal tissue in patients with SBS or to develop methods to generate much needed intestinal tissue in vitro that ultimately could be used for transplantation. Our work shows that GATA4 is an essential regulator of intestinal development. We provide insight into mechanisms controlling intestinal epithelial cell proliferation during early development and the initiation of villus morphogenesis. We conclude that GATA4 regulates proliferation, at least in part, by regulating transcription of the Ccnd2, Cdk6, and Fzd5 genes. We identified novel tissue-specific GATA4 regulation of cell-cycle mediators and suggest that GATA4 affects WNT signaling by contributing to transcriptional regulation of Fzd5. The relationship between GATA4, FZD5, and WNT5A will be explored further in future studies. Moreover, we propose that by regulating proliferation, GATA4 influences the onset of villus morphogenesis, suggesting a novel relationship between proliferation and villus morphogenesis. We also detected abnormal Notch signaling in GATA4 mutants, supporting the proposal that GATA4 and Notch signaling interact during intestinal development. Finally, our studies of GATA4 using ShhCre and VillinCre show that GATA4 function changes during the course of intestinal development.",
